to see it up close in reality is something to behold\nRe cautioned that more packages could still be in circulation he said the packages did contain explosive material and should not be considered hoaxes despite the fact that no one so far has been harmed Quil Lawrence NPR News New York\nAsked again by reporters today about whether his own rhetoric has anything to do with the man accused of sending bombs through the mail President Trump largely brushed off the comments after doting it appears the suspect is an ardent supporter of the President Trump said he himself bears no blame president also doubled down on his recent criticisms of the media's coverage of his administration\nWell I think I don't want to know if I could really do that because as you know the beat is really really unfair to me that the Republican Party I think it is very very unfair deserves the Republican Party and the way of governing\nTrump's remarks come as he came as he headed off to Charlotte North Carolina for a political rally tonight the ashes of match shepherd the young gay man murdered Twenty years ago when Wyoming related to rush to date the national cathedral NPR's Tom Gjelten says the

notable figures Tom Gjelten NPR News Washington\n... some thousand migrant is traveling north through Mexico um the response to this is clearly political right now that has no legislation is being passed right there is no other kind of movement David what do you see and how we are talking about immigrants migrants in asylum seekers right now is this a permanent shift\nA difficult as a permanent shift if us working class Americans or why their incomes have stagnated the two answers they give our immigration and trade\nAnd so a lot more people have come see immigration and not only as a cultural shift\nBut as an economic threat as well I think what strikes me about this particular episode is that again that catastrophic tunes deeply using about it we've had waves of refugees come to our shores throughout our history as late as April or some come ashore some get granted asylum about twenty two percent in this last wave\nAnd we're a big country and we can handle a lot of people are and the idea that this is some existential threat seems to be completely overblown it's an issue that we can deal with a but the way it's being portrayed as some some out of control situation is just out of proportion to what's actually\nGoing intimate terms what is the Democratic reply to a a Republican platform that talks about these issues such tried Italy\nI think one of the difficulties here besides the fact that President Trump clearly sort of focus on this caravan because he knows that talking about the threat of immigration\nOr helps to mobilize his base of the problem here is that there is a total mischaracterization of what Democrats stand for they're constantly accused of being for open borders\nAnd when you look at all of the immigration bill saver voted for it they call for an end with support I should say back in the day from some Republicans\nThey all spoke of obvious limits on immigration and thus far in order to or as I Am in ten days right I mean right but the I think what they are doing what they have to do is say we're not far open borders and this is an attempt to push us away from issues related to economics to health care\nOr end to the issues that a lot of voters voting on to the point where Republicans have had to essentially mislead\nA that's a terrible word about where they stand on healthcare a and I think they are doing that quite effectively and a lot of a local races governors races and I think in a great many house races to\nDavid to Democrats are putting a lot of fucking conversation about health care how are you thinking about that\nYeah to get some credibly stupid idea a Donald Trump represent he's represents a big change in American foreign policy it'd be changed with American identity or he plays on cultural identity issues it's really a comprehensive critique of where the American establishment has been\nAnd what strikes me as the Democrats and not even trying to answer that critique they go to health care they said we you know we Obamacare it gives you protection for insurance for preexisting conditions and we want to preserve that so well Trump makes a very comprehensive mostly culturally Desi critique\nThe Democrats come back with a materialist response which is we're going to protect protect your benefits and that's a decent response in normal times but in the times like this I think the Democrats should be making an argument in defense of pluralism in defense of diversity a big argument against what Trump Lewis dance\nEJ last hard minute to you\nI think that yeah the voters disagree with tape it that\nThe if you look at all of the polling the top of the top three issues health care and economics ranked one to or to one uh in where in where the voters come from I think Trump's cultural message appeals to a minority of the electorate which he is trying to mobilize\nAnd I think national unity or just come simply from defending pluralism which by the way Democrats do I wrote recently about a lot of Democrats in a few Republicans defending\nUh being open for example a to refugees and away the Trump Administration has not but the way we come together is to solve problems that's what a candidate like Stacey Abrams is talking about down in Georgia where I was a this week and it seems to be working pretty well for her\nAnd that's a JD on at the Washington Post and Brookings Institution thank you so much good to be with you David Brooks at the New York times have a good weekend think you will\n[noise]\nThe time will run closed down Skidmore was president of a

Ari Shapiro in Ann Arbor Michigan\nAnd I'm Audie Cornish in Washington DC there's been a break in a case of suspicious packages sent a prominent Democrats and to CNN a Florida Man was arrested today even as new packages containing possible pipe bombs continue to surface\nFor suspect fifty six year old Caesar sad faces a variety of federal charges including threatening a former president FBI Director Christopher Wray says they stink or print was found on one of the packages and his DNA into other's race says the packages contained improvised explosive devices\nThat we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices\nWell authorities ... appears to be a political parties and they stress that it's premature to speculate on a possible motive at the White House earlier today President Trump welcome the arrest while giving thanks to law enforcement\nThese people have worked so hard and to have done it so quickly it's looking like a a you're looking it's a needle in a haystack how do you do this so quickly they've done incredible incredible job but I Want to congratulate [noise] throughout this week\nAs the investigation preceded we've heard mixed messages from the president NPR's Scott Horsley is here now to talk more about that hey there Scott ... so the president spoke about the arrest today the White House event right celebrating black leaders what happened\nHis tone at that event was tough he said there was no place for a political violence in this country he condemned would appear to be an effort to sow fear among Americans and as he done earlier in the week when there was a flurry of these packages the president made an appeal\nFor national unity he said uh people shouldn't demonize their political opponents unsettled are different and should settle their differences peacefully at the ballot box\n... in other words it was a sort of a conventional message that you would expect to hear from a president at a time like this but uh still a little bit of eyebrow raising coming from an unconventional president like Donald Trump\nRight a lot of his critics pointed out this week that the president often ... Democrats that he's been known to to speak positively about violence I mean was there any feedback from those targeted by the suspect\nUh for president Rocco bomb I happen to be campaigning for Democrats in Wisconsin today and he suggested that the president's call for unity rings a little bit hollow\nI'm hoping you think it's wrong\nHere people spend years months vilified the questioning their patriotism calling them enemies in the paper and\nYou're concerned about civility [noise]\nPlease and the president himself has been sending mixed messages throughout this episode earlier today he was tweeting a a complaint that nonstop media attention to the suspicious packages was taking attention away from politics and cutting into what he said was a Republican momentum and head of the midterm elections\nUm talk a little bit more about them in terms of just eleven days away now which is these mixed messages do you think of president will be leaning\nHarder on I think that's what we're all kind of waiting to see a earlier this week uh in Wisconsin the president sort of self consciously dial back his his more partisan rhetoric he said he was trying to be nice\nBut tonight at another political rally in North Carolina it was kind of back to the no holds barred Donald Trump or he went after Democrats as being extreme and radical you name Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters and particularly targeted the news media\nWe have seen an effort by the media and raised in ours to use the citizens are actions of one individual to score political points against me and the Republican Party\nThis was a Donald Trump in full grievance mode already and his partisan supporters ate it up\nThat's NPR's Scott Horsley Scott thank you You're welcome\nMeanwhile President Trump is threatening to close the U.S Mexico border tensions are rising as large numbers of migrant families continue to cross illegally and more are expected as a caravan of migrants from Central America moved north towards the border\nUs border patrol says they're overwhelmed by the influx we're joined now by NPR's John Burnett who covers immigration and is with us on the line from Austin, Texas Hi Don hey Ari\nOn T. V. we've seen dramatic images of this caravan moving up through Mexico it's still hundreds of miles away so why are tensions rising now\nWell the fears are really suppressing reality the sides of the Honduran Caribbean has reportedly dropped by half from some southern thousand thirty five hundred now and expected to fall even more the farther north of gifts but that hasn't stopped all the overheated talk coming out of Washington\nLet me just to give you a flavor or listen to this exchange between Fox News anchor Martha ... column and homeland security secretary cures to Nielsen that was on TV last night\nIs there any scenario under which if people forced their way across the border they can be shot at\nWinning not have any intention right now people may well be apprehended however a ... officer and agents at at their own personal safety extraordinarily seriously as they have handled it of course to defend themselves\nJohn how is this intense rhetoric playing out at the U.S Mexico border\nSo today I spoke with the mayor of Columbus New Mexico is ... cities right on the border across from Columbus Mexico he said an armed militia from Florida is already camped out west of town patrolling private range land you got a call from another militia leader from South Carolina earlier in the week\nHe said quote if you need help with the illegals coming across you let me know when will be there\nThe militia leader reportedly said if were fired on will shoot back solace told him I'm thanks but no thanks we're fine with the border patrol\nWe've heard about growing numbers of migrant families trying to cross the border and the caravan that we've been talking about is not even arrived jets\nBut tell us about why the numbers are growing right now well there has been a record number of families with children turning themselves into federal agents either\nAt the ports of entry or shortly after crossing the border illegally the Trump Administration released numbers earlier this week and they really are startling in July agents arrested about Ninety two hundred family members traveling together in September that number sort of more than sixteen thousand apprehensions that's an eighty percent increase\nThat's a huge growth how our border agents handling that [noise]\nSo a border patrol agents are checked just told me every day they're arresting four to five hundred immigrants just in his station mostly adults with small kids are asking for asylum\nImmigration says their detention facilities are not big enough to handle these crowds so they have to release them with a notice to appear in the already back logged immigration court\nThis week immigration and Customs Enforcement put a new policy into effect ice will no longer help immigrants with travel arrangements to a destination in the interior\nAndme at least thousands of families stranded in these border towns and the nonprofits that helped them are overwhelmed immigrant aid groups up and down the border overflowing summer paying thousands of dollars a night on motel rooms for immigrants with nowhere else to go\nCritics claim the government is just dumping immigrants in the streets making the crisis look worse [noise]\nPresident Trump says he has plans to deploy the military to the border to stop the caravan whenever it might arrived can you give us any more\nDetails about that right the Pentagon said today defense secretary Jim Mattis plans to sign a deployment orders this weekend for up to eight hundred active duty troops to be in place on the border by early next week\nThe White House has floated the idea of an executive order that would shut down the border to the Central American immigrants and denied them the ability to seek asylum that would be an extraordinary move us recognizes the right of asylum in federal in international law\nBut we saw that this president attempted what he attempted to travel ban and he'll give that his government emergency powers when he's worried about immigrants coming to our borders\nBob you saw the dead or in the sixties which I couldn't imagine the early seventies [noise] um and then you saw them again in a toward the end before Jerry Garcia died he died in Nineteen Ninety five you with a long time\nYou get along time history with drugs or he died of a heart attack and sleep I'm Out of rehab center in California in August of Nineteen Ninety five [noise]\nThat was a sad day for a lot of people\nYeah I remember we were I was cleaning the house because some friends from out of town were coming\nAnd and I got a phone call and my best my wife was on the phone and I was saying what's up and and she said you haven't heard have you and I said no what you said she's a dairy Jerry died\nAnd I remember putting the phone down and just sitting there and it was in Paris and to me how much grief I felt because I never met the man I wouldn't know what to say to him a first stuck in an elevator together you know I just love the music and I knew he was a rapper ... you know and you know so it was All right but you know and I\nUse less than an angel buddy the music he played was angelic and I can really make the world to me and I just and they are friends visit was kind of ruined it was it was because of that and I felt that you know annoyed at myself for being that\nYou know [noise] that over women that I remember one of the day to make it easier because they had tickets for the for living in Baltimore the tickets for the Holocaust museum and we went [noise] I got lost cesium I sat down in the whole the right to sue the nations and just ...\nAnd it was partly because of the museum which was also Wellman your experience and partly because I was born in Germany and I thought I haven't felt this crappy since my father died\n\nThen\nYou write I still smile when I hear the words grateful and dad in the same center the dead still\nMake me smile they still make me laugh they still make me cry is not true for you and and what I'd ever go away\nNow never go away you know your dad a tremendous repertoire\nBigger than other bands because they also did a lot of covers of old folk music\nOf of a blues\nOr we're just not even you know just a couple of show tunes every now and then they go there I kind of look at them as a walking encyclopedia of American music on the twentieth Nineteen and twenty century\nThey do a cover of in a very lovely sounding folk song my Bonnie Dobson called walk me out in the morning do and if you don't really notice subjects you think oh this is a nice little song about World War three [noise]\nAnd I know where other people gone wherever the children gone you know\nAnd then the refrain is [noise] you never thought about them for whites think about them now I'm I'm not getting your life and that's where the slows down to\nThe new\nThey turned it into an intuition Shakespearean tragedy\nAnd it it it's just\nAnd then the guitar really asked a lot of times in a lot of sixties music due to the car is just kind of put to sleep loud among the never choose that German one time Garcia said I serve the music\nAnd everything I had a purpose you know when they were the best sometimes they weren't that their best you know with him when Jerry was you know stones whatever but at their past you can't take a note out and it'll still be the same thing\nAs version of walking out in the morning to do\nChilling it's it's so good and it's actually after you think the song is over and then Garcia soldiers another couple of trips out of his bag and then is over after another five or six minutes", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "27"}
