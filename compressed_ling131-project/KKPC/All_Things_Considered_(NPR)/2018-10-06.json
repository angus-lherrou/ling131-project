McDonald sixteen times as he held a knife at aside the release of the video the shooting sparked widespread protests\nDr Ford suffered some thing but that there is no proof that it was him well the idea usually when it's an acquaintance situation that a memory works that way I mean Dr Ford the scientist she explains how memory works in her own contacts and that if she couldn't even be believed enough\nTo stop this that there is a concern that this is really a system that's rigged against women\nBethany I Know you've written with some degree of skepticism about of Ford's account or against Kavanaugh what do you think the consequences of this episode will be for society more broadly\nSo I I I think that it's an important ... station to have about sexual assault but I think that this is also an and Collins spoke to a great deal and her and her commentary on the floor\nThere's also a presumption of innocence and there's an expectation that you can't bring for these kinds of serious allegations that can dismantle an entire career without any cooperation and unfortunately there wasn't in this case I'm In the case of ray Moore when he came out\nAnd accusers came forward to the Alabama Senate race yeah yeah there there was there's cooperation that a lot of his accusers had that that made their accounts convincing and I I didn't personally see that in in any of these circumstances\nI also want to ask you both about the political consequences of this debate because when Ford first testified in front of the Senate Judiciary committee Democrats and Republicans called her credible and express sympathy and admiration for her willingness to speak publicly this week some took on a different tone starting with President Trump here he was at a rally in Mississippi on Tuesday night\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was that I don't know [noise]\nThe audience laughed and applauded and at that same rally Trump said this is a very scary time for young men in America with the midterms one month away Bethany do you think this will have an impact\nYeah absolutely and we're we're already seeing that as far as fundraising and and sort of enthusiasm from Republicans this has been\nA very unifying moment for Republicans I mean we ... we saw Brett Stevens and the New York times applied to President Trump and that's something that I don't think anyone thought that they would have seen three weeks ago let alone um let on now but\nThis is this is really I think going to to drum up a lot of enthusiasm on the right in a way that hasn't existed since twenty sixteen\nCan really do think that ... will last for the next month if Kavanaugh is confirmed for the court this weekend is expected\nI think that's a still unclear I mean there are definitely was a fear Republicans told me they were afraid that the poor part of their base would revolt against them if they didn't get Kavanaugh through now that won't happen it seem more like a defensive play\nI I don't know if that's enough to counteract the energy that we're seeing right now\nOn the other side that spurred by this sort of gender war it seems that's being a exacerbated by the president's ah with the comments that you played a I think that really ... the other side the losing side traditionally is the one with the momentum after a fight like this\nAnd just briefly from each of you know that it looks like Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court apart from the shift to the right ideologically that he was expected to bring to the court to each of you think that the echoes of this fight will linger in the Supreme Court itself Kimberly it\nCould I mean look Clarence Thomas still speaks with a lot of disdain about his own confirmation process so it's very possible this is a consensus building a group that's how they have to be the functions will it's tough to see how that doesn't play a role\nAnd briefly Bethany I'll give you the last word\n[noise] yeah I I I think that this has radicalized a lot of people and I think having a ... one of them I I I'm not sure how much of this sort of\nThis experience has impacted his judicial opinions but I I Can't see that it hasn't changed his mind somehow about due process about the presumption of innocence um I I I think that this probably did maybe pushing more right were then he would have otherwise been had to spend a smooth confirmation process\nThat's Bethany Mandela editor of Russia and columnist for the forward and Kimberly ... chief Washington reporter and columnist for the Boston Herald thanks to both of you have a good weekend thank you thanks [noise]\n\nThat that was ... raised and light up to his shoulder um which is not something you can eat looking at the Baskin video up there and said so the prosecutors really push too hard on why his version of that get match with video\nWhat kind of an impact you expect this verdict to have on the relationship between the Chicago police department and the African American community\nI think that's hard to say that because I think that the tension here had been more about more than just look on McDonald's you'll have to remember that\nIn addition to this trial there than other trial later this shooting there are three officers charged with conspiracy for exaggerating the threat of a chronic Donald presented that night in their reports and\nI think that there's this feeling that the shooting was a a problem that the community feel at all so fast you ain't got officers covered it up so I think\nWe'll be watching closely what happened in that trial on how the sea reacts to that\nAs we've reported on so many police involved shootings and in so many cases the officers are acquitted this conviction is a rare exception what do you think made a different well\nI think the number of shot six made a big difference in this case I also think the fact that there were multiple other officers on things that night who account on Donald and chose not to shoot I think that that would require a lot of folks that are left\nThe w._b. easy reporter Shannon Heffernan reporting on the trial and conviction of Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke found guilty today of second degree murder Shannon thanks so much\nLabor Department of reports the unemployment

likely to be confirmed to the Supreme Court tomorrow now the two previously undecided senators say they will vote yes Maine Republican Susan Collins on West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin announced their support this afternoon\nPeople have been gathering in Washington and other cities to protest Kavanaugh's nomination NPR's Brakkton Booker spoke with some of them earlier today\nShow me what are the U.S Capitol they help signs that read the leaves the survivors and stop Kevin Rachel ... is an attorney who traveled here from Anchorage, Alaska her trip was funded by the American civil liberties union\nI'm here and part of the hash tag one hundred AK women it's a group of Alaska eliminated kind of all the way down dropped our lives or dies dollar responsibility to attend to lobby our senators specifically Senator Murkowski to know against the confirmation that\nRecount ski wound up voting no today as far as tomorrow's vote it's unclear sell it is clear on where she stands on Kavanaugh she says she would be trouble to appear before him especially after what she says for his partisan attacks last week during a student hearing\nSo I think there are many reasons not to confirm him but I think that one alone should help all of our senators have great concern\nAnother woman Susan Barnes arrived in Washington from Rockford, Illinois with her daughter Leighton they're also here to protest and read me there are signs Eighteen year old lady who goes first\nIntegrity still matters you know having a good and for a beer with the guy's not good for that Supreme Court\nSusan Barnes says she doesn't want to see ... on the high court because of the impassioned testimony of Christine Blasey Ford she told lawmakers last week that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her decades ago while they were both in high school\nI definitely felt for eye doctor for it I Am doctor for a bond\nSays she was sexually assaulted in high school and never wants her daughter to go through something like that Kevin supporters were hard to find outside the Capitol today but Michael ... who says he's an independent was happy to take up the mantle\nBecause nobody else is out here on his side right now they're all here they need to hear that they need to hear that\nAs the time New York for the Senate to vote protesters huddled around a portable speaker to the clerk\nWill take a moment in the Senate to record the official tally expected to be fifty one and two forty nine and the bird count on nomination we'll he'd Vance final confirmation vote what happened\nTo some protesters vowed to come back tomorrow even though it looks likely Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed\nIf that happens many say they will take their terms casting a vote in next month's midterms\nReally rocky ... been here in Washington\nBack in July when Kavanaugh was named as the nominee among people gathered at the White House for the big announcement which John Malcolm Malcolm is with the Heritage Foundation that's a conservative think tank here in Washington\nA think tank which President Trump has credited with helping to inform his thinking on judicial nominees John Malcolm joins me now welcome it's a pleasure to be with you\nAnd my right in thinking you were pleased with how the confirmation vote appears to be shaping up\nYes I'll be more pleased after it's done tomorrow now decreasing the likely that Brett Kavanaugh will be an associate justice ... Supreme Court and I'm very pleased\nAbout the numbers are there I let you address some of the questions that have been raised that will continue to be raised in light of his testimony hum and questions about his temperament I'm more than twenty four hundred law professors from across the political spectrum have signed a letter arguing\nThat he demonstrated a lack of judicial temperament when he when he was testifying that there should be disqualifying and then I Want to play you a little bit of John Paul Stevens the former Supreme Court justice\nWho weighed in last night and said he no longer believes Kavanaugh should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens\nIs the thing that the judge and they should have been in for a when he was nominated but I think that his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nJoe Malcolm so these are not he said she said questions that are being raised these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think\nSure well we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to bar who\nKnow him well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week will testifying\nWell that is certainly true I think that there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught\nAgainst him and his reputation as a family that he would have acted like and what comment on I had by the way he acted\nLike an atomic ... I think the response which had been well clearly he must be guilty because they truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if you did and damned if you did at the American bar association of course\nInterview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as a Supreme Court justices well\nPeople wing and then continuing to weigh in on both sides of this absolutely right let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan\nJustice falling forward sure one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not base he released based on any political or personal beliefs and he is not about to sacrifice that wealth has a reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court how\nAbout you know by the way that you know obviously with Peter ... had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the ... you know became president I don't hear too many people question her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut to that specific remarketing or he went on to say it was the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics absolutely\nI I think there is no question that he found the ...\nSome of the members of the Democratic senators editor Judiciary Committee to be appropriate but when it controlling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respect in the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because she's mad that Cory Booker had Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal um he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he uh he said there's some things they shouldn't have said what ... said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break he apologized to center ... ah for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the collar but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's strengths Katie gang rape\nIf that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will\nEnd very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics should have said that\nYou know he I think there is no question that the Democrats you know when you you'd be some of them engaged and the timing of this for a maximum advantage and had a political tinge to it and I I not fault him for responding to that it will not affect what kind of a justice he will be not one iota\nA venture leaf a pool and the train station in Grand junction\nAnd a lay he um says it's just stop and control says yes it's your stop [laughter] so grab your bags and take this envelope and find a hotel room open it up and you'll figure out what to do and basically I'll see you later and that's where they parted ways\nAnd you're listening to Colorado matters I'm Ryan mortar and we are talking about Grand Junction role and really the wider western slopes role in the\nDevelopment of a nuclear weapon during World War two and a ... as part of the Manhattan Project you should do we know whether material from Colorado's western slope was in the bombs dropped on Japan\n[noise] you know that's a great question and you know I've looked into it and it it becomes very hard to trace you know a specific Adam a uranium from\nAll the way from from the Colorado Plateau to to its final use um from what I can tell it looks like the um most of the material coming from the Colorado Plateau particularly\nThat floats through the Grand Junction\nFacility would have gone into a reactor fuel which are produced plutonium which was used to um at the first uh detonation of an atomic device at the trinity test site better on the Mexico as well as as one of the bombs dropped on Japan\nTo the Grand Junction work on the Manhattan Project entered after about three years\nMany of the buildings were later removed from the site and they're also had to be a pretty big environmental cleanup see that one building left behind was a log cabin that had been lay his office and the department of energy hit ... decided to turn that cabin and to sort of a mini museum I guess\nYes I said the cabinet is fascinating ah it was already there when a second lieutenant a lay he showed up in Grand junction and a\nLady set up his headquarters in downtown grand junction but this\nA cabin was the office for a refinery that refined uranium I'm\nAlready there uh it had been used as an office for a gravel pet 'em and and some folks had lived in it um and then after World War two I lay he actually returned to Grand Junction as the first Atomic Energy commission manager of the office\nAnd he moved into the cabin as as his office space\nAnd you want to do watch very briefly myth that cabin\nWell what we're looking to do is I'm sharing the story of not only of lieutenant lady but really share the stories of the sites that I'm\nThere to support this nation throughout the world war two and the Cold War um and so folks can learn about what happened there what's happening there currently\nThanks so much for sharing this fascinating history with us thanks it's been my pleasure Patrick ... is an analyst with the department of energy and he joined us to talk about the ... efforts\nTo preserve the history of Grand Junction role in nuclear warfare and the [noise]\n\nFinally today some feedback on a
