today there is no proof that middle Easterners have infiltrated the caravan of Central Americans now making their way to the U.S border NPR's Scott Horsley reports Trump has been issuing dire warnings

the Cold War bilateral source of national related treaty and I'm all for\nJoining us now to talk about what all of this will mean is Melissa hand them at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies ... nuclear weapons expert and joins us now thank you thanks for having me so is what John Bolton saying accurate is this treaty passed\nIts prime [noise] no not in any way I I'm surprised that he's even using that language this treaty is about protecting Europe\nSo the U.S and Soviet Union a first agreed to this and Nineteen eighty seven at one of the really darkest points in their history um because these missiles carrying nuclear warheads we're really a threat to Western Europe\nAnd so the U.S wanted to protect allies by limiting the Soviet union's ability to deliver nuclear weapons to them\nHow we pulling out of history to be a bad idea right now for security in Europe\nWhen they originally\nCreated disagreement the idea was that the Soviet Union wouldn't be able to\nPrevent NATO members from coming to each other's aids because of the threat of their nuclear intermediate range missiles\nAnd that's still true today and so the fallout from these ah statements from the Trump Administration has really\nMulti fold no one uh there was no advance notice that we know of to any European allies or NATO\nSo there's going to be a lot of infighting and handwringing over what NATO should do\nAnd to uh Europe and I would say at this point Russia and China and the whole world are really worried about what this means largely for for treaties an arms control agreements around the world\nI Want to take on Bolton statement about how this is now a mole type polar world let's talk about China how China's missile capabilities factor into the Trump administration's decision to pull out of this treaty\nSo it's true that the u._s. is concerned that China might use what's called a dump on twenty six to hit Guam where the U.S has military installation or to hit an aircraft carrier and that's what the U. S. ... considered about um with China\nThe problem is that China was never a party of this agreement so really they don't have any restrictions on building these kinds of missiles\nAnd you know if if the U.S wants to negotiate with China a similar kind of deal then they can do so\nCould pulling out of this treaty complicate U.S Russia relations at this point\nCertainly they both hold today just as they did back in Nineteen eighty seven the largest amount of nuclear weapons in the world and it's in their self interest to prevent other states or non state actors from getting as many nuclear weapons as they do and how worried\nShould the average citizen be who's watching all of this play out right now to leaving this treaty in your opinion make the world less safe\nFor a long time people really believe that international agreements where the best way to create peace and stability in the world you didn't have to like your partner in a treaty but you could still\nA deal with them and you could believe that they would obey the terms of the agreement and you could verify that and you could retaliate if they didn't do\nBut a lot of those rules are going out the window and increasingly under the Trump Administration and under potent and Xi Jinping we're seeing more strong arm moves and so what's more worrying for me is that we may go back to a time when whoever has the biggest missile\nThe largest warhead is the one that has the security and um that really takes us back to some dark times that many people worked very hard to prevent\nMelissa ... of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies thank you very much for joining us\nAnd so at this point we can actually make a definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in many patients has any\nProgress being made in the search for a cure\n[noise] we've made a lot of progress at this point we have\nSome very promising therapies that attempt to remove or prevent the accumulation of some of the abnormal proteins that seemed to be associated with this disease\nSome of those medications have not worked as well as we'd hoped um but I think that we are on the cost of developing some very new and highly effective therapies\nThere's also some new research out there about what may prevent people from getting old timers what is the latest research tell us about that\nWell that's a very exciting area of development now we are testing numerous approaches so one of the most exciting is to use\nSome of the same type of compounds that have been a proposed for treatment but they give them much earlier in the disease and so if we can prevent the accumulation of these abnormal proteins\nThan the hope is that we can either stave off the illness or even stop it in its tracks\nThe other approach that a lot of us are very interested in is can we use lifestyle approaches to modify the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease can we use things like physical exercise dietary approaches\nAnd other kinds of activities that we think will a lower the risk of developing this disease and what are the answers to those questions\nWell they're still being worked on unfortunately so we have a lot of\nData that correlates you know someone exercising with the reduced risk of all Samaras but we haven't proven it yet in a go forward way we haven't shown that if you start an exercise program that you yourself will have reduced risk but I think that there's accumulating evidence\nThat a lot of these lifestyle factors and biological interventions may really pay dividends\nNow Sandra Day O'Connor said yesterday that she has been a feeling the early stages of dementia and likely has Alzheimer's disease what is the difference at this point\nWell dementia is a broader syndrome of which there are many causes and Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia but it's not the only one\nIf you were a family member of Sandra Day O'Connor right now would you think that you yourself would be at higher risk of getting dementia or getting Alzheimer's disease because she has\nWell um is O'Connor is eighty eight as you pointed out earlier and so we would characterize her as having what we call late onset Alzheimer's disease and late onset Alzheimer's disease seems to have left\nGenetic load if you will or less genetic links who's an early onset disease and so I Would personally not feel uh at this point that that wouldn't necessarily make one more likely to develop the disease than the general population\nWhen I ask you one more question is there a difference in what we're seeing right now between women and men when it comes to also risk disease [noise]\nWe do see evidence that women are more likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and uh we think that's a a very interesting fact it's true that women live longer than men on average but even when you adjust for that women have a somewhat higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and that [noise]\nThat

a similar package was discovered address to the residents of former president of Iraq Obama then CNN's Manhattan headquarters was evacuated after a package was found their address to former CIA

in an identified white powder similar parcels were discovered in the offices of Democrats Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Maxine Waters and former attorney general Eric Holder Quil Lawrence NPR News New York\nNPR's Mara Liasson tells US President Trump's been briefed about the foiled attacks and is vowing to find out who was behind the President Trump says that a major federal investigation is underway to find out who sent the pipe bombs Trump called it a despicable act and said the sentiment was bipartisan\nIn these times we have to unify we have to come together and said one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America\nThe president says he's very unhappy an angry about the incident and promises to get to the bottom of it Mara Liasson NPR News Washington\nThe Virginia attorney general is joining officials from across the country and investigating reports that Roman Catholic priest

Yuki Noguchi says investors are nervous\nReasons at one point during the day markets were off about ten percent from their all time highs there are a number of uncertainty that have made investors jittery in recent weeks one is a potential global economic slowdown led by China\nI made him fourteen because that's when I moved to a new town as the Brunson family does in the film and that felt like where I was emotionally connected to\nA time in my life I wouldn't say that's officially when my parents separated I think it was actually previous to that there was some ins and outs in the relationship I'm\nSo for me that was like spiritually the right age to sort of put myself into the story\nAnother a kind of see him in the book is that this fourteen or sixteen year old boy is getting different narratives from his mother and his father as they're going through this turbulent period of their marriage and he has to decide who's right who to believe and\nUm that's really tricky when you love both your parents and they're telling a different stories about what your future is going to be like is that something that you relate to also\nAbsolutely and that actually you've now reminded me of probably my the most exciting first hit I got on the book was this feeling of the mystery of who are parents are\nDo do do you know when you suddenly realize like they are past life without the problems are that they're real people you know in in sort of seeing them as a whole people which means they're flawed people that was exciting to me I I sort of had to get to know Jerry Anne Janette better\nProbably as a means of understanding my own experience maybe being put in the middle as you say but especially Jeannette I was like this woman is so complicated a mysterious and\n[noise] and sexual yeah which is I think also really difficult for the teenager to deal with especially because she kind of include him in a direction that she's doing\nYes and and I how I feel about that is this woman has probably been a good mother for fourteen years and the good wife\nAnd I think the data's tried in in in his way and I think they've done their best in many ways but suddenly like one day the rug pulled out from under the charade is up and it's just like this kid is would it be kicked out into the wild right you know it's like okay\nTime's up you this is welcome to the real world\n[noise] so you directly asked Richard Ford for rights to adapt his novel wildlife into a movie and he wrote back to you in a letter he wrote that is included or at least ... erupted in the press kits for your movie I'd like to read that letter it's a great letter\nI'm grateful to you for your interest in my book but I should also say this in hopes of actually encouraging you my book is my book your picture were you to make it as your picture\nYour movie makers fidelity to my novel is of no great concern to many established your own values means go read the book behind so it doesn't get in the way\nThanks for reading that so was that liberal\nOf the oil there as possible you want some money from oil and un he become\nAntagonists and in in one scene in Oregon here\nHe's basically told by one land owner that he'll sign over the oil rights to Daniel Day Lewis if Daniel Day Lewis agrees to be baptized by you and your makeshift church mhm so this is a scene where you're ... him and I should just say parenthetically\nThat the Daniel Day Lewis character earlier in the film he's taken in a boy whose father was in was killed in a mining accident\nAnd then when the boy goes deaf as a result of another ah oil accident I'm Daniel Day Lewis sends him away to school okay so here's the scene with my guest Paul day now and Daniel Day Lewis\nWith us here well what do you argue that are the laws ... Julian going All right\nJohn nice to [noise]\n\n... [noise]\nYou come here and you wrote and ... and ... but you have\nAlso brought your bad habits as your back slider\nUm carry through and the rest of your acting career and now in your first time directorial effort\n[noise] yeah Paul I think has a lot of love I think he loves his actors and his crew he has a an incredible eye for detail I think it's definitely been important for me um I've been wanting to have been a filmmaker for a long time to seeing directors like this go to work\nMeaning to see them wait for the oil drip to be right even though time and money is you know burning I remember one time or in a costume fitting\nYou know him noticing something in the stitching the tie that nobody else would have noticed you know I'm just sort of\nThe focus to care and integrity and it's also important when you see somebody like him I'm able to enjoy their work and and have a moment of fun probably too but I absolutely loved working with him and and frankly many of the directors I've worked with I think the common theme is really hard work\nThat took about your fell in love and mercy and this is a story of Brian Wilson\nMost famous for for the beach boys and of course for his solo albums and I'm In this film there's two versions of Brian Wilson is the version you apply when he's younger\nDuring the beach boys era and then the version later in life when he's having serious mental health issues and a friend was in that part of the play by drunk he sat\nSo I Want to pay scene from love and mercy you've been in this scene writing a God only knows greats\nAnd you play it for your father and if your father who's played by bill camp in the movie is an abusive control freak he's various are carrying with his sons\nAnd I'm very hypercritical nothing's everything enough for him and so you're playing the song for him while he's sitting and looking very tense and smoking has pipe to here's Paul day now and bill camp in a scene from loving Marcy\nI mean the\n\nLast verse will be one more time in the chorus will harmonize over and over at the end\nSo rough I Know but it's getting their wife or cause was [noise]\nShe likes to mean it'll get better that the vocals will counterpoint to back it was for real soulful\nOr you don't want my advice for my mother and just tell me what you think it's usually [noise]\nUm I'm living on her own\n[laughter] we're still family\nMoved on fire their own father don't start walking again argue I say something now you argue but don't say anything\nForget what you don't like the song I never said that I can tell\nJust say something I Would change the title the country's a tuna called God only knows fifty five fifty or I\nShould you close your eyes like I asked you to tell the United states [noise] if you close your eyes you can see place\nSomething's happening\nIt's like being blind because you're blind you can see more don't you think it's a spiritual kind of thing\nI don't know what you're talking about\nI close my eyes students here today\n[noise]\nI don't know maybe it could be something with the right arrangement\nWe I've French horn on it and [noise] flutes tambourine sleigh bells piano base real complex key shifts\nFrankly if you really want to know I don't care for it\nIt's to wishy washy if you leave me why leave me life will go on why go on living it's not like a Beach Boys on your brothers are going to hate it ... it just suicide note didn't you just say it could be something with the right arrangement well I gave it another thought okay\nIf you can't keep your voice down in my house\nSo that's my ... in a scene from love and mercy the full day no as brand will send in a camp and his father Murray wealth and it's really upsetting seen I mean God only knows it's such a beautiful song and the fact that his father either can't here that are doesn't want to hear that\nAnd that he's being so mean to such a musical genius it's\nVery upsetting but in any way you had to seeing in a way that approximate at the brain loss and you're at the piano or are you actually I Know you're doing the singing and I had seen you actually playing of course\nYeah and that's ... that's just live you know I'm playing and singing on camera that's not done after the fact you know that was just insane\nYou used to be in a band called moved in your guitar and um did you know how to play piano\nI could probably formed a few chords but not really and you know frankly learning this music for this film of emergency\nListening to it or is probably one of the greatest joys I've ever had in my life professionally or personally I loved this music so much you know a particularly pet sounds and smile\nI don't know Brian for somebody who struggled so much you get so much light in him and he met him yes yeah and when he when we talked about music he still felt like a school boy about it you know you could be quite uncomfortable about most things but if you were with him and got into music you know he he really\nBut but by lightning sign him I mean you know he's he's really he's giving a piece of himself\nTo us and I think he wanted to help people heal which is such a considering the struggles that he had and you just heard in this scene you know to want to give give that I'm through your music to somebody else who's experiencing you know\nUm it's just such a beautiful generosity and and gift and you're listening to that scene now it's um you know not it's not just upsetting because he's in musical genius you mean he's offering himself to his dad you know\nAnd we kept it totally I kept it yeah unseen their core change as in love and mercy are so beautiful and so unpredictable and um so what did you have to learn those court like you'd you know how to play those scores let alone the sequencing of them\nNo no no no and I really started from basics and um\nAnd that was just so beautiful to have the piano opened up to me through Bryan I'm because the voice things did he teaches the court's not Brian or a guy named area and there's an Hispanic um helped me out and uh you know just started practicing day by day\nIn single doing vocal exercises you know and and and that's a really nice routine for somebody preparing for something let's say let me do thirty minutes a day of of singing at first and in this amount of piano and slowly\nYou know learn your learn your chops sort of build them up get comfy\nBut I'm the other really fascinating thing about learning through piano through Brian is his left hand the bass notes\nReally incredible um and that's really what changes the court off and he's not always you know emphasizing the route note um would you would have you're playing a gee you know he's often emphasizing a different um note that in the voice thing and that changes the entire sounded the court and it's actually something that I Believe Paul McCartney\nGot from listening to the beach boys and started doing as a bass player which was kind of quite revolutionary at the time\nUm so for him in the music to not you know necessarily be landing on the roof no really changes the feeling behind the court and\nSo I learned so much uh and and and I miss it you know listening to that I don't listen to them often because it really sends a chill through ... and you know I Do miss listening to his music\nWell let's take a short break and then we'll

these days but they had all felt the pain of the nation's opioid epidemic last year more than Seventy thousand Americans died from a drunk\nWas opioids were responsible for about two thirds of those stats and the White House today President Trump signed legislation that will allow lawmakers from both parties to say they are taking steps to address the problem NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nThe opioid bill was passed by both the house and Senate with near unanimous approval level of bipartisan support that Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio says is unusual in today's highly polarized political climate\nI guess maybe because of the severity of the crisis and particularly in states like mine uh people are willing to work together and joined hands and figure out how to solve it and forget the politics\nDemocratic senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire agrees the opioid crisis cuts a wide and deadly swab from rural areas to big cities and polls show it's the rare issue that voters in both parties are alarmed by\nWe are losing over a hundred people a day in the United states of America to this epidemic you couldn't go anywhere in the country and talked all about the impact it had on them this is impacting people in all walks of life in all different ways\nThe opioid built signed by the President's Day aims to address the problem in different ways\nTargeting both supply and demand President Trump signed the bill was some fanfare in the White House ... almost exactly a year after he declared the opioid epidemic a public health emergency\nTogether we're going to end this gorge of drug addiction in America we're going to end it or we're going to at least making extremely big dent in this terrible\nTerrible problem lots of politicians are claiming credit after the bill signing as the measure incorporates lots of different ideas\nEfforts to interdict drugs at the border for example to increase support for drug users seeking treatment was the bill doesn't include is a whole lot of new money to fight the problem hasn't says lawmakers have approved some six billion dollars to combat opioid addiction over the next couple of years\nBut experts in the field tell us that is not nearly enough we have to treat this as a starting point we have a lot more work to do\nPortman wants to see more effort to address over prescribing opioids nobody ... many addicts start out with a legitimate need for pain pills but yeah it's despair also plays a role\nPart of the answer to this is to get people who are in places like small town Ohio of rural Appalachian more opportunities that is I think one of the antidote to the drug issue more broadly\nHealth secretary Alex Azar said this week there are some encouraging signs of the epidemic may be leveling off or at least not growing as rapidly as it once was\nBut drug addiction remains an elusive and evolving problem overdose deaths from heroin and prescription drugs may be near their peak but ... says methamphetamine is regaining a foot hold and cocaine is making a comeback as well\nYou know it's a societal issue we have America has a bigger drug problem that other countries are not just opioid tore by far lead the world and we need to focus on that broader issue\nFor now though today's bill signing gives members of Congress something they can point to when confronted with the pain of the

today on the killing of journalist Jamal ... has it has a\nGymnast or these\nSpeaking at a conference in Riyadh the crown prince said it was painful to all Saudi citizens he called the killing a heinous crime the killing prompted many western CEOs to canceled their plans to attend as high profile gathering U.S Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin canceled his appearance but\nMany of us business executives did show up and to find out more about what had happened at this conference we reached New York times reporter Alan Rapaport he's in Riyadh welcome thanks for having me so we're supposed to talk about what this conferences for the Saudis want the global companies to invest their money and the king and that's the basic object right\nExactly it's called the future investment initiative and it's the second year that they've done it has become known sort of colloquially as the ... in the desert a conference and a drawing about three thousand people wow this week or wow world\nAnd in part of the deal is Saudis want to diversify their economy so they're not as reliant on oil I imagine\nExactly so there's lots of panels going on at the conference where they talk about capital markets investing technology and you know efforts to make Saudi Arabia hub for these kinds of industries come here and set up shop\nNow this year of course the killing of democracy ... cast a shadow over the conference but today the crown prince directly confronted the issue in his comments what what did you make of his remarks today\nIt was quite interesting but it was kind of wondering first of all whether or not he would speaker nodded name he did whether or not he would address the situation and ah he did address it head on a he did not take any responsibility personally for it\nWhich was interesting but he called it a heinous act and he did promise to brings ever did it to justice so I think that was his attempt to try and LA concerns a among people from all around the world who thinks that this is sort of part of the Saudi culture to violate human rights in this way\nAnd how was the audience reacting as the crown prince was speaking today\nIt was a very positive you know I'm sort of a bully in the audience in favor of the crown prince he got a standing ovation um after he uh discuss the situation as well as when he was talking about the Saudi economy and how you know he wanted to lead the charge to make it an economic powerhouse in the middle east\nYou mentioned that it was a very supportive audience I Want to talk about what American companies did show up any who did you see there\nThere was a broad range of executives from all different kinds of companies the big names from like J. P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs we're not there are some of the banks and lower level executives but\nI think some people were definitely shy about being there they were in many cases concealing names on their name tags by their ties are keeping their jackets buttoned up which you might not view in Saudi Arabia were pretty hot these\nWere people willing to talk about why they did show up what they hope to get out of the conference\nYeah somewhere I mean there was definitely a sense a people that I spoke to that you know this is an important business opportunity important investing opportunity and they didn't want us our relations with the Saudis and I think some people felt that you know their attendance\nIf they didn't show up wouldn't necessarily be notice or make a statement so they felt like they were going to go\nAnd see what happened anyway and there were others who felt that you know it's unclear at this point it exactly what did happen and you know until investigation as conclusive\nThey were going to get the Saudis the benefit of the doubt\nHave you heard anything yet at this conference that makes you think ... that will deter a new American investment in Saudi Arabia or hurt existing ties with the ... and\nI think so I mean I think it will depend somewhat what additional evidence comes out going forward but you know people said that the big banks and the biggest brands and business are going to be reluctant to jump back in right away because of the potential damage the brands\nAs well as companies in ... in Silicon valley which are very focused on you know ethical investing\nThe defense companies were less reluctant than the big banks to step away from the conference I think they just seem less concerned about the backlash against their friends and this is such a important market for them to be involved in I think it would be economically dangerous for them to step away\nThat's Allan Ropper part of the New York times thank you so much for joining us today thank you for having me\nAnd here in Washington the Senate Judiciary committee considered for more of President Trump's judicial nominees today but two senators attended the hearing that's because the Senate is in recess NPR national\nJustice correspondent Carrie Johnson reports\nEntire hearing was over in less time than an episode of law and order around forty minutes and all the committee's top Republican Chuck\nAthlete didn't show up neither did any Democrats instead senator might crepe our Republican from Idaho was in charge\nBrigitte ... could lose ... and Mr Miller please come forward and take your seats eventually\nOne other senator arrived Republican Orrin Hatch of Utah\nOn the agenda where two seats on the U.S court of appeals for the Ninth Circuit both coveted jobs they carry lifetime tenure the nominees were Brigitte ... a magistrate judge in Arizona and Eric Miller a law firm partner in Washington state in some ways the hearing followed the usual script\nNominees bank their spouses and children that Miller gave another family member or a shout out\nBoth of my children have made very clear to me that in their view I Would be remiss if I lost I'm sure that our family also includes the cat the cat was not able to be president\nSenator crepe lobbed a few basic questions to the nominees here he is in an exchange with Bridget Beatty\nSomebody who would briefly what do you believe is the proper role of a judge [noise]\nI Believe that a judgment and I understand the role and that means understanding that you are no longer an advocate you no longer have a client or caused or the preferred outcome\nEric Miller had a heavier lift his two home state senators Democrats from Washington oppose his nomination\nAnd we can find no example of any judicial nominees to the appellate courts being confirmed over the objection of both home state senators\nThat's Christine Lucia is with the Leadership Conference on civil and human rights she used to work on that Senate committee for fourteen years\nSo if ... Miller is confirmed over their objection it will be yet another red line that's crossed by Senator Grassley leadership on the Senate Judiciary committee\nThe national Congress of American Indians also wrote to the Senate with concerns about Miller they say he's focused on undermining the rights of tribes often taking extreme legal positions that issue matters especially in the Ninth Circuit home to four hundred and twenty seven federally recognized tribes again senator ...\nThe point is that there's a belief that you don't have the appropriate view of tribal sovereignty\nMiller defended himself by arguing he did take the side of an Indian tribe and Casey argued at the Justice Department years ago since he joined private legal practice Miller says he inherited a base of clients that often

the fight for us even a tight\nRace in New York's nineteenth congressional district and his strategy is one Democrats nationwide have embraced in fact more than half of pro democratic TV ads in the home stretch to election day has mentioned health care compared to around one third of Republican ads\nThat's according to the Wesleyan Media project Margie Omero is a democratic pollster\nDemocrats have a very clear advantage on health care and not only that it's one of the top issues of voter saying not heard of that that they think hey you know big issues facing them personally and facing the country\nThat's a big change from the twenty ten and twenty fourteen midterms when Republican slammed Obamacare Democrats barely touched the topic\nBut since twenty sixteen Republicans have tried and failed to repeal Obamacare\nAnd the law has gained popularity now Republicans have ramped up their own messaging among the new ads that popped up in recent weeks one from Republican John ... whom Delgado is trying to unseat the ad features facile his wife a cancer survivor\nJohn firsthand how important health care for family the truth is he a guaranteed cameras for people with preexisting condition this is one of\nA recent crop of ads were GOP candidates promised to protect people with preexisting conditions President Trump has been saying the same thing but then the Republican Obamacare repeal bill would likely have made it harder for many sick people to get coverage that's according to the Kaiser Family foundation Larry Levitt\nInsurers would have still have the guaranteed insurance to people with preexisting conditions but for people who are uninsured and had a pre existing condition they might have food prohibitively high premiums which would have put coverage of way out of reach\nAccording to a September pull from Kaiser even a majority of Republicans supported keeping these protections however let it points out a flipside to the policy\nWhen you see a guaranteed insurance to people with preexisting conditions premiums go up especially for people who are helping\nAnd this has long been part of the Republican argument that Obamacare raised premiums for too many people and\nFurthermore force people to get insurance they didn't want however there aren't dozens of Republican ads explaining for example the finer points of pre existing conditions and there's a good reason for that\nThere's a truism and politics that if you're winning or losing\nMichael Steele is a Republican strategist it's not the Republicans have been dodging healthcare this year rather they have other lines of attack perhaps the biggest single payer health care often known as Medicare for all\nI think Republicans feel that grown or or\nMedicare for all without a realist wind up for

are high across rural America and then you pull on rural life conducted by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard th Chan School of public health more than half of those surveyed said they knew someone personally affected by suicide\nBut eight rural mountain west states are among the ten us states with the highest suicide rate NPR's Kirk Siegler visited one town Grand Junction Colorado which is trying to do something about it\nAt the confluence of the Gunnison and Colorado rivers Grand Junction sits in a bowl of valley ringed by tall mountains desert bases and red rock lifts you can see how someone who is struggling could feel a little trapped here this is how Seventeen year old Victoria Mendoza describes it\nAnd we can't really fix this because this nature but the surrounding mountains I feel like the people in our valley feel like there's only life inside the Grand Junction\nMendoza has battled with depression runs in her family the first funeral she ever went to was a little girl was for an uncle who died by suicide\nThings got really hard a couple of years ago when there was a rash of teen suicides seven over a school year one was a student Mendoza knew from being in band together and another high school student killed himself in the parking lot in front of a crowd\nHonestly physically kind of felt like there was like this cloud around her whole valley we were just kind of anticipating the next one and it got to a point where we were just like waiting for the next one\nBefore it became such a public crisis suicide was stigmatized in this valley that's long been a problem across the rural west it's that cowboy stereotype of self reliance that runs deep\nYou know picked up by your bootstraps mentality\nKathy evil has worked in the school district for Thirty years most recently helping at risk kids\nI think that we unfortunately [noise] think of mental illness instead of mental health\nAnd it's a rural area and there aren't as many resources Grand Junction does have a small mental health hospital but it's the only one between Salt Lake city in Denver\nI think there's also the issue of access to guns and I'm not ... I mean that's not a political statement one way or another we have guns in our home 'cause my boys hunt but it I think the accessibility makes a difference\nRegardless of the causes evil says that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen the school district was forced to act\nThe old way wasn't working Victoria Mendoza says at first kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for Mendoza\nWhen news of the scandal broke the plaintiffs argued VW is top management knew about the troubles earlier today Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel called on the country's auto industry to stop penny pinching when it comes to fixing diesel cars with excessive emissions you're listening to NPR News\n[noise] [noise]\nHi I'm Stewart vendor world president of Colorado Public radio as a source of news CPR is one of the largest media institutions in the state we're committed to producing news for news from communities throughout Colorado [noise] and we're committed\nTo sharing the power of the human voice in college for connecting people around our common interests celebrating our diverse experiences from the western slope to the front range\nFrom four corners to the eastern\nBecause of your support Colorado Public radio is here in Colorado\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from a zoom zoom offers cloud video conferencing online meetings and a video conference room solution in one platform featuring digital video and audio screen sharing account registration and more at zoom dot us\nFrom Fidel investments taking a personalized approach to helping clients grow preserve and manage their wealth learned more at fidelity dot com slash wealth fidelity brokerage services L L C and from the listeners who support this NPR station\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I notice that change it's been three weeks\nAnd a day since dissidents now to journalist ... went missing it's been five days since ... death was announced on Saudi state TV\nThroughout that time the Trump administration's position on the killing of ... and Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nHas been evolving the president has condemned the killing that still has not condemned the Saudi crown prince or said whether he believes NBS as he's referred she played a role\nWhen Republican senator who has been a vocal critic has built the Saudi king in his policies\nAnd the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman himself is Indiana senator tot young it's called the crown prince impulsive and reckless and says the U.S should send the Saudi leader a message senator young welcome thanks for having me also so what is the message the U.

interests\nHasn't been a mistake for President Trump to put so much trust didn't installments pledged reformers country then\nLook I think it's really important that we work with security partners in the middle east there aren't many options to choose from\nA but we do have leverage or as a country to use against the Saudis to bring them in a better behavior so that they're not repeatedly killing civilians through airstrikes using our weapons in our fuel is they've been doing for the last couple of beers\nIn Yemen so they're not murdering journalists are like Indiana State a graduate a ... in Washington Post journalist\nSo these are the sorts of things that we need to not only highlight but we need to begin holding\nThe government in Riyadh to account on on account of these actions\nAnd on honing Riyadh accountable some of your colleagues in Congress had been calling for a regime change in Saudi Arabia for the conference to be replaced do you agree that that would be a good step\nWill look we're still confirming certain details with respect to a this most recent tragedy in the interim I've been encouraged that the administration is revoking the visas of individuals' we already know had been involved\nIn this ... situation I'm but I'm not prepared to rule anything out uh I I think we should suspend all arms sales until we know more\nAnd we should most certainly should stop refueling Saudi coalition aircraft are engaged in this sort of atrocities I just referenced in the country of Yemen\nRight you mention that you would like to see Saudi arms that Saudi arms deal with the U.S get ripped up the President Trump has talked a lot recently about all the jobs that would be lost if the White House tore up that arms deal with Saudi Arabia do you share the president's concerns about jobs being lost\n[noise] look I think that the number of jobs are ... levy loss from this ah or frankly fairly minor and I I I don't see that as a major consideration I see this instead as a matter of upholding our values and um let's not forget our national security interests here\nThe country of Yemen has been destabilized by Saudi action\nThat country happens to be the headquarters of al ... in the Arabian Peninsula the most dangerous al ... affiliate out there so um it's essential\nWe talked about what Congress could possibly do to address the situation in Saudi Arabia but what about the president do you believe that President Trump has been vocal enough calling out Saudi Arabia enough in the wake\nA democracy oh jeez death\nWell I think uh the president's message I gather more information ah it's of all he's in a good spot now in fact he condemn the ... death is the worst cover up ever\nThat's a pretty strong condemnation for a country that has historically been and will remain I think an important security partner rumors\nBut should President Trump had been so reticent to criticize Saudi Arabia at the beginning\nI think reticence when you're dealing with national security partners was probably a positive impulse but right now he's in a situation having together more facts are that we have just been experiencing the worst cover up ever him and so that's pretty strong language coming from the president of United States\nDoes it concern you the close ties the Trump Administration has with members of the royal family and Saudi Arabia specifically Jared Kushner the president's son in law has cultivated a very close relationship with the crown prince Mohammed bin some on does that concern you\nKnow we have had strong relationships with Saudi government's for generations and uh that's uh something that has continued with this administration recognizing that the Saudis have been in can continue to be very important security partners they provide us valuable intelligence\nBut I have to admit that relationship or gets undermined is the Saudis\nAre Deceive Us and as they engage in a violation of our fundamental

agree on much these days but they had all felt the pain of the nation's opioid epidemic\nLast year more than Seventy thousand Americans died from a drug overdose\nOpioids were responsible for about two thirds of those stats and the White House today President Trump signed legislation that will allow lawmakers from both parties to say they are taking steps to address the problem NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nThe opioid bill was passed by both the house and Senate with near unanimous approval level of bipartisan support that Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio says is unusual and today is highly polarized political climate\nI guess maybe because the severity of the crisis and particularly in states like mine uh people are willing to work together and joined hands and figure out how to solve it and forget the politics\nDemocratic senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire agrees the opioid crisis cuts a wide and deadly swath from rural areas to big cities and polls show it's the rare issue that voters in both parties are alarmed by\nWe are losing over a hundred people a day in the United states of America to this epidemic you can go anywhere in the country and talked all about the impact it had on them this is impacting people in all walks of life in all different ways\nThe opioid built signed by the President's Day aims to address the problem in different ways targeting both supply and demand President Trump signed the bill with some fanfare in the White House ... almost exactly a year after he declared the opioid epidemic a public health emergency\nTogether we're going to end the scores of drug addiction in America we're going to end it or we're going to at least make an extremely big dent in this terrible\nTerrible problem lots of politicians are claiming credit after the bill signing as the measure incorporates lots of different ideas efforts to interdict drugs at the border for example and to increase support for drug users seeking treatment\nWas the bill doesn't include is a whole lot of new money to fight the problem hasn't says lawmakers have approved some six billion dollars to combat opioid addiction over the next couple of years\nBut experts in the field tell us that is not nearly enough we have to treat this as a starting point we have a lot more work to do\n... wants to see more effort to address over prescribing opioids knowing that many addicts start out with a legitimate need for pain pills but he adds despair also plays a role\nPart of the answer to this is to get people who are in places like small town Ohio of rural Appalachian more opportunities that is I think one of the antidote to the drug issue more broadly\nHealth secretary Alex days are said this week there are some encouraging signs up the epidemic may be leveling off or at least not growing as rapidly as it once was\nBut drug addiction remains an elusive and evolving problem overdose deaths from heroin and prescription drugs may be near their peak but Portman says methamphetamine is regaining a foot hold and cocaine is making a comeback as well\nYou know it's a societal issue we have America has a bigger drug problem that other countries not just opioids away by far lead the world and we need to focus on that broader issue\nFor now though today's bill signing gives members of Congress something they can point to when confronted with the pain of the

Chang Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman made his first public comments today on the killing of journalists Jamal ... as if it has a\nLimited to the gym yesterday\nSpeaking at a conference in Riyadh the crown prince said it was painful to all Saudi citizens he called the killing a heinous crime the killings prompted many western CEOs to canceled their plans to attend as high profile gathering U.S Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin canceled his appearance but\nMany of us business executives did show up\nAnd to find out more about what has happened at this conference we reached New York times reporter Alan Rapaport he's in Riyadh welcome thanks for having me some first talk about what this conferences for the Saudis want global companies to invest their money and the king and that's the basic objective right\nExactly it's called the future investment initiative and it's the second year that they've done it it's become known sort of colloquially as the top of this in the desert a conference and a drawing about three thousand people wow this week\nOr wow world and in part of the deal is the Saudis want to diversify their economy so they're not as reliant on oil I imagine\nExactly so there's lots of panels going on at the conference where they talk about capital markets investing technology and you know efforts to make Saudi Arabia hub for these kinds of industries come here and set up shop\nNow this year of course the killing of democracy empty cast a shadow over the conference but today the crown prince directly confronted the issue when his comments what what'd you make of his remarks today\nIt was quite interesting everybody was kind of wondering first of all whether or not he would speak or not he did whether or not he would address the situation and ah he did address it head on a he did not take any responsibility personally for it\nWhich was interesting but he called it a heinous act and he did promise to brings whoever did it to justice so I think that was his attempt to try and concerns a among people from all around the world who think that this is sort of part of the Saudi culture to violate human rights in this way\nAnd how was the audience reacting as the crown prince was speaking today\nIt was a very positive you know I'm sort of a bully in the audience in favor of the crown prince he got standing ovations um after he uh discuss the situation as well as when he was talking about the Saudi economy and how you know he wanted to lead the charge to make it an economic powerhouse in the middle east\nYou mentioned that it was a very supportive audience I I Want to talk about what American companies did show up any who did you see there\nThere was a broad range of executives from all different kinds of companies the big names from like ... and Goldman Sachs we're not there are some of the banks did send lower level executives but I think some people were definitely shy about being there they were in many cases concealing their names on their name tags by their ties are keeping their jackets\nButtoned up which you might not you in Saudi Arabia were pretty hockey's and they\nWere people willing to talk about why they did show up what they hope to get out of the conference\nYeah somewhere I mean there was definitely a sense of people that I spoke to but you know this is an important business opportunity important investing opportunity and I didn't want us our relations with the Saudis and I think some people felt that you know their attendance if they didn't show up wouldn't necessarily be notice or make a statement so they felt like they were going to go\nAnd see what happened anyway and there were others who felt that you know it's unclear at this point exactly what did happen and you know until investigation as conclusive they were going to give the Saudis the benefit of the doubt\nHave you heard anything yet at this conference that makes you think ... that will determine new American investment in Saudi Arabia or hurt existing ties with the kingdom\nI think so I mean I think it will depend somewhat what additional evidence comes out going forward but you know people said that the big banks and biggest brands and business are going to be reluctant to jump back in right away because of the potential damage those brands\nAs well companies in Silicon valley which are very focused on you know ethical investing the defense companies were less reluctant than the big banks to step away from the conference\nI think they just seem less concerned about the backlash against their friends and such a important market for them to be involved in I think it would be economically dangerous for them to step away\nThat's Allan Rapaport of the New York times thank you so much for joining us today thank you for having me\nAnd here in Washington the Senate Judiciary committee considered for more of President Trump's judicial nominees today but two senators attended the hearing that is because the Senate is in recess NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson reports\nThe entire hearing was over in less time than an episode of law and order around forty minutes and all the committee's top Republican Chuck Grassley didn't show up neither did any Democrats instead senator might crepe our Republican from Idaho was in charge\nYou Bridget ... could the ms ... and Mr Miller please come forward and take your seats eventually one\nOther senator arrived Republican Orrin Hatch of Utah on the agenda where two seats on the U.S court of appeals for the Ninth Circuit both coveted jobs they carry lifetime tenure the nominees were Bridget Beatty a magistrate judge in Arizona and Eric Miller a law firm partner in Washington state\nIn some ways the hearing follow the usual script nominees thank their spouses and children then Miller gave another family member or a shout out\nBoth of my children have made very clear to me in their view I Would be remiss if I lost mention that our family also includes the cat the cat was not able to be president\nSenator ... lobbed a few basic questions to the nominees here he is in an exchange with Brigitte ...\nTell me if you would briefly what do you believe is the proper role of a judge [noise]\nI Believe that a judgment or understand the role and that means understanding that you are no longer an advocate you no longer have a client or caused or the preferred outcome\nEric Miller had a heavier lift his two home state senators Democrats from Washington oppose his nomination\nAnd we can find no example of any judicial nominee to the appellate courts being confirmed over the objection of both home state senators\nBats Christine ... with the Leadership Conference on civil and human rights she used to work on that Senate committee for fourteen years\n... Miller is confirmed over their objection it will be yet another red line that's crossed by Senator Grassley leadership on the Senate Judiciary committee\nThe national Congress of American Indians also wrote to the Senate with concerns about Miller\nThey say he's focused on undermining the rights of tribes often taking extreme legal positions that issue matters especially in the Ninth Circuit home to four hundred and twenty seven federally recognized tribe again senator quaint though\nThe point is that there's a belief that you don't have the appropriate view of tribal sovereignty\nMiller defended himself by arguing he did take the side of an Indian tribe and Casey argued at the Justice Department years ago since he joined private legal practice Miller says he inherited a base of clients that often clashed with Indian tribes\nMy job as an advocate is not to advance my own views but to advance the plants views and to do the most that I can within the bounds of the law to all asleep a achieve points interests and that's what I've done\nThen Senator Hatch dumped in with more of a statement then a question\nWhile I Want to compliment both of us are excellent choices and the president for picking you support you fully and we're going to do everything we can get you through before the end of this year\nThe hearing continued for about twenty more minutes with two other nominees Karen ... is a former member of Ken Starr independent counsel team she's vying for a district court judge posted in Oregon Richard hurtling a former house and Senate staffer wants a seat on the federal claims court", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "24"}
