to travel on to the U.S even as Mexico grass visitors permits to some of the migrants\nActually goes only allowing those with visas or passports in and some who are seeking asylum\nSituation is

brought by children and teenage environmentalist activists behind the lawsuit who were in an age from ten to Twenty one argue the government's failed to protect natural resources as a public trust for future generations insertion of ends at reports\nChief justice John Roberts signed the order marking a victory for the U.S government which has tried for years and are both the Obama and Trump administrations\nTo get the case dismissed the lawsuit was filed in twenty Fifteen and it's sponsored by an Oregon based nonprofit called our children stretched\nEmily Green has been traveling with him and she's now on the bridge that separates quarter mile from Mexico and she's with us now Emily thanks so much for talking to us thanks for having me a little bit more about where you are and what's happening right now\nSo I'm On this bridge has had the right spot I'm On Mexico and what I'm saying right now are they ... just in their diapers kids without shoes on tons of men and moms it feels like I'm In the midst of a humanitarian crisis\nCan you tell us a bit more about what people are telling you who they are and why they've been willing to go through all this so most of them came\nFrom Hunter S and there are so ah folks from El Salvador and some from Guatemala but the vast majority from Hunter S what they told me largely is that this wasn't planned they read or heard about the caravan\nAnd conditioned and in Honduras are unfathomable a bad\nThat they can't get gas that there's no food that they're simply starving and that they had to take a chance they also felt much safer and numbers to travel to Mexico as part of the big group of people instead of just a loan or paying a smuggler or coyote to take them\nNow understand that a number of people are actually turning back now\nThat's right so Guatemala has said buses\nTo take a those migrants who want to return to hundred to take them back voluntarily and so\nI talked to a woman by the name of Rosalind Lopez at you name she's twenty six years old she said like many of the other migrants that she started Ted joined the Caribbean and competition but ... but she regretted that decision along the way\nShe has four children back in Honduras and she said she knew the trip would be hard but it's even worse than she imagine\nShe\nSays to me it's still suffer back and under is at least we'll keep her life and she was first of the fact that yesterday the Mexican police deployed tear gas against migrants trying to enter Mexico and that people got hurt and so she has given needs condition it's better that she returned to Honduras\nBut you said that there are still several thousand people there so that suggests that most of the people are going to try to stay in and hung on keep moving with the ...\nThat's right I think for the point I mean I'd say there's maybe two to three thousand people on the spread most of them are moving forward\nI talked to a twenty four year old Kevin India he's traveling with his younger sister and a friend or they've been travelling for three days they camped out on the bridge last night with thousands of the other migrants 'em and they want to reach Florida with their friends here's what he had to tell me\nYet ...\nSays the Europe becomes your friends so scared that you use that fear to your favor and it pushes forward and he's heads are going to try and get across to Mexico anyway they pan and that includes by boat or trying to cross that bridge that I'm On right now\nYou know President Trump has reacted furiously to this he's been speaking about it a campaign rally demanding that Mexico closed the border by any means necessary he claimed to send us troops to the southern border I was wondering if that message is getting through to the people that you've been talking to and what did you have from all the both the market sending authorities there\nI Would say that virtually none of the migrants on this spread to really know what time is saying they don't have cell phone service or they don't have money to charge your cell phone so it's basically word of mouth they know something doesn't want them they absolutely no that that that's almost meaningless them\nWhat they want to do is leave\nTheir lives they're they're very hard they are very violent life behind and under and they're going to push forward but I had this today on the bridge\nThat this is not going to end the well I don't have the sense that all of a sudden in Mexico is going to let these three thousand people and um and so it makes me wonder what's gonna happen to them this is this is going to turn for them to a humanitarian crisis\nWhere these people are going to go I don't think it's going to end well\nEmily Green is a reporter based in Mexico and she's with us now from the fridge that separate from Mexico from Guatemala with thousands of would be migrants are gathered hoping to cross Emily Green thank you so much for talking to thanks for having me on the show\n\nHe was I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother as he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds\nAnd it fits the general reporting on these kinds of thing when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think that it has been shown that things offices are able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed I mean I think of the classic example is\nUm Dylann Roof who who murdered and he went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to arrest him without harming him and it it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests for black men in particular versus arrest for white men that very clear racial disparity\nYou noted though that he had been described as six foot three and three hundred pounds of those ... those are actual details though aren't they I mean if you were to someone you wouldn't you describe those things you\nMight not have sampled you know how tall Dylann Roof is you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as ... as easily as Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\n... it's been reported that your brother's struggled with some mental health issues is that is that accurate\nYes that's absolutely accurate\nDo you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to support the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police are they are often just proportionately the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police\nShe wants to talk with she can't 'cause she just doesn't have the voice yet and then once you got the voices just like boom\nLewis said he liked to learning that her father named her star for light it's a detail actor ... likes to\nSay that Islam is so beautiful about black culture as we give our children power in their names my name actually means power\nIn
