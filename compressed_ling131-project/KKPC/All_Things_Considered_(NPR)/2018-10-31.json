shootings one at the synagogue in Pittsburgh the other at a grocery store in Louisville, Kentucky\nThe third was the explosives sent through the mail to prominent Democrats all three of the suspects now in custody are men born here in the U.S NPR's Greg Myre he joins us now to talk about the common threads between these incidents Greg hey ours we hear so much about international terrorism an effort to stop people from other countries these incidents are all homegrown how common is that\nA absolutely you know nine eleven really concentrated the mind on radical Islam from abroad but the numbers since then tell a very different story deadly attacks by the far right white supremacist\nOutnumber those by Muslim extremist by a ratio of three to one about Seventy attacks versus twenty three\nThe ... the death toll in the past Seventeen years about the same about a hundred and twenty five on on on both sides here the far right tends to target the small minorities in smaller numbers in indiscriminate attacks so that many of the radical Muslims have carried out\nAnd when you look at the three people who are accused of these attacks in the last week they all look similar to each other a men born in the u._s. should we read something into that as if the new face of extremism\nA it's sort of been the face of extremism these are American men acting on their own and they account form a solid majority of extremist attacks\nReally started picking up about a decade ago of the man accused in Pittsburgh made anti Semitic remarks on social media the Louisville suspect had a reputation for racist comments in the mail bomb suspect in Florida\nUh always told worker co workers that he admired Hitler and thoughts of gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated I spoke to Bill Braniff the director of the stark consortium at the University of Maryland um they study terrorism in in his research points to this far right obsession that white Americans are at risk\nWhat are the characteristics of an individual that allow them to go from non violence in support of one of these ideologies to violence we find that the believing in this collective sense of victimhood is in your necessary condition\nGreg we've seen so much in the way of government efforts to fight Islamic extremism is they're the same effort to stop this kind of domestic far right extremism\nProbably not the same level a Christopher Wray the FBI Director was before Congress or just a couple of weeks ago he ... he said Islamic extremism and he still sees that as the greatest threat\nBut then he noted very quickly there are a thousand active investigations inside the U.S and he said this covers everything from right to left and everything in between he didn't break it down further than that but he specifically said this was not Islamic extremists he was talking about here\nI'm In the challenge of course is how do you find people there are is the social media trail\nBut there are so many American men expressing the thoughts these days it's hard to tell of who will act in who's just ranting\nWe're going to hear more in a moment about one social media site that's become a platform for these rants but first the FBI is describing the scope of the problem what is it and the Trump Administration more broadly doing about it\nThe Trump Administration hasn't shown a lot of interest the Obama administration created a program countering violent extremism given grants to local groups to prevent radicalization the Trump Administration has cut that way back then hasn't really focused on far right threats despite the growing numbers of attacks\nIf NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre Thanks Greg thanks sorry\nBefore Robert ... hours walked into the tree of life synagogue in

think you will see Chevron deference in great jeopardy\nOr their other priorities you think this new court will have\nI think it is possible that you'll see this court\nA hearken back to the days of

the Supreme Court assault on the constitution he's also former legal affairs editor at Newsweek\nSo I have a question and I suspect you won't be able to answer but I'd love to know the answer to this I really want to know what the justices think of how Brett Kavanaugh I handled himself\nAt his confirmation hearings when he was questioned about Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual assault and let it us justices who are already seated on the court thought he had a judicial temperament do you have anything that you can tell us about that\nI stayed in touch with some of the justices I've interviewed I've stayed in touch with them since the book has come out I guess like an offer to thoughts one leaving aside the specifics\nOf Dr Ford's testimony and Kavanaugh's response the justices can stand seeing the court placed a in the mail strum they they think it's bad for the court they think it's embarrassing and while they'll watch the hearings are on TV you know they have cable at the court\nThey live in a marble temple but they can still watch TV and they hate it\nHaving said that I think part of the reaction this time was having a specific most of the justices know having a chief justice Roberts served briefly I think with cabin on the DC circuit in ... if not [noise]\nThey live near each other in suburban Washington they belong to the same clubs eat at the same restaurants there are other piece and Elena Kagan\nJustice Kagan when she was dean of Harvard law school tired Kavanaugh to ah come teach there so they all know Kavanaugh they knew know him far more than they knew Neil Gorsuch when he joined the court and they light cabinet and they respect him there is a reason\nThat Kavanaugh was the leading so cold feet or judge in the country that is the judges who send their own law clerks up to the Supreme Court to then clerked for justice is Kavanaugh was the leader in the country incidentally I think second place was Merrick Garland\nStill on the federal appeals court in Washington and ... who of course was Obama's pick to succeed Scully in two thousand sixteen\n[noise] so I think there are a lot of concerns now that we have two justices in the Supreme Court who have been accused of sexual misconduct Clarence Thomas the sexual harassment and Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault\nAnd these men might have decisive votes in matters pertaining to gender equality sexual assault or sexual harassment issues\nAnd it questions the credibility of the ... court because they might be very biased in their opinions\nWhether they're biased or as you know have the appearance of bias is a real problem for the court and there is no real solution I don't for example think you will see recusal\nIn such areas of the law I don't think you'll see Kevin recused himself anymore than Clarence Thomas ... part of that is it's hard for justice to recuse himself or hurt herself at a lower court you can always substitute in a new judge you can't do that\nOn the Supreme Court there nine justices if one doesn't sit in the case then you're down to eight they don't like even numbers of justices but we'll we'll cabin uh bend over backwards in in such cases to try to undo the concern people have that's\nSuch dime store psychology is beyond my pay grade they're certainly isn't any indication in his opinions to date of a bias but you know his performance after Dr Ford testify\nTalking about how this was a vast left wing conspiracy the Clintons and all that even if he apologized for try to in the wall Street Journal op ed piece I think that in some respects\nA leaves him in an even tougher position than he might in a sexual harassment case there are a lot of cases that if they don't involve the Clinton specifically obviously they involve politics and a cabinet or you could argue showed his true\nPartition shelf in that twenty minutes of testimony I Would be justice concern in that area\nWhat kind of cases do you think that might influence\nYou could imagine campaign finance\nAppeal coming up they're going to be more of those and depending on who brings it\nYou know are are there Republican interest or their democratic interests I think even if he's not in fact biased the appearance of by a bias is a real one\nHaving settled that there are all kinds of reasons of course to criticize justice Thomas's performance on the court for the last Thirty years and I do so in my book but I'm not sure you can point to a lot of cases in the area of of\nA sexual harassment or regulation of the workplace 'em and say that Thomas ruled the way he did out of ... or bitterness from his hearings back then\nI don't know if this was after last February or not but last February there was a New York magazine cover story headlined the case for impeaching Clarence Thomas with stories of other women besides Anita Hill who\nHad stories of sexual harassment ... um regarding Clarence Thomas so it's um it's a story that keeps you know coming back to life\nIt does and some folks could argue that maybe it was silly generous it was unique and it was dated but the Kavanaugh stuff brought that all back\nTo light and as you point out now we've got two justices under a cloud separated by Thirty years that is really bad\nFor the court it's bad for the courts\nPrestige I think it helps to an end feeble Congress we have a lousy Congress for any number of reasons but one of the reasons as various congressmen and senators would tell me they don't act\nIs because they know that the justices across the street will act and I also think it it distorts presidential elections and the way that we saw in two thousand\nSixteen twenty twenty five percent of Trump voters said they didn't like Trump's temperament they didn't agree with the with a lot of what he said but they voted for him simply because of the Supreme Court\n[noise] so um it in terms of how politicized the court has become\nI'm President Trump supported Brett Kavanaugh through the hearings and front insulted Christine Blasey Ford who made the allegations of sexual assault [noise] are you concerned are their concerns out there that Kavanaugh will feel the hold and teach Trump and therefore\nPresidential campaign ... confided to a friend\nThat he was outraged by candidate Trump's attacks on Roberts Roberts in effect saying I've been a loyal Republican my whole life I worked in the Reagan Administration I helped the Bush campaign in Bush should we go or how can anybody seriously question\nMy credentials I was struck by that that the chief justice of the United states would particularly care what the presidential candidate thought because long after that candidates gone weather is elected president or not what chief justice Roberts will still be occupying the Senate seat of the marble temple and will be there for decades\nSince this is the era of the John Roberts court in two ways one is that he's the chief justice but also he is now considered to be the swing vote so he is really the most decisive factor in the court now right\nCorrect he will be the first chief justice in eighty plus years who is in the middle such as that is of the court it'll will truly be his court and he will have the potential for quote unquote greatness\nAnd he's demonstrated at his greatest moment of a court in the Obamacare ruling has he demonstrated it in any other moment\nNo [laughter] not really it may be on the margins of some rulings but the two important projects for this chief justice have been deregulating\nCampaign finance Citizens United and all that and removing\nA racial preferences from American Life whether it's in college admissions or a how the voting rights act in Nineteen sixty sixty five is applied and he firmly believes in the conservative agenda on those\nTwo issues if you look at what he's done in those areas don't confuse him\nFor a moderate he's not but I think he holds the potential\nTo apply the brakes and I think to the extent we see the court\nFurther placed into the male strum in coming years now that it's got five votes on a lot of issues I think you may see this chief justice take his views about the courts integrity and place them ahead of his own particular views on this or that issue\nJohn Roberts wrote the majority decision that gutted the voting rights act\nAnd that kind of decided in favor of voting restrictions as opposed to voting rights [noise] um so ... and future voting restrictions vote versus voting rights decisions come to the Supreme Court did you think the court will continue to vote on the side of restrictions\nWell yeah I they they gutted much of the ring writes active Nineteen sixty five but I think that's as I argue in the book that's one area where the courts adventurous him or arrogance is pronounced the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five\nUm you can like or dislike on the merits as a way to eliminate vestiges of slavery in southern states and and and other states with with discriminatory practices in voting laws and practices\nBut Congress passed a law and re upped the law uncontroversial e periodically why is it the court's role\nTo override that democratic preference why is it\nUm that those who brought the challenge against the voting rights act\nSomehow you need to have their alleged writes a vindicated by the Supreme Court instead of just relying on legislators I'm mystified by the decision but you know it's a conservative decision not John Roberts is a high mark\nSaid John Roberts was the swing vote on upholding the Affordable CARE Act and you write that\nHad to draft of his decision what what the differences between those two draft and why did he have two of them\nWe knew that Roberts from prior reporting had switched votes\nIn the Obamacare ruling in two thousand twelve and had infuriated the other conservatives on the court but I learned and reporters in the book that even though he voted initially\nIn the private conference of the justices right after the oral argument in the courtroom even though we initially voted\nTo strike down the law he immediately went back to his chambers and instructed his law clerks to draft to different opinions one that resulted in the law being struck down\nBy the second opinion that resulted in the ... being upheld biggest Roberts was betwixt and between and because of them were four justices on each side he knew\nHe was the swing vote he knew he was the decisive vote he would control the writing of of of the ruling and he wanted to see what both opinions\nLooked like and sometimes as justices will say Roberts and otherwise the opinion just doesn't right\nAnd he quickly came to the conclusion that the law ought to be upheld I think Roberts and the best\nSense of the word in a close case decided I'm going to give the benefit of the doubt to the legislature and he decided as an institutional matter\nTo strike down the Affordable CARE Act in the middle of a presidential election year would put the Supreme Court smack in the vortex of that presidential election and that would be bad for the court\nIf you're just joining us my guest is David a caplin he's

to lead and so I raised my hand\nI spoke to her about some of the optical she face when she decided to run for Congress\nWhat did trouble me and hurt me was that I was ... by the charges of identity politics throughout my campaign\nAnd it was just sort of um an assumption that my message was not appealing to or that my work had not been to the benefit of a broad and diverse coalition of many people\nAnd that was hurtful because that is a a plane out of the G O P handbook not a charge that would have expected to be lobbied against me by Democrats and certainly not people that consider

like you had to turn into an advantage in some way\nAbsolutely people said because I don't have a degree that I have no business running for office\nI left school not because I didn't know the value

millions of Americans can relate to\nAnd we need more people that are governing from a place of lived experience because these are the experiences of millions and the reason why so many policies don't work for people is because people are not at the center of those policies\n[noise] you know right now we're looking at Stacey Abrams in Georgia rates I Need to become the first black female governor

some of the hurricanes that we've ...\nDuring his presidency President Trump has gone to the side in Texas and Florida Puerto Rico and has tried to represent the country and the country's\nEmbrace of these victims at times has worked at other times it's been quite awkward particularly in Puerto Rico and then there was the quickie news conference that he had after the Charlottesville disturbance in twenty Seventeen equating or some people felt he was drawing a partner quibbling ths between some of the people who came to\nTo rally as white supremacist as white nationalist his Nazis and the people who came to protest\nThat route I think there's blame on both sides and I have no doubt about it and you don't have any doubt about it is it\nDo you think this way that Trump reacts in times of tragedy do think that that's a decision he is deliberately making about how to react or is he just someone use uncomfortable playing the role of the empathetic and solar\nIn fairness of public shows of empathy or not President Trump's strong suit he he did not promised that sort of a presidency when he ran and let's face it he has a great talent for bonding with rally audiences and it's just less

considered from NPR News I'm Ari Shapiro\nAnd I know said Chang mid term elections are less than one week away and we're going to take a look at the money that has been pouring into these races billions of dollars have been spent on advertising and most of that money is going to democratic candidates\nThe center for Responsive Politics a nonprofit that tracks campaign money projects that a total of five point two billion dollars will be spent during this entire election cycle\nThe group's executive director Sheila Krumholz joins us now to talk about how all that money is being spent welcome thank you glad to be here okay so fine point two billion how some compare to previous mid term elections spending\nThis is way up from the two thousand fourteen mid term elections so five point to this cycle versus just three point eight billion in two thousand fourteen that's at thirty five percent jump and a record and how\nIs this money getting spent TV radio Internet social media like where would you see most of the money going right now TV\nIs still tops in the most competitive races and overall kind of pulling back where we see that a almost a billion dollars has been spent already this cycle on media\nWay up from two thousand fourteen at this point in the cycle so a media uh advertising on TV for the competitive races a digital advertising across the board for all races yeah especially on Facebook\nYeah here it through the roof this year Facebook spending a yes why is that you think\nWell it was certainly a successful in the two thousand sixteen of election cycles for a lot of actors are so far I think as of today face because now to two hundred and Ninety six million dollars and uh as in terms of FCC report in digital ad spending a\nIt's one hundred and five million a with a almost ten million of that going to the presidential race so that that race has already taken off\nAnd as I said the vast bulk of all the spending is by Democrats right right you know I'm curious when you see one side vastly outspending the other side is that a sign that that site has a good shot at winning or is it more than a sign of some insecurity some lack of confidence\nI think both come into play on the one hand the Democrats are thrilled to see big numbers are in their columnist cycle and that is an asset they these candidates need money to get their message out\nOn both sides so uh that's a positive sign for the Democrats on the other hand to the degree that this money is coming from voters\nIn other states\nThat is not so helpful and election day so a there is a lot can backfire it can it can be viewed as outside meddling\nA by voters and other states that have nothing to do with the interests of the district or the state that represents people who may be energized about a candidate but are unable to help them on election day when it really counts\nSo that's one way a lot of money can backfire are there other ways for instance could spending a lot of money on ads actually annoy voters because I talked to a lot of voters who hate getting bombarded by ads could that bombardment depressed voter turnout\nCertainly some of the advertising is designed to suppress voter turnout they are in opposition to a candidate as opposed to a supporting a candidate so those are going to be a especially tiresome for the voters\nSo more money does not necessarily mean more votes\nMore money does not necessarily mean more votes on election day the candidates who has spent the most typically wins however will see this ... this year whether the Democratic a fundraising advantage\nWill help to drive down the reelection rate which has been impervious to change especially in the house races Sheila Krumholz\nIs the executive director of the center for Responsive Politics thanks very much my pleasure thank you\nFor the U.S has had three alarming incidents in a matter of days the shooting up a synagogue and Pittsburgh another at a supermarket in Louisville, Kentucky and the bomb scare suspicious packages mailed to prominent Democrats these raise the question are we entering a period of increased political violence in the country NPR's Tim Mak

differences\nAnd someone will actually say that they believe we could come to a civil war again in the United states but then she said many people back off from their initial conclusions they do say no I don't I don't really believe that will have a civil war but I find some of what I see happening\nFrightening enough to think of it that way\nModern civil conflicts don't have to involve marching

a time in which differences on policy issues did lead to violence civil protest that didn't lead to blood in the streets\nSo I Do I Believe this is possible it's part of my own life experience and the concept of a civil war\nIs seeping out into the open especially on the right the civil war and America's horizon reads the headline in last month's the American conservative and on town hall dot com a

one for the prevailing identity the sense that you can't necessarily interact or or work together with someone from a different identity group\nThat that's something we see here are you in the U.S as we look at some of the partisan political divisions\nThe way to prevent disagreements from becoming violence according to experts in civil conflict is to be more open to those with whom we disagree\nThe biggest challenge that many people have been in their own lives is really taking the first step to not when you disagree with someone to listen first that's job and again I think as you

Shapiro President Trump says he wants to force China to stop abusive trade practices by slapping tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese imports\nOne problem is that the value of China's currency has been dropping this year which is under cutting the tariffs impact NPR's Jim Zarroli explains\nPresident Trump of course likes to boast about the strong US Economy and all the good things it means for the United states\nWe are the economic envy of the entire world when I meet the leaders of countries the first thing they say invariably is Mr President so nice to meet you drink graduations around your economy\nBut the sizzling economy also means something else the U.S dollar just keeps getting\nStronger it's up against the euro the end the peso just about every major currency here is David dollar yes that is his name who was economic emissary to China in the Obama Treasury Department\nThis is actually a worldwide phenomenon the dollar is up about seven or eight percent on average against all our trading partners\nAnd the dollar is really gaining ground against China's you on a dollar would have gotten you six point to you on in late march today it gets you nearly seven it's the lowest it's been in a decade Linda Lim and economist at the University of Michigan says the drop in the yuan raises questions\nWhen you're an falls is because people are selling it and buying dollar right and so the question is why they selling it and buy dollars\nAnd Lim says there are several answers for one thing the fed is raising interest rates which makes us investments like treasury debt more lucrative so people want to buy more us assets and to do that they need dollars dollars are in demand meanwhile China's economy is slowing and so its currency is weaker\nThe strong dollar means that Americans can buy more from overseas especially from China and they are says David dollar\nSo you actually see the U.S trade deficit rising very rapidly this year trade deficits up about ten percent year on year\nThe strong dollar also has an impact on President Trump's trade agenda the president placed tariffs on Chinese goods to make the more expensive so Americans wouldn't buy as many it was a way of putting pressure on the Chinese economy but the stronger dollar then makes them cheaper says Linda Lim\nThe cameras I'll watch will increase the cost of Chinese goods in the U.S that we couldn't stay well partly counteracted\nTrump has so far imposed tariffs of ten percent on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports but the yuan has fallen that much since the spring which blunt their impact Lim says the following you on may also have another impact\nForeign companies that have been thinking about investing in China will now find a cheaper to do so\nGeneral

establishment locally or nationally I knew this would be lonely I knew it would be up hill I knew that it would be bruising\nYou mentioned the idea of having to go up against incumbents right and a democratic establishment what are some of the obstacles that people who are newer to politics are going to face especially as black women are there other kinds of aspects to running that they ... they may be locked out of either by tradition or through other factors\nWell listen I was told everything from I shouldn't be wearing my hair in twists I shouldn't wear hoops I shouldn't be as transparent about\nMy personal hardships and I think that more of us need to feel empowered to stand in our truth and chew authentically represent our lived experience when my family dealt with the stabilization and devastation of mass incarceration\nHaving a loved one that wasn't cars right on her household\nI'm having a loved one battling addiction of sexual trauma and violence and the stigma of that these are universal challenges\nSo it was the idea that you're you're very biography is the kind of thing that people might have looked at as a a disadvantage and that's the thing you felt like you had to turn into an advantage in some way\nAbsolutely people said because I don't have a degree that I have no business running for office\nI left school not because I didn't know the value of an education\nBut because my mother got sick and she lost her job and I was her caregiver in battling that pre existing condition of leukemia which ultimately took her life that is a story that millions of Americans can relate to\nAnd we need more people that are governing from a place of lived experience because these are the experiences of millions and the reason why so many policies don't work for people is because people are not at the center of those policies\n[noise] you know right now we're looking at Stacey Abrams in Georgia writes I Need to become the first black female governor there's Linda Coleman running for Congress in North Carolina why now it's been many many years where there haven't been that many women of color running what do you think is different\nWell to be clear even though we have an ad that leadership parity and gender and race black woman had been leading in faith communities and social racial gender and economic justice movements we've been on the frontline we've proven that our boats matter that our voices\nMatter and now we're proving that our leadership matter the polls that is down by Thirteen points and we won by Seventeen\nBecause we expand the electorate and ultimately you can't poll transformation and that is what does a foot in this country right now but you can't vote for the best candidate if they're not on the ballot and so more of us have to run\nI honor Pressley Boston city council thank you so much for speaking with us thank you that's a on a Presley with no Republican challenger next week she is set to become the first black woman representative in Congress from Massachusetts\nTwo studies out today raised concerns about treatment for early stage cervical cancer that had gained favor in the U.S this study is published
