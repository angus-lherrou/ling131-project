not happening and parents brand new report\nIt all started with an email from housing secretary Ben Carson telling her the employees that Suzanne Israel tough HUD assistant secretary for administration was leaving that agency to become acting inspector general at the department of interior\nThis came as a surprise to many in Washington perhaps even to the current acting inspector

the space back these are malls with four five six acres in some cases that are fully talented and there are only a limitation is available parking\nSo they're losing one anchor store but they've got others American what would they do it to share space\nWell they're likely to break it up and turn it into other specialty retail or add to their experiential opportunity in the form of added food offerings things of that sort of okay and then there are B and C malls and these are smaller these tend to be older\nIn many cases they've already lost his ears and the prognosis for these bees and sees is grim\nWhy can't they do the same thing as the ... campaign reimagining the space and out of food court or something\nThey can do it on paper but they can manage it financially because the malls volume has declined to the extent that there is no financial viability left\nWhen you talk about the triple a malls that are thriving or those congregated in a certain part of the country is there a certain type store type layout that is working for them just paint me a little bit more of a picture of what those look like\nThey're dispersed throughout the United states they straddle urban population center and heavily populated affluent suburban community [noise]\nSo they're typically the biggest shiny is penny in the marketplace is virtually every major population centers throughout the United states there is one and in some cases two of these AAA sensors that are doing fine they're fully tended to they've got lots of footsteps\nThey're still sought out as destinations by

helping NPR advance journalistic excellence in the digital age\n\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly\nOn page eight twenty three of today's Washington Post you can find the last column Jamal ... wrote before he disappeared ... went missing on October second it looks increasingly likely that his dad he reality President Trump acknowledge this afternoon\nWhich means says his editor writes in the note accompanying the column today likely marks because she'll jeeze last piece\nWell Fred Hi it runs the Post's editorial page and when I reached tired at the newspaper today he told me what happened to ... is a mystery but one that could be easily solved no need for a huge long investigation\nThe post to the reporters at the Washington Post have been out front on investigating this story in terms of trying to piece together what may have happened [noise] based on information available to you have to ask do you believe he is dead\n[noise] you know we we held onto this call him that he filed the day before he entered the consulate [noise] uh in the hopes that we could edited with him as we normally did\nAnd um we waited and waited and I think the fact that we published today [noise]\nHas kind of an acknowledgement to ourselves as well as to the world that we don't have much hope that we're going to be able to edit this one with him or that will ever be getting another call them from him from everything we know it seems as if he was a victim of a\nMonstrous crime\n[noise] going to ask about the dual role that the Washington Post\nIs playing here there is of course a firewall between the news or I'm a reporter is an editorial page but you run a firewall that's always there but in this case has it been tricky with post reporters trying to aggressively investigate what happened even as your editorial pages calling on the Trump Administration to do more to investigate what happened\nNow I don't think so I mean you know in the editorial side were often thinking positions\nI Know but is it different when it's a position on one of your\nOwn you know we are all in the post newsroom dependence side and the new side I think everybody is feeling this very personally and I think we're all determined to show that\nYou can't do this do one of ours this can't be a world where our government can lure a journalist to their own diplomatic compound in a foreign country and then if the worst is true dismembered him and have him disappear\n[laughter] you just spoke there about feeling this personally um how has his disappearance affected your team and affected you\nKnow it's it's very painful or [noise] first of all he was well loved by many people\n[noise] you know if this could happen to gym all it can happen to any journalist and pets to my mind not the kind of world any of us want to live in as diminished\nAnd that struck me about his last column that you published today one is that he thinks the post for publishing his work not only in English but in Arabic to reach obviously are Arabic speaking and reading audience I don't I Want to ask how common practice that is and why you chose to do that in his case\nBecause we see our mission as I'm presenting a range of opinions\nAcross a wide ideological diverse landscape especially in countries where people can't get it from their own media and Jamal was you know the reason he left Saudi Arabia\nWas she felt she could no longer do it at home and that a lot of people who want it to express themselves in Saudi Arabia were muzzled aren't prison\nAnd so he was willing to take some risks to do what they couldn't do and uh if we can do it in their own language as well as an English all the better he\nWrites in this last column about ah the regime in Saudi Arabia clamping down on on the Internet or do you have any way of tracking how widely read his columns have been either in English or Arabic in his home country in Saudi Arabia\nSo we have certainly seen when we translate are editorials or ... or other piece into Arabic\nWhen you get a big spike in readership from the region [noise] one of the most heartbreaking things about this is that he was a patron he supported a lot of the reforms that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia says he's four\nBut he believed that the best way to accomplish them was to allow people to debate them and uh to express opinions and I'm In the long run that's the way his country was going to succeed and I think we're trying to contribute in that same vein\nFred Hi it he's the editorial page editor of the Washington Post and a colleague of ... thank you thank you\n\nFor years there's been a debate about what to do with the aging headquarters of the FBI which happens to that across the street from President Trump's Washington hotel a newly released batch of emails indicates the president influenced a federal decision to keep the FBI on the same site\nTrump's involvement in the fate of the property is being investigated by Democrats on the house oversight committee who are concerned about possible presidential conflicts of interest NPR's Peter Overby reports\nThis all has to do with the FBI and it's old dilapidated headquarters in D.C the building sits across Pennsylvania Avenue from President Trump's hotel\nThe general services administration the federal government real estate manager plan to move the FBI to bigger facilities in Washington suburbs door zero buying a G. S. A. official explained the financial angle to a house hearing in twenty Thirteen\nWe believe that Pennsylvania avenues site has considered her potential for higher and better use than as a headquarters of the federal agency we hope to unlock that hidden value and apply it to the creation of a new facility\nIn fact Donald Trump before he was president showed an interest in developing the old FBI site but by twenty sixteen he was about to cut the ribbon at the current hotel he bragged about it on the campaign trail series in Fairfield, Connecticut\nWith building a very very complex super luxury hotels good old boy a lot of people it's almost finished as more\nAnd less winter Trump stopped the FBI's move it happened in the White House meeting with officials from the FBI and gee I say the new plan is to rebuild the old headquarters although it means moving thousands of workers elsewhere this spring TSA administrator Emily Murphy told a house committee Trump had nothing to do with the decision to rebuild\nThe the destruction that we got came from the FBI was the FBI that direct and she has asked what's requirements would be but the\nEmails released today suggest something else one G essay official referred to the project as quote a demolition new construction ... the president's instructions\nAnother referred to it as quote what ... directed everyone to do jury ... a democratic congressman from just across the Potomac in Virginia he said that redevelopment could land a competitor across the street from Trump's hotel\nA number of us thought the president had to have something to do with this pressure any\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders told the New York times that quote the president wanted to save the government money and also the FBI leadership did not want to move its headquarters Kathleen Clark is a law professor at Washington University in St Louis her specialty is governmental ethics\nThis is a problem because Trump's intervention may well have been motivated by his personal financial concerns with his own hotel\nBut he points out the president is exempt from federal ethics laws including the ban on conflict of interest\nA G is a spokeswoman said the emails were taken out of context and referred to funding issues not the location congressmen Elijah Cummings is the ranking Democrat on the house oversight committee if Democrats take the house next month Cummings is in line to become chairman\nAt this point in time Republicans will get all the negatives that are associated with the president was sure as heck my you know my going to go after the positives as well\nThe Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson isn't so sure about that\nWhen she goes to a district she is a reminder that Republicans in Congress had become is yes\nAnd voters why\nShaq and balance not serving\nDoes the president help more than he hurts it's a debate waged every mid term Trump said this week though if Republicans lose the house he doesn't bear responsibility because he's been campaigning so hard for them ...
