[noise]\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm jak sphere the small Gulf Coast community of Mexico beach may have taken the hardest hit from hurricane Michael even as rescue crews continue to search for survivors and others worked to store power there NPR's Greg Allen says the damages sobering\nMichael was the largest hurricane ever to hit this part of Florida the panhandle with a hundred and fifty five mile per hour winds and you can see the evidence everywhere here uh houses that were in under construction are now just sticks\nMany homes are missing their roofs summer missing or siding and their sides fences down most surprising things the trees trees are done everywhere crushing houses whole forest over like matchsticks\nAnd also there on the roads making it very difficult to get in and out of Mexico beach and all these other communities down here on the Florida Panhandle\nMichael is now blamed for at least half a dozen deaths across Florida Georgia and North Carolina currently a tropical storm Michael continues to roll across North Carolina and Virginia dumping heavy rain as it heads towards the ocean\nPresident Trump welcome to an all star line up with musicians to the White House today everyone from kid rock to my love of the beach boys to Sam more from the group salmon Dave gathering came as Trump signed legislation overhauling the way music as license and songwriters are compensated Sam more is that it's been a long time coming for musicians and artists\nThis was a historic moment I'm so proud of Mr Bush was when we couldn't get it done when we had moved to Obama and we couldn't get it done but we've got to do with this man [noise]\nOf the or and be hatch music modernization act to measure creates a new independent entity that will license songs to companies that play music on line the nonprofit collectible than pay songwriters its name for the return Utah Senator who is also a musician\nAnother wild day on Wall street with the Dow Jones industrial average falling more than five hundred points or two percent NPR's Scott Horsley reports President Trump is blaming the market slide on interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve\nAs stocks yo yo throughout the day White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow tried to sound reassuring he stressed the U.S economy is still in good shape but President Trump complains the Federal Reserve is quote out of control\nDespite the feds ample warnings Trump says he's been caught off guard by the pace of interest rate hikes\nI think the fed is for too stringent and they're making a mistake and is that right [noise] and it's despite that we're doing very well but it's not necessary in my opinion and I think I Know about it better than they do\nYet to hear that it's a very small community and the through the streets themselves are not too bad getting here is another matter you know we came over from Tallahassee today it should be a couple of hours my producer Becky Sullivan and I took us nine hours to get here because you just don't know what roads are open and the roads are open they're just barely open you have to drive around this round down trees\nYour power crews out and in in ... and good Samaritans doing what they can but it's still very hard slog get\nIn or out of this area when you say it took him nine hours that to drive that would normally take long\nTo ours right what about the impact on people I mean there's always with the storms some people said they rode out the storm I assume you've been out talking to them what are they saying\nYeah I mean it's a it's a tough one I talked to him a man here who stayed and he said he left in hurricane ... which was in Nineteen Ninety five and you always regretted it is so hard to get back into the community later he always worried states we stayed\nAnd he said the strong as anything he was prepared for it or at ever experienced before you know the the sound the noise the windows the walls flexing and he had a little safer and built from South in his past at one point he said it became so he's something told him that this was no longer safe\nAnd they moved to an inter a bathroom and does that happen windows shattered glass blasted and he said they certainly would have been injured that'd be the case and he has struggled to patch of his window and rode out the rest of the storm\nAnd ah today's here repairing his house with a neighbor you know I asked him if he was sorry that he said he says no he'd do it again because he says if I didn't stay there all my mature all my possessions everything will get ruined by the rain and the other stuff coming in\nAnd what about the people who did evacuate is there any kind of timeframe on when they might be able to come home [noise]\nUh no I don't know I'm not not yet as far as I Know when you arrive in Gulf a county here\nYou get an alert on your cell phone telling you that only for sponsors are allowed in the county at this point that they don't that even private even people who live here residents are not allowed back and so there's road blocks that many all the the major intersections\nAnd many many people are being turned away um it's to their frustration so it's they're worried about the safety because there are still wires down um everywhere here so it's it's it's it's safety first and it's going to be some time I think for people were allowed back\nA NPR's Greg Allen reporting in Mexico Beach Florida we hope you stay safe thanks so much you walk them\nAll right let's go to North Carolina now where people are relieved that hurricane Michael ... not as hard as they feared\nThey're still recovering from Hurricane Florence which pummeled for nearly a month ago Florence ... thousands from their homes and many are still dependent on the charity of relief groups to get by and NPR's Tom Gjelten reports and volunteers came all the way from Puerto Rico to help out\nLumberton is one of the cities in North Carolina hardest hit by Hurricane Florence social one of the poorest for many people here still need help feeding their families the parking lot behind the east Lumberton Baptist church\nThere's no occupied by a huge trailer a mobile kitchens capable of cooking Fifteen hundred hot meals for this day I mean when it comes from I guess a meal packaged to go\nTo the kitchen comes from operation blessing for Christian relief organization from Virginia\nThis trailer has been down to Beaumont, Texas has been to Florida a few times it's been to the Jersey shore printing\nBoykins is coordinating the effort\nOur mission is to be the head of the few visas we want to be able to help as many people off\nAnd be able to just go our love and care for the community everywhere we go\nBut this effort has a twist the Lumberton city manager knowing his populations needs reached out to the mayor of San Juan Puerto Rico Carmen ... Cruz asking whether she could send some people to assist the operation blessing crew Puerto Ricans were hit last year at this time by Hurricane Maria\nMayor cruise asked for volunteers and there is a five person crew from San Juan here today serving food issues floors who works for mayor crews lifted the group to lumber\nThe only right thing to do was to to to say if\nIf you have to recruit them

now and thanks so much\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I Know that ... and I'm Mary Louise Kelly we're going to talk now about the man behind a name you have been hearing a lot these last few days Jamal ... he used the Saudi journalist who walked into the Saudi consulate and assemble last week\nAnd then disappeared was never seen walking up prompting reports that he was kidnapped or maybe murdered by a hit squad flown in from Riyadh for that express purpose but who is or was ... and why would he have been seen as posing such a danger to the Saudi regime\nThat is such an extraordinary operation would have been put in motion\nOr we're going to put those questions now to ... of the Brookings Institution welcome Hi thanks for having me God have you with us All right we know some basic facts ... age fifty nine\nOr that he's an editor or that he's a critic of his government and Saudi Arabia [noise] what else should we know about him\nSo the interesting thing about him is that he wasn't always a dissident and he was actually a consummate insider with close connections to the Saudi royal court that's what makes this different this is someone who came from the inside and then decided that he could no longer support\nNew Saudi policies under a new leadership and he left Saudi Arabia in June twenty Seventeen\nHe went into exile he came to the U.S came to the U.S and started writing for the Washington Post what did he write that would have annoyed the Saudi regime so much\nSo one of his pieces that is getting a lot of attention now in retrospect he wrote in September twenty Seventeen where he basically announced his break\nWith Saudi Arabia is the factor leader Mohammed bin Salman also known as NBS the crown prince ... and he's supported the some of the general reforms that MBBS was trying to put forward including\nMore rights for women but he felt that if Saudi Arabia was going to go through a transformation that the people had to be part of the conversation and the Saudi leadership and M. B. S. in particular increasingly moved in a direction where they didn't want any questioning of this new direction\nAnd cause shaggy couldn't bring himself to agree with that and I think that he was pained\nTo have this break with the Saudi regime he didn't want it\nAs you look back over what he wrote when he did what he said over the last year or two was there a moment where it appeared he'd crossed a line on was starting to put himself into danger you know I don't know if\nWe can point to one moment but I think we can say that he had become\nThe most prominent Saudi dissident but more importantly the most prominent Saudi dissident in the west I mean the fact that he wrote regularly for the Washington Post\nThe fact that he knew many in the policy community in DC so I think he was the one person who could credibly and effectively I'm casting doubt on my ... been selling man's vision for Saudi Arabia at a time\nWhen ... says he's called was really trying to portray himself as this young reformer and the young reformer that America should hitch wagon to\nThis is interesting because because a lot of journalists have written critically about Saudi Arabia and that the direction that Mohammed bin some on is taking at what you're describing is why he might have been seen as a\nAs a more of a danger than others at that he had such a platform that he was so well connected in Washington and an outside of Saudi Arabia\nAnd he's coming from within Saudi society he knows the major players and and leaders in the Saudi royal court so it's different you know if I criticized Saudi Arabia for something that's one thing but if Jim out to shove you did that\nThen it's different because he's speaking from within the family\nDoes it strike you as puzzling though I mean the records are being stores to Turkish officials Turkish investigator saying that this team of Fifteen people flew in on private planes with the express purpose of targeting 'cause she'll get that just seems like a massive operation to take out one editor\nIt sounds so crazy that it's hard to get your head around it that Saudi Arabia would go this far to allegedly killed one of their critics\nCan you imagine that this actually happened in the way that Turkish officials say it did\nI think it's the most um persuasive and plausible scenario right now I I think many people have been waiting for the Saudis to offer evidence to the contrary they haven't but not only that they've shown I think it's surprising level of indifference is almost as if\nYou know their taunting the international community in a sense and if they really didn't do it then there's a way for them to demonstrate that but I think that the evidence is building and also sources from different intelligence agencies are moving in this\nDirection it seems that this is the most plausible scenario\nShadi Hamid thinks so much for having me and my pleasure Shadi Hamid is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution we have been talking about\nSaudi journalist and dissident Jamal ... now 'cause she'll get disappearance and possible murder is draining relations between Washington and Riyadh and it comes at a time of heightened tension between the U.S in Turkey where cars Yogi was last seen\nThe Trump Administration says it is giving the disappearance high level attention but the U.S has new and ... in either Saudi Arabia or turkey NPR's Michele Kelemen reports\nRobert Jordan was the Bush administration's ambassador to Saudi Arabia in the wake of the September eleventh attacks and he says in times like this it's crucial to have an ambassador someone who's appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate\nYou can't really deal with the highest level or governor on the ground with our and brush her there and without someone who is contrary breeding ground for American\nJordan now a diplomat in residence at Southern Methodist university says an ambassador would help coordinate us efforts on the ground in Turkey and in Saudi Arabia to find out what happened in ... and would be making clear to Saudi officials how one settling this is\nA threat to the relationship I have people watch brushing and extra ranch freelance or why ... ... the world that we're now we're\nPushing her Trump's son in law has close ties with the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman a powerful figure who's accused of being behind the disappearance of the journal that questioner is relying on Saudi help for Middle East peace plan he has yet to unveil\nFormer ambassador Jordan says it's possible that the crown prince feels emboldened by this relationship with Trump stone and loan as for the president he says he wants to get to the bottom of the good show gay situation but he's not ready to cut off lucrative arms deal\nI'm sure our listeners will see the love affair that you're having with was very much for being or you're you're taking time to talk with us today thank you

gripped Washington in the country last week it is a storm that has calmed down now Brett Kavanaugh is now justice Kavanaugh but the fallout from the bitter and divisive battle over his confirmation is still defining political conversation\nWhen Kavanaugh was sworn in President Trump apologize to the new justice for the rough confirmation process he had to go through\nThose who stepped forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation [noise] not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception is\nWhat happened to the capital of family violates

politics segment\nDo you do to do that I Am joined by Karen ... the of the Washington Post and David Brooks at the New York times thanks to both of you for coming in today the greater the here so Karen that bit of tape we just heard from President Trump talking about political and personal destruction that's\nHow some Republicans have been characterizing the opposition to Kavanaugh but\nAnother way they been describing the people who turned out to protest his by using the word mob by calling the angry left mob like Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has that the Senate Senator Marco Rubio of Florida Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa\nWhat we have or is the resist that has existed since the day after the November sixty twenty six Jeannie larger is centered right here on Capitol Hill they have encouraged mob rule\nMob rule cared was some sort of coordinated strategy this week he thinks that will Republicans who just happen to use the word mob\nWell I think they've

Hi Mary Louise so that you are you\nHas been around for a century since ah around that time of the Bolshevik Revolution but safe to say for a lot of us here in America the first time we heard about them was twenty sixteen\nThat's correct from the election hacking but these are very busy guys and girls um\nThey have been involved in this ongoing case of to G R U agents the alleged agents who were accused of poisoning Sergei Skripal and Britain he's a former G R U agent himself who had had a trade it in his wife's bop swap was living in Britain\nThe difference though this case is filled with lots of glaring almost comedic screw up some first of all screwy ball in his daughter survived the attack in March which was was clearly not the intent\nThat assassination attempts that did not manage to assassinate the two people who were being targeted go on\nThat is correct and the two suspects were seen on the security cameras which are all over Britain and then the suspects go back or back in Russia and they make this very strange appearance on on Russian television to explain what they were doing insults Barry\nBut we were so the\nSo there are just blading their explain that solved there is this beautiful town and they were just tourists and of course if you were going to to England\nYou would make a trip to solve their just see this a church tower the hundred and twenty three meters high um and then they said well it was cold and fluffy and so they turned around after a couple of days and and headed back to Russia\nOkay so fast forward to this month to October and to some equally questionable spy craft on display and then other ones\nRight and so this is sort of the follow up the Dutch announced just last week that they've caught for they say gee argue agents\nAh with high tech equipment in a rental car outside the office for the prohibition of chemical weapons which was testing the the chemicals apparently used in the attack back in March\nUm now they were caught in a rental car they apparently tried to smash some of this equipment one of the phones or was apparently traced to a G R U headquarters in Moscow has only been used a couple of days earlier even found a receipt for a taxi or from the barracks to the airport in Moscow\nIt sounds so clumsy it almost makes you wonder if they wanted to be caught or at least didn't care if they were ...\nI think what we could say is they really don't seem to care if they're caught the Russians just deny deny deny on there's no indication that they're they're stopping these kinds of actions\nBut what is the U.S trying to do to stop these kinds of actions and we keep hearing about indictments for example against Jerry you officers\nThat's right the indictments against you argue officers are seven were announced last week twelve from the Mueller investigation in July [noise] um so there is this naming and shaming and providing details it'll level we really haven't seen previously now one of the interesting developments is how to respond or two months ago President Trump has signed a directive\nThat would streamline the ability of a U.S agencies to to take action so this is something to look forward to do see if this deters the Russians in any way\nNPR's Greg Myre thank you thank you turns out that the two Russian operatives behind the u._k. nerve agent attacks have their identities blown up by a team of Internet researchers NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has the story of who they are and how they get it\nOkay so here's the one thing you need to know for this story everything is on the Internet\nA problem is is that there is no to that conclusion of the in the Russian state was ... for your time to move to\nBack in September British authorities held a press conference they released passport photos of names used by two men and they believe tried to kill a former Russian spy with nerve agent\nIs likely so they would ... raises some visa ...\nA guy like Eric polar that sounded like a challenge towler works for a group called spelling kept\nHis job is so unusual even he doesn't know how to describe it something like digital researcher digital investigator digital something probably works polar and his friends are very very good at finding all kinds of things on line they've used commercial satellite images to track Chinese air bases watch security\n... fold on social media in Venezuela pinpointed the locations of chemical weapons attacks in Syria the true identity of a Russian spy\nIt's tough because this guy's you know military intelligence officer so it's not going to be easy to find this guy just on Facebook but\nRemember everything is on the Internet these days including photos of a military academy the trains intelligence officers taken by Russian tourists [noise]\nWhen you look at these photos on there on our on our website and it's just a bunch of Russia and just random Russian guys going through and kind of fight saying if it's like military academy\nThese tourists visit the academy and one thing they like photographing is it's wall of fame with pictures of notable graduates\nThis was a year before the poisoning some totally random innocuous normal Russian person uploaded photos shows are boy ... 'em up on the wall\nColonel ... the spitting image of demand and the photo released by the British right there on the wall with his name's spelled out for all to see and bell and cat turned up a lot more it turns out if you're willing to risk getting a nasty computer virus you can download all sorts of Russian databases\nThings like insurance databases um driver's licenses voter database and things like this is one hundred percent legal but it's out there\nIn in those databases they've found a way more photos and details about their ... old phone numbers and addresses including one that linked him to a local military intelligence headquarters\nThis week they also id topeka's fellows by a guy they think is named Aleksandr Michigan Michigan came from a small town in Russia as far north once they found them deli cat worked with Russian journalists to send someone up there and they\nHad a picture and are showing around people in the town they're like oh yeah that that's our you know that ... that ... in short in Russia in ... Michigan over there he's a good ... good boy he's a good lead his grandma Ninety two year old grandma always shows us a photo of him receiving a metal ... and\nRussian President Vladimir Putin probably didn't give me skin metal for being such a great grandson\nNow and get past ten fulltime researchers scattered across the globe toilet works out of Kansas City others are in the u._k. the Netherlands and elsewhere they say they're funded by a combination of grant money money from classes they run crusty on treatment is another member of the group\nWe firmly believe is so important the more people are aware of how to do this kind of things and most of the times it's not too hard\nI caught up with him and told her during a training they were doing near Washington DC\nToday where to start with how to use the term is approximately or exactly when a photograph of video was taking\nThe students include journalists law enforcement types human rights workers ... says getting a lot more people to do this stuff is what ... is all about the name ... comes from one of these apps fables about a group of mice who decided to put a bell on a stealthy cats in order to expose its presence\n... says that's how they see this new kind of work\nIn his front yard a red and white yard sign reads jobs matter vote no on one twelve\nAbout it in part works out my phone and from work\nAnd so what if this were\nA yard sign doesn't scare off Theresa Gilbert and she goes door to door in the neighborhood what would you do I'm just curious\nWould I Would do so\nAnd the decline into which for competition will be higher\nWould you do do you have other than others will subside surveying that you\nAre playing bass but it doesn't pay very [laughter] that's on the little girl [laughter] that's right [noise]\nTheresa Gilbert moved on to find a voter who hasn't yet made up their mind both groups are trying to connect with as many undecided voters as they can before election day I'm Grace hood CPR news\nWe're taking a quick break from all things considered to ask for your support\nFor reporting like you just heard from Grace Hood go to C.

thoughts and prayers it's making a difference\nTo the way I understand you you've learned about the extensive damage to jinx middle school when you were watching the news six hours away\nYes um that's how I learned about it actually I came across the footage and thoughts and and it was just heart wrenching\nTell me about those images when you were first discovering the scale of the damage teachings middle school\nYeah well you know looking at the gym and what I Know is that Jim is so symbolic because we do everything from having athletic advanced graduations that take place in the gym and our kids actually go there every morning it's where they\nWere they gather with their ... their friends and and they talk and socialize before they go to class so for me\nI think about my kids you know and and you wonder what does that sense of security that's now ripped away\nHave you been able to reach out to any of the students and staff to see how they're doing\nFortunately we've been able to get in touch with about eighty percent of our people and they're all doing well we don't have any known loss of life or injury or something like that so from that standpoint that's good we also know from I Know from talking to people that I have like a coach gain or who is\nMy uh basketball coach just thirty minutes before this interview I had to call and I'm found out he's lost\nEverything there's always been destroyed and so it's gosh we're having to rebuild everything\nI understand that there's a lesson already within your student body edging middle school you have a few students from

them we have several that have stayed but what we are able to do was to take that lesson of what those kits where Ruth and just say you know what look how they dealt with the situation look how

early right now to say if you have any idea yet when your school might be able to reopen\nIts too early to know when it will be open um we feel good about the individual classrooms because we do have hurricane shutters butter up what we don't know is about the roof and some other things we lost all of our portable classrooms are are damaged but the bigger issue in the bigger problem are being able to make certain that we have electricity being able to have\nRunning water sewage all of those things and then in addition to being able to have people that are still there I'm concerned about kids
