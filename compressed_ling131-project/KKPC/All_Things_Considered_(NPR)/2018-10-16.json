fact that we don't just have those people suffering death threats having to move out of their homes\nOn but we also have other politicians calling on people who might differ with on policy to be

match [noise]\n\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Ari Shapiro\nAnd I'm Mary Louise Kelly President Trump is tweeting that he talk today with Saudi Arabia's crown prince about the death of journalists ... who disappeared after entering the shouting consulate in Istanbul Trump says the crown prince totally denied any knowledge of what happened and promise to a full investigation\nTrump separately has suggested rogue killers might be to blame\nTo understand how autocratic countries like Saudi Arabia interpret these remarks we called up tomorrow Kaufman with us she served at the state department under President Obama and is now with Brookings she says Trump is following through on a position he took more than a year ago\nOn his first foreign trip when he went to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia he said explicitly we're not here to lecture we're not here to tell other people how to live what to do who to be or how to worship\nAnd that statement sets aside decades' worth of bipartisan American commitments as well as the commitment of a range of western democracies to international human rights law\nBeyond Saudi Arabia or do you see a link between President Trump's America First transaction based approach to international affairs and the actions of dictators overseas\nI think if I were a dictator especially one with a decent relationship with Washington a cooperative partnership with Washington and I heard the American president say that he's not here to lecture me I Would certainly take that as an understanding that no matter what I might do at home I shouldn't expect\nAny direct consequences in my relationship with Washington if you take for example Philippine president ... uh who has picked up President Trump's phrase allergy about fake news and it's also engaged in a raft of extrajudicial killings\nOf political opponents as well as a drug dealers\nThere is a lot of reason to be concerned that when President Trump goes on TV and is asked about a ... attempted murder of journalists and says well we killed people to that that's going to lead someone like president to ... think that he can get away with doing the same thing\nThere were lots of instances during the Obama administration where the president condemned the actions of foreign leaders whether that was let them you're putting in Russia or Bashar will also in Syria and it didn't do much to deter them so is it really possible to say that this is happening more because President Trump is an office\nI think they're both direct and indirect ways in which President Trump's ... attitude about human rights and democracy it translates into behavior abroad\nThe first of course is if dictators feel like they had a green light from the American president and that's pretty rare but the United states doesn't always criticized directly or one on one sometimes it works together with other western governments\nAnd they all do a day marched together or they issue simultaneous statements so that no one government gets the backlash all by itself\nAnd when the Trump Administration takes the United states out of that coalition\nIt did churches other western governments from speaking up as well\nOh so you're saying it's not just that the U.S is giving an implicit green light to these dictators but it's undermining the international alliances that used to speak with one strong voice against the actions of those leaders\nAbsolutely it is creating a more permissive environment by deterring other governments from speaking out\nAnd there's another way in which the withdrawal of that strong American voice on behalf of human rights and democracy makes a difference which is that all over the world you have\nCivil society leaders pressing their own government for transparency and accountability you have political opposition leaders are demanding a change in autocratic societies and they do their work and the knowledge that\nOther governments out there in the world that are committed to human rights are looking out for them a little bit and we'll speak up if something happens to them so we're not voice from Washington it's still\nAll those vulnerable people the ones who rely the most on this international human rights coalition are deterred from doing their work\nTomorrow Kaufman with us was deputy assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs during the Obama administration and she's now with the Brookings Institution thanks very much my pleasure Ari\nThan Marcus here of Colorado Public radio I Do think that one of the measures of a great state a great city is the quality of independence of its news how can people make informed decisions otherwise\nThe Denver ballot will have twenty two questions on it\nI think the news and information and quality news and information is hugely important especially to our democracy here you keep that going with a gift to CPR dot org do it right now one eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty I'd been Marcus across the table for me as producer John\n... it's a pleasure to be here and uh it's an honor to ask you to join us joined this community of support that makes this\nKind of journalism possible because um\nIf you are listening now I I'm pretty confident you understand the value of this kind of journalism\nAnd frankly I don't think we have to work too hard to ask you to uh to put a dollar figure to it you know how about five dollars a month does that work\nWould you pay five dollars a month to stay informed about what's going on in the world to hear from a thoughtful people talking to each other about today's events as opposed to yelling at each other about those events\nIf that's worth something to you now is the time to step up and be a part of it CPR

be bad but he also tweeted that he talked with the crown prince who quote totally denied any knowledge of what took place inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nTrump tweeted that he had no financial interests in Saudi Arabia that may be true but in the past he's boasted about how much Saudi money comes to him in the U.S\nIn twenty Fifteen he said of the Saudis quote they buy apartments for me they spent forty million Fifteen million am I supposed to dislike them I like them very much meanwhile there are bipartisan calls in Congress for sanctions against Saudi Arabia Mara Liasson NPR News

believe you use and shooting the police solves\nEr at talk about the substance what did they say to each other in these direct and candid talks\nWell they've the U.S officials have said very little about that I mean they say that Trump sent Palmdale here to convey the message that it's really important for the Saudis to conduct a thorough transparent investigation into the disappearance of this Washington Post columnist\nUm U.S officials haven't weighed in about all of these reports\nIn the news at the Saudis are now portraying this is like an interrogation gone horribly wrong\nWe don't know exactly how the Saudis have been spinning this with ... in private or if he believes them but we do know that President Trump seems to at least according to his Twitter feed Trump says he spoke by phone to the ground brands who is with pomp E.O at the time and he says\nThat the crown prince and this is the quote on Twitter totally denied any knowledge of what took place in the consulate\n[noise] it does seem as though Pompeo has been sent to walk this really fine line President Trump is threatened severe punishment his words to whoever's responsible for ... disappearance maybe murder but but there's also a lot more at stake here in the in the wider us Saudi relationship\nYeah and in this country Mary Louise is is really key to the Mideast strategy of the Trump Administration there are big us arms deals\nAt stake these are U.S policy on Iran is is a vital here the sanctions are going back into force and the the us needs the Saudis\nTo keep the oil market stable um and then on the other hand the administration is facing a lot of pressure from Congress members of Congress are outraged over this apparent murder in the ... and his stumble and over the Saudi conduct in the war in Yemen so I think you're totally right there the administration is trying to walk this very fine line\nA secretary Pompeo was headed next ah which means you're headed next to the capital of turkey to Ankara what's the agenda there\nWell he's going to be meeting with the um foreign minister there obviously turkey is also really important ally in a country that wants to get to the bottom of this do I'm ... I'm In turkey today we're searching the Saudi conflict and they found evidence that this Saudi um\nJournalists was killed there um so it it's going to be to follow up on those investigation That's NPR's\nMichele Kelemen reporting from Saudi Arabia\nIs not just governments figuring out how to deal with Saudi Arabia Israel and the suspect to death of ... major corporations are distancing themselves from my kingdom top executives have pulled out of an investment conference scheduled to take place in Riyadh next week they include leaders of J. P. Morgan and Ford\nAndrew Ross Sorkin is the New York times also plans to attend and moderate panels not only did he pull out he was also now reporting on how CEOs made the decision to withdraw from the Saudi conference and he joins us now welcome thank you for having me you say this incident is forcing business executives to become reluctant statesmen why reluctant well I think\nThat over the past year or two really under the Trump Administration CEOs have been forced into these uncomfortable positions of having to speak out on moral issues this conference in Riyadh known as ... in the desert has become a crucible of sorts\nFor so many CEOs over the past week and all of it being done without really direction from Washington I'm ... Stephen ... is still going\nCEOs have been left to make these hard decisions what's on the line for the CEOs wise at such a hard decision\nUm the Saudis look at attendance of something like this as a show of faith in their country as a show of loyalty\nAnd so the idea that somebody like Jimmy ... would decide not to attend really puts potentially the employees the business at risk real profits\nYou report on the actual phone calls were the CEO's were making these decisions over the weekend what went into\nTheir ultimate decision to pull out of this conference I think for most of them this reported murder was one step too far you have customers knew so much more about what's happening in real time reacting providing feedback to executives on these issues in a way that they did\nSo in the same way that consumers might expect executives to take a position on immigration or same sex marriage you're saying there could be consequences if they did not take a position on this issue\nAbsolutely in particular the view is that over the past two years and again I Do think it goes back to this particular\nAdministration these executives have come out so forcefully taking a moral position whether it was on Charlottesville whether it was on immigration what there was on the Paris climate accord they felt compelled to do those things\nAs you know the news cycle moves fast and memories are short do you think this will have long term consequences or is it pretty quickly just going to get washed downstream and things will go back to normal\nI think for some of these companies frankly I think they're going to be real implications for their business Richard Branson had announced last week but she was going to step away from Saudi Arabia literally this afternoon the Saudis are canceling\nThe virgin hyper loop infrastructure project that they put together in retaliation you know after what might have been described as a skirmish between Canada\nAnd Saudi Arabia over the summer the Saudis literally told their financial in investment managers to sell all of their investments in stakes in Canadian companies as retribution for what they saw as a hostile ACT UP when the Canadians criticized the country for\nSome human rights related issues\nAndrew Ross Sorkin writes the ... column for the New York times thanks for joining us and driving me\n[noise] [noise] ...

also crashed right into the middle of too hotly contested political races Florida is of course a swing state and a critical one\nAnd candidates vying for the governor's seat and a U.S Senate seat were quick to jump into relief efforts here's Democrat Andrew Gillum he's running for governor and wielding a chainsaw to help clear fallen trees\nLiving up\nThere meanwhile Harris's opponent this is Republican Ron dissent is on his way to the panhandle to help out all in tears\nYou know why why are we are so much for\nFolks in northwest Florida need you well let me bring in Steve ... years the Tallahassee bureau chief for the Tampa Bay times he has been out and about today covering current governor Rick Scott a seemed ... welcome to the program\nHow much does hurricane Michael shaken up these two big races\nIt's had a major effect and the governor's race in the race for the United States Senate because the Democratic candidate for governor is the mayor of Tallahassee which got hit hard by the storm and the leading Republican candidate for the U.S Senate Rick Scott sitting governor is a it pressed into his other role as commander in chief in an emergency\nTo sort of a help this state recover\nTell me a little bit more about how the candidates have adjusted what they're doing we heard a little bit there from the gubernatorial candidates out on the campaign trail meanwhile Rick Scott who as I mentioned is currently governor he's running to be senator I hear he has turned his campaign over to his wife at least temporarily so that he can focus on cleaning up after the hurricane\nThat's correct Rick Scott has suspended campaigning\nAnd his wife first lady and Scott who is really not had much of a profile as first lady has stepped into the role that's very unusual and I just left Scott in Gadsden county which is the next county west of Tallahassee\nRick Scott though he's not formally campaigning he was listening a post for people's concerns about storm problems but everyone wanted to have their picture taken with the governor everyone wanted to shake his hand\nThe point I'm making is you can't ever completely separate governing from campaign\nLet me ask you one practical question early voting in some of the hardest hit parts of Florida is supposed to begin at the end of this month October twenty sevens are those polling places likely to be up and running\nNot in a place like bay county which is the hardest hit comedy of the ball and which is by the way the biggest county in the hurricane zone there are scrambling and I've talked to elections supervisors who are asking governor Scott's issue an executive order that would dramatically reduce the number of voting locations\nSo that you have these super voting centers maybe every five or ten miles people would have to travel further to vote but everyone's vote would be protected\nHas hurricane changed the issues that voters say they want to vote on them and I'm thinking of climate change which is not often mentioned first and foremost among things that drive people to the polls that hurricane Michael ... was in part the intensity was impacted by warmer waters which is of course linked to climate change\nI'm skeptical of whether that's going to be elevated as a major issue up throughout this campaign for both governor and US Senate\nDespite all the problems we've had here with red tide and the algae and sea level rise environmental issues are not polling nearly as importantly as health care and education and the economy what a hurricane does to alter the dynamics of politics and campaigning is getting reinforces\nTo people that without government you have nothing in a in an emergency you know everyone's asking where's FEMA everyone's asking you know we're first responders are and they're grateful for the help they are getting from first responders but everywhere you look you see the hand of government finally give people hope\nSteve ... he's Tallahassee bureau chief for the Tampa Bay times talking about the impact of hurricane Michael on politics in Florida State by state thanks so much thanks very well he's\nRight I can live in Lakewood, Colorado I recently
