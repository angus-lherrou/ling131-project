Robert hours became quieter more isolated\nAnd then in high school eventually just disappear and it's not clear if she graduated and it's not clear to this man what happened after that\nPaint a picture for us of his life at this apartment complex the man you portraying your reporting almost seems like a dose like he's not even there\nYeah um so he lived in is sort of low slung apartment building that twenty five minutes south of Chicago\nAnd the people they're sort of described him as so unremarkable that they didn't even remember his name [noise] and that he was pretty much a ghost he would come and go and sometimes disappear for days comeback go inside and that was pretty much it\n[noise] and there's such a contrast between vet demeanor in person and who he was on line tells about the person he was on social media\nYeah so at least in the last year she spent a lot of time on the Internet and he\nNeeded a lot of really terrible things about\nJews about immigrants he was clearly very angry and he seemed to find a like mine get community on Gabrielle media network that has become more popular\nAmong All right activists among white nationalist people whose views are unwelcome in places like Twitter and Facebook even the president and didn't escape his\nAnger and he's insisting that the president had not gone far enough in completing the goals that Mr Bowers\nAnd can you tell whether those online communities shaped informed his hateful views or whether he just found a home for those pre existing beliefs when he joined these communities\nI don't think that we know enough yet to see that I think the ban is one of the things that he's going to come out over the next couple of weeks and then a couple of months as investigators going into his past\nWhat else are you still hoping to learn about him and his motives\nI mean we would certainly like to know more about how did he become as hateful as he did and how long has that been going on and what role to the Internet playing [noise] did the current sort of political anger and conflict plane uh so\nI Know that investigators are going to be going through his computer files are going to be going through\nWhole they're going to be talking to folks who know him who might have worked with in family members friends\nI kind of thing but Julie ... of the New York times who's been reporting on the background of Robert Bowers the accused synagogue shooter thank you very much\nThank you President Trump will travel to Pittsburgh tomorrow\nAt today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and set the hatred stop\nCritics of the president said his campaign rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd fears I used to Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey there hello so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blamed the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage and the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media beers responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media\nUh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on this rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week out what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent this is who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the solar and cheap or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy\nUh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using just belittling nickname for her\nJob [noise] I guess she doesn't have any of this but I Am more than she does and I have none\nAnd says that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price as the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling him with the without evidence\nIn many ways like you said this is what his supporters like we expect from him but what his critics argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're bad on taxes or something like that is that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences be in the mid term what difference might the president's rhetoric mc\n... it's very hard to tell A People's views the Trump are as seemed to be pretty hard and at this point so\nIt will you really don't know whether this is going to change any votes or the risk of courses that maybe some lukewarm votes supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponents to get really fired up but we'll just have to see what happens next week\nThat's NPR White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe reporting from the White House thinks Asia thank you\nBut the real work was here inside or office\nSaid almost feels like a FISA statement for the ...\nIt is actually and I put that in because I didn't quite trust of the reader to get it ...\nYou know those two paragraphs or a marker for the reader saying look guys this is where the real story is I Know that is true of the novel is that really true in life it's hard to imagine that the trails and affairs cannot actually be what's important to whether a marriage lives or dies [noise]\nI have to say that in the long run they don't matter the stuff that happens outside the office doesn't matter and and I can tell you that by analogy\nSo what happens in really good marriage counseling the marriage counseling illustrated in this book\nIs that by the end of the process when you really begin to get it when you can actually understand for the first time in your life or your partner is really saying to you you feel like a new person it's as if you shed everything that happened before\nRight I mean so if you had an affair before it's as if it happened to a different person that doesn't count anymore you're you're new does that make any sense\nIt does and it makes it sound like the marriage counseling is about much more than marriage about real transformation of each individual\nIt has to be it absolutely has to be\nAnd that's why it takes time because it's it is not some kind of blinding insight that you're going to have oh God this happened to be and I was fourteen now we understand it I'll be different it's not about that at all\nIt's about learning lessons that you should have learned when you were growing up maybe by watching your parents but your parents didn't habits together they weren't didn't have a great marriage\nIt's about learning these lessons of how\nYou can relate to the other person how you can understand what they're thinking and you have to practice you have to practice it again and again and that's that's what a couple of dozen this book there are certain little things that the marriage cancer leads them through for example throughout the book to show stopping to say I want you to look at each other and told me what you see\nAnd as you read the book you'll see that they see more as they learn more until they're really can see the other person in a in a deep and meaningful way\n[noise] I said that we only me three characters in this book which is not exactly true because the way you right that's right it really is sort of a fourth character there is which is the marriage itself it's the marriage itself\nAnd the marriage scouts are actually sees the marriage as a distinct and real character\nShe's actually listening to the marriage as the marriage changes in the office\nAnd she's trying to get the couple to be able to do that as well to see their marriage as\nAs something that they built over time that's very important and its allies in a way this different from each of the\nMarriage rates have been going down for decades according to the Pew Research center today just about half of adults are married down from about Seventy five percent in the sixties your book is clearly pro marriage why do you think this institution still matters\nWell I mean you're absolutely right in my book is pro marriage um but it's not pro marriage in any kind of\nTransnational sense that we have to have marriage is pro an important relationship because it makes your life so much better\nYou know I mean there's a reason that everybody wants to have a relationship it's like the two of you individually are one thing but if you can get it together you literally become more than the two of you if you can if you can create a important fulfilling relationship together do you think\nEvery marriage could benefit from a good marriage counselor or is it really just sort of for people in crisis and dysfunction\nOkay I I think that every marriage could benefit from a good marriage counselor you know you may not have to go for four years [noise] but I think that um you can really learn a lot I don't think you should settle for a marriage that just you know is okay\nI mean it's it's the critical thing in your life you want to marriage that's wonderful you want to marriage that that you can feel and talk to and that gives it back to you [noise]\nWell ... thank you so much for talking with us about your book

who's in charge of northern command\nWe know border security as national security and the U.S military will advance DVDs capability to harden the border\nNPR's Tom Bowman is at the Pentagon and he joins me now Hey Tom hey Mary Louise so they're already something like two thousand National Guard troops deployed to the border right is this fifty two hundred active duty on top of those exist in two thousand\n[noise] uh this goes beyond the two thousand and those guard troops are providing support duty such as transportation aerial surveillance that kind of thing\nAnd the guard is not taking part in any law enforcement activities and these additional five thousand or so active duty army troops will also be in a support role again no law enforcement activity no interacting with migrants we're told\nBut this new group of soldiers will provide more support to border patrol of firsts fill a ... bill do what's called hardening border entry points in California Arizona and Texas ... barriers more razor wire fencing you're crossing points\nAnd they'll also transport border agents used more remote locations by cargo aircraft and helicopter dissolves through a surge by the way of hundreds of additional border agents so\nThese soldiers were also builds camps provide housing medical assistance camp kitchens for these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all legal there's a law called ... which prohibits military forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders of the U.S this is this is all legit\nIt well ... that's where the fish will say they made clear these troops will not take part in any law enforcement duties ah they're only to support role again\nAnd the plus he ... his law dates for the post civil war era in the Eighteen Seventy isn't that was a reaction to federal troops being used and former Confederate States and that law prohibits the military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not are going to have contact with migrants will they be armed\nWell some of them will be armed do they say

fifty six year olds who are say oc could spend decades behind bars if he's convicted\nDanny Rivera from member station WNPR in was in the courtroom and joins us from Miami Hi Danny hey I Know this a court appearance was largely procedural tell us what happened in court this afternoon\nYeah it was really like you said mostly procedural there wasn't a whole lot of you know guilt or innocence talk I'm basically say up was formally charged on five counts of federal crimes ranging from threatening former presidents\nTo illegal mailings of explosives um remember he was arrested near Miami last friday he'd been driving a white van plastered with anti democratic pro Trump's and anti media stickers and he'd apparently been living out of that band for we don't know exactly how long but for some time\nI'm In court today prosecutors basically said they don't want him to have the option of bail because they consider him a flight risk and danger to other people in the community what was his demeanor\nSo before the the hearing actually got started he was talking with his attorneys and he was wearing a he was he was shackled at the wrists and ankles and he was wearing a tan\nJumpsuit he didn't say much um but when he talked he did sound kind of defeated you could hear his his you could barely actually hear his voice at all it was it was quite raspy\n'em before the the proceedings you could I caught a glimpse of him tearing up and looked like his his attorneys kind of gathered around to to shield him from from the view once that started happening\nUm that the judge asked the misuse of questions you know do you understand the charges brought against you if you just kind of nodded I mean he looked\nYou could see he was upset at some point you know his face kind of turn red who's cheering up his upper lip was quivering um he he didn't look like he was doing too well and\nAnd this was all taking place in southern Florida which is not where's trials going to take place explained that\nYeah so the charges were actually filed in the southern district of New York he was arrested in in my close to Miami so that's where the the original hearing is taking place but he will at some point be taken up to to New York\nOr the U.S attorney there is the one prosecuting the case of many of the package bombs\nWere mailed there in that office has a long history of prosecuting these kinds of crimes\nThe trial itself I wouldn't bet on it happening anytime soon these cases tend to take years or even longer to go to to to trial if there is no plea deal\nIn the meantime the next hearing the the judge said it's going to be on friday here in Miami so he'll be you're here at least until then and at that point we'll learn whether he'll be recently released on bail or if he's going to be transferred up to New York for for more hearings\nRight that is Danny Rivera reporter with member station WFCR in in South\nThanks very much standing in front of me we're going to take the next few minutes to remember to be eleven people killed at the tree of life synagogue on Saturday\nTwo brothers inseparable and devoted to their synagogue she saw and David Rosenthal she saw was fifty nine five years older than David the brothers live together in a community home in Pittsburgh run by achiever that's an organization that helps people with disabilities\n... is vice president of residential supports with achiever and she joins me now via Skype to remember the Rosenthal brothers a crush of welcome and I'm On my condolences on your last I'm so sorry\nOh thank you very much we appreciate that\nDescribe she so and David for me what were they like\nDavid and see so we're larger than life\nThey were two of the most kind generous people they were selling climbed into the fabric of their community they loved to rock all through his ... hell they would stop and talk to everyone and anyone\nAnd I read that she had an official rule he was a greeter at the synagogue\nYes stay still was not only a greeter at the synagogue but I Would refer to him as the ambassador to squirrel hill he was always hello how are you\nDavid Was a very reserved person but as soon as you said hello today that he just opened up they were so close to their family David would call his mother every single day when he got home from work\nThey got up with a positive attitude\nHow's your family how're you doing what's your day look right for it today less things for you today and they threw parties for everything and in fact one time they had their bathrooms remodeled in their home and they wanted to throw a party for remodeling bathrooms\n[laughter] trying to imagine that one and and and then\nThere was a next door neighbor where they had their house remodeled and they were going to put it on the market and they went to the open house because they wanted to be a part of that yeah\nWhat kind of work to do do you describe them coming home from work\nDavid Was working for good well and cleaning and see if there was about to start a job two days a week and a family owned business\nHas it taken a toll on your staff who worked with them and help them for for all these years\nYes soon runs them at such an early\nAge excuse and they and they are such a vital part of their family our family so it is extremely difficult now\nI'm so sorry part of what also must be difficult is letting all your other clients all the other people who rely on achieve a no how are you talking them through this\n[noise] myself and another staff member went out yesterday to me with housemates and people who knew down to offer them and\nExplanation as best we can about the events of Saturday and to offer any support we are also going to offer people kind of a service where people can come and share their memories and their failings\nThrough your planning some kind of gathering within your organization to honor and remember them absolutely and it sounds like these are two brothers who like to party who would have appreciated that gesture and been right there in the mix\nI think that is exactly correct I think that on Saturdays you could have counted them to be where they were\nThat's where they wanted to have been the best way that we can remember them an honor then is to know that they live their life well\nAnybody you talked to in ... near them they were well respected in their church and their family is absolutely fantastic and\nIt's one of the best situations that could ever be\nThat's crucial with achiever talking about David and sea salt Rosenthal the brothers were killed
