NPR News Washington\nA week after the Trump Administration asked a judge to reject a draft planned reform Chicago's twelve thousand officer police force attorney general Jeff Sessions is saying the kind of reforms being discussed will create a surgeon violent crime there\nThose reforms include limiting please use of deadly force sessions says bringing the department under close federal supervision is not the way to go micromanage\nThing this E. P. D. through a federal court order is justified really as an insult to the farm\nFrom you know from that point states could take a look at it and make a decision as to how to proceed and there would be any number of options available to them whether its diplomatic penalties penalties and international organizations\nOr or other kinds of outcomes but but there's nothing binding and I'm not talking about are beautiful but we are talking about a credible international investigation that's David Cay thank you thank you\n\nPresident Trump is campaigning in Arizona tonight the trip is part of a western swing to rally Republican voters head of the midterm elections which are now just over two weeks away last night in Montana he distilled the Republican closing argument heading into the mid term elections to this\nI Know a lot [noise] of job at all\nThe power of the law and order and common sense that's what it's going to be\nThe caravan he's talking about is a group of migrants trying to reach the U.S border it's now big feature in his stump speech and joined us now to talk about all this is NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith hate him high so why I'm Talking about another caravan at a political rally think well\nThis is not the first time he has talked about caravans he talked about a different caravan back in April\nA this is a new one um and it's getting a lot of attention on cable news and so he is talking about it again he suggested that rally that without offering any evidence um he made a claim that at Democrats were somehow behind the caravan\nWhat they wanted a jar of in and there are those the say the caravan didn't just happens it didn't just happen a lot of reasons Jarvis four thousand people but I just want to thank the Mexican government because they're stopping it hopefully be bored ever [noise]\nWe should underscore that there's really no evidence to back up this conspiracy theory that that he's been able to offer but you know the reason that he is talking about this and talking about illegal immigration is that it's something that gets his supporters animated\nYou know they are still at these rallies chanting build the wall almost every ... every time he's out there so basically this is just an effort to rally the Republican base to get out and vote yeah and the evidence is that it's a winning issue a there are two new polls from ... that are out\nAt the find that illegal immigration is an incredibly salient issue among those who plan to vote Republican in the upcoming elections asked about twenty different issues facing the country and those supporting Republicans intimate terms\nUh Seventy five percent of them say that they consider illegal immigration to be a very big issue Jocelyn Kiley is associate director of research at the Pew Research center you can see that\nAh there's energy a among Republican voters around the issue of immigration and that energy is most pronounced uh within the set of Republican voters who are really focused on border security and law enforcement\nAnd so how do we know this is a base play illegal immigration in the way that President Trump talks about it is simply not a priority issue in the same way for Democrats or independent voters as it is for Republican voter voters and for Republican voters and she says it it can be a powerful motivator\nI think what this election supposed to be about the Republicans tax cut which\nWas one of the president's biggest accomplishments why is he talking so much about immigration specifically now yeah and immigration is an area where he hasn't accomplished as much as he would want to border crossings are apparently up\nA and a and you know it it's just he hasn't gotten the wall for instance a but it worked for him last time I he feels that this is an issue that works for him he thinks talking about illegal immigration is one of the reasons that he's president of the United\nStates now as NPR's him if he thinks stamp your awesome\n\nYou know you need a certain order in in your home you know the issues that came with the wall you know building a wall doesn't get any of it is a good idea\nBecause I just installed not even two weeks ago a security door on my door I already have a door but I Would have better doors when you're a ... year old son he's fourteen years old and it's funny that he told me somehow that door makes me feel safer it made me think you know that you know it does make sense more more metal their keeps\nThe worst people out you know\nBut still not side and within seconds you'll run into people who vehemently disagree with parents like evil Hernandez a truck driver who says immigration is the deal breaker the reason most Latinos will never vote Republican\nYou heard of the news they're coming up with all these laws that make it more difficult for people for any country in the world to uh you can either settle you've seen the kid's been separated from the families of the water I think all that reflects pretty bad on the Republican Party you ask me\nI mean ... all that you know Trump and his agenda\nThere is reason Hernandez has view may not be worrying Republicans right now\nRepublicans are banking on two things\nJust ... heads the Latino public policy center at Arizona State university\nAre banking on that there's enough white voters to do when the election today and their banking that there's going to be short memory for Latino voters tomorrow\nBut Garcia says data don't lie Latinos will turn Arizona majority minority by twenty thirty and a whole lot of them are going to be us\nMeanwhile two major hospitals in Panama City still are admitting patients on the emergency room services are available as teams provide care intense set up outside those

considered from NPR News I'm off the tank and I'm Mary Louise Kelly after Seventeen Days of uncertainty there is confirmation tonight\nFrom Saudi Arabia that Washington Post journalist ... ... ... is dead the report came from Saudi state TV and the Saudi kingdom is expressing quote deep regret over his death\nSeventy prosecutors say they believe a fight broke out between ... and people who met him at the consulate in assemble that fight they say led to his death\nEighteen Saudi nationals have been detained and the number two of the Saudi intelligence services has been fired the White House meanwhile has released a statement saying the Trump Administration is saddened and that they will continue to follow international investigations\nOh we're going to talk to these developments in our regular week in politics segment with EJ do you own of the Washington Post EJ\nHey great to be with you and breathe painting of the federal is welcome to you high [noise] let me ask just for an initial reaction from you both in and how you're thinking about squaring the account\nPut out tonight by the Saudis with the account put out by the Saudis rate after 'cause she'll do disappeared which was that he left the consulate walked away alive and well free\nYeah I mean I think that their explanation here that he got into a fight is paper thin at best\nAnd I think going forward we need to definitely proceed with caution there's a lot of questions that remain unanswered here right what exactly happened inside the conflict and doesn't match up with the account that Saudi Arabia is saying or is it closer to what turkey was telling us\nWhy does it closer to the bone saw account of getting hacked to death while he was still alive and decapitated and all these horrible ... tell their audio to back up their account they say they have said that there is audio they've said that there is video to back this up is is that true I mean having to get all those questions answered\nWe have yet to to see or hear those tapes that Turkish officials say that they have Egypt what's your initial reaction\nI have a very similar reaction that sounds so much more like a cover story than an accurate account first because as you say they started out denying all of this uh the number of people involved sure makes the fight\nInside the ah the consulate sound or or the embassy sound like an odd thing to happen and\nObviously there are so many gaps between this account a and show what the Turks have said I think what's fascinating here is that they're a cone seems to follow some of the comments\nThat President Trump made you just wonder has there been discussion between the White House between the Trump Administration and the Saudis about what would be unacceptable\nExplanation or something that uh that they could get away with as far as Trump was concerned it was he for example who raised\nThe theory that won't get killers a hurry to a quiz show ... well that sounds like a real killers ... explanation\nYou're raising many questions that we don't have an answer to this point what was coordinated what were the facts all of that said we do have some kind of an official account now from the Saudis and it\nIncludes that that ... ... is dead does that put pressure EJ and your view more pressure on President Trump who has resisted blaming the Saudis pressure on him to take a harder line\nI think there is a lot of pressure on President Trump to take a harder line and he has\nHardened his wine a bit publicly said there should be a severe punishment then all of that but all the indications from the administration or\nThat they really do not want to break with the Saudis they're not ready to take on a the crown prince Mohammed bin so I'm On a because they seem to see him as an ally in Trump is suggested that he is a personal ow\nI Hope so it is not down only to the president and Congress has a role in this as President Trump has pointed out with Senator Lindsey Graham has weighed in Republican Senator Graham has weighed in tonight saying he was very skeptical of the Saudi version of events Brea is you know there's been a drumbeat for sanctions there's been a drumbeat from Congress about taking a tougher line\nAre you watching for that drew me to get louder\n[noise] yeah I mean that honest thing remains to be seen I think ultimately though that this incident doesn't necessarily mean that we should reorient our entire Middle East strategy\nI mean at the end of the day we have to remember that ... is not just a columnist for the Washington Post but he was also a personal friend of us I'm a bin Laden and was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood this is an individual you know we we have to take all of that into account and I also think that when you are dealing when he was a ...\nA journalist for the Washington Post and who is a U.S resident into it now appears was murdered Saturday consulate\nI and of course we do have an interest in making sure that us permanent residents are protected as well that's something that we're interested in doing um when you are talking about the middle east we're talking about a lot of bad actors here I mean if we don't if we're not willing to work with Saudi Arabia\nThe other options are not so great either right we have turkey which tells the highest number of journalists anywhere in the world we have\nIran we have a number of uh other countries that committed human rights atrocity is just on the regular so I think that we just really need to get all of our ducks in a row and we need to you know maybe not necessarily change in one fell swoop our entire Middle East strategy over this\nFind it really disturbing to go back to his youth this person who has been a as close the borders sense of the word liberal in terms of demanding greater freedom in the middle east to go back to his youth and tar him as\nA young member of the Muslim Brotherhood I think this is this is a former propaganda that can be is being used to justify it\nSo one here people shouldn't read his final piece for the Washington Post which was really powerful for freedom in the Arab world it was really overweight and white and short of column and that sure he has been and that is the man who was killed\n[laughter] let me ask you both to set aside for a moment questions about the weather has passed\nAs relevant has passed before he became a journalist and came to the U.S and focus on this question of does this represent a diplomatic crisis for the United states with a Saudi Arabia which has been a strong ally for generations\nFree I think that Saudi Arabia is aware that they really messed up here um you know they've\nArrested I think it was Fifteen people in the last hour they announced that they've arrested and dismiss five others\nSo I got I have to change if they made a statement from Saudi state TV yeah so I think it's clear that they're taking it seriously and they should be taking it seriously\nUm I think that they definitely need to you know rethink what they're doing and the way that they are going to treat American permanent residents that are living in their country\nEJ ah last tortillas thoughts on the where this leaves the U.S Saudi relationship going forward\nI think the relationship is in crisis I think the comments from some of the Republicans in Congress or suggests that as well as a Democrat and I think it's fundamentally put to bed this notion that mom had been some foam on M. B. yes she is known\nTo crown prince\nIs an hour or ... or I think this has really brought home the shortage of his regime or that all the pressure of his image will never be the same as it was when he started out and was getting a lot of or markedly good pressure and that this is a big problem for him going forward\nSewing room one forty nine year old female she's a mother of three she's dying from a rare sarcoma [noise]\nShe had to decide whether to continue chemo or\nSo I brought in a social worker and the ethics committee to help her\nAlso lined up and meeting with a chaplain\nShe just said she wanted someone to pray with during all of this [noise] sat with her for a long time today and just [noise]\nShe's having a really hard time to be honest [noise]\nI think I Am [noise]\nIt gets a bit surreal after that we're we're like go in the hospital I Know you're limiting the number of people can be in any one show\nYesterday guests are allowed and you will go into all these locations in the hospital that most people will never go as a patient say you go into the basement we go to the boiler room they go into this equipment from that just has tons of bad everywhere we go into the bridge to ... different holidays at the hospital we go into the infusion center\nThe quiet room yeah we we kind of take over the quiet room with the\nIt's a room that I'd rather medical center implemented for their employees so it's this room where they can go and just find some quiet\nTo just be unrest and do you see the basement I often associate that with where bodies dead bodies are that's not the case you know okay we love to see any real if this sounds like an insurers worst nightmare how how did how did you possibly get the clearance\nRate is the best question ever I have no idea\nWhere you are your business or because I\nIt just it everyone was let this happen I think we ... at that people come in and signed waivers uh-huh right off the bat but otherwise we just have set it up so that there's hopefully nobody gets hurt first you know harm [noise]\nWhat do you want people to get out of this [noise] so I have a limited perspective my perspective from the nursing I brought in to other directors live on ... and ... tank\nAnd the three of us have we really want people to walk away with this idea that life is now we need you need to wake up and live your life at any moment something can happen\nAnd it shifts and that life doesn't need an invitation\nDeath doesn't need an invitation you just have to walk through that door and started living it\nSo I guess to feel how precarious life views\nYeah OK mhm and that um our grief agrees actually is something that I'm can propel us forward\nDoes the nurse who held your hand in a critical moment she knows the impacts you had on you\nI don't know I I wrote a comment card for her but I don't know it I thought many times about reaching out to her\nBecause of this and um that's a really good idea I probably should okay\nHow do you think this has changed your view of nursing\nIt's made me much more appreciative of the work we do I I find this job at the calling us something sacred as I'm One of the most incredible professions that are out there to sit and be with people and some of the worst nightmares and in the in the midst of their suffering and be able to sit with them and not care for them [noise]\nBut you can still have a bad day absolutely have so many venue instill\nEven be in a bad mood right I mean what would happen if you couldn't come to work sometimes in a bad mood\nAnd that's the thing is like it's bringing that bad mood and opt into city into your nursing thanks for being with us\nI think you Denver choreographer terror renders her new show first do no harm runs through October twenty eighth rose medical center in Denver it's actually part of a year long residency she's doing and the next phase she'll work directly with nurses [noise]\nFinally today a worldwide sing along will take place Saturday world singing day was founded in Boulder in twenty twelve it has grown to more than two hundred cities in forty countries\nThis year's tune is called ode to song which has sunk to Beethoven's owed to joy with phrases from more contemporary popular songs\nHere is the Colorado spirit chorus with a preview of these weekends worldwide sing along just imagined it with a bunch more voice [noise]\n", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "20"}
