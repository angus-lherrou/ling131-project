I have trouble with it but I soon I definitely remember yes how close does remain the same I think but British effective hugely but what happens to kick ... thank\nMuch and my name's Sandra habit and I'm In London a festive thank you very much for really good read and I love the way some of them ... and didn't sit ins were wasn't into more than one version of this story albeit with different outcomes and levels of significance to as soon as life\nBut the main character says I Want to know more about Sylvie that you saw mother yes sorry yet at her mother and father he was a lovely man and easy the on despite all have faults\nIs likeable and comes up Trump's at times but I couldn't decide whether or not I liked that movie\nI was intrigued when the Thirteen year old asked us ... mother coming out of a grand hotel on the on with another man I wanted to know more about that but it's never mentioned again or didn't something no\nYou didn't [laughter] so it was very mysterious character and I'm Glad you said that but you didn't know whether you like to know because I think that sort of the the way that she presents herself as well because I think she's a very frustrated carrots uh I'm In a guardian ruins which is the book after life to live we see a little bit more all\nOf her at ... but it turns out to be very disappointing I think I'm supporting anything match [laughter] um I like Sylvia losses carry to and I did I did have a moment in what I thought I could write so be it so we could have an oval she could be a no vote but in a way because I'm ...\nI'm ... you know as as having a fairly ambiguous character and being unknowable because I don't think she wanted to be known and\nThen I think I had to leave for that sometimes you touched ... and you want to bring them back or you know give them more but then you have to have to talk to them that because that was that role in her role is to be a kind of seen it at first blush sophisticated women because she's up her time I think\nBut if I were to write another novel based around folks corner which is my recovered desire I'll have to say 'cause they know that many how rich you know the place I Want to live where everyone wants to live than it would be Mr Shawcross the store the next door neighbor because I I think she has actually much more interesting stories and Sylvie to town\nOn Monday to ... and was Sylvie Jen is that in the past have got to have with him misdemeanor and is now living an independent life\nIt's a good reason he let me start ... between Sylvie on is if your house but it was much younger and ... she gets\nUs it's a very good way for I think Sylvie yes I think it will be sees it is he eats a nice of possibilities I mean she doesn't\nDo very well with her life are possibilities that has to say but I think so ways\nParticularly I think I'm making supposition say 'cause it's not necessarily something I've written and I never think you should talk about things you haven't written because they just don't exist but I think is he is he's war echoed as it was because she stepped in the end of ads and you know the messages and the first World War and I think\nSylvia can see in that that that's a woman who did something and that Sylvie has only been a wife and a mother and I think also being life and the mother in\nNineteen ten who's a very different prospect for being will now so I think if he shows something that could have been an is annoying because she's not done the best with it and I think is probably so recently looking at it but you know is he is an irritant to everybody really\nWell to me I I I Know I I loved it I mean she's she's just wild child up fault always comes up Trump's always helps us You're up through the various crises of our life I think she's extremely attracted our right to [laughter]\nTo best studying also don't ... the life of a Sheila's brothers but I just it made me wonder because you know how you fall in love with characters in books he was definitely of old many attractive or interesting characters and book she was my safe\nBut I just wanted to use and also other than a she left and presumably the center of your attention whether there was one you particularly enjoy\nEnjoy while I left Haiti Ross obviously those yes she is a little boy and but you I like you I like ... I think he's a really started cold English character you know he's a gentleman and and rather put Conan not entirely fulfilled\nYes it's you know she was full of who start so seeming extremely boring I'm prone to leap on a cliche again from about ... what he does he does open up to become the support of a lawyer ... yeah I Know he's much stronger than we think\nWe have we have a question though from an Iraqi Canadian this was the b._b._c. World Service a swat ...\nAnd this is taking up all based on the earlier question about was a a Sheila remains consistent whether she ...\nShe says some just talking about all the characters in the book she says you know who takes us from zero to here uh from one story to another from one tragedy to another yet the main characters a she's a mother father brother teddy and so on remained constant why\nOur environment as we should be because it's so out of touch with an H is so I think this says that I think that no I didn't have a six cents\nAnd some are also with the the family cook Mrs lover who went to have a six cents arrive and I'll tell you but now [laughter]\nI'm of the opinion that five cents shoes with too many and that's what I'm not doing another one [laughter] I'm just kind of see what you mean [laughter]\nAnd Cape May have a listener on the phone now in Melbourne in Australia she is Caroline Caroline welcome I gather your a pretty meant fond of cake Hopkins in\n[laughter] very much so I Love life ... life and I've been in the the ethic we're recommending it to read it in my mouth and the cup lot yet and they left it to say thank\nYou case one thing that that I take it for me but then life opt to live and uh God and ... when was the same of animals that Fox's dog bad Silva hat\nThe black ... that are paid a carrot to toys people name and fake ... nation I light trough Kate why animals or say Kathleen wave and into the story\nMm good question and I think a lot of it unconsciously as because I write I've noticed looking back I Do that a lot signals this home flux of but in some novels and of course as it was dogs\nI'm always very aware of animal life around me is that some folks are human bass up you have ... other\nThings [noise] uh but um it just seems a natural thing to do and maybe I can ask me trying to keep in touch with nature in some way but I think it's they provide us with very beautiful images of think it's one thing but it's quite straightforward to my thinking to keep a its fragility and you\nKnow flying\nIt would make quite good ceases actually just animals and came back because I mean any UC oh for those who talks\nCaroline you're planning to Russia dissertation on on a moving take ... to ... [laughter]\nNo I didn't think they are but I agree with you I Love the way that they just kind of mass into normal life as well thank you very much\nThank you yeah well well thank you for your question on another question now from the audience share it woke up yes the ... when the\nDrone dog food from ... from don't want to pick up a point in life in your own says ...\nWhere are you refer to the ... ... ... ... ... ... were missed the second World War ... ... one of those things you wanted to do\nWas to hurt some soldiers tribute experiences ... British on weren't during school\nIn doing that do you have any particular insurance that struck through very full ... hours more to being and perhaps how you would ...\nThat's a good question I I think I can take tripping some us it's not that I didn't fit as I wanted to recreate it for my own\nUnderstanding and I've pleasures around what I can see that but I'm simply deep and my relationship to that thing which I had just miss\nAnd if you became aware of is on there was so well in life have like ... and ... it's about the booming ... different kinds of or that in life after life to the ... center of the book is the plates\nAnd I did realize that there's an awful lot of things we don't know there's an awful lot of facts that are not a publicized because they would have been bad from around our view is that what was colored through the propaganda that existed at the time and a lot of it is is you know that very gung ho kind of things that the ministry of information to pushing it and I think\nThe actual feeding and the temperature of the people at the time was much darker than that and much less ... in a way because\nThe will became about survival rather than ... than the subways and I think it was just discovering statistics which were horrible that bombing you know building debts and and the different various bombings that\nI think [noise] did I understand that she has a say in a way I think I just\nFelt it more because I really like creating an atmosphere in books I read like creating the ambulance and I feel that I I really was able to enter into that and that was my wave experiencing the war I suppose but yes I Do I feel for you I just missed it because I was born [noise]\nFive six years afterwards and said that there when I was growing up I was very conscious and on my own 'cause it's a term that my father was a coal miner and they will have very different experiences which I didn't have access to set up the way it maybe it was just a second\nThing on my part but I mean John guy said I'm going to take a risk kids while you are you [laughter] are you old enough to have remembered as a very small child will the bombing of London was like in the ...\nLucerne or was a small child turn which I Do have specific members over ... ... in my mind um\nDid did you feel talking some captured it the way you remembered it\nWell suited me the booming I'm American remembers shivering lumber ... moved from from from my bedroom window from\nThe other thing before I was very ugly countries will particularly as long as I grew up thinking about retirement and older child I moved here in our job\nWas to run the most mhm mhm mhm and you bring my town and some of your accounts of the bombing mhm ... mhm well the places in one\nOne ... ... which is another part because my mom was ... Tommy run them\nBecause they didn't know the great myths of there with the bombing more but science as they were targeting accurately which of course they had no idea what bums fooling none of us we didn't when we bombed it so it was entirely just happened to be you know most most bumps fellows talented\nUnfortunately on people but [noise] we're talking of the\nBombing those another question from is about a mile in El Salvador and Central America who wrote I was completely taken aback by the description of the blitz when she was trying to survive this ordeal to the point I felt I was that\nSo I was wondering about the research and the amount of time this must have taken to make the reading so visit\nI resent you something you forget once you've done so that when people say how how long did you search for how much research and I'm like oh I don't know I Can't remember but such different these days when I wrote behind the scenes that museum it was amazing ate before the Internet\nAnd you would do what you do what's done you'd go to the library or you go to a reference library and you'd take notes and you would order books and it\nWas time consuming and then the Internet came and it says everyone was very dubious about the accuracy of information on the Internet and then I think we've gotten a competent [noise]\nBut you do now is the research to see going on because if you have a question you know if you up so it's a much more seamless process whereas you know before you could say oh I spent three months and in the library was searching on this but it's now you don't know because it happens while you're wrong she holds though\nThat's not entirely true life afterlife or recorded ruins is\nI did about a year of trying to win most let's cells so I wrote to read a little too of biographies and we spoke for what she lost to film footage\nA entered as much as I could because\nYou don't want to become overdone with such because then you become tedious basically I mean they're down moments when I get carried away by\nSetting you know go to and ruins because I'm not a technical person I had to try and get to ... to ... was a technical things to do with bombing and uh and it's something that you find that you stop talking about in your fiction you have to put yourself back and take no no no this is an awful decision to a handbook for them at an engine [laughter]\nAnd then you have to forget there was such that you did and you have to write the fiction and that's when you start going back can and and checking and putting things in and doing more so it's a it's not easily quantifiable for me these days research because sometimes it just about sitting in your garden reading a book that\nSomehow I feel like it was that\nPick up ... thank you very much\n... I'm Kathleen O'Connor from Northern Ireland originally my favorite chapter in the book is the one written from the German perspective and and I would like to read more around this particular topic\nAnd my question is what was your favorite written source in your research from the Germans respect ah this\nThis is at one point for him one of her life is a ... is in Germany is living in Germany she is she's still a British woman but she's she's a and we do see absolutely about ... to ... some like from from that side of the tunnel\nI did become obsessed with David Brown or rock\nI [laughter] I had to be held back from being excited whenever I can go Seventy back either as I started going [laughter] you know his mistress were too young to remember is that there's a there's a lot of kind of film footage for example and to film footage but do the color film pushes so I'd I'd say\nThat um although that sounds like a trivial way of getting into the gym and experience the world is actually", "show_name": "Sound Opinions", "year": "2018", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "07"}
