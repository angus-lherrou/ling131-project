politics is boring\nThat happen right wing of ... that you were there I was there that happened in our lives I miss it I didn't appreciate what a good thing it was when we had it I don't know about you but me\nI spent a full week obsessively\nReading about judge Kavanaugh and watching videos on line and calling\nPeople to discuss it and I know this is just daily life and are totally divide the country these days but can I say for me again for me of all the moments we've had these last few years\nWhere red America and blue America look at the exact same event and come to radically different conclusions\nAnd to me this one feels the worst I think because the original hearing itself a doctor for it and judge Kavanaugh testimony was just so I don't like it was so many hours and then both witnesses were so emotionally wrong\nThat even watching it was emotional it was upsetting\nAnd then since that hearing we've had this week of waiting for the FBI report which held us off or a week in that same state vegetation and disbelief Republican disbelieve the Democrats Democrats just believe that the Republicans\nBut even in moments like this one there are people who haven't picked aside and incredibly sometimes those people are the ones who have to decide I mean I had to cast a vote in the United States Senate and it does not seem fun for them today\nAnd I shall we have somebody in that situation in our\nFirst act Arizona Senator Jeff flake and the second act we leave Washington behind we have somebody who's literally deciding on a mass life or death [noise] no real experience or understanding of how to do it [noise]\nThose those people having to make these huge decision [noise] they're not comfortable with hall [noise] let me be the Chicago just American Life America stay with us [laughter] [noise]\nBut [noise]\nJudge to Senator Jeff flake was one of the central players in the drama on Capitol Hill this last week turn on the TV and you'd see is tortured face\nHe dragged his decisions down to the wire over and over used undecided than seem I could no on Kevin up there was a yes it was let's wait a week is Jeff Flake who made the Senate wait for new FBI investigation than he was a yes again\nA producers though ha to spend a lot of time with Jeff Flake of last year you may remember the hour long episode you did recording him for months and he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill and she was with him in the days before and after the cabinet hearing watching what is going through and talking to him about how we made a choice is\nThere's always the first thing I Want to talk about is the elevator okay it's a big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator near to tell you that's not a true story that's not what changed his mind [laughter]\nI was there right behind the women yelling [noise] that's why my recording isn't clear as what you heard on CNN [noise] just staring at flake peering out from the elevator\nJust admit for an interview\nJust leaks fees can be a little deceiving he looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside he's just like humming a little tune in this case though I think he was miserable\nJust meet in a lot of new ... fans\nThat ended up taking pictures for them [noise]\nAll\nThe people I Do [laughter]\nOkay [noise] um eighty six in Central Park west [noise]\nI don't know I was so starved for any sign of a bipartisan show\nI'm going to go ahead and say bipartisan in New York means you agree with the Democrats\nThis is all happening because way back to New York from Washington on Saturday I ran into Chris Coons on Amtrak he told me flick was on the seller right behind us that we can invited\nHimself along with Coons to the global citizen concert at the great lawn in Central Park broadcast live on MSNBC can't think of a blue or place to be honest more on the news location for the hash tag resistance so I'm surprised to hear flakes coming to you and I text and to see if I can go\nGets me credentials and they take them out of town [noise]\nGet a little lost because I'm from here I think I Know where everything is but I don't\nAnd then we're running across the east ... street transfer\nWe had to a little trailer back speech meet up with Chris Coons outside tens of thousands of people are already out on the line these two senators are going to deliver a short impromptu speech about bipartisanship to this\nCrowd hassle it when they first come first performed for them and his performing after\nCrazy crazy is that what it is after yeah you guys are the opening act for ... be enough you know [noise]\nThis is where flakes reaching across the aisle gesture gets ethical surreal and it's hard to top how surreal the weakest dinner ready\nAll these famous people keep popping into the trailer\nYou if you're a hero I was just so funny that as a people go to Robert\nDe Niro who step to flake with a finger in states like a scene from Goodfellas we rely on you\nToo much goes down with this guy he's got to go [noise]\nIt's I Know it's because they they want the ... of this and that would be on all with beyond or it's weird\nTo hear Robert De Niro say the word the term\nI'm telling you you're John Legend of the should withdraw has its roots and we just we just know that we're all watching and hoping that you make the right decision for the contracts and okay so that's what I'm saying don't worry about is the director\nEven do there now they just so much for lifting and when\nKatie Holmes in surgery Coontz says none of that is\nThat's great I don't know how to\nUse their eyes from Missouri has come in Katy seem\nTo be fair neither of the senator seems to know who any of these people are accepted Niro everyone wants to picture with the Senator Cruz and fleet of rushed towards the stage and continues to be monitored by the Hollywood resistance Darren ... them I'm a filmmaker I made blacks why\nHer last one I Am I going\nAround in the front to see how ... the first are receiving the film Republican senator\nThat's a real New York\nCall for bipartisanship is drowned out by calls because\nThey're off stage so the star treatment starts again\nThe Reverend Al Sharpton catches him like run a red carpet\nFor the call just cause you a hero\nBut at the guy is a guy do\nYou think we can bring this country together out that it's like a left wing first at this point random bit players keep popping out to catch liberals spells Chris Martin from Coldplay gets like a magic pinned up some sort to keep his pocket\nOh yeah ...\n... ...\n... ... Martin leaves we have a moment to sit down\nLike a singer they was\nWell I mean you know it's not something you know you're the boss is different you know a conference on Social Security reform or the other side you know it's not far from settled like having\nPeople like Robert De Niro and John Legend like you're a hero to for a weeklong\nWelding it'll last a week to my next votes for Kevin our for something that alleging that I'm a pariah you enjoy it for a week do you think they know you're still a Republican\nI'm\nKnow I think probably\nEnjoy okay what if\n\nThe fleet center a few years he'd I'm On the right keeps disappointing unless it feels good for wants to be happy do like it [laughter]\nOh yeah every politician does that mean we like politicians way we feed on that\nAnd then it happened just like he predicted\nAfter seven days of being treated as a Democrat\nOr at least Republican defector fleet comes home to the GOP Thursday the FBI releases the report that he called for on friday flake announced his decision he's a yes on Kavanaugh I reached Chris Coons that afternoon\n... you know look Jeff and I both went to the same place and read the same report 'em and you know I appreciate his friendship [noise] we are we are viewing this through a different lens Jeff as a conservative senator has always wanted a conservative on the Supreme Court I I Am not and I don't\nWho started the FBI report was a disgrace to basically didn't follow up on any leads he said was not the investigation he'd asked for last week he was mad frustrated kept going off the record and raging you would not tell me about his conversations with Jeff Flake after they both read the FBI report\nI I'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate here\nAs soon as flake voted friday he fled the capital I talked to him in the car [noise] people are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes he said\nWhy did you vote yes I Am presumption of innocence he told me over and over he was satisfied that the FBI before do you feel better now you're kind of back among your people you had kind of a week with the ... you know the Democrats celebrating\nYou you're kind of back among among your people\nAsk people [laughter] that stuff [noise] I Am aware of what we're only about a party\nThere is no bipartisan right now there is No Child to stand in the middle of the quote a film that Robert Deniro is not in the kind of don't ever take sides with anyone against the family ever [noise]\n\nVery chase sort of students have a program that turn out of it is a recording that we found of Justice Anthony Kennedy Kennedy of course is retiring judge who see Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for the swing vote on the Supreme Court for years and being questioned into cue in a back in twenty ten\nI stand here today justice a potential colleague starting the confirmation process how has the process changed since he went through all that well I like my own uh [noise]\nYou know\nRemember the\nSenate is\nA political party and they have to act in a political way\nThe framers new there\nAnd it's really not for me to tell\nThe Senate how to structure that process\nIt has the obligation\nOr to recognize\nThe necessity of preserving the neutrality and the independence and integrity of our court [laughter]\n\nWhat do you should ask is whether the judge has the temperament commitment and the character and the learning I think the judge should be broadly read\nI my self was of fascinated with political theory you know if if you ask what makes a good judge of going to get an autobiography you know so you have to be careful [noise]\nSo ... ... southern southern so the Senate or as a as a really very difficult position [noise]\n\nKennedy was speaking to an audience getting high school students people asking by the state cases we'd always wanted to be on the Supreme Court no by the way he's funny he's a good talker and explain this job how it works we will meet\nUm just the nine of us and uh and discuss the case\nUh we begin with an order of seniority for the most senior judge or to the\nOf the death penalty so faced with you know almost a dozen other people who already felt\nStrongly I didn't think I could convince anyone or a of of what I was thinking I was I was I'll be honest I'm scared\nAt twenty seven spend with the youngest your by several years and he was a kind of guy who avoided speaking up at all costs\nAt home his neighbor parked in his face he let it go at the office if the boss told them to do something even if he disagreed he did it without question\nIn other words even though we've been looking forward to being a juror when he found themselves in the jury room spend wasn't exactly Henry Fonda and twelve angry men the way he understood it the jurors had to reach a unanimous decision and the idea swaying eleven strangers over to his way of thinking seemed impossible [noise]\nHe was also afraid that if he opposed the group it would result in a hung jury in a mistrial they'd have to start the whole process over again with a new theory everyone would be mad at him says fence had nothing\nAn hour and a half later Paul story was sentenced to death by lethal injection that\nWas hard to look at him during the seasons and um we [noise] we sat waiting for the judge to ask us you know what's the sentencing\nAnd everyone was really tense and the woman next to me and others are uh begin crying she was trying to hide it you know and I gave her my handkerchief and she just ups [noise]\nWhen the foreman announced the verdict [noise] and I think his mother cried out they had an exit for us to go through after ... things and we were out of the courtroom fast\n\nIt felt like a mistake right away\nThen went over to his parent's house where you had dinner and drink scotch with his dad he told his family about the trial and then he went home where you had more to drink before bed\nAnd then that was that was over and uh [laughter] and I went went on with my life or at least he tried to\nBut what do you do with with these feelings um I've I've I was just stuck you know it was done was cast in stone and\nUm yeah no I felt terrible I felt massive amounts regret I felt I I Know I I felt guilty or you know sending someone to death row\nWhen you think about the people that a trial affect you think of the victims and their loved ones and do you think of the accused their families and what they're going through you don't usually think about what it\nDoes to the jurors but for span the trial wasn't something he could put behind them at the crack of the gavel [noise]\nIn the days and weeks after the verdict he read every article about the case he could find\nSo eventually he just stopped I realized it wasn't really healthy at the time span was a regular\nDrinker and it only got worse after the trial got a lot worse after the trial\nHe was drinking more beginning as soon as he got home from work and spending more days hung over his wife didn't understand what was going on\nIt may have contributed to my divorce which was the phone near\n\nHere after the trial and spends life changed the new house with a hammock and the flagpole was sold and spend moved out of Texas\n\nSen settled in Olympia, Washington started life over he found an apartment for himself and his cat need to but he couldn't shake his memories of the trial he tried to escape through alcohol but it didn't tree in front of a shame\nSometimes after a night out drinking you return to a Facebook page Paul stories mother had made for her son one mother had already lost her son\nAnd now because fan had been too afraid to speak up another mother was going to as well\nI'm not trying to excuses crime it was terrible but to send the guy that does not just the the presents and your mind the uh for for current thoughts\nAbout it cannot go away\nFor all the bad rapid gets shame offers a certain safety\nIt provides a comfortable hole to hide in the way from the judgment of others but it can also lead to isolation and inertia and for eight years eight years in which Paul story sat on death row awaiting an execution date Sen barely talked about the trial with anybody\nBut then in two thousand sixteen year after ... stories federal appeal it been denied\nReporter writing a series of articles about the judicial system approach than about his experiences that your\nThan was tired of being alone with his regret and so for the first time he opened up about his feelings\nI felt guilty he told a reporter and sad\nAnd a little helpless\nI don't think I made the right call [noise] Bennett hope to talking about the trial might help and it did\nUp until the article was published that was when ... received an uncomfortable phone call from a lawyer who read the article\n... co workers might over here he took the call outside behind his office building [noise] it was there that he learned that eight years earlier he misunderstood a key part of the jury instructions\nI sock incorrectly essentially I Believe I Would have to convince\nEveryone to choose life imprisonment when\nIn fact all I had to do was declined the death penalty and that's all it would've taken\nPreventing the death sentence only required one dissenting vote votes fan could have cast so they would have been no mass trial no hung jury and instead of the death penalty Paul story would have gotten life in prison without parole\nNow would that would have been nice to know [noise]\nI could have changed\n\nAfter the article was published something else happened something spend never expected or wanted\nPaul stories mother Marilyn got in touch\nShe reached out with an email filled with sentiments of forgiveness she addressed given me and if I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and knowing knowing\nThat there's that forgiveness which also weird like it it wasn't something I completely understand\nFor spent it didn't make sense why would Maryland want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive themselves for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that and like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her message ... how do you mean\nWell I I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as a a ... ... it just floored me I I didn't know what to say\nSan was never able to write Marilyn back\nAlready did begin reply but I didn't\nHave the courage to [noise] finishers under\nSort of you know there's so much pain in there and\n[noise] I feel like it really read things are\n\nA few months after spend receive Maryland's email and execution date was that the state would put pause story to death on April twelve\nOf two thousand Seventeen but then something unexpected happened Glen and Judith cherry the parents or the victim came forward it seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied\nTo cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against capital punishment in\nA video they released publically Judith cherry presents a statement which reads in part we do not want Paul stories family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son they are innocent of his deeds\nBased on this testimony with only five days to spare Paul stories execution was postponed\nWhen news of the stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance an opening to finally respond to Maryland's email but he did it it's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want\nI I Need to apologize for not [noise]\nFor not doing what I should have done to begin with for not following my gun for not drawing [noise]\nShame leads to a nurse or as even the most casual reader of the fundamentals of physics will tell you entered object will remain and our intelligence acted upon by an external\nForces in other words it takes a little nudge and who better to supply a little nudge than a little knowledge and so I write Maryland a letter\nI Know this is a really sensitive and deeply personal issue with ... and I hope I'm not being too forward
