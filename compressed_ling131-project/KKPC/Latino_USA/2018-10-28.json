Tom [laughter] we were hillbillies remember that [laughter] and uh but I Can't imagine what I took you over there for\nI'm sure it was for you know I think we were just running errands they're still lucky [laughter]\nIt's it's funny because when I when I like you know I remember these very particular incidents and that was one of them and and probably\nThe reason I remember it is because it seemed very significant to you I think I sensed as a kid that that you were that it was really upsetting to you because it it I think I felt at that time that you didn't really have very many people in your life at that point you can trust\nOh I didn't have I didn't have hardly anybody my whole family moved out of town I had no\nFamily oh let's see I moved out that day I graduated from high school mhm and I was Seventeen cars I started a year early I had I just wanted out in the ... I found out that I got the scholarship mhm I packed up that nine\nWhy did you want to get out to about because my family would functional that my mum and it was pretty bad [noise]\nThe girl that I Lived with\nAt that time she was taken all of a truck\nAnd every time I Would come home they would always try to get me to take drugs with them or something and I I really didn't do it much at all\nAnd it was really\nIt was it was tough to come home and\nI I guess I must have been suffering a little bit I missed it I really miss my little brothers and my little sister and they were gone\nAnd I was I guess maybe trying to substitute\nI think maybe that's one of the reasons that I remember that we remember yourself on those because I think it worked both ways I think that we felt if that didn't make you feel closer to us I think that we we responded and well\nI was desperately I guess I was looking for a family that I mean it\n[laughter] if only you knew you probably wouldn't hire me but I mean they're\nPeople are complicated now what I really wanted to do would spend more time with your mom and dad but I was terrified\n[noise] I mean I\nI just couldn't I couldn't do it I was too shy you know a lot of times they it was I thought they were asking me to stay longer and talk\nAnd I would just run out and I'm sure that we're [laughter] and they probably felt what's wrong with her but I just couldn't do it\nSo you sort of talk to us instead so yeah I was comfortable around kids because you know I had kids in my family [noise]\n\nEverytime subjective are hard times came up\nI hear a subtle how's it going into\nThe first I thought it was embarrassment but that wasn't that exactly\nIt wasn't until we've been talking for hours that I realized what it was\nShe was waiting for the other shoe to drop\nShe hadn't forgotten that are passed it happened she just forgotten that I witnessed part of it interfere it became clear the one that have been knowing under our entire conversation was that I was calling to say she'd damage me by exposing me do it\nI don't think I was to kind of accent because there was a lot of turmoil in my life and in my family\nAnd that that's what my fear is that I might have had some kind of negative impact on people and and I know probably I did on a couple of people but they were my age but ah\nYou know you just want to remember yeah I was a baby that are the kids love me blah blah blah [laughter] but I I Would be devastating if I heard anything different Mm\nThere are parts of the past you don't want to go back to ... parts of yourself you don't want to go back to\nProduce from Jordan here for life that I remember\nIs he or she just too soon forgot\nAnd it turns out I'd also done my best to forget what I was like but\nI didn't think of myself as where it all but Susan Jordan reminded me in the gentle terms possible when I was nine of anxious and bookish was kind of uptight\nNot to seem as an insult that I just kept thinking these kids don't know how to play\nWhen I went to your rooms I didn't it didn't seem like you had a whole lot of toys I Hope I've got this right but it just seems like they were mostly folks and more educational things\nI mean I remember you had planned it in your room and a chemistry set\nAnd I didn't remember that Kate had hardly any dolls you didn't seem quite at play full as other kids that I had they not just in more serious in general mainly I think that's what I did was try to play\nOr\nPerhaps the most amazing thing about this whole story how little I remember as a defeat us about each other or even if they had deceived us about ourselves\nIt was packed we couldn't actually get on stage the only way out was over to sling myself over the orders and they carried me on the hands ... the crowd and gently deposited me at the stage don't do so this is your last game that was your last good yes\nAnd and it ended with the entire audience lifting you up and\nYou bodily ah out and gently depositing you out out of the club at the well not out to the club but to the stage door yes\nWhere it was amazing\nI I don't think I've ever really been affected by a mob of teenagers and people in their twenties um what what exactly is that like\nUm well\nIn ...
