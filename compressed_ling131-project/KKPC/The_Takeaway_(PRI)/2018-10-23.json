U. T. has this update\nThe silt the floodwater rolling into Austin reservoirs it looks like chocolate milk and makes it a lot harder to treat than usual often water utility director Greg I'm as there is\nThese two figures have clashed themselves\nBecause one Stacey Abrams founded this group called the New Georgia project and twenty fourteen they submitted eighty five thousand voter registration applicants to ... office and cancer blocked about half of those registrations from going through and he claimed that there was fraud going on within Abrams group the New Georgia project\nUltimately there were no fraud charges that were filed against the group\nHowever this battle between these two people Brian captain Stacey Abrams dates back a few election cycles so when I saw they were running against each other I knew that voting rights was going to be a major issue in this race although I don't think anyone quite saw that the issue is going to blow up quite as much as it did\nYou know the exact match room where your ... your registration has to be exactly match your voter id\nI understand how hard that can be I mean I have a passport and your driver's license and one has the middle of the national one hasn't been a name\nAnd and trying to change the passport and there's so much\nI tried and failed I really tried and so I still have to work on that it's not fast and it's confusing which for them to use which office to go to like that run advice so it's not simple to change that kind of ... really minor discrepancy\nIf it makes you feel any better you're not alone Terry there [laughter] and Wisconsin was thinking about adopting similar exact match system the six retired judges who help oversee elections there they ran this test and four out of the six judges in Wisconsin failed the exact match system\nBecause of their names on their voter registration forms were different than their names in state databases and so this kind of exact match system is known as disenfranchisement by typo\nBecause when you submit a voter registration form if you have\nA hyphen missing on your name if you have an apostrophe missing if you use Tom\nOn one form and Thomas on another your former is going to be blocked by the state of Georgia and what's interesting to me is that Georgia first tried to put this policy in place in two thousand nine when it previously had to approve its voting changes with the federal government under the voting rights act\nAnd the federal government actually block this exact match system from going into effect\nBecause they said it was discriminatory against minority voters who are more likely to be flagged by this system than when Brian Kemp was elected in twenty ten he started doing this administratively he was sued and twenty sixteen by the lawyers committee for civil rights a voting rights group because thirty five thousand\nRegistrations were flagged as pending under the exact match system and there was a huge racial disparity in terms of who was flat and ... office after said he was going to stop doing this system but what happened is the Georgia legislature\nBasically reauthorize the law gave voters more time to do this and so a lot of people didn't even realize this law was backed into effect they thought and I was one of those people that thought\nThis law was blocked in twenty sixteen how is Brian Kemp doing this again and that's only when I realized that the Georgia legislature had reauthorized respond given kept new powers that a federal lawsuit was meant to prevent\nWhy are people of color more impacted by this exact match law than a white people are\nThat's a very good question and that was a question that I posed to a number of voting rights lawyers recently and what they told me is that\nBasically the names of people who are African American or Latino or Asian American tend to be more unfamiliar to election workers so they might have names that don't match\nOn the databases from one form to another or election officials might actually enter\nThe correct name incorrectly or because they're confused by the spelling or they don't recognize the name and so I think that basically people of different kinds of backgrounds are sometimes unfamiliar to the largely white officials that are running Georgia's elections I think that's one of the reasons why\nA lot of people are color are ending up on these pending registration lists\nPotential disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters so that part of the law has been struck down but another part of the law of voter id law where you have to show government issued id to be able to vote that part of the law remains in effect and I looked at the numbers in Kansas\nAnd over twelve hundred ballots have been tossed in Kobach was secretary of state of Kansas because voters showed up at the polls without having the right id\nBut Kobus only won his primary his Republican primary by three hundred and fifty one votes and now he's locked in a very close election with Democrat Laura Kelly\nWho's a member of the state Senate and independent candidate Greg Orman\nAnd even the smallest reduction in turn out to shift the race and Kobach favor\nAnd the government Accountability Office did a study of Kansas voter id law and they found that Kansas voter id law in twenty twelve and it was first in effect reduce turn out by ... percent\nIn that state with the largest drop off among black voters young voters and first time voters and these are all people that are going to be less likely to support Kobach than the traditional Republican base\nYou say that Kris Kobach was actually the source of President Trump's false claim that millions of people voted in legally and twenty sixteen and if you compensate for all of those illegal votes Trump would have won the popular vote and not Hillary so what is called that do to plant that idea\nKris Kobach met with Donald Trump after the election basically Kobach was a disappointing for a cabinet position he was under consideration to be head of the department of homeland security\nAs correct id but we have no idea if this is actually going to work the secretary of state of North Dakota has been noncommittal about whether he'll accept these IDs whether poll workers are going to be confused so if we have another close election in North Dakota it could be swayed by this voter id law I\nThink the larger point is that this is one of the most historically disenfranchised I'm not the most\nHistorically disenfranchised community in this country that Native Americans have all sorts of problems right now that they're facing because of what this country did to them and and now they're facing all of these burdens just to be able to vote and the twenty Eighteen election I think that's just very very disturbing from a civil rights perspective\n[noise] it's kind of standard almost a cliche for people including you know elected officials to say get out and vote American democracy is based on exercising your franchise\nOver the weekend President Trump tweeted a warning he treated all levels of government law enforcement are watching carefully for voter fraud including early voting cheat at your own peril\nViolators will be subject to a maximum penalties civil and criminal um what's the reaction to that tweet and\nIt was a very alarming tweet by the president as you mentioned Terry usually ...\nEnds and high ranking officials encourage people to vote President Obama just put out a tweet recently when he went through all the excuses for people not voting and said this is why you should vote but Donald Trump was doing the opposite he basically made it seem like this was an act\nOf voter intimidation by the president of the United states not the first time that Donald Trump has tweeted about voter fraud he repeatedly clams without any evidence that millions of people voted illegally\nIn the twenty sixteen elections in fact voter fraud is a very rare problem in American elections it's not like it never happens but it's not nearly as widespread as many people including the president what how do you believe just to cite one study there was a review of\nEvery ballot cast between two thousand and twenty fourteen so over a billion ballots cast during that period\nAnd there were only thirty one cases of voter impersonation so that means you're more likely to be struck by lightning than you are to commit voter fraud but I think the real reason why Trump was doing this and why he mentioned early voting in particular is that in spite of the bears that we've been talking about\nEarly voting turn on his way up and a lot of crucial swing states and its favoring Democrats who are getting out to vote in spite of the barriers they're facing and this was alarmed Republicans and so what Trump is saying is that he\nWants to essentially intimidate people out of voting particularly at an early voting because he feels like this is hurting the Republican Party and at any time it seems like Republicans are about to lose an election they invoke the specter of widespread voter fraud\nWhich they feel well hopefully have a chilling effect on voter participation\nWell we've been talking about voter restrictions were going to talk about the possibility of expanding voting rights during this election after we take a short break if you're just joining us my guest is Ari Berman he's the author of the book give us the balance the modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a senior reporter

we're talking about voting rights and voting restrictions I guess as Ari Berman he's the author and give us the balance the modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a senior reporter for Mother Jones or he's been writing about voting issues\nSee said that twenty Eighteen can actually be a big year for expanding voting rights in spite of all these additional new restrictions\nThat we've been discussing and that their initiatives on the ballot in seven states it would make it easier to vote and harder for states to gerrymander political districts so give us an overview of those uh initiatives on the seven states\n[noise] yeah so despite all of the focus on voter suppression Terry twenty Eighteen could actually be a huge year when it comes to expanding access to the ballot because there are initiatives that would make it\nEasier to register to vote in crucial swing states like Michigan Nevada through things like automatic and election day registration there are initiatives in four states to make it harder to gerrymander by doing things like citizen ladder nonpartisan redistricting\nAnd places like Colorado Michigan Utah in Missouri and the biggest ... the one that could affect the most people is in Florida where they have a ballot initiative\nThat would restore voting rights to ex felons so Florida is one of only four states that prevents ex felons from voting meaning even after you've served your time you've paid your debt to society\nYou have to wait five to seven years in Florida\nTo appeal to have your voting rights restored it by the governor and his executive clemency board and this current governor Rick Scott in Florida has restored voting rights to almost nobody you have a situation in Florida where one point six million\nEx felons cancel that's a staggering number what that means is that one in ten people in Florida\nIncluding one in five African Americans in the state can't vote because they have a felony\nConvictions so ten percent of people in the most important swing state in the country that has routinely decided presidential elections aren't able to participate in aren't able to vote in twenty Eighteen and this ballot initiative would restore voting rights to up to one point four million people in Florida\nThat would be the largest in franchise meant of new voters since the passage of the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five so despite all the suppression we're seeing in Georgia in North Dakota and Kansas in other states\nFlorida has a chance to give the right to vote back to more people than at any time since the Nineteen sixties and and that's the good news that help doesn't get drowned out by all the bad news\nSo Rick Scott the governor of Florida who you described as the chief enforcer of the felon disenfranchisement law he's running for Senate against three term incumbent amounts and\nHe is and so here you have a situation where the architect of a policy\nThat has disenfranchised one point six million ex felons in Florida is running for office and the people disenfranchised by Rick Scott aren't able to vote against him and previous governors and Florida have restored voting rights to many more people than Scott has Jeb Bush\nThe governor of Florida restores voting rights to Seventy seven thousand ex felons\nCharlie Crist Jeb Bush's successor\nStart voting rights to a hundred and fifty five thousand ex felons in Florida Rick Scott has only restored voting rights to three thousand people in Florida during his eight years as governor so he has implemented this felon disenfranchisement law in the most restrictive way possible and it's not just his race Florida could also elect\nThe first black governor in their states history Andrew Gillum but you have a situation where five hundred thousand half a million\nDisenfranchised African Americans aren't able to vote potentially to elect the state's first black governor\nSo\nIn the past I've certainly been a lot of voting related court decisions that have been appealed as high as the Supreme Court the Supreme Court now has added Brett Kavanaugh to the bench what's his position on voting rights he\nHas from the cases we've seen a pretty alarming record on voting rights heat up out of voter id law from South Carolina in twenty twelve that the Obama administration had opposed and said could disenfranchise tens of thousands of minority voters in that state\nBut a cabinet wrote the majority opinion upholding this law\nAnd he basically said that even if there was no evidence of voter fraud that states could enact new restrictions on voting and that sets a very broad precedent\nFor Republican controlled states like Georgia like North Dakota light Kansas to enact new restrictions on voting and even if there is no evidence\nOf the kind of fraud that they are purporting to crack down on\nThey can uphold these measures as legal ... even if they just say that they are intended to and cabinet as words uh promote the integrity of the election and so he is going to be joining", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Takeaway (PRI)", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "23"}
