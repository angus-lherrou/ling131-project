fresh air\nToday the journalistic challenges of investigating Russian interference in the election and connections between the Trump campaign and Russia which out with Washington Post reporter Greg Miller who broke several related stories and shared a Pulitzer this year we'll talk about the stories he broke including one about what she says\nThat was a sort of one of the more fascinating and interesting episodes I've ever lived through as a reporter\nAnd we'll talk about reading an economy memo that in an Oval Office meeting between Colombian President Trump from complained about leaks and about a reporter and Miller realized he was that reporter\nThey're talking about heads on parts reporters in jail chasing down sources was unnerving\nOther TV critic David be included considers have Saturday Night live and sixty minutes responded to the Kavanaugh hearings that's on fresh air\n\nFirst news live from NPR News in Washington I'm Laurie London\nPresident Trump says the FBI should do a comprehensive investigation into the allegations surroundings Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and that he's keeping in his words an open mind\nBut as NPR's Mara Liasson reports he also says that Senate Republicans should determine the scope of that investigation\nPresident Trump said he wants the investigation to end quickly and that the FBI should look into whatever the Republican Senate wants it to he said he believes Kavanaugh was truthful in his testimony and that his family has been treated horribly but he also said he has no backup plan if Kavanaugh should withdraw or be rejected by the Senate\nI Hope that he gets approved I Hope that the report comes out\nLike a ... like I really think it should I think it will I Hope\nI Hope what look I'm waiting just like you the president said he was surprised how vocal Kavanaugh was about his drinking problems in high school President Trump doesn't drink which she joke today was one of his only good traits Mara Liasson NPR News Washington\nTrump is also touting a newly reached trade agreement with Canada and Mexico Canada is chief trade negotiate eight or in negotiator agrees NPR's Windsor Johnston reports the U.S Mexico Canada agreements would replace the north American free trade agreement or NAFTA\nTrump says the new trade deal is based on the principles of fairness and reciprocity\nOnce approved by Congress this new deal will be the most modern up to date and balance trade agreements in the history of our country where the most advanced protections for workers ever developed\nTrump says the agreement will create jobs across the manufacturing agriculture and technology sectors it would also protect Canada from any future automobile tariffs imposed by the United states\nBut for now leads in place us imposes duties non steel and aluminum imports and retaliatory tariffs that Canada and Mexico implemented in response Windsor Johnston NPR News\nPolice in Germany are questioning six suspects believed to be planning terror attacks as may Nicholson reports\nA source he's kind of outrage Eddie this morning and has arrested six men age between twenty and such a seventh man believed to be the ringleader was arrested last month\nI'm telling us consistently that Flynn had in fact discuss sanctions with\n'cause I can in fact it signaled that they could expect some relief from those sanctions when Trump was an office so you know there's a scene in the book that I write about which one of my colleagues at him and says I'm a terrific national security reporter\nIs meeting with the source and he has this certain method about that when he has conversations with sources he'll often bring a piece of paper that will have a list of facts that he wants to check would that source and he's going through that list of\nThe facts and in this case it's about Flynn and Kislyak\nAnd uh at that moment that he gets the first sort of indication from a highly reliable source that the White House position on this\nIs false that Flynn's claims that Pence's claims that Sean Spicer claims need to be scrutinized further that they're not honest and that's what sets in motion is sort of really\nA fervent push on our end to get to the bottom of it\n[noise] see your your team contacts Flynn just say we're publishing this story basically saying that you lied and that you did have phone conversations with the Russian ambassador about lifting sanctions after Trump takes office\nAnd Flynn of course denied it and denied it and denied it and then you had to decide you didn't publish anyways you and your editors had to decide how was that decision made\nThat was a sort of one of the more fascinating and interesting episodes I've ever lived through as a reporter\nI'm so when we write stories like this you know basically accusing a very senior government official of not being honest with the public and there's a very high bar there uh before you before you can publish something like that you want to have\nEverything locked down and in fact in this case we had a colleague guarantee young who had previously scheduled interview with Flynn in his office in the west wing of the White House and so we huddled with her before she went over she was going to talk to him about foreign policy objectives of the new administration and so forth\nAnd asked her to at the very end of her interview with him raised this question with him on last time to tell him look\nPost is close to publishing stories saying that you did discuss sanctions would Kislyak how to respond\nIn that in that moment he doubles down and tells her no no and he repeats that several times no no no basically did not happen so caring comes out of that meeting and called us and tells us this\nAnd we actually hit pause and the storyline that night we were ready to publish that story that night but the sort of the the strenuous denial the nature of the denial from him made us think okay we [laughter]\nWe need to double check we need to theirs and we need to hold off and just make shouldn't make double sure that we're right on this that night I'm we talked about it in the post newsroom the next morning I went into a meeting with Marty Baron Kamron bar other senior editors at the Washington Post and laid out our sourcing\nThat's the first time I I I ever used the word number nine I later I said we have nine different sources telling us this is true and and described outsourcing to those editors\nAnd came out of that meeting with a green light I mean when when we laid out those details laid out our sourcing and the efforts we had gone to to try to to nail this town I'm Marty Baron and others were were didn't hesitate you know we're going forward with the story we need to tell Mike Flynn what we're doing\nSo that's that's an option another interaction with when that was amazing so we call the White House we say we have the denial we're going to use that on the record we're going forward with the story anyway we're confident our sources and then the White House blinks Flint links\nComes back to us cause me it through a spokesman calls me and says for the first time\nI'm Mr Flynn is no longer certain that those sanctions were not discussed and that call he can't be sure that the subject didn't come up and that was just so different from the categorical denial we had gotten I don't know sixteen hours earlier\nPolitically fatal often by lying in the face of overwhelming evidence Flynn however had noticed that community I was interested that you used the word lying\nLying when used in the same sentence as Trump [laughter] it's very controversial in the journalism world because mine implies intent\nYou know a false headed is when you speak something that isn't true line implies that you know it's not true and you're saying it anyways so people are getting just weighing luck is is worthy of using the word lie or not so you've used the word lie so I Want\nTo ask you about how you decided to use it\nYeah I mean I feel like\nUm it is a difficult decision and we don't we don't throw that word around lightly we um we often get criticized at the post for being too reluctant to use that word and I think that's true to other news organizations as well but at the same time\nI mean we're at here at this moment are you know we have a fact checker at the Washington Post to his documented\nFive thousand or more fall swords from this president since he's taken office many of them are false words that he repeats despite repeated corrections public corrections repeated efforts even by his own staff\nTo um to correct his misstatements I mean there is an intent to I don't think there's any doubt that there is an intent or that it is part of\nIn fact he doesn't even get to talk to some of the senior Republicans until almost a month later this sort of the August recess timeframe but nevertheless this was a you know an alarming development that some Republicans are showing very little interest in\n'em he finally gets into a conversation a private meeting with Mitch McConnell and we write about this in the book and burning feels like he's coming to these leaders would\nFrightening information overwhelming information solid intelligence that shows that Russia has this objective they're trying to screw in our screw up the election and try to install Donald Trump\nAnd then he ends up in a shouting match with McConnell because McConnell's reaction is something he just Brennan fails to anticipate is deeply troubled by\nMcConnell is saying well if you basically tells them if you come forward this administration comes forward and accuses rush of trying to help and help elect Donald Trump I\nWill consider that interference in the election and I will and I will call the administration out on that I Will accused the administration of trying to interfere in the election I mean it's astonishing here's the Senate majority leader\nBeing told that Russia's interfering in the election and he's saying I'm not willing to issue any kind of statement or take any action that would let the public know that but I Will accuse you of interfering election\n[noise] you you write puente had weaponized intelligence McConnell and the GOP weaponized denial\nYeah because they the because of their refusal to sign on to even any kind of a public statement that would uh explicitly say Russia's interfering in this election Russia is trying to tilt the outcome of this election\nThe Obama team felt sort of handcuffed I'm\nNow ... you could argue that they that they really weren't in that they had lots of ways they could have come forward and talk publicly about it\nBut the Obama administration is hoping to do this in a bipartisan way and so determined to do it in a bipartisan way that we're newness and McConnell and others refused to go along\nThey're sort of stuck they can't see a way past that it takes them months to figure out a way to get a statement out did even then only glancing Lee gets at the idea that Russia's interfering in the election with a certain purpose [noise]\nYou know when Mitch McConnell finally agreed to releasing a joint statement of Democrats and Republicans about Russian interference in this was in late September\nUm was a letter to state election officials from all four leaders of Congress warning of unnamed ... Malik factors that are seeking to use cyberattacks to disrupt the administration of our elections\nAnd urge states to quote ensure that their network infrastructure is secure it made no mention of Russia\nSo even when McConnell given I signed on to a statement there's not only no mention of hurting Hillary Clinton and helping Donald Trump there's no even mention of of Russia it's so they are just\nStarting to look packets of started I look back on that now I'm because given what McConnell and others in government knew at that time that statement is so watered down is to be virtually meaningless [noise] um so\nSo meanwhile John Brennan was trying to convince McConnell look Russia's interfering in the election and McConnell is saying oh yeah if you say that again going to say you're interfering in the election so brand and recently lost his security clearance\nAnd McConnell is still the Senate majority leader I'm I'm Wondering and I don't know um I don't know if you can answer this at all\nBut if it can be proven that McConnell knew\nThat Russia was trying to interfere in our election and influence the outcome of it and then tried to cover it up to deny that it was happening is that treason is that like legally treason\nI don't want to use words like trees and um but I write about many cases that are really distressing um that tell us that we're in a different political earlier than anything we've that we've seen in this country for a long time\nUm where political imperatives where loyalty to party or party considerations\nSeem to overwhelm everything else including the ... concern for the country and its in its core institutions I mean what's more Coors than\nAn election an American election for president of the United states\nWhat is more deserving of protection\nUm and putting above all party considerations than that and yet we see numerous cases through this period\nIn which um when senior officials and learn about this and I think Mitch McConnell's one of them their impulse is to protect the party interests to try to protect the prospect of Trump's victory over the sanctity of the election itself I mean it's\nIt's um it's a troubling thing and it didn't always it wasn't always this way\n[noise] let me re introduce you here if you're just joining us my guest is Greg Miller he covers national security and intelligence for the Washington Post now he has a new book called The Apprentice Trump Russia and the ... version of American democracy and they take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air\nColorado Public Radio's for new ways to help Colorado keep up to sort of [noise] [noise] Hi I'm Daniel generation I I'm here to watch a brand new email newsletter the lookout chock full of reporting from CPR and trust that was around the state and world about issues that affect Colorado a smattering of human person that [noise]\nBecause it like backyard barbecue banter in your inbox every weekday morning\nYou have a lookout Schreiber CPR Donald [noise]\n[noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from progressive insurance offering or waves are by home insurance with their home quote explorer to arrest them quotes in ratings are able to go on line\nLearn more progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive now that it's progressive and from the I.
