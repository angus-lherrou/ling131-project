and ... you know they always had the ... of everything is I think what I'm trying to say I'm so\nOh yeah I I I remember him dancing so beautifully around these kinds of questions which I think he was irritated by [laughter] very core and when I say that I I don't mean to be disparaging as a person I'm constructing the questions\nI think it's natural for us to be curious and to articulate our concerns or thoughts are questions\nBut I think it's also natural for the quote unquote artists to preserve the kind of mystery I'm seemed to not talk about the mechanics almost like a porno you know this goes in here that goes in there there's something bigger than the mechanics and that is the end\nThe end result the stirring quality of of what is the result\nOf an artist at work\nAnd um you know I think he uh has he said you know I put my paper had on my concussion and dance he tried to hunt for the occasions to to dance around questions or a cooperate Tibet as best he could and I feel like such a shabby imposter trying to\nUm be the ... for him you know the ambassador of this particular book which I had very little to do with frankly other than offering a title for it or you had a very\nEloquent introduction which I Will be quoting as time goes on here [laughter]\nThank you so I ... I think you've said he left behind like lockers worth of notebooks what are you dealing with him I mean you ... like he was always riding there's always a cocktail napkins and pages and\nIn his pocket you found a notebook in the freezer ones um so what what are you dealing with the findings\nWell it's amazing there's so much paperwork to go through a from the simplest point of view is the are the archival work which is assembling everything and trying to pay homage to it for posterity then there's a the completion of works of his in this instance it's the flame this book\nUm and then there were also some songs which I was tasked with finishing you know you may know I ha I produced his last record the\nCold you want a darker and while working with him many many poems were red sometimes to a mere kick drum you know just for meter for tempo and so there's this sense of responsibility to keep the songs alive is he always used to say\nI Want to pay the title song on the final album that was released when your father and then at Khan was still alive it's called you on a darker and then we'll talk about working with him on hand and this is it's what can I say it's a great song [noise]\nFew she means I'm from the inside is the more ... you want us to talk [noise]\n[noise]\n\nAh [noise]\nIn the human brain [noise]\nA million and candles and burning for another game\nYou want to Darren [noise]\n\n\n[noise] oh that's ... calling from the final album that was released while he was alive the title track you want to\nDarker I guess his his son Adam ... wrote the introduction to a new collection of ... final homes no ... lyrics and drawings called the plane\nThat China so much about facing death and of having a God who allows suffering and accepting the suffering but yet not being like happy\nNow you know what\nI don't want to read this booms I think that I think in some way or another if we could urge people to um to consult to work with smaller samples or otherwise it takes a kind of ... tone that I think he would have been very very reticent to uh to accept it\n[noise] I'm\nWondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his sons or read his homes\nThere was this really dark quality but there was this like kind of\nExistential distance from it at the same time and it transcend than quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is troubling you by the idea of you you reading poems yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice this complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality who is expressing at the same time and that you don't feel like you could\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines\nIn which he talked about the solitude of the experience of the of reading and there's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that uh that this is this is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nI appreciate you saying that as a son but as a fan of your father's work I Will say that he performed his work in concert to large crowds of people and there are so many performers who have performed his songs so they have the have his work as a life outside of his mouth\nThis is Leonard yeah go ahead more ... there was a moratorium on that song you know with my family so how is that right you got to meet with ... yes refrain please refrain from playing ... because\nI think he felt like a you know who's going to cause Leonard Cohen fatigue or something you know where they give give some other songs a chance to get [laughter]\nUm it was it was partly joking partly zone exhaustion I think with with the song\n[noise] so in spite of the moratorium your family has on hello yeah I think I think I'll play it anyway are you okay with that\nOh God you know I'm going to report due to the bully police [laughter] okay I hear it\n[noise]\n\n\nReally [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nThat's under ... singing hallelujah and my guess is Leonard ... son Adam cone and there's an he wrote the introduction to a new collection of passion immensely publish Leonard cone um lyrics\nPoems notebook injuries and drawings and it's called\nThe flame um so you know at hallelujah I think like two hundred people that recorded hallelujah and um it but it didn't become well known until just about the recorded at like maybe ten years or more after your father recorded at\n... which is just so strange but um it just sign of\nHow I think there's a period of years when your father is genius wasn't fully knowledge when you know he had the initial period of hits and then I think people are just ... a lot of people just kind of drifted away and then rediscovered him\nAnd um what was it like for you and for him during that period one when I think he'd been a little bit forgotten\nYeah [laughter]\nI feel like my father probably felt like his whole life um was characterized by that by that description that he did have been forgotten forgotten by the angels forgotten by the or the you know cupid a forgotten but um [noise]\nI Know that he was not satisfied\nThat he was a seeker I wasn't satisfied was either the position that he had for the most part I'm In society he wasn't happy with society itself but we're ... ... deep in the conflict\nHe wasn't he wasn't satisfied with the people that you've chosen to be around him he wasn't satisfied with his role as a father he wasn't satisfied with his role as a lover I'm\nAnd through all this layer upon layer of dissatisfaction you somehow mustard I'm an incredible buoyancy and ability to be a\nUm one of the most delightful people anyone ever came across and I'm really wasn't with any sense of bitterness or judgment I think he just felt like a you have this shabby little life and his own we solve this was ... was the work itself\nAnd that's what made the end of his life that more astonishing and surprising and delicious you know there's a unexpected\nAbility to to feel you know twenty thousand seats in in any major city in the world who use reviews from people that were like you know this you're likely we're reviewing the Sistine Chapel itself\nUm the was accompanied by commercial success and accolades and ah [noise]\nTo see him take his hat off you know and I think we jubilant audiences one after the other was the man who was genuinely surprised and delighted\nBy the reception that he thought he was never going to get in life\nWhen I saw him probably in the late to thousands like two thousand nine maybe I I Can't remember what it was kind of like being in a church or synagogue there was this\nSense of like ... the devotion of as fans to him and his devotion to the music and she sings a larger\nAnd he ended up with what struck me as the benediction and I forget exactly what he said but you know to those of you who are going home you know to your family's enjoy your family's in to those of you who live alone\nEnjoy your solitude and I felt like people don't say that that's such a beautiful thing to say that your lovely wife sending people home and sending home people who are going home alone enjoy your solitaire\nYeah maybe songs find you and your solitude yeah that's what made a blood ... actually be the exact quote has made the blessings find you and your solitude I thought that was just beautiful\nWell this is a man who is he says and I think you've you've just played it well you know although we had a reputation as a ladies' man you know he was he had the greatest teeth to the ten thousand nights you spent alone he understood something above so to\nLet me re introduce you if you're just joining us my guest is Adam ... he's the son of
