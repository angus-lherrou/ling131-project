I didn't even know there was a concentration camp there ... you didn't know was a concentration camp when you live there either right\nWe didn't we didn't ... it was sort of a a transfer camp holding camp or whatever you call it but it was before that it was a huge city yeah rice or eat in a sense you know a middling rice and and whatever so that's what it was cold and it was known but it was so sad but was a\nBefore being a political ... refugee camp where we ended up in was a Nazi camp a concentration camp\nHow old were you I was ten from central twelve so you were able to go to school and it was it was a Catholic school you were taught by nuns and\nYou worked in the kitchen with the nuns and he said that their food began to heal you um what did you learn from the nuns who you work with about preparing and serving food\nSo ah in the camp out we were held in there until they vetted us and they found out that you know we worms spies that we were just the simple family and actually of Italian heritage\nThat wanted a new life so uh they gave us a kind of a ... a permit to leave the camp certain hours of the day we have to check out and chicken and ah my mother was given up\nAnd if you buy a family a woman that had an autistic child and she wanted my mother's a teacher to spend some time and teach and talk to the child and intern she she subsidized my schooling in the convent that was actually right close to her house\nAnd then that come and I was a I just loved it because it began to sort of interact with other children speak Italian and the religion came back in my life the nuns that took me under their wings knowing that I was a child that you know have not been\nEducated in their religion in in our religion because of being\nUnder communism so it was a great a setting for me and also\nTo sort of help subsidize my schooling they put me in the kitchen I don't know why but I guess they sense you know in the kitchen was more of what I did with grandma you know kind of peel potatoes apples but it was for me the first kind of entree into a commercial kitchen\nSo I'm In Nineteen fifty eight you and your family immigrate to America with the help of Catholic Relief services and Catholic Relief services emerges as a real hero of this book in your life story\nThey helped you get passage to America they found you a hotel room to stay in when you first arrived they found a house or apartment for you to rent afterwards they helped her parents find jobs they gave him money and they didn't want to be repaid even though your mother insisted on paying them they wouldn't accept it [noise]\nUm [noise] but anyway so you were how old when you came to America twelve\nI was Nineteen fifty eight didn't speak any English that you learned it within a year and then you were in school being like an outsider newcomer without any facility with English and it was I imagine pretty hard for you\nAnd you still had to deal with food but with food and a foreign country\nWith very little money and no garden or animals or you know fruit trees or [laughter] any vet to deal with so how did the world of food changed for you\nIn a matter of well each each changed tremendously you're not twelve years old though\nYou are or at least I recall being very very I was happy I was so happy the finally we came up to a place where we are going to stay we are going to build their home\nAnd uh um I was excited about learning the language of excited about becoming an American I was excited about making friends uh you know whose language I didn't know and I was excited also by the food or you know I must say it initially and things like ...\nAnd [laughter] and all of that stuff from east you know and and then like yo it off\nBecause I'm going to confess year
