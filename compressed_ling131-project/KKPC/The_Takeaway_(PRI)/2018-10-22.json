Russia will have to do exactly the same in order to maintain Paris ... so it is a written\nThe arms race the oldest what Moscow is warning and saying that threatens the the stupidity\nOf the world oughta essentially but I think you know at the end of the day at the point is that Russia is is trying to argue\nOr trying to to keep I think the moral high ground in the states aren't giving that it has done nothing wrong and that by withdrawing from the treaty it is the United states that destabilize the situation I think that's interesting because of course there are critics of the treaty here\nIn Russia itself or you've loaned donkey that it basically ties Russia's hands and allows other countries for example China I took I had with missile development and a increase in the nuclear arsenals and perhaps in fact there are plenty of people here in Russia who'd be quite happy to see this treaty gone up but even more happy to be able to play enough on the United states\nAnd President Trump has complained that China is not a part of this pact or do you think that this could be some sort of strategy to make a new deal with with the three countries\nWell certainly it does bank that question doesn't that I'm I'm not entirely sure and certainly the experts that we've been talking to suggest that actually it might be a very long shot to try to renegotiate this Tracy but I think that the sort of the language it's coming from the Kremlin is interesting it does seem to suggest that Moscow\nIs a exploring the room for compromise on this because the line that we're hearing from the foreign ministry I'm from the Kremlin is that Russia has seen the actions yet by the United states simply a statement of intent by Donald Trump and in fact withdrawing from the treaty itself as a process\nWhich takes some six months so I think Russia saying look\nWe already said hey what your saying we're ready to discuss this we're ready to try to play the responsible actors and that's at least to\nTo to to keep that guy's a and let's talk let's see where they can go because I Do think that Russia and the United states both have shed concerns about Chinese or nuclear developments on whether or not as any kind of wiggle room in that for some sort of brought a deal I think is a big question at this point\nNo it's very interesting Mikhail Gorbachev the former president of the Soviet Union who signed the deal with Ronald Reagan has criticized President Trump's decision he said do they not really understand in Washington what this can lead to which ah refers back to what you've been saying the response has been in Russia that this is a dangerous step\nFor world order 'em but what has the legacy of this treaty Ben in in Russia have Russians been accepting of it over the years\nWell it essentially white counted ... of ... and of course the Soviet Union had to destroy a lot more of them then the U.S how to do\nA it was and it is and it remains a key parts of the security architecture a post Cold War so I think you know Russia and the rest of the world to be the beneficiaries of that but of course you know in recent months then yes that Russia has been keen to stress that it is developing its nuclear arsenal that it is back\nIf you like on the world stage is a nuclear player again a positive precedent ... kind of positioning of Russia as\nA as the was the one who's inherited the Soviet and I guess they have said President Putin sees Russia as a superpower rather like the ... the United\n... rather like the Soviet Union used to be said positive that this is maintaining a nuclear arsenal\nAnd so we've seen for example back in March he made a speech where he sort of paraded Elise long range nuclear missiles that Russia is working on ... and that was\nA a a sort of a big big deal for ... and so I think you know Russia wants to be\nA global a nuclear power it wants to be reckoned with more broadly and I think\nThe bigger question is whether if there is a renewed on race and by the mid range missiles come back into play you know can Russia I'm not ... kind of rhetoric with its check book and it doesn't have the money to fund the kind of arms race that potentially could be talking about [noise]\nBut it's the BBC's Sarah arranged for in Moscow thank you so much thinking here and now he's a production of NPR and WB you are in association with the b._b._c.

CT screening of finding [laughter]\nShow everybody likes\nThen if they see he's going to abolish the national park system\n[laughter] that's great my middle ground which turned out his eyes are [laughter] what do you think listening back to ... I it's strange\nTo hear back I forgot I'm just kind of how truly absurd it it was and yet kind of true to form so I was a rattling I\nAlways wanted to know whose idea was it for you to play Spicer did they call you it's that decided to life folks call you and ask you to do it or did you suggest the idea to them\nYou know my no I did not suggested I Would never ever have thought of that than a million years um [noise] my friend Ken sublet that's I'm One of the head writers at us and now that I Know you know going back to the ground links theater in Los Angeles uh he\nCalled and said would you ever come in and do Spicer I wrote something that I think you can play and I was like what the the what I Can't play him I don't\nI don't do in person nations I'm not a man I don't know I have I have no interest it's not in my wheelhouse\nAnd he just kept saying you know I think could do it I think it was just coming can I can I send you to read [noise]\nAnd I I think I said I don't think it's quite my thing and and then I Believe the next day I saw\nAnother rather you know insane press conference where I thought well just as weirder than anything I could actually do like we can't even we can't even match it on us and now it's so absurd and I just thought\nOkay I'm going to come in and read it and talk to you guys about it and\nYou know I think and then the the real humbling blow as I thought well how how long is it going to take like can can we even get me to look like him and the really lovely a special effects guy there just said oh yeah that's not gonna be hard at all that'll take like a half an hour\nWhich I thought oh I thought it might be harder to switch over to a man that really was it and they got it down to like you know at one point we were doing it in my view Fifteen minutes\nTerms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like you have to look at this we were all desperately even though we were friends with in the movie saying like\nOh my God look somewhere else like we couldn't escape it and then I and then I think we started to reconcile with the facts of like it could be funny for the sheer sake of being like what is the worst thing that could happen to you and and how do you kind of like just like a horror movie get through it\nIs interesting to hear you say that because the second half of my question [laughter] what's going to be OK some women found that liberating that you know women can do gross out humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality of by doing gross out scenes so you're ... really interesting because you're saying that's that's not really what was intended but it wasn't\nIntended it was really talked about because I'm I'm I'm not one for\nBathroom humor or stuff like that I think sometimes there's that horrible and wonderful feeling you get where you're so embarrassed for the character mhm and I think that's showing the character kind of going through such a vulnerable humiliation that\nWe can all laugh at it because in some way we've all done it we've all falling said the wrong thing had some shaming thing done and they think I think at least for myself that that was the connection to that's a real human experience even if\nThat particular action hasn't happened to most people\nMost McCarthy something else that you're famous for [noise] is um insults\nMelissa McCarthy at what point did you start thinking about uh either acting or comedy which came for us like acting or comedy but comedy standup\nStandup came first I'm In kind of suddenly and\nTo New York and I was twenty kind of out of the blue or hadn't living in Boulder, Colorado I'm not sure exactly what I was doing or why it was even there I moved there with my sister and then just it was still kind of lingering and\nI had a friend come and see me and say why are you in Boulder and I said I don't know I only want to be in New York so three days later I moved to New York city that night\nHe found a place to do stand up the next an open Mike night the next day 'cause not 'cause I'd necessarily talked about stand up but I think\nI kind of did a lot of telling stories and like to you know I found it fun to make people laugh and our first night he said you should do your you're going to do an open Mike night tomorrow night and they said All right I think because I was twenty and\nYou just kind of think everything's not a big deal I figure you know now I Would be terrified but at twenty I just went okay that seems fine we're not doing anything else and I went up on stage the second night I was in New York and\nI kinda thought oh I think this is what I'm going to do and I remember calling me\nSaying I'm not going to go back to school\nI had planned on finishing up at FIT I hadn't finished school is the fashion and when to yes and I wanted to do women's clothing it's kind of all I kind of ever thought about from you know my grandmother was a seamstress maybe that was embedded in me but it was really my it's what I did on you know I really loved it I Love making clothes I loved\nWatching other designer studying what they did I Love the whole process I was always sketching [noise]\nAnd then they did stand up one night and I just thought I think I'm gonna go this direction\nDo you remember any of the material you did that first night\n[noise] I Do strange I'm sure it was terrible uh I was at stand up in New York I'm for an open Mike and I remember I first of all I hadn't written anything I just kind of got up on state I didn't know that you were supposed to write I mean just oblivious oblivious to any any preparation or [noise]\nAnd I went up on stage and you know I had a big wig on and kind of a very eccentric you know I think it was like a silver\nMetallic kind of trench coat dress and and I remember just starting to talk about being in New York and being so\nTall and and wealthy and having everyone love you so much and I think at first it really through people as um you know it seems so you get hysterical and narcissistic and I thought oh they're not liking this\nAnd they wouldn't harder and I kept complimenting myself more and more but in ways that these were not factual compliments I was saying everything I wasn't\nI had you know Thirteen cents I was not tall I was not fabulous and I'm sought after in New York so I Do remember that feeling of them realizing that I'm making fun of myself am not complimenting myself and then when they started to laugh I just thought oh this relief on\nThis is really strange and fun and\nSuch a tight rope backed of where they didn't like me a minute ago and now I think it's okay and then then I could say anything because they knew it wasn't\nSerious and I think I pulled somebody up on stage and talked about us being engaged\nAnd he was clearly there with a date [laughter] and I didn't really know how to do jokes are just kind of\nAgain I went on as a character I went on his missed why I never would have gone on his myself but through a character I could\nBe more ridiculous in more bold and brazen and\nI Would not go and just popped out on someone's lap and talk about how much they love me but as this character I could and I just felt the great freedom in that we do always dress the way you describe a ... yeah I was always recognize lately completely ... in a different I was always in a huge leg to some very elaborate\nCostume 'em but oh almost club kiddy but not as alternative at that point I was living with a one of my still best friends Brian out what who now as a shoe designer but at the time he was at FIT so he was making all these different clothes so I Would wear you know I Would\nGrab things that he was making for class and we would go out and\nGo do stand up that night and they would throw in one of his like you know we we're ... swing caper some kind of scuba suits thing and it just seem so fun it was all so much more ridiculous than in fun and I just thought well why not what else do you get to wear like a scuba address out\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll talk more if you're just joining us
