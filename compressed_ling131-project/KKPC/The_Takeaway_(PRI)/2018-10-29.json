clay was let go and an unnamed third country as part of a settlement agreement much of what you're made confidential man was picked up in Syria in the fall of twenty Seventeen as they suspected member of the Islamic state US military held him in a rock for more than a year but did not charge him\nThat's exactly what you're doing then I think it's natural to expect that a few people within this movement are going to begin behaving as if they are at war and they're going to take drastic action and the sort of fear mongering that happens I think particularly around immigration in the country\nIs a big huge fuel behind white nationalist ideas and it's it's something that comes from mainstream corners of our of our country and politics and on the Internet and I think one of the scary things about it the the last post the hours right on gab is if you take out the last sentence the I'm going in\nThat reads essentially like many means on Facebook or do every day it reads like hundreds of posts on storm front do every day these are widely held ideas\nAt white nationalist recently have gone from referring to immigrants first is illegals which is insulting enough then as infiltrators and now as invaders and they speak about this as if they are wartime commanders which begins to justify drastic and violent action\nA President Trump has been calling himself a nationalist and\nSome people are saying that's a really ... were for white nationalists and that's\n... is like one step away from calling yourself a white nationalist and so I'm I'm Wondering how your hearing the president's self description as a nationalist and also how that is being heard in the white nationalist world\nYeah I think that a white nationalist feel like\nDonald Trump in some ways has been sort of winking at them and has been for\n... years now I'm In ways where he can use some of their language but also managed to explain that he was not saying it exactly that way so you know during the presidential campaign that sometimes meant\nThat Donald Trump would retweet a white genocide message from from the white genocide user and that exact phrase white genocide would be spread dolls Donald Trump's followers I think similarly\nWhen Donald Trump sort of said that he was on a nationalist and give it the defense for national is on a lot of white nationalist thought hey this is missing link to us that our ideas have real mainstream power and that he identifies as some of what we're doing even though of course he can't fully say that he's a white nationalist\nThe synagogue shooter rubber ... hours criticized Trump for calling himself a nationalist now are said he's not a nationalist he's a globalized globalized a buzz word for Jewish\nYes the globe with is a is definitely a buzz word for Jewish and above worried that\nThe president himself and and many people close to him have used often the final campaign ad of of Donald Trump's presidential campaign was it was a criticism against global west with a picture of George Soros and five others\nAll Jewish um you know with the with the the star of David also on this campaign ad and global is is is absolutely a code word for talking about about Jews particularly in the white nationalist world why\nBecause they believe the Jews have worked their way into huge global power and\nYou know and and it's interesting to read these white nationalist sites because they they speak of Jews almost as if\nI'm Jews are this is sort of evil superhero with huge amounts of power\nThey say that Jews have worm to their way in their words into control over the u._s. government over Hollywood over over huge international banks and and they believe that it's through this globalism the Jews are required enough power to begin to weaken the white race\n[noise] getting back to to balance the shooting he criticized President Trump or being too accommodating of Jewish influence\nAnd I'm Wondering here is it's confusing to white nationalists to feel on the one hand that as you put it Trump is kind of winking at them with language like calling himself a national that's been on the other hand his son in law Jared is Jewish\n... daughter of bunker converted to Judaism Trump right now has two Jewish grandchildren so you know you get the sense of white nationalist or a little confused\nAbout how to read the president\nThink that they are a little bit confused but it's the confusion that they're happy to live with because until this recent administration and waiting\nMuch of the re messaging that he did in terms of white nationalism plays into ... incidents like this I'm Derek with central to creating a phrase white genocide and that's a popular movement to then ask somebody going to a synagogue and murder eleventh people and leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself\nSpread again and again on the radio for years and you're young wife is a I think it's it's haunting\nEliza ...

social media posts and statements made by Robert Bowers who shot and killed eleven congregants at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement\nUh South Florida neighborhood and I ran a training sessions on how people could holding their message to try to get that audience not freak people out and just tap into things like don't you think all these Spanish signs on the highway or making everything worse than don't you think political correctness is just\nNot letting you talk about things that are real and getting people to agree on that would be the way forward\nAnd you won a local election as a member of the west Palm Beach county Republican committee but they wouldn't let you take your seat because of your views so I did that I Do feel like that for ... your plans for like I take over the Republican Party\nIt for my plans for um being on the administration of the Republican Party and its decision making in Palm Beach county but\nWinning the election was always the real goal it was just trying to prove that I could walk around and organizer campaign and go door to door\nAnd say everything that white nationalist bullied or at least Ninety percent of it without saying what the organization my dad ran was and that I could win on that the point was always to show that that could still work in the in the same year the ... was running his campaign\nWas going to win the presidency that that was a good time to start advocating white nationalist talking points that boggled bomb a winning was a sign that why people would start voting more strongly on a racist ideas not less\nYou know I put that into context for us with their lives Derrick\nLike the only person then who ... who is thinking that thought that with Obama running for president and then becoming a president this was like an opportunity for white nationalist\nI think a lot of white nationalist sub President Obama's election is a huge opportunity for their movements and because what white nationalist have done a with with dangerous effect is\nPlayed to this ah factually incorrect sense of grievance that exists unfortunately in large parts of white America polls consistently show that thirty to forty percent of white Americans believe that they experience more discrimination and more prejudice than people of color or than juice which is factually incorrect by every measure that we have\nBut by feeding that sense of grievance by plane to these ideas of your country is being taken away ah things are changing this is turning into a place that you don't recognize we don't need this kind of immigration we don't want these signs in Spanish\nThat has a huge effect ah with with a lot of voters and and it's got Derek elected and it is it's what has gotten other politicians elected in our country is well\nWithout identifying as white nationalist without outright saying hey I'm a white nationalist the race issue because I haven't read it uh-huh\nRight I think I think most most white people that do not want to be called racist and but many white people do have racist views and by\nHaving these conversations when they're not explicitly about race and and they don't involve slurs white nationalist can connect with a certain number of voters Derek and his father did some things to the fact that I I thought were really interesting and reporting the book\nOne of which is they storm front invested a lot of money into recording some country CDs there were slightly more explicitly white pride than\nWhat you'd see in mainstream country music and they would go to a big country concerts there were attended by majority white crowds in the south or an Allen Jackson concert somewhere in the deep south and they were going to the parking lot and they would hand out the CDs so to suddenly spreading these messages of more white pride songs to an audience that they thought was going to be more receptive to that message\nSo we were talking about how white supremacy kind of a ... was re branded into white nationalism and the goal of white nationalism is to separate the races\nThere are other ways that white white nationalist racism has been re branded and Derek I mean among the things that I think you try to do was take some of the violence out on the rhetoric so can you talk about that a little that\nI think one of the most effective things that I and some people I was working with a pretty small little group of people who I met while doing Internet radio we would organize little teams that are apparently on line it's wads\nThat would go to any article that anything to do with race and posts them carefully done talking points are we developed things like the phrase white white genocide\nSaying that all all non white immigration into white countries is white genocide and would talk about white pride talk as things like saying anti racism is a code word for anti white and tried to keep people on pretty tight talking points\nAnd send them out to try to change the conversation anywhere on the Internet where it was happening because we were focused really intently on changing the language and I'm trying to make it comfortable for people who did not want to be called racist to say everything else that white nationalist said\nI find it really interesting that you and your father tries to cleanse the violence and violent language in rhetoric out of a white nationalism or white supremacy\nAnd yet there you are describing\nThat you were trying to emphasize that immigration would lead to white genocide that white people\nLike these other guys coming and they're going to kill all of us that's really violent language it's not about you committing violence but it's about all the other people who aren't white committing violence committing murder committing genocide against you\nSo it's still the language of vines you just change to the actors are\nAnd who the victims and ... and the and this was a long process but um immigration was just going to out number white people in all their countries and that that was a threat to all the normal white people who are listening to the radio show or a posting in the comments section and the quite unlike\nWhat they were being told they were the aggressors that they were the people who are making society worse\n... being attacked it it's not like all the immigrants are going to take our jobs are they going to speak a foreign language we're not going to understand at an American culture you know won't be quote unquote cure you're talking about like genocide like they are going to kill all of us we will no longer exists\nI'm Talking about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme let it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kittens and the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against at every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that the entire ideology the end point to the ideology is built on a fallacy and and for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on\nWhat you mean you want to separate people have different races and different places like ... percent ... percent white is okay what percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea at\nSo which I think it's the core issue that and your racism nebulous thing that that that is and that even white nationalists when pressed to have a very difficult time to find that\nWas a really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never public er and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this is your how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to\nAre we going to do this or that and one of those with how to are we going to define who's white because only a white person could be a member of storm front\nBut there's no biological definition of white\nAnd so that was very clear there's no way to save the what's the twenty three and me a definition even if that had been around at the time\nAnd there's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white in and were something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so we conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come to ... who is white was that you had a\nGenerally be considered visually wide by most people in America and you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only
