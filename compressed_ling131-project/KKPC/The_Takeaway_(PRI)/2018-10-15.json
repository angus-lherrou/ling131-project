neighbors would be bumping the blues and so they were open their windows and you know it in Saturday's in the south that you know that's cleaning day\nSo I'm either here in the arm Oregon Diana Ross and rod Stewart from my mom's house or through my window the Lee family next door I could hear fats domino and you know some of the deeper southern blue stuff\nCan I ask you about the neighborhood you grew up in and if your parents work like they did for a living\nSo I grew up in Birmingham, Alabama\nThe west side the neighborhood is called west in the code three five to eleven one of the worst ZIP codes in the city in terms of crime statistics at the time [noise]\nA pretty rough neighborhood on the back side of the crack Arab ... we moved into west stand on the back end of white flight so in the eighties we had a couple of white neighbors but you know by the early nineties and you know\nCrack it really taking over the you know it was pretty much an all black neighborhood the one thing I've kinda joked about sometimes but it's actually true is that\nIf you're going to live in gain territory it behooves you to live deep in gang territory\nBecause where I Lived in Birmingham\nMost of the shootings were happening we're territory's met like on your borderline almost so there were a lot of bad people but a lot of the bad stuff that happened in the hood happened more so on the outskirts areas in relation to where I Lived\nDid you ever had are joining a gang\nNo I you know my mom my parents were separated until I was in the third grade so when my parents were reaching filed and we moved to burn a mother and are left Memphis and went to Birmingham you add taking piano lessons I was playing baseball I was in gifted courses\nYou know when I was ... when I got put on punishment and my mom would take my video games from me I read encyclopedias\nJust a you know I really out of lack of better options but you know I was always a brainy kid I had led goes and you know in gangs tend to benefit people that are type a personalities are people who strive to be a type a personality I was very aware of gangs\nThere was a housing complex South Park projects and they just built a new library in the commercial district on the other side of the projects in the library had computer classes\nAnd my mom wanted me to take computer classes so\nThe quickest way to the library was to cut through the project and sometimes I got picked on and you know and then there were days why didn't feel like being bother with that so you would have to walk around the south park project to get home which is a forty five minute detour\nAnd then you get home and your mom does where you've been which you've been out there and so now you're getting accused of being out doing bad things when in actuality we're voting them but you know you can explain that\nTo people with the saving grace for me was that my parents are bought me\nA really nice basketball goal and there's a park up the street from my house uh called powder Lee park\nAnd probably park had all the you know it was a municipal city park\nAnd he had all the hoops and you know it'd be bank is out there and proudly part sat on the edge of gangster disciple and vice Laura territory so sometimes it would go down so my mom didn't really want me around that element so I and I've never talk with her about this\nBut my guess is that her ideology was at the boy like shooting basketball let's put a basketball hoop in the yard and that way he won't be probably park if something goes down and it it's just I don't know if his fate or what man but\nWe had a house one of the few houses in a neighborhood with a two car garage which meant the way the goal was set up you could play almost half court if you played off into the dirt on the driveway so we basically had half court\nAnd we had the best basketball go with a breakaway ram because of the city park the goals always break because they're arrested and crush DNA replace them with other rusty and crush the rams so all the gangbangers came to our house to shoot hoops lately the whatsoever\nYou out of trouble and all of us that come into play basketball\nBut so then you asked me what my father did and our time then okay my father was a radio personality in the city and I respect that my dad was\nA civil rights journalists back in the sixties and seventies he was embedded in any any march you can find any footage of I'm sure my dad is no more than two or three steps behind Dr King covering the march\nMy dad did morning news on the radio my father was the voice of the city of Birmingham for very long time his name rank out and out of respect to my father guys will lead guns around the corner they believe the liquor up the street\nAnd when they came to our house to Switzerland so you might feel vice lord and a gangster disciple you it's it's it's plausible\nAnd there's no drama out of respect to my father and my mom because my mom also didn't take no smack of anybody and I think there's something to showing kids you know and my mom would bring ice water out like she was nice so\nI grew up in a bad neighborhood but I had a lot of guts out a lot of circumstances in my favor that kept me on the good side of the wrong people\nMy guess is Roy would junior a correspondent on the Daily Show we'll be right back but first I Want to take a moment to urge you to support the station when it comes to news and popular culture nothing on the radio compares to the debt and breath of public radio\nWe can do that kind of programming only because he
