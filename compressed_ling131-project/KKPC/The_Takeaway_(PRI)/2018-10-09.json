Michael approaches the Florida Gulf Coast governor Rick Scott is urging residents to take this one seriously\nDon't take a chat a hundred and twenty mile an hour winds were going to have twelve inches of rain in some places but twelve feet potentially a storm surge do not take a chance\nHe says impact will start to be felt as soon as tomorrow so people need to prepare now for this potentially catastrophic storm\nHurricane Michael is forecast to be the most destructive storm to hit the Florida Panhandle in decades the storm will be life threatening an extremely dangerous\nBecause so much of being in a gang is about face and it's about fronting\nIt matters a great deal if someone say find your Facebook it to counter trolls you or a leaves a disrespectful Instagram comment\nAnd something else that's happened as this gave violence moves the social media is that it also means that violence is no longer about who's feuding for a particular block but gangs at the same franchise even if there are many miles apart might start fighting each other over something that originated on line\nSo so if someone calls you out on line you're going to respond and it may not it may be on line but it may also be on the street right\nAnd that's the difference between a gang feuds in the past is if two people died yelled words or the other in the street I'm only the people around them would hear it and the moment would be done if you posted on line\nThe whole world is watching at least in their perception and it sticks up there until something is done about it and that's why it's at the origin of so many of these uh fights and not just a eighty percent of fights in school sparked from something on line but also of course the spate of gang killings\nAnd what's interesting and a little bit scary is that we see the same phenomena of Internet beeps at the gang level moving up to levels of drug cartels all the way to how it's changed a diplomacy how it's changed politics\nWe have this question of what happens when leaders of nations are interacting in the same way when they're having these beliefs in front of the world will make it harder for them to negotiate if the whole world knows that they've been insulted and they've done nothing about it\nYou have an interesting kind of looking at the development of mass communications you say that the Internet is the most consequential communications development since the invention of the written word and it it really got super charged when everything could be\nDone on smartphones and\nThere are many examples where social media has have been used to fuel popular uprisings ... the most striking example in the Arab Arab Spring as a time a lot of people talking about social media is being this powerful democratizing force I mean now you know expression is in the hands of everyone the\nTrouble is the authoritarian regimes also had access to the tool how did they strike back\nTheir spring was probably the high point of the techno optimism about the Internet and social media you have everything from a national media sources describing it's a liberating\nPower to people in Egypt are literally naming their kids Facebook but then authoritarians figure it out they figure how to fight back um we use this idea of like war to express that there's two sides to it and so there's always a back and forth\nAnd so we've seen is that authoritarian to figure it out also how to use social media and a couple of key ways one is that it gives them a new way of monitoring their population and what they're thinking and what they're saying ah for example there's the question on line or does reach we equal endorsement\nWell now we finally have the answer or the example we use is a journalist and turkey who reach wheat something or just for a couple of minutes before he takes it down and yet it lands in Turkish prison so government can use the power of the law to monitor\nThen you have this new model that China's presenting which um is this almost a perverse incentive system it's called the social credit system where essentially all your different online activities everything from what you say\nTo what you buy can all be monitored and it's brought together and to a single score of your social trustworthiness\nSo for example or if you buy diapers your score goes up because you're a good parent if you play video games too long your score goes down because you're screwing around\nThat score than is used to uh give you rewards and society everything from a free charges of your smartphone at coffee shops to a negative side you can't take planes it's used in job evaluations it's even used in dating profiles so it affects uh how\nShould uh eight days of Israeli airstrikes that drew Peter myself to this subject to virtually and got us researching it ever since [noise]\nUh this military campaign was accompanied by a remarkable online viral marketing campaign the campaign to twenty twelve opens with the assassination of a high level Amoss militant\nThat's not particularly unusual but is it what is unusual is that the drone strike video was up within a few hours and the official Twitter account of the Israeli defense forces was broadcasting it out again and again\nIn time a Hamas Twitter proxies respond threatening war and how far\nAnd is the operation commenced has Israel would strike particular targets it would\nPut out information about what had been done about the the weapons caches that had been recovered then among us would respond in a similarly taunting manner\nAnd what's important is that this wasn't just the social media operatives if these two sides but also millions and millions of Twitter messages exchanged back and forth by the the proxies of one side or another ten million and all and the first twenty twelve conflict Ninety percent of which were outside the region\nAnd this was an example of a limited military campaign that nonetheless was a global war for public opinion and this set a model that we're starting to see in all future conflicts\nAnd two things stand out about it the first is that we could all participate it was people outside the region or deciding\nYes one of the challenges base is that\nUh we don't have a good handle on the link so you'll hear a lot of discussion of Russian trolls will trolls are basically you know people on line or trying to provoke some kind of emotional response usually to make you angry\nBut when we're talking about the Russian operations they broke into two parts there were sock puppets those are real humans behind the account who are posing as something that they are not so at some a Russian hipster in St Petersburg\nWho's acting like they are an American veteran a grandmother from Texas but then you have\nAlso bought these are machines these are algorithms that are basically pushing out messages automatically the combination of the two can be incredibly powerful because the sock puppets can say one thing and then the box can drive that message viral by having thousands\nOr tens of thousands of voices echo it out further\nYou know repeatedly these social media platforms like Twitter get rid of these accounts but they have ways to automatically regenerate\nAnd what's worrying as we look ahead is that these pots don't necessarily need to be active now something that these Russian operatives but anyone who wants to manipulate fisherman\nConversation something they're increasingly doing is creating accounts and having them lie dormant\nAnd have a a history of messages that seem authentic and benign and not related to a hot political event so when they activate them months or years down the road you'll be much harder to detect them as something other than a real person\nYou cite an amazing number here you said when Donald Trump announced for president in twenty Fifteen fifty eight percent of his Facebook followers were from outside the United states right how how do we know that is\nSo you're able to detect the origin of accounts ah one of the new rules of the game when everything is on line is it out in the open\nSo you can follow it you can see the patterns of behavior maybe one of the more notable aspects of a Donald Trump's a follower account is that\nAh at that point in time about four percent supposedly lived in Mexico now of course these were not real Mexican citizens behind these accounts\nThese were in essence fake followers created to give the semblance of a massive on line following that can then be turned into a real online following by driving your messages viral right\nBut at fifty eight percent of the followers from outside the u._s. can we infer that a lot of them are fake\nYes a vast majority of them were they were basically a bot accounts generated out of what are known as click farms are these are almost think of like a sweatshop factory it's the same thing for people that are essentially being paid\nTo click on accounts in places like the Philippines or Bangladesh\nAnd then you combine these physical people with bought and you can give you a a much greater power and politics\nYou know that's been written about the Russian efforts to interfere in the American twenty sixteen election we've seen indictments give us your sense of the scale and impact of this effort\nThe challenge with this is that the information about it came out and little dribs and drabs and the result is that the scale of it is not appreciated by most people just how big in number but in extent the campaign was so for example if you're looking at Facebook\nAh it now ... says you know roughly over a hundred and forty million Americans about half the population solve some aspect of a Russian um information misinformation pushed on lie\nTo you move over to other platforms like for example Twitter where it's literally a hundreds of millions of messages being retreated back and forth\nA great illustration of this would be one single account um tendency GOP that was a posing as if it was the hub for Tennessee Republicans we now know that it was one of these Russian sitting in St Petersburg\nIt was the seventh most red account on election day not the seventh most read of the thousands of Russian accounts but the seventh most red overall to you saw similar campaigns playing out on Instagram to or there is actually one that was just detected a couple of weeks ago on Reddit\nAnd the impact of this was not just what the Russians were pushing\nBut the echo effect into the broader population including the media itself\nOne of the uh accounts that was um posing as a young American Woman\nShe was actually quoted in everything from a Washington Post to New York times to USA Today and the like\nAs if she was a real young American Woman and actually again it was one of these Russians behind it and so you know it's up for the historians to ah you know argue about whether at swung the election or not and such a close election what we can say is the scale of it wasn't meant\nAnd that the Russians believe it worked because they're coming back for more they're doing it in the election right now\nEmmerson broken writes about conflict and social media ...
