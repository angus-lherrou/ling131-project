he's earring strong support for nominee Brett Kavanaugh from fellow Republicans Kevin off his vehemently denied allegations that he sexually assaulted women decades ago trumps of the high Court

wait\nThat's NPR's Julie McCarthy more than a million people have been affected there's no food or water and powerful earth are aftershocks continue aid groups are urging people to stay outdoors [noise]\nFrance says the government of Iran is behind a ... bomb plot last June outside Paris NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports that in retribution Francis frozen some Iranian assets\nFrench authorities say the planned attack was on a gathering that's organized every year by an Iranian group in exile and National Council of resistance of Iran\nThere were several European and Arab ministers in attendance as well as former New York city Mayor Rudy Giuliani in a joint statement the French interior foreign and economic ministry said an incident of such gravity on French national territory could not do and punished\nAnd you're right that the department of commerce and very little to do with directly with commerce and if in fact forbidden by law from engaging in business and you say that the department of commerce should really be called the department of information or the department of data why\nBecause that's what it does it's you know inside of the department of commerce you have\nThe census for example which is the best picture we have of ourselves as a society you have the a collection and assimilation of all the economic statistics and above all more than half the budget of the department is spent gathering weather and climate data I mean the national weather services inside the department of commerce\nAnd one of the great opportunities that exists with the federal government is the the better use of the day to collect all of a sudden we're able to parse the date in in ... and use the data in ways we've never been able to use it\nAnd that's a similarly stopping that the that the person that Trump put in charge of the Commerce Department Wilbur Ross is not interested in ... he sees the job is kind of like cheap trade negotiator which is odd because we have achieved trade negotiator\nAnd one of the big like data pool that um the Commerce Department is responsible for is the U.S census\nAnd the head of the Commerce Department Wilbur Ross is not now involved in a lawsuit pertaining to a question on the census [noise] um I I don't know if there's a definitive or not the question on the twenty Eighteen cents is whether it's on there and\nWhile they're still they're still argument about whether they're going to insert on the steps is a question of establishing whether the person who's reply to the census citizen ... will do is queer the responses to the census\nLet's let's talk about why 'cause a lot of people will be afraid to answer that question\nWill be people will be afraid to answer the question or if that people will be suspicious of the motives of the census takers\nRight and ... and a lot of immigrants live with somebody who isn't here legally so even if you're here legally if you know someone who isn't you might be afraid to say that you're an immigrant\nI think at this point that even people who are here who are legal who are fearful so actually back up a second they haven't even the gun to prepare the ... for the census I mean that the the real problem with the census is that it's way behind schedule and it hasn't been budget it for\nSo there's some question whether they're going to be able to pull off the census in the first place but then how you pull it off\nIs another question in there and starting this they're inserting a question that seems designed to dissuade especially Latinos from answering it\nAnd one of the consequences if Latinos are underrepresented in the census\nFor starters you don't get a picture a correct picture of the ... congressional districts so we're districts need to be with redrawn because of shifting in the population they won't be redrawn\nOf late one of the things we've learned is just how valuable the date of the government collects is\nResearchers have been doing things with this data that they've never been able to do before and so for example um we wouldn't know that there was an opioid crisis in the country if the data on prescription drugs had not been made available and not been possible\nIf we don't have a picture of what the society looks like there's all sorts of misunderstanding of the society that will occur\nSo that people suing Wilbur Ross the plaintiffs include over a dozen states in big cities who say that he acted improperly and trying to add this question about are you um are you a\nUS citizen I'm that he acted improperly and trying to add that to the census and\nThe states and cities fear their political representation will be calculated incorrectly because they will be missed represented in the sense is if this question discourages immigrants from answering so Wilbur Ross ... did you\nYou surprised at the choice of him to head the department of commerce since as you say\nOf very slow moving problems that are dealt with in a slow way but they require a long term approach and on top of this enterprise has been has been thrust is very short term\nAttitude I mean the ... the Trump Administration is incredible kind of living from news cycle the news cycle and the public has gone along with it and that's the that's that's the frightening thing to me\nAnd you see a lot of action happening at the department level that that kind of level of government where things are being done with physicians aren't being replaced where people are being appointed who aren't really um appropriate for the position\nAnd people and they're people who have the ability to dismantle critical functions as the government who also have a financial incentive to do so because they have some conflict\nSo let's get back to the Commerce Department which you write about in his death threats accomplished prime includes the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in LA yang Noah and you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department is really Noah first of all what did you find in the Commerce Department\n[laughter] it's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent it's sixty five percent or so of the budget it goes to this one thing I Know it eats the Commerce Department and they simply don't National Weather service by the national weather service is a bit and now there was there which is the biggest part of no\nBut this was where it gets curious Christie does wrangle a few may raise a few million dollars to abide by the federal law and he builds actually I think are quite good transition they had hundreds of people who were really qualified to go into the various departments\nAnd receive the government for their ... the Obama administration\nIs so the bottom and Mr Asian has has built this great course and how the government works it's it's you know hundreds of briefing books that have been compiled over the past year\nAnd it's not an ideological briefings you give the same briefing whether the Democrat or Republican wins and it it really is just explaining how they dealt with problems so you understood so this is how we dealt with this week a virus so if you have another pandemic or through a threat of pandemic\nHere's how you might do it you might disagree with how we did it but but this is how we did it and an awful lot of what's supposed to go on there is just that this is these are the problems\nThis is what this department does\nOoh this is how you do it and Trump took all those people who are meant to receive those briefings and fired them the day after the election so we had nobody to go into these places to receive the briefings why did he fire them\nGreat question the simple short answer is that Jared Kushner told into and the jar cushion that did not like the idea of Chris Christie running the operation because Chris Christie as as a prosecutor in New Jersey it put Kushner's father and\nBut that really doesn't explain it I don't say because there was no reason Trump had to listen to ... and there's also no reason you couldn't have just fired Christian kept everybody else on board I think what happened was that a number of people who were in Trump's ear and especially Michael Flynn\nWho wanted to be the national security advisor or were left off the list of people who are going to get jobs important jobs and the government\nAnd they were left off the list because the transition timid vetted all these people and found the problems with them so some of those problematic people wanted important jobs in government and they'd persuaded Trump to get rid of this operation that was going to forbid them from having them\nI think that's what happened and a couple that with that is a ... was Trump's total\nDisdain for an indifference to the government I mean if he had any awareness of the complexity operation he was about to have to run or you'd be terrified to get rid of the people who are going to help them do it but he really I think he really thought I just don't need to know about that\n[noise] so was there like a last straw for Chris Christie that got him fired [noise]\nI think what happened was is that they allowed Chris Christie to build this transition team because Christie explained it was the law they had to do it they didn't have any choice\nTrump pay no attention didn't take it seriously was irritated when every heard money was being sped\nBut no one really focused on it because no one thought it was ever going to be used that they didn't think they were going to win so Jared Kushner although we over saw it kind of closely and made sure that Christie wasn't doing anything he didn't approve of\nDidn't ever really imagine that Christie was going to be in a position of real authority because Donald Trump is not going to win the minute it became real they focused\nI think it ... he was never going to be allowed to do the job because it but they never thought that job was going to be done if you're just\nJoining us my guest is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist risk and the book is about the federal government under President Trump and the book

joining us my guest is Michael Lewis he's best known for his books like money ball the big short and the undoing project to all of which have been bestsellers his new book the fifth risk is about the federal government under Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and commerce departments\nAfter President Trump was inaugurated he sent in what you described as a small landing team led by Thomas Pyle the president of the American energy alliance which you describe as you know a group funded with millions of dollars from Exxon Mobil and Koch Industries\nThat basically represents their point of view [noise] so what was the landing team and what was piled tasked with doing\nSo landing team is a grand phrase\nFor what arrived at the department of energy because it was really just pile and he didn't show up until a month after the election and he would have been in theory tasked with receiving\nYou know hundreds of hours of briefings from people in the department of energy who would prepare them but he what he did instead was met met for about an hour with a couple of people in the secretary's office and listen politely and didn't take notes\nAnd the people who were running the department of jihad the impression that he had no interest in what they had to say\nOne of the things he did um is part of the quote landing team we send a list of Seventy four questions he wanted answers to Seventy four questions to the department of energy what were some of the questions\nHe wanted lists of uh names of anybody in the department who attended meetings that were associated with climate change\nHe was trying to identify people who might be hostile to the fossil fuels industry I think so the department didn't actually respond by giving him the list of names but he ... the bigger point was\nHe came in in what were they interpreted as a hostile spirit I'm signaling that the new administration was not did not approve of the various attempts\nThe department of energy was making to wean us from fossil fuels and it is you know part of the department of energy mission to engage in and fund basic research in alternative energy\nSo you know your previous book about the science of of risk and about trying to kind of quantifying away how the human mind works when it's assessing risk that book was called the undoing project do you feel in a way that your new book could have been called the undoing project because in some ways\nDepartments and you know I and the Trump Administration are getting and then be because there aren't a lot of people to replace the people from the Obama administration yet and some of the people who have been put in positions to run those departments are antagonistic toward those department\nSo yes there's actually there's actually a direct connection between the undoing project my last book in this one is what got me into this book in the first place one of the insights that draw\nOut of the work of the psychologist Dan economists and Amos too risky who are studying the way people judge risk is that when you changed the ... people don't sets it\nEspecially with catastrophic risk you take something that it is a one in a million chance of it happening and change it to one in ten thousand people don't feel that\nAnd I was thinking of that when Trump came in and approached the federal government the way he did because\nOne way of thinking of the federal government is is this vast portfolio of risks many of them potentially catastrophic risk the risks of a pandemic or a the risk of a a nuclear accident or risk of a terrorist attack or the you know one after another and many of these\nAre not risk that most people are thinking about the risk that the nuclear waste site in half or Washington leeches\nPlutonium into the Columbia River and poison the whole Pacific Northwest and I thought Trump's approach is effectively taking lots of you know one in a million or one of the ... hundred thousand risks and making them more likely making them all more likely\nBecause he's putting people in charge of the risk you don't know anything about it and I ... the society doesn't feel it caught him into ... showed you the people don't really feel this\nAnd that inside is what got me going in the first place [noise]\nSo you used to work on Wall street way back in the day and you wrote about that experience in your first book liars poker last month mark the tenth anniversary of the financial collapse of two thousand eight the market has more than recovered over that time\nBut some people are starting to say this might be another bubble um\nHow are you interpreting having written a book recently about risk and having you know been having written about the financial crisis what you've done um I'm actually in what your thoughts are about whether we are now in terms of financial stability in the end and and world markets", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Takeaway (PRI)", "city":
