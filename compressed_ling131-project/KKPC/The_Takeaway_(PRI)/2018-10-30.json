took three years in twenty draft you deliberately right every I'm In like an expletive\nWithin reason behind it well really and uh-huh and that's very intentional and that's you know capturing very realistic dialogue\nThat seems improvise is a complement to these young performers acting and you know really deliberate thought in how these people speak to one another [noise]\nDid you learn to speak that way\n[noise] yes I think I was taught and maybe culturally we were taught at that time if you're a man and you express your feelings are you expressed that something hurts you then you should be made fun of\nAnd that kind of repression leads to anger and anger leads to bad behavior and I think I wanted to show a film about young men with an inability to express themselves\nBut the thing is like you or\nAs a child and then as a young teen you were writing like skips for The Simpsons I'm not on a professional ... you were just like writing for The Simpsons so you ... yeah we had both ambition and also a a facility for words you lived in a world the words\nYou wanted to communicate on the page and I'm thinking what must have been like for you to have this urge to write to communicate to make written jokes\nReferring to pop culture with characters in it I mean that's what The Simpsons is all about and at the same time you're like but you're not supposed to express yourself\nBecause you're a boy [noise] yeah and I'm not I'm not victimizing myself I think as a straight white male I have more privileged and I can't even comprehend of course yeah ... my last\nYou you're kind of suppressing something that came really natural to you that you really valued\nRight and I also I have always been expected to be a certain type of thing and I played right into that out of my own insecurity as a person\nAnd I as a kid was very funny identifies a writer first and foremost in my life after just rather person uncle stuff like that first occupation I Would lift it would be a writer [noise]\nAnd then going into a culture where that kind of verbal communication or emotional communication is mocked and then on top of that\nYou know even when I became a well known public figure I think the duality of comedy and being overweight and all this stuff allowed for jokes\nAnd punches to be made about me and towards me\nWhich turned me angrier which made me communicate worse and then when you're funny\nYou become a bit mean all speak for myself you think of the thing to hurt the other person 'cause you assume they're about to hurt you it all plays into each other in this very weird cyclical thing and then I became famous as an overweight comedian\nAnd then I felt like I wasn't given the respect as a human being\nA lot of humor and it's like self deprecating humor and self deprecating humor doesn't go over and that kind of like teen masculine I'm like athletic culture\nI say this is an outsider to all of that [laughter] but but anyway did you have an impulse toward self deprecating humor but no I knew that that wouldn't be appropriate to the scene that you were in\nI think my point is I'm trying to even in my twenties even going through a career publicly going through my twenties publicly either being mean and defensive or self deprecating to a point where you're beating yourself up to feel like you deserve a seat at the table are ...\nThe Newman center friends of chamber music that come\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guess is Jonah Hill and he's known for starring in movies like Superbad money ball and the wolf of Wall Street I Want to ask you again about all The Simpsons scripts that you wrote when you're a kid did you ever try submitting one of them\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting them would you be willing\nTo share a story line or a joke from one of your early scrap\nHere's where I'll say I think the strongest episode was I was in a file since a young age and my parents were incredibly ah let's just say how would I put it they encouraged me or let me watch movies beyond my age because they saw how interested I was in film\nSo perhaps ignore the content matter of certain thoughts but I'd maybe should have waited to see till I was older so I had seen the godfather to really young age because my dad's favorite movie\nAnd I wrote The Simpsons godfather spoof\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten that I think is a I I was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the analogy between the characters from the godfather and the ... and The Simpsons were clever for a nine year old [laughter] who is who\nMarge was Don Corleone [laughter] because of nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer so she would be the chess player sort of quiet low key chess player that would become the Don\nYou know I got like an Asian off of that and then ... and brought me in to read for that little one line and four year old virgin and [noise] I don't know then I stuck around [noise]\nSo there's one specific line I'm going to ask you about that this line fits are so well with what we were talking about before about\nHaving to learn a kind of masculinity an attitude that you hadn't learned and skateboard culture and you might be able to gas line I'm going to ask you about\nThis from Superbad which you start in with um with Michael Cera and um [noise] your your your high school kid and this and you know you're not part of the cool crowd and all and one of the really popular high school girls play by Emma Stone who you know ... or within the Netflix series maniac\nI Love her yeah I from a distance I Love her to\n[laughter] than the decision if you already has the honor for as a person could use a an actor\nGood good that always makes me happy to hear but anyway she's going to be throwing a party while her parents are gone and she needs somebody to buy alcohol and even though you're under age you just said you're going to get the alcohol you know bring it to the party and be the hero and so you're you're trying to tell the Michael Cera character\nOr about this and he's kind of skeptical of this is a very good idea the Iliad and be able to do it\nAnd then you say and I'm going to say like the really clean version\nOf this because it's much too expletive laced for us to play this on the radio that you basically say you know have girls say I was so drunk last night I shouldn't have had sex with that guy we could be that mistake\nSo gosh that sounds you know I mean women are so furious about had teenage boys an adult men tried to get girls and women trunk or drug ... to get them into bad\nI mean it literally horrified [laughter] what a hard thing to hear because the idea behind that is this young man is hoping the young woman is showing ... braided that her judgment would be so poor that she would make a mistake by sleeping with him\nAnd that is incredibly wrong and I didn't write that film so I think comedy has a really hard time and the aging process because things that are funny at a moment or people might laugh at\nUs times changed I was never right\nBut for some reason it was okay to make a joke about it at that point where as of course it's not now hearing it now sounds terrific how does this sound to you awful [laughter]\nBut it didn't sound good to me than either I didn't like the idea that kind of like disregard for girls are women just like that never sounded upsetting uh yeah [laughter]\nI was deeply upsetting I you know what to be honest with you I was twenty three and I not that that's an excuse but I don't think I had the emotional maturity\nTo understand that those words are that joke would be so horrible you know because that's the reality I don't think I ever thought of that as a reality 'cause it's not my experience and so now thinking of that is a reality is very hard to hear\nYeah well thank you for being reflective about that [noise] so um so it's been interesting Thirteen Years later after super bad to see how you and how ... how and Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg\nHave evolved you know and that and the subjects you've all taken on since then because I ... I think things have changed\n[noise] yeah and I literally can only speak for myself and as an actor in that moment I didn't see how hard that is and how ugly that joke is that I don't want to speak for the filmmakers 'cause this is such a larger\nHard issue where a Thirteen year old joke stands now when I hear that it's very disturbing but I also know those people that wrote it and they're really good people so it's just so complicated I never want to be hurtful to anybody either side\nOne only take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is

nineties\n[noise] you know it's been interesting to like first see kind of like I'm coming to manhood on screen 'cause she was started in your teens I'm super bad you a lot in your early twenties yeah\nAnd and now and like in the past I don't know ... years five six seven years you started playing more dramatic roles\nYou know in films like Wall Street and Moneyball how did you get the word out to film directors that you were interested in making the transition to more dramatically [noise]\nIt's just by choices you know um I had seen the puffy chair which I loved and I reached out to the ... brothers after super bad came out and it was like I Would love to work with you\nAnd they gave me this part and Cyrus which is a film that I Love is that um was a great experience with John she Riley ... she told me [noise]\nAnd then in ... and then Bennett Miller was making money ball and Catherine had talked about me to ban it and then then it's off Cyrus and in Kashmir money ball\nAnd then in the interim a\nI continue to do some comedy films that were funny and fun and then uh I had heard about\nThe wolf of Wall Street and I asked you audition\nAnd um\nI knew that was going to fight to get that part but I I knew I wanted that part really badly and then when I wanted to write and direct I think I had a lot of opportunities to do that if I wanted to make a mainstream comedy\nUh\nAnd when I really thought about it I was like wow things in my life are happening that are intense\nAnd am I going to be happy\nJust doing what is expected of me or what my heart really want so I have to figure out who I Am I have to figure out how to love who I Am\nAnd I have to figure out what my voice is\nAs a filmmaker and when I looked to my heroes like Mike Nichols or Barry
