morning of their own or government official told the kingdom state run news agency but they totally reject any diplomatic threats according to the official quote if Saudi Arabia received any action will respond with greater action\nAnd the Saudis said the widespread allegations of murder are nothing more than fall so it's still they have yet to offer any official information about the

think this this is about trying to keep the Republican base fired up after Kavanaugh getting confirmed we saw spike and enthusiasm with the Republican base during the Kavanaugh fight well there's a big risk because they won't be that motivated\nI took one Republican strategist Ken Spain who was the communications director for the ... the arm that gets ... tries to get Republicans elected to the house and he said look Republicans have been suffering from an intensity deficit over the course of the last few months and raising the threat level will hopefully translate to generating greater turnout\nAnd he said this really has to do with those red states like Texas in Tennessee\nFor the Senate to try to maintain the Senate because this fires up Republicans\nThat was NPR's to ... this is\nThe politics show from NPR and we are talking to demand it go Ayesha Rascoe and Kelsey Snell Kelsey and that's\nPrecisely what McConnell said when I talked to him he said that this is coming at the perfect time\nThat is coming on the eve of the election and when I asked him to predict how many Republicans were going to be in the Senate next year he declined to give me an actual number but what he said to me was that voters are going to know that the Supreme Court fight\nUnderscores for Republican voters that the Senate is what he called in the personnel business and that the project of confirming judges is over for the last two years for President Trump is Republicans lose\nDemocrats reacting to all of this\nDemocrats haven't been really able to come up with a clear message\nAnd to frame the message in a way that people could relate to to to say that this is what we're fighting for this is what we are concerned about this is why people are out there screaming or why people were out there who why people may be so passionate\nThat they haven't been really able to articulate that well\nAnd we saw the former attorney general Eric Holder who's been involved in these midterms\nGo out say someone says if you don't when they go low we [noise] go low we can do that for all kinds of outrage\nOn the right uh you know people going after him saying he was spring on violence and he said they should stop the fake outrage but certainly feeling them\nAnd it it seems like of this moment people are tired when you talk about civility when you talk about uh going high they're saying that didn't work for us and they're saying that the other side has not done that so they would argue that the Republicans have not gone high that the Tea Party was not polite\nThat President Trump is not civil and he's he's not always polite and he says a lot of things are so why shouldn't they fight fire with fire\nWill also when I talked to activists up here a couple of them said to me that there don't see a point in being polite when they feel like they're ... they're very real risks to some of their core beliefs in the political system right now and that when\n... when President Obama was being polite it was when he was in power and that there's just simply a difference here that knew that Democrats feel that they have no power and the situation and their visceral reaction is coming from that place of of fear\nAnd frankly there's a frustration on the part of Democrats you know President Obama thought that he could get a lot of things done with Republicans in a good faith negotiating way and it just\nDidn't happen that was NPR's Ayesha Rascoe Kelsey Snell and medical ... thanks everyone thank you thank you\nAnd Dominican stick with it now it's time for racial [noise]\nRuns the United states is that the caller I Need your help we will never got down to fight and if we [noise]\nEvery week we focus on one race in the country that speaks to a larger theme playing out in races all over the place this week we're looking at Minnesota's eighth congressional district diminished go you're still with us and I want to bring in mark the deck like of Minnesota Public\nRadio hey mark thanks for joining us\nIt's my pleasure I'm a big fan of the show thanks for having me\nOff thank you so mark what's it been like they're on the ground\nWell Minnesota's just a hot bed of political activity this year not just in the eighth district remembers sooner Al Franken he resigned in January\nHis seat needs to be filled in the special election a Minnesota senator Amy ... is up for her regular reelection Minnesota's also choosing a new governor and three new members of Congress were really busy over here\nYou know the sixty a competitive districts that the cook Political Report says either lean to one party or as a toss up only three of those are democratic held seats in Minnesota there are two of those seats and one of them is what we're talking about here today\nSo again we're looking at the age congressional district in Minnesota diminished go who is in this race\nWell this is an open seat that's because the Democrat Rick Nolan who's the congressman holds the seat is not running for reelection in Minnesota the Democratic party is referred to as the Democratic farmer labor party and that candidate\nIs Joe ... he's a former state representative is thirty two years old or the Republican candidate if Pete's daughter\nThe St Louis county commissioner he's a retired tooth Minnesota police officer and there's an independent in this race too so how he's going to shape this race is going to be interesting his name is ray sandman people call him skipped\nSo this is a district where in sort of an unusual thing for twenty Eighteen Republicans are on often right and if\nDemocrats want to try to take back the house they need twenty three seats to net to do that and you know they need to hold places like this if\nThey want to have a real shock marquee this district like\nWell it's massive it starts just north of Minneapolis St Paul and spends all the way up to the Canadian border it's really been a democratic stronghold Democrats have held at since Nineteen forty seven with the exception of a Tea Party upset in twenty can\nEver since that upset it has been in play Republicans every two years of a run a campaign that have come close to winning\nThey're very optimistic this time around because Donald Trump last Minnesota but one by almost sixteen percentage points from the eighth district they think this area is one of the best if not the best chance for them to flip a seat\nYeah I mean this district is heavily union white working class it was actually the largest swing of any district in the country from President Obama\nTo President Trump and to the demographics tell a lot of that story than they do and the Republican Pete Stauber has been campaigning since the summer of two thousand Seventeen he's doing what you're with Donald Trump's blessing the president was here in June campaigning for him\nDemocrats on the other hand were taken by surprise when Rick Nolan said he wouldn't seek reelection earlier this year very far a primary battle resented which came out on top but that was just mid August ... at a significant jump on Democrats at least when it comes to campaigning\nMark what are the issues at play mining\nIs a big issue up in the district the third party candidate is talking about opposing the mind he says it could threaten the water resource\nThis could have a significant effect on the race if the Independence Party candidate Beulah support that would have otherwise gone up a Democrat both ... been talking also a lot about taking back our government here is a Democrat ... reason to be\nWith Russell control from the special interests in Washington DC and invest power and the people in rules just like this\nHealth care is another big issue in this race ... like many Democrats is calling for single payer universal healthcare stubborn says that's a bad idea here is we're done if it's going after sub or on the issue at that same debate\nMy opponent ... two minutes now to talk about health care that's not what for one single idea that would result in coverage for more Americans\nCaught up with stubborn the southern end of the district north of the twin cities recently he's also trying to frame or done of it is a political opportunity someone who moved from Minneapolis back up north to get into the race\nFifty two years of of life on this earth and I I've spent the vast majority of my life outside powers to my own and has been in politics his entire life\nMy hearing from voters you're out there\nWell people are engaged Democrats and Republicans both claim that they have the most voter enthusiasm behind them as the election draws near\nA Democrats are saying some people who voted for Donald Trump of buyer's remorse and they're looking now to try to cast a vote against Trump\nIn the mid term elections in support people like a ... Republicans oh say they're equally fired up and they're saying as we've been hearing about all week that's a battle over Brett Kavanaugh has really really fired up\nTheir base and they think that that is going to be enough at least a northern Minnesota to flip a district from democratic to Republican control\nWell a mark thank you for joining us absolutely my pleasure thanks for having me and NPR's America ... thank you do your welcoming\n[noise]\n\n\nThat is the politic show from NPR we'll be right back support comes from the U.S Olympic Training center in Colorado Springs home to Olympic and Paralympic athletes training for gold tourist Monday through Saturday nine AM to four pm shopping visitor center opens Sundays eleven AM to five PM team usa dot org [noise]\nIt's not like you know it's made easy you know we vote on\nTuesdays uh which was designed for an agrarian society you know in November So you know this has not been updated and we definitely have one party that has more of a sense of urgency\nTo go and make these changes to make it easier to vote because a lot of these voters have been talking about our core key democratic group\nRight to make and there's one other group actually I really wanted us to talk a bit about anti euro printing money because they also tend to lean more different\nPanic and those are folks of color in particular Latino and Asian Americans have really low voter participation rate there even lower in mid term election years\nAnd ironically the two fastest growing groups in the country ... exactly and and instill you hear this time and again and you can even go to places you know this election cycle people have talked to a lot about Beto O'Rourke who is challenging Ted Cruz in Texas that to the Senate\nAnd and what that could mean and we have one of our colleagues who also went down and spend some time in El Paso that is where ... is from\nAnd and she met people who didn't ... didn't really know who's running for office and it just felt like they didn't put their face in politics because they felt like they've never banked on political institutions changing their lives and there's one woman in particular who made this point uh her name is Christina Rodriguez she was in El Paso but I\nReally don't think about it I kind of sad to say but I don't think about like okay well what can be better and it's like I Do what I can do to make my life better don't depend on them to change things for me\nThat's an amazing quote there is this sense of powerlessness that I met from a lot of people that they don't feel like things have changed so therefore whoever's in office you\nKnow they're just sort of moving along because they don't notice a change from President to president and the races that could make the biggest\nDifference in your life like maybe city council or school board or or the\nState legislature those aren't the sexy races they everybody talks about those are the ones where it's really hard to get information about who the candidates are and that and that\nLeaves people feeling like they they don't know who to vote for\nAnd it's a huge issue in the southwest in particular I mean you look at Texas\nArizona we were talking about Nevada where you have this huge surge of Latinos and yet or not registered to vote so every time you hear people talking about how Democrats could turn Texas blue for example\nThat is really reliant on Democrats being able to not just get Latinos to vote but get Latinos registered to vote and then be fired up to vote for them and in fact there's actually a growing gap\nAh that's been seen between the number\nOf eligible Latino voters versus the number of Latino voters who've cast a ballot over the years\nSo what would happen if all these non voters showed up on the first Tuesday after that first Monday in November well first of all they might not be able to vote because you have to be registered before the deadline so people need to go look that up if you're if you're considering it and many of those deadlines would attack by the way or asked right but\nIf that were to happen hey or\nPolls would probably be a lot more accurate because we have a better sense an ability to to map out by demographics how people would likely vote or it would certainly changed the shape of not just the races in this country but I think ... has been making the point about public policy as well\nThat was NPR's off for holidays and medical ... thanks so much guys welcome [noise]\nThis is the politics show from NPR I'm camera Keith and it feels like there are always stories that we just can't get too because there's so much other political news so every week we take a few minutes\nTo dig in on some of those headlines that you may have missed and to do that we always have Ron Elving however on hello tab so let's start with buying the Justice Department unsealed charges this week against a suspected Chinese spies for allegedly conducting espionage fill us in\nOkay we're not talking about the usual kinds of cloak and dagger military spying here this is about high tech competition between major economies so what is the U.S government allege the individual in question the Chinese individual posed as an official of a tech association but was in fact when official in Chinese intelligence\nAnd he invited a GE engineer to visit China stayed in touch tried to get specific proprietary information and so he was arrested in Brussels by Belgian authorities and has been extradited to the United states to face trial\nUp but this could be a big deal because even though it's economic as we say is the first time someone believed to be in Chinese intelligence has been brought to the United states to stand\nTrial huh OK moving on the environmental protection agency has taken some new actions to weaken regulations is that right Ron\nThis was the week with the United nations came out with a big report giving the world's governments essentially a decade to get serious about climate change before it's too late that got a certain amount of attention but not so much attention has gone to some of the individual things the EPA has been deciding\nOh having to do with various kinds of pollution and this particular week of the weakening of regulation had to do with just spending the scientific advisory board\nFor particulate pollution now that's the kind of air pollution that doesn't come out of gas form it's made up of tiny solid particles that can get into your lungs and this follows on the heels of other UPA proposals have weaker regulations on radiation exposure and mercury emissions\nLast month or so we were talking about the administration rolling back restrictions on methane emissions\nFrom oil and gas drilling and transport so when the president talks about all the regulations that he has rolled back some of those regulations have to do with the environment\nRight the last story involved health insurance plans and a vote in the Senate\nWe had a close Senate both in fact as close as the Senate can be in a division between the two parties it was a fifty fifty votes not perfectly but almost perfectly along party lines this week\nAll the way back into Obamacare they created these little short term plans they don't cover a lot but they're real cheap you could have this for three months as a kind of absolute minimum stopgap before you got more permanent arrangement other Trump administrators like those plans because they're cheap\nAnd um so they said why just three months or let's let him go for a year and the Senate had a chance to roll back the change and that opportunity failed this week when the Senate tied fifty to fifty so the regulations remain in place\nRon tell us about the potential downsides to these plans\nThese plants don't have to comply with all the usual rules under the Affordable CARE Act so insurers don't necessarily have\nTo cover all those basic things that people think credible mature guarantees they will get perhaps including maternity care perhaps including emergency care perhaps including an ambulance that takes you to the hospital after a car accident\nAnd of course at the bottom line they also divert dollars and patients from larger insurance pool that makes Obama Care work so in that way it's one more way that the White House has managed to undermine the law that they could review\nThat is NPR's Ron Elving each week he catches up on some of the headlines that we might have missed because of all the other news is happening thank you run again\nThis is
