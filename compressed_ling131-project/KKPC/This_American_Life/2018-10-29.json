most appropriate and pro Russia congressman in Washington DC his district was actually won by ... by two points in twenty sixteen he's being challenged by a local businessmen so it's one of those key races in Los Angeles suburb that will show us whether this trend is\nDefinitive the local business when used to be a Republican himself right and so like there he may arguably have some bipartisan appeal\nRight and polls show that race is super close if you're just joining us You're listening to the politics show from NPR I'm Scott Detrow we're focusing on the race for the house of representatives with NPR's Dominican wants narrow Danielle Kurtzleben and Tim Mak\n... take me to the future of you and I sitting in the studio an election night\nOr the cabs have your browser will be open to\nYou know I'm an old school I don't even have the browsers I use paper and I've got my list here or that and because I'm political editor I Am going to take some liberty\nZoom out and grab a bunch of races in one big bucket on the phone and they want to do everybody subtle and here we go this is the Obama Trump\nDistricts okay from ... to Trump right these are districts that President Obama won in twenty twelve but President Trump wound up winning twenty sixteen you're talking about all these races but I Want to talk about where they are because it's really indicative of how well Trump did and uh what Democrats need to do to win the house\nOr on election day or for Republicans to hold it most of these places are either in the Midwest and if you look at at all of them globally\nThere in New York and New Jersey the ... the Philadelphia suburbs\nUh all the way up through upstate New York a lot of these districts there's one that's uh just outside St Louis on the Illinois side you look at all of those places\nAnd I to me you know if Democrats can do well in the half a dozen or so tossup races that are within this Obama Trump bucket then they probably take back the house\nFun fact three out of four Iowa districts therefore Iowa districts three of them were Obama Trump districts and two of them are pretty close tossup races\nRight now a part of that might have to do with the even this of redistricting but that's a conversation for another\nPhone to put a shout out there that's off a I'm going to go with Amy McGrath in Kentucky sixth district she is running against Andy Barr he a as a Republican to foresee the Democrat\nOr not this is a district that has been pretty hard core Republican Trump won it by Fifteen points but any McGrath is a marine veteran and she is one also one of those democratic women candidates that has gained a lot of prominence on the national stage\nOne of many or one of many women veterans running on the Democratic side this time\nYes absolutely I mean we have quite a few ... at least historically speaking women combat vets running for Congress she raised three times of India guarded and the third quarter this year and\nPart of what I'm watching it's first of all she can flip this kind of a district that's really stunning but I'm also watching a lot of these combat vets because what we do know from pulling it is that voters tend to give women and democratic women perhaps especially\n... much less of an edge on things like national security and so on as they might give her Republican man and so this is sort of a test case for that\nSo we've been saying all along that the Democrats are feeling confident that they can take control of the house but of course we don't know what's going to happen on election day we taught for on the show about the legislative stakes what could Congress do next year depending on who's in charge\nWhatever the political stakes what does it mean to the Democratic party if it at the end of the day they don't we take control the house and for the second election cycle in a row they've they've missed their mark and and and they've lost\nIt'd be an earthquake within the Democratic party no question about it you know right now there's a lot of younger democratic activists who are quietly talking about the fact that the leadership within the Democratic party is in their seventies and if the party doesn't if the Democrats aren't able to take back the house then they're going they're going to be a lot of questions to ask about who that leadership\nWill be in Tempe take the flip side of that if Republicans somehow keep control of the house of representatives what are Republicans talking about the next day\nWell the president has a alluded to more tax relief for middle income Americans um uh and and on the left there's ... there's going to be a lot of questions on the blame game like who's responsible you know much like what happened with the Republicans\nAfter Mitt Romney lost and twenty twelve whether they'll put together some sort of introspective autopsy of what happened during this election\nWe know one thing is for short is Republicans hold the house they will not pump the brakes they're going to be stepping on the\nGas or an exclamation point NPR's the minute come on to narrow Danielle Kurtzleben and Tim Mak thanks everybody thinking that You're welcome and medical stick with us because now it is time for race of the week\nI'm running for United States Senate and the people of color I Need your help we will never backed down by and if we [noise] we [noise]\nEvery week we focus on one race that tells us something about the broader election and this week we're looking at the governor's race in Georgia the minute come up tomorrow you're still with me how's it going hey there were gonna bring in Johnny\nKauffman of W. A. B. E. in Atlanta hey Johnny hello so the medical let's start with you who are the candidates\nAnd the Republican is Brian Kemp who the secretary of state and the Democrat is Stacey Abrams she's a former house minority leader in the Georgia general assembly and ... would be the state's first black female governor and the race really a statistically tied\nAnd Johnny A voter suppression or who can and can't vote has become a huge issue in this race especially as early voting has begun why is that\n... has sparred over voting for years and it's getting more and more attention as the selection comes closer\nMore specifically one issue that's drawn a lot of controversy is these voter registration applications that have been held up because the information on them doesn't exactly match other government databases and the registrations that have been held up in that list there's a disproportionate number of people of color\nYou this is drawing a federal lawsuit a camp says it's all blown out of proportion that it's just a move to excite the Democratic base and he actually points the finger at Stacey Abrams\nEnd of the group that she founded called the New Georgia project which has done a lot of voter registration he says that her group is responsible for these messed up applications there are on the list definitely some fakes or some errors like people named Jesus Christ that live on ... street as camp likes to point out\nBut the issue has really persisted for a long time it continues to be a source of debate in the race\nLet's talk about the issues for a little bit what are the voters that you're talking to focusing on\nHealth care and education are really big in the race and and jobs although Georgians economy has been doing pretty well and the current Republican governor Nathan Deal is pretty popular\nRace has been an issue in this race or maybe not totally at the forefront but very close ah there was a report pretty recently\nThat looked back in the archives and found that Abrams participated in a a flag burning the Georgia flats\nIn the nineties that the time that the Georgia fly had the Confederate flag on it as well\nTwenty six years ago as a college freshman I along with many other Georgians including the governor of Georgia were deeply disturbed by the racial ... that was embedded in the state flag with that Confederate symbols\nAnd eventually that Confederate symbol was removed and she pointed out that the governor at the time was actually pushing for the Confederate symbols to be removed as well\nThe ... this is one of the top tier national races this year a lot of\nPeople paying attention to it a lot of a likely democratic candidate for president in two years have made a point of going to Georgia to campaign for Stacey Abrams what is it about this governor's race that's getting so much attention given all the other races going on all across the country\nWell Georgia is one of those state that has been traditionally Republican but there have been signs that it could be moving away from that certainly the demographics suggest that it could be a more of a center right state\nJohnny you've been covering this race since the beginning less than two weeks left what are you thinking about are looking for the final days of this race\nMy big question right now is how well he's Abrams reaching and communicating to voters who may not be as engaged and don't usually vote in these midterm elections Abrams has gotten a lot of tension in the national media\nThe fact that she would be the first African American female governor is a big deal\nBut campaigns done a really good job of labeling her in a simple way that she's just too extreme for George eight\nStates even he could be standing rating liberal she's in extreme cases\nIt's clear and concise people can understand what he's getting out there he runs I'm not sure has done the same with Ken and so my big question is you know Abrams talked a lot about her policy proposal she's very smart\nBut how well does that reach people in Georgia and maybe a more rural parts of the state that don't have access to as much education or resources are they going to be motivated in the same way that maybe they were for President Obama back in two thousand eight\nAnd people compare this election to like the Obama wave that that ah Abrams needs to inspire voters in the same way that Obama did in two thousand ... Obama did not win Georgia in two thousand that he lost by about two hundred thousand votes so that's a huge hill that Abrams has to climb if he's going to win this race\nOr we will have answers to all those questions in less than two weeks That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro as well as Johnny Kauffman of W. A. B. E. Johnny thanks so much for talking to us yeah thanks for having me this is the politics show from NPR we'll be right back\nYou can just tell you that you don't want to stop and pull polling exactly what you do not see the numbers zero\nZero percent of democratic with it so that surprised me but getting to what's important nine and ten Republican men and women say yeah I'm going to vote Republican independence independent men prefer the Republican by two percentage points which isn't\nRoughly evenly split independent women prefer the Democrats by twenty three percentage points so once again when you're looking at the gender gap that is where it's\nGoing to look at unmarried women look at white college educated women they are really driving a lot of this election and the opposition to President Trump last question on this\nAh what were the issues that that voters seem to be most motivated by well\nYou know the one saving grace for President Trump here is that the economy and jobs continue to rate as the top issue for a for people now it's not a huge percentage of people but it's it's the largest number of what's asked here and when you look at a second is healthcare third is immigration\nBut the divide between the parties are two completely different universes there to party flip and Democrats have been blanketing the airwaves with healthcare ads they're running healthcare healthcare healthcare everywhere\nDemocrats believe that the top issue followed by the way by climate change Republicans see jobs in the economy has topped with immigration and not too far behind which explains President Trump's attempts at trying to wrap up the base and talking about immigration and this caravan coming from Central America\nAnd funny you should mention that because later in the show Danielle and I will have a long conversation about health care with NPR's Scott Horsley looking at how it's played out of the campaign but more importantly what the actual\nVotes have done or would have done and what the Trump Administration has done on Obamacare as later on the show right Danielle Kurtzleben ... thank you so much and you You're welcome [noise]\nVisit the politics show from NPR I'm Scott Detrow feels like there's always that view major stories that dominate the headlines one person is now in federal custody after nationwide bomb scare the drooling international outrage over the killing of a Washington Post columnist has the Trump Administration\nOn that end of the United states calling a growing caravan of Central American migrants a national emergency\nAnd because of that other really important stories often get overlooked so every week we take a few minutes to focus in on one story that didn't get that much attention this week\nAnd to do that we always have NPR's Ron Elving all around good to be with you Scott ... everything else that happened this week President Trump signed a sweeping legislation on Wednesday to address the opioid crisis uh what what was in that bill\nA rare moment of bipartisanship actually a piece of legislation aimed at helping people preventing overcome addictions in what has become forest health crisis in this country and many years and you know it's hard to think\nOf another domestic issue where President Obama pushed for legislation and provided funding and President Trump has followed up doing more of same are reminder on the figures last year more than Seventy thousand Americans died from a drug overdose opioids were responsible for about two thirds of those deaths\nThat's more than a hundred and Fifteen Americans a day who die from opioids so the house and Senate passed an opioid bill with near unanimous approval several weeks ago but it was not actually signed into law until this week signed at the White House\nTogether we're going to end this gorge of drug addiction in America we're going to end it or we're going to at least make an extremely big dent in this terrible terrible problem\nSo what are some specific things that this law does one\nOf the factors cited in recent successes with controlling this scourge\nHas been access to Medicaid coverage\nUp which was expanded under the Affordable CARE Act states taking advantage of that have seen some progress in reaching difficult cases among the poor so one of the things this bill does is to lift certain restrictions on the use of Medicaid and Medicare coverage to deal with opioid addictions\nAt backs the creation of comprehensive opioid recovery centers tries to address the over prescription of opioids and in many doctors appear to be getting the message on this\nUh the new law also backs government research into non addictive drugs that could be used as alternatives for pain management alternative therapies additional measures including\nNew enforcement strength for the United States Postal service so but they can try to curtail some of these foreign shipments of illegal drugs into the United states\nYou mentioned some of the overwhelming statistics of of how many people are dying from overdoses I feel like almost every person in the country knows someone in one way or another who struggled with opioids\nThis bill us signed into law at a time where we're seeing some signs that this crisis may at least be leveling off\nYes that came from Alex Azar the secretary of the department of health and Human Services\nA data for the first months of twenty Eighteen indicate\nThat the number of opioid deaths is not increasing nearly as fast as in recent years\nHe used the word plateau and that certainly hopeful term maybe a few percentage points increase this year rather than say ten percent as we saw in the previous year in twenty Seventeen the number of Americans dying from opioids rose to Seventy two thousand\nFrom sixty four thousand the previous year\nA new data from the Centers for Disease Control show the numbers are not rising\nAs fast in the last ... Seventeen and the first few months of twenty Eighteen\nSo if anything the government has been doing can further that trend\nOf both parties seem to think that's worth doing\nAnd that's at least one hopeful story this week we're talking about how this is the the rare period where where both parties are on the same page but that doesn't mean there hasn't been any criticism right that's right and there was a lot of disagreement in the process of putting this together people saying look what we need here as a tobacco up and take a much more holistic approach to the entire question but just\nStitching together all these different programs I kind of pastiche of good intentions\nAre that's ultimately not going to be good enough and that that may well be true some people say there needs to be a great deal more money\nPut into all of these programs that it's really just a drop in the bucket against the size of the problem is we've seen but here again the consensus in the end was let's pass what we can let's put as many dollars in as we can if we can only agree on that stitched together patchwork programs let's at least do that\nThat is NPR's Ron Elving every week he catches us up on some of the stories that we might have missed thank you Ron thank you Scott\n[noise]\nThis is the politics shell from NPR we're going to take a quick break and be right back\nUm [noise]\nUm [noise]\nMm\n\nMm\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the Annenberg Foundation committed to supporting educating and engaging communities in the United states and globally for more than twenty five years learned more at Annenberg Foundation dot org\n[noise] from the Kauffman Foundation working together with communities and education and entrepreneurship to create uncommon solutions and empower people to shape their lives and be more successful or online at ... dot org\nAnd from listeners like you who donate to this NPR station [noise]\nThey may have seen that down and a half [noise]\nWelcome back to the politics shell from NPR's Scott Detrow is here with a special broadcast every weekend in mid term election\nAfter all the votes that's been tally in each week we focus on one issue on voters' minds health insurance reform becomes law in the United states as\n[noise] we health care for my first day I'm going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disasters Obamacare\n[noise] with the Democrats ... Republicans found one of their best talking for the used it again and again we're going to unify because we all every Republican ran on repealing and replacing\nIt we're going to keep our promises that does seem within reach when Republicans gained control of the White House in addition to the house and Senate but\nThe Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act has ... tale of Obamacare failed by a single voter away today\nAfter seven years of promises to repeal and replace Obamacare it came down to just one vote the final vote forty nine to fifty one now is the Democrats who feel like health care is an advantage for them Democrats have talked about health care fall election and the polls indicate that voters want to hear about it\nThat has Republicans on defense and we're going to talk about all of this", "show_name": "This American Life", "year": "2018", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "29"}
