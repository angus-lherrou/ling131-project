Chicago just American Life America stay with us [noise]\n[noise] [noise] judge\nTo Senator Jeff flake was one of the central players in the drone on Capitol Hill this last week turn on the TV and you'd see is tortured face\nHe dragged his decisions down to the wire over and over undecided didn't seem like a no on Kevin up there was a yes it was let's wait a week is if we can made the Senate wait for new FBI investigation then he was a yes again\nProducers though ha to spend a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode you did recording him for months that he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill and she was with him in the days before and after the cabinet hearing watching what is going through and talking to him about how we made a choice is\nThere's always the first thing I Want to talk about is the elevator okay it's a big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator near to tell you that's not a true story that's not what changed his mind [laughter]\nI was there right behind the women yelling [noise] that's why my recording isn't clear as what you heard on CNN [noise] just staring at sleek peering out from the elevator\nHe just stood me up for an interview\nJust leaks fees can be a little deceiving he looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside he's just like humming a little tune\nJust meet in a lot of new Jeff league fan\nWhen he ended up taking pictures for them\nAll the way that I Do [laughter]\nOkay I'm eighty six in Central Park west [noise]\nI don't know it was so starved for any sign of a bipartisan show\nI'm going to go ahead and say bipartisan in New York means you agree with the Democrats\nThis is all happening because way back to New York from Washington on Saturday I ran into Chris Coons on Amtrak he told me flick was on the seller right behind us that we can invited himself\nAlong with Coons to the global citizen concert at the great lawn in Central Park broadcast live on MSNBC can't think of a blue or place to be honest more on the news location for the hash tag resistance so I'm surprised to hear flakes coming to a Texan to see if I can go gets me credentials and they take them out of town\nYou get a little lie because I'm from here I think I Know where everything is but I don't and then we're running across the east ... street transfer\nWe had to a little trailer back speech meet up with Chris Coons outside tens of thousands of people are already out on the line two senators are going to deliver a short impromptu speech about bipartisanship to this\nCrowd ... companies perform for them and his performing after\nCrazy nerdy beef is asked is after yeah you guys are the opening act for ... be enough you know [noise]\nThis is where flakes reaching across the aisle gesture gets ethically surreal and it's hard to top how surreal the weakest dinner ready\nAll these ... these people keep popping into the trailer\nWhat'd you say you're a hero I was just so funny that other people do is to ask Robert\nDeniro steps to flake with a finger in states like a scene from good fellas we rely on you\nToo much just go down with this guy he's got to go\nIt's I Know it's because they didn't want the ... and this and that would be ... with the ...\nIt's weird to hear Robert De Niro say the word the term I'm telling you you're a ... year old man John Legend\nAppreciate withdrawing has this week and\nWe just we just know that we're all watching and hoping that you make the right decision for them and I'm like okay that's all I'm saying don't worry about is the director\nEven do there now they just so much for lifting the women ... homes in surgery Kuhn says none of that is\nThat's great I don't know how to ask but\nUsually they're hearing from\nEmotionally has come in Katy\nPerry neither are the senator seems to know who any of these people are accepted Niro everyone wants to picture with the Senator Cruz and fleet of rushed towards the stage and continues to be monitored by the Hollywood resistant Darren ... them I'm a filmmaker I made blacks wine\nGlasses on one side you have to go\nAround in the front the housing non famous he offers are receiving this film Republican Sen\nThat's a real New York you call for bipartisanship is drowned out by calls because\nThey're off stage the star treatment starts again\nThe Reverend Al Sharpton catches him we run a red carpet\nFor the call just cause you a hero\nThat guy is a guy\nDo you think we can bring this country together outside it's like a left wing first at this point random bit players keep popping out to catch liberals spells Chris Martin from Coldplay gets like a magic teamed up some sort to keep his pocket\nOh yeah ... ... tons of Troy\nLeach drops it Chris Martin leads we have a moment to sit down\nWith a leg [laughter] uh since ... was it\nWell I mean you know it's not something you know you're just so this is different you know a conference on Social Security reform or the other side you know it's not far from settled like having\nPeople like Robert De Niro and John Legend money like you're a hero to for a week long in\nThe room welding it'll last a week to my next votes for Kevin our for something that a luxury that I'm a ... who you enjoy it for a week do you think they know you're still a Republican\nI'm\nKnow I think probably\nEnjoy okay when\n\nJeff Flake that are a few years he'd I'm On the right keeps disappointing to laugh it feels good for you to be popular or you have do you like it [laughter]\nOh yeah every politician does that mean we like politicians would we feed on\nBlood method [noise]\nAnd then it happened just like he predicted after seven days of being treated as a Democrat\nOr at least a Republican defector fleet comes home to the GOP on Thursday the FBI releases the report that he called for on friday week announced his decision he's a yes on cap and on I reached Chris Coons that afternoon\n... you know look Jeff and I both went to the same place and read the same report 'em and you know I appreciate his friendship we are we are viewing this through a different lens Jeff as a conservative senator he has always wanted a conservative on the Supreme Court ah I have not and I don't\nWho started the FBI report was a disgrace to basically didn't follow up on any leads he said was not the investigation he'd asked for last week he was mad frustrated kept going off the record and raging you would not tell me about his conversations with Jeff Flake after they both read the FBI\nI'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate here\nAs soon as flake voted friday he fled the capital I talked to him in the car [noise] people are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes he said\nWhy did you vote yes I Am and presumption of innocence he told me over and over he was satisfied that the FBI before do you feel better now you're kind of back of your people you had kind of a week with the ... you know the Democrats celebrating\nYou but you're kind of back among among your people\nAsk people [laughter] that stuff I a chocolate chip are only about a party\nThere is no bipartisan down there is No Child to stand in the middle as quote a film that Robert Deniro is not in the kinda don't ever take sides with anyone against the family [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nVery chase when students have a program that turn out of this recording that we found a Justice Anthony Kennedy Kennedy of course is retiring judge who see Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for the swing vote on the Supreme Court for years and being questioned into cue in a back in twenty ten\nI stand here today just just a potential colleague starting the confirmation process has changed since he went through all that well I like my own uh [noise]\nYou know remember the\nSenate is\nA political body and they have to act in a political way the frame or just knew that\nAnd it's really not for me to tell\nThe Senate how to structure that process\nIt has the obligation\nTo recognize\nThe necessity of preserving the neutrality and the independence and integrity of our court and\n\nYou should ask is whether the judge has the temperament commitment and uh the character and the learning I think the judge should be broadly read\nI myself was of fascinated with political theory you know if if you ask what makes a good judge of going to get an autobiography you know so you you have to be careful about the [noise]\nSome some southern southern southern so the Senate or as a as a really very difficult position [noise]\n\nKennedy was speaking to an audience getting high school students people asking that escape it cases they'd always wanted to be on the Supreme Court no by the way he's funny he's a good talker and explained his job how it works we will meet\nUm just the nine of us and uh and discuss the case\nUh we begin with an order of seniority for the most senior judge or to the\nAnyone or a of of what I was thinking I was I was I'll be honest I'm scared\nAt twenty seven ... was the youngest or by several years and he was the kind of guy who avoided speaking up at all cost\nAt home his neighbor parked in his face he let it go at the office if the boss told them to do something even if you disagreed he did it without question\nIn other words even though he's been looking forward to being a juror when he found themselves in the jury room spend wasn't exactly Henry Fonda and twelve angry men the way he understood at the jurors had to reach a unanimous decision and the idea of swaying eleven strangers over to his way of thinking seemed impossible [noise]\nHe was also afraid that if he opposed the group he would result in a hung jury in a mistrial they'd have to start the whole process over again with a new Jerry everyone would be mad at him just fence had nothing\nAn hour and a half later Paul story was sentenced to death by lethal injection that\nWas hard to look good having during the sentencing um we [noise] we sat waiting for the judge to ask us you know what's the sentencing\nAnd everyone was really tense and the woman next to me and others are uh begin crying she was trying to hide it you know and I gave her my handkerchief and she just ups\nThe foreman announced the verdict [noise] and I think his mother cried out they had an exit for us to go through after ... things and we were out of the courtroom fast\nIt felt like a mistake right away it's been over to his parent's house where you had dinner\nAnd drink scotch with his dad he told his family about the trial and then he went home where you had more to drink before bed\nAnd then that was not than it was over and uh [laughter] and I went went on with my life or at least they try to but\nWhat do you do with with these feelings um I've I've I was just stuck you know it was done was cast in stone and\nUm yeah no I felt terrible I felt massive amounts regret I felt [noise] I've I've you know I I felt guilty or you know sending someone to death row\nWhen you think about the people that a trial affect you think of the victims and their loved ones and do you think of the accused their families and what they're going through you don't usually think about what it does to the jurors\nBut first fan the trial wasn't something he could put behind him at the crack of the gas all [noise]\nIn the days and weeks after the verdict he read every article about the Casey could find\nThat the more he read the more shame he felt\nSo eventually he just stopped I realized it wasn't really healthy\nAt the time span was a regular\nDrinker and it only got worse after the trial I got a lot worse after the trial\nHe was drinking more beginning as soon as he got home from work and spending more days hung over his wife didn't understand what was going on\nIt may have contributed to my divorce which was the phone your [noise]\n\nYour after the trial and spends life changed the new house with the hand making the flagpole was sold and spend moved out of Texas\n[laughter]\nFence settled in Olympia, Washington started life over you found in an apartment for himself and his cat Nico but he couldn't shake his memories of the trial he tried to escape to alcohol but it didn't free him from a shame\nSometimes after a night out drinking you return to a Facebook page Paul stories mother had made for her son one mother had already lost\nHer son and now because fan had been too afraid to speak up another mother was going to as well\nI'm not trying to excuses crime it was terrible but to send the guy that does not just the the presents and your mind the uh for for current\nThoughts about it cannot go away\nFor all the bad rap it gets shame offers a certain safety it provides a comfortable who'll to hide in the way from the judgment of others but it can also lead to isolation and the nurse yeah\nAnd for eight years eight years in which Paul story sat on death row awaiting an execution date send barely talked about the trial with anybody\nBut then in two thousand sixteen year after\n... stories federal appeal it been denied\nA reporter writing a series of articles about the judicial system approach than about his experiences that your [noise]\nThan was tired of being alone with his regret [noise] and so for the first time he opened up about his feelings\nI felt guilty he told a reporter and sad\nI don't think I made the right call [noise] Bennett hope that talking about the trial might help and it did\nUp until the article was published that was when ... received an uncomfortable phone call from a lawyer who read the article\nSpend was at work\n... co workers might over here\nHe took the call outside behind his office building\nIt was there that he learned that eight years earlier he misunderstood a key part of the jury instructions I thought\nEssentially I Believe I Would have to convince everyone to choose life imprisonment when in fact all\nI had to do was declined the death penalty and that's all it would've taken\nPreventing the death sentence only required one dissenting vote vote fend could've cast so they would have been no mass trial no hung jury and instead of the death penalty Paul story would have gotten life in prison without parole\nKnow where that would have been nice to know [noise]\nI could have changed\n\nAfter the article was published something else happened something spend never expected or wanted\nPaul stories mother Marilyn got in touch\nShe reached out with an email filled with sentiments of forgiveness\nShia driven me if I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and knowing knowing that there's that forgiveness that felt so weird like it it wasn't something I completely understand\nFor spend it didn't make sense why would Maryland want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive themselves for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that and like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her Mrs ... how do you mean\nWell I I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as a a ... ... it just floored me I'd I didn't know what to say\nSan was never able to write Marilyn back\nAlready did begin to reply but I didn't I\nDidn't have the courage to [noise] finishers in the ... you know there's so much pain in there and\n[noise] I feel like a really read things [noise]\n\nA few months after spend receive Maryland's email an execution date was set\nThe state would put pause story to death\nOn April twelve of two thousand Seventeen\nBut then something unexpected happened Glen and Judith cherry the parents of the victim came forward it seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied\nTo cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against capital punishment in a video they released publically Judith cherry presents a statement which reads in part\nWe do not want Paul stories family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son they are innocent of his deeds\nBased on this testimony with only five days to spare Paul stories execution was postponed\nWhen news of the stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance an opening to finally respond to Maryland's email but he did it it's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want\nI I Need to apologize for not [noise] for not doing what I should have done to begin with for not following my good for not drawing\nShame leads to a nurse or\nEven the most casual reader or the fundamentals of physics will tell you entered object will remain unnerved until it has acted upon by an external forces in other words it takes a little nudge and who better to supply a little nudge than a little knowledge and so I write Maryland a letter\nI Know this is a really sensitive and deeply personal issue with ... and I hope I'm not being too forward\nI ask Marilyn she remembers a juror by the name of spanberger", "show_name": "This American Life", "year": "2018", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "06"}
