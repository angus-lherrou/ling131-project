get back\nSanta Maria they could still make the cut [noise] wasn't WB Z Chicago is this American Life from Ira Glass today in our program returned to childhood what did you find out what you do not find when you go back\nIt turns out there are a lot of Susan Jordan's who don't remember me a lot\nOne guy even called his ex wife a former student Jordan and then call me back to tell me she never heard of me I was getting nowhere by myself\nSo I contacted a professional one urban ... when a certified New York city private investigator three days after putting him on the case I got a message saying he'd found her I called them back\nI call the morning early or roughly around seven thirty mhm [noise]\nBut she didn't want to go to introduce myself Russia or whether they show was showing the real life as far as I forget her in New York and I've been looking for someone I used to live in Cincinnati or what would it take to school they're unable to time with Susan Jordan that\nShe should a movie and I said okay and I said I uh do you know anybody they the Alex Blumberg and right away she had babies [laughter] is um\nThe interesting part about the whole thing is she definitely likes you remembered as you and uh she's going to call you [noise]\n[noise] hello this is the Susan yeah this is Alex Bloomberg Hi Alex my family I'm doing okay how are you know I guess you get my email I got your email yeah a lot of ... and I I called you at work and then I realized that I I'd also gotten this number from the from the private investigator\nSusan and I talk forever three hours on the phone is catching up comparing notes that she has to buy my sister and kids that used to live in the street or an old\nFamily dog right how're you doing I'm doing okay\nIt was amazing how much she remembered and how much we remembered and comment even small incidents like the time that we were stopped at the traffic light and I stared too long that the guy in the motorcycle\nI think I remember that was it on the Erie avenue of\nProbably probably and he said did he say something to you and I said no he didn't say anything to me and he said he said something to you didn't and you were about to\nGet out of the car and the bad guys as I'm sure\n[laughter] I think I can remember your face I think you were staying very ill with your hands in your lap where are you afraid\nI was terrified that [laughter] yeah I didn't know that he would notice [laughter] but uh [laughter] well don't worry but I I Would have taken him now [laughter]\nI had no fear I'm telling you [noise]\nYou know we it was like maybe six or seven or eight years after you maybe set us um and I was\n... store yeah yeah I remember [laughter] in Norway train our was right at the thrift way yeah [laughter] I remember I guess you were you bagging groceries at this but I didn't recognize you\nAnd you told me the word and then I did right\nRight I think he said my pet\n[laughter] like I did for a few [laughter] people still call you that [laughter] [noise]\nSusan got married when she was still in college and went to work for the phone company as a repair person she spent the next Twenty years or so hanging from a telephone pole and she said she hated us the money was good\nAround the time her first marriage ended she finally got the courage to quit and find work using her degree\nNow teaches at a special school for mentally ill children she lives in Florida with her second husband she seems happy\nOf course when you ... back into the past like this you find a partial an incomplete your memory is\nFirst or the facts you get wrong turns out Susan had been a college freshman when she babysat\nUs not in high school like I thought my sister remember she's written a motorcycle also not true and the guy who she got in the fight with the cats in my mind was her Harry seventies boyfriend turned out to be her roommates boyfriend but besides the fact you change the fact you completely meant\nThat fight or the cats Susan had forgotten totally that I'd been there and it was a little strange because my presence was the only thing she forgotten other details you remembered San even the names of the cats themselves\nPossum and Tom [laughter] we were hillbillies to remember that [laughter] and uh but I Can't imagine what I took you over there for\nI'm sure it was for you know I think we were just running errands\nThey're still lucky [laughter]\nIt it's it's funny because when I when I like you know I remember these very particular incidents and that was one of them and and probably the reason I remember it is because it seemed very significant to you\nI think I sensed as a kid that that you were than it was really upsetting to you because it it I think I felt at that time that you didn't really have very many people in your life at that point you could trust\nOh I didn't have I didn't have hardly anybody my whole family moved out of town I had no family oh\nI see I moved out that day I graduated from high school mhm and I was Seventeen cars I started a year early I had I just wanted out every day that I found out that I got the scholarship mhm I packed up that nine\nWhy'd you want to get on that 'cause my family was functional that my mom and it was pretty bad [noise]\nThe girl that I Lived with\nAt that time she was taken all on a truck\nAnd every time I Would come home they would always try to get me to take drugs with him or something and I I really do it much at all\nAnd it was really it was it was tough to come home and\nI I guess I missed that for a little bit I missed I really miss my little\nAnd my little sister and they were gone and I was I guess maybe trying to substitute\nI think maybe that's one of the reasons that I remember that we remember used to follow those because I think it works both ways I think that we felt if that didn't make you feel closer to us I think that we we responded and\nWell I was desperately I guess I was looking for a family that I mean it [laughter] it's only you knew you probably wouldn't hire me but I mean they're people are complicated now what I really wanted to do with spend more time with your mom and dad but I was terrified\n[noise] I mean I\nI just couldn't I couldn't do it I was too shy to know a lot of times they it was I thought they were asking me to stay longer and talk\nAnd I would just run out and I'm sure that we're\n[laughter] and they probably know what's wrong with her but I just couldn't do it\nSo you sort of talk to us instead so\nYeah I was comfortable around kids because I had kids in my family [noise]\n\nEvery time the subject of are hard times came up I hear a subtle hesitancy into what\nThe first I thought it was embarrassment but that wasn't exactly it wasn't until we've been talking for hours that I realized what it was\nShe was waiting for the other shoe to drop\nShe hadn't forgotten that are passed it happened she just forgotten that I witnessed part of it interfere it became clear the one that have been knowing under our entire conversation was that I was calling to say she'd damage me by exposing to it\nI don't think I was to kind of accent because there was a lot of turmoil in my life and in my family and that's what my fear is that I might have had some kind of negative impact on people\nAnd and I know probably I did on a couple of people but they were my age but\nYou know you just want to remember yeah I was a baby that are the kids love me blah blah blah [laughter] but uh I Would be devastating if I heard anything different Mm\nThere are parts of the past you don't want to go back to ... parts of yourself you don't want to go back to\nProduce when Jordan Europe for life that I remember\nIs he or she just too soon forgot\nAnd it turns out I'd also done my best to forget what I was like right there\nI didn't think of myself as where it all but Susan Jordan reminded me in the gentle terms possible\nWhen I was nine of anxious and bookish\nNot to see him as an insult that I just kept thinking these kids don't know how to play\nWhen I went to your room I didn't it didn't seem like you had a whole lot of toys I Hope I've got this right but it just seems like they were mostly folks and more educational things\nI mean I remember you had planned it in your room and a chemistry set and I didn't remember that cake had hardly any dolls you didn't seem\nQuite as playful as other kids that I had ... ... more serious in general mainly I think that's what I did was try to play\nAnd\nPerhaps the most amazing thing about this whole story how little I remember as a deceived us about each other even if they had the saved us about ourselves\nCarried me on the hands ... the crowd and generally deposited me at the stage don't\nBe so this is your last week that was your last good yes\nAnd and it ended with the entire audience lifting you up and\nYou bodily ah out and gently depositing you out out of the club at the well not out to the cloud but to the stage do yes\nWhere it was amazing\nI I don't think I've ever really been lifted by a mob of teenagers and people in their twenties um what what exactly is\nThat like um well\nIn

I felt pretty good about it I'm not sure how I Would have felt about it in London in Nineteen Seventy seven whether seeing was incredibly violent you know whenever you played you're you're just as like getting bitten off as you are to get paid [noise]\n\nDescribing it was like to come back after the ...\nIt was hard for me to get motivated again or to do my business off to the um\n... off to the tool [noise] it it just wasn't as thrilling as being on a stage in front of cheering well not many things a bit like sort of you know you know my my dad's generation you know off to sort of you know grabbing off as a kid you know being fired on than than in\nWorld War two and all that kind of stuff it was just kind of hard to getting getting it out for a ... you know working at the shipping in the shipping industry again ...\nMm Mm shortly after I go back a Steve ... was in town and that is\nUh he's he he he was the original\nProducer and he was also my roommate at the time that that all the automatic stuff was going on uh and uh now he's you know incredibly successful you just like you to take Matthews and all that stuff you know and anyway he was in town and he had some time and then so we hung out together for a couple of days in hunter was off\nUm and a wife yes onto my my ah so um\nYou know we got to hang out and we talked a little about the old days and he told me\nYou know big poll from\nFrom ... uh uh does catering in a you know ... and\nA nod Joe from the ... she's an Australian now and a and a while to from\nThe ...

there because there today show a few years back\nWe've arrived at three of our show at three Ariel Sharon Shimon Peres David grin and me\nSometimes when we were visitor childhood is not very pleasant what we find take for example our next guest when he was a teenager he started reading the biography of David Ben gory in the first prime minister of Israel and one of the things that he learned is that all of his life David Ben Gurion kept a diary and the whole package\nSeemed like a good idea job diary\nDecember third Nineteen eighty six Wednesday another fascinating day in the life of Adam Davidson I have a math test tomorrow I'm going to school early to tutor a girl in my class for the aforementioned test\nMy math class a joint pre calculus and calculus class consists mainly of seniors not especially interested in learning\nI get that I'm the quote class expert unquote in that I always do the math problems which no one else can\nEnd for this I'm disliked I guess that because I apply myself think clearly and do a little work as well as some intelligence helping out I Am a geek in truth I'm far from it\nWhen you first read that to yourself when you first side of your reaction was\nIt was pure higher [noise]\nMe Adam Davidson and occasional contributor to our program found his old high school diaries Adams mom is Israeli status American and grew up in New York [noise] body was in New York His brain as the diaries reveal somewhere else entirely\nI remember when I was writing it I remember very clearly although I don't say this and the diary [noise]\nThat it was very

on our program describing your experience in Israeli Army summer camp that was right before I started reading the diary\nRemain other sure let's see um\nThere's so much wrong with Jews in Israel that I'm going to have a job ahead of me one thing it's a lack of any strong Jewish identity among those Jews this attitude thickens me huge ... of the world to stop worrying about money and well being\nI Do not know what exactly I'll do but if the situation continues when I'm a bit older than watch out world jewelry here comes Adam and watch out will generate here comes Adam is on Capitol

the passengers were you talk about Israel\nSure let's see\nI mean I have this thing from January fourth Nineteen eighty seven I memorized the hope ... which is the Israeli national anthem a few minutes ago that will help me in Israel\n[laughter] amazing that you're in your prime minister of Israel and and what are the things I Need all that I Need to know the national anthem will probably try to fund through a site that has something to be a ball game or something [laughter] you just didn't have a sense right exactly [laughter] [noise]\n\nJanuary fourteenth Nineteen eighty seven Wednesday I'm getting more and more angered by the effects of Arab propaganda they blame the Jews for everything and the world including Jews go along with it\nEntirely ridiculous I mean I really thought this was this was a testament for the ages I really thought that this writing was powerful and persuasive and anyone who would read it would immediately become as scientists [noise]\n\nAt sixteen I it's such an inflated sense of myself there was so much going on in my life than that I can remember and I wasn't recording it instead I was creating this\nRidiculous fantasy of you know I'm not just a sixteen year old kid who's you know having crushes and\nYou know a hopeless geek who can't get a girl a kiss them and being scared and confused about growing old I'm I'm the future prime
