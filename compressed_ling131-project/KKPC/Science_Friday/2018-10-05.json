C. A. at the Supreme Court furthermore judge cabinets approach toward the doctrine of separate belote is narrow\nWind up part of a statute is challenged on constitutional grounds he has argued for severing beat in Balad laws\nAs surgically as possible while allowing the overall law to remain intact\nFence what's his approach and his to send in a case that involved to challenge to the structure of the consumer financial Protection Bureau in his dissent\nJudge cabinet I argued for quote severing any problematic portion wells and leaving the remainder intact\nAnd quote given the current challenge is to be a ca proponents including my self up\nProtections for people with pre existing conditions should want to jazz says who would take just this kind of approach\nAnother research and that I heard often is that judge Kavanaugh cannot be trusted if a case involving alleged wrongdoing by the president were to come for for the court\nThe basis for this argument seems to be twofold first judge Kavanaugh has written that he believes said Congress should enact legislation to protect presidents from criminal prosecution\nOr civil liability while in opposite\nSister president I Believe opponents miss the mark on this issue the fact that judge cabinet offered Vince legislative proposal suggests that the print he believes that the president does not have\nSuch protection currently second there are some who argued that given the Kurds special counsel investigation\nPresident Trump should not even be allowed to nominate adjust to that argument ignores our recent history President Clinton in Nineteen Ninety three\nNominated Justice Ginsburg after the whitewater investigation was already underway and she was come\nFirst served Ninety six to three\nThe next year just three months after independent counsel Robert fist was named to lead the whitewater investigation President Clinton nominated justice briar\nHe was confirmed ... eighty seven to nine\nSupreme Court justices have not hesitated to rule\nAgainst the president's too if nominated them perhaps most notably in the United states versus Nixon three next send up point keys\nWho heard the case joining the ... opinion against him judge cabinet I had been unequivocal in his belief that no president is above the law\nHe has stated that ... versus Madison Youngstown steel versus Sawyer and the United states versus Nixon are three of the four greatest Supreme Court cases and the history\nWhy do they happen comments each of them\nIs a case where Congress served as the check\nOn presidential power and I would note that the ports case the judge cabinet has pointed to as some the greatest in history was brown\nVersus the board of education one cabinet odd dissension illustrates the point about the check on presidents empowered directly [noise] he wrote the opinion and I'm Don\nFirst in the United states a case that challenges the Bush administration military commission prosecution of so she had some uh bin Laden\nThis conviction what's very important to the ship mental strange them by judge Kavanaugh\nWho had been appointed to the DC circuit by President Bush and hadn't worked in President Bush's White House rule that the conviction was sons last fall as he explained during the hearing quote\nWe do make decisions based on who people are or their policy preferences or at the moment we base decisions on the law\nAnd the\nOther side's Mets with have expressed concern said Justice Kennedy's retirement\nThreaten the rights of same sex couples to marry yet judge Kavanaugh described the overcooked pals just says and which legalize same gender marriages as an important landmark\nHe also cited Justice Kennedy's recent masterpiece cage cake shop opinion\nFor the court's majority stating that\nQuote the day of trading gay and lesbian Americans are gay and lesbian couples as second class citizens who are in theory or in dignity and words are over in the Supreme Court and\nOthers have suggested that the judge holds extreme views some birth control in one case judge Kavanaugh encourage that does favor or both sides\nOf the political spectrum for seeking to ensure the availability of contraceptive services for women while minimizing the involvement of employers with religious objections\nAlthough his critics frequently over and looked at this point\nJudge Kavanaugh's dissent rejected arguments that the government did not have a compelling\nInterest in facilitating access to contraception in fact he wrote that the Supreme Court precedent strongly suggested that there was a compelling\nInterest in ... access to birth control\nThere it's also been considerable focus on the future of abortion rights based on the concern that judge Kavanaugh would seek to overturn roe v Wade protecting this race\nIs important to me to my knowledge judge Kavanaugh\nIs the first Supreme Court nominee to expressed the view that precedent\nIs not merely a practice and tradition but rooted in article three of our constitution itself\nHe believes set precedent is not just said judicial policy it's constitutionally gift Kate it to pay attention and pay the\nTwo roles of precedents\nIn other words the president is an ... goal or an aspiration it is a constitutional tennis\nThat has to be followed except in the most extraordinary circumstances and the judge further explains that presidents provide stability predictability\nReliance and fairness\nThere are of course rare and extraordinary times where the Supreme Court which writes the\nOverturn oppressed for them the most famous example was when the Supreme Court and brown versus the board of education over rules ... versus ... percent correcting a gravy asleep wrong\nDecision to use the judges term\nAllowing racial inequality\nBut someone who believe that the imports is the president has been rooted in the constitution would follow longest tablets president except in those rare circumstances where\nSome of the allegations levied against judge cabinet illustrate why the presumption of innocence is so important\nI Am\nThinking in particular not of the allegations raised by professor for but if the allegations that when he was a teenager judge Kavanaugh drug multiple girls and use their we can stay to sell like cave gangs re\nFish out last ditch\nAlec cage was put forward without any credible supporting evidence and simply parroting public statements some fathers that's such an allegation\nCan find his way into the Supreme Court confirmation process it's a stark\nReminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness\nMr President I listen carefully\nTo Christine ... seats for testimony before the Judiciary Committee I found her testimony\nTo be sincere painful and can ... I Believe\nThat she is such a survivor of sexual assault and that this trauma has up and did her like\nNever the labs\nFor when it said she named could not corroborate any of the advance some bad evening gathering where she says the is solved occur none\nOf the individuals professor poured says we're at the party has any recollection at all of that night\nJudge cabinet forests fully denied the allegations under penalty of perjury mark judge denied under penalty of felony that she had witnessed an assault PJ Smith\nAnother perks and allegedly at the\nDenied that he was fair\nUnder penalty of felony per faster sports lifelong friend liaison Kaiser indicated that under penalty of felony she does not remember that party and ms Kaiser went further\nShe indicated that not only does she not remember and I like that\nBut also that she just not even know Brett Kavanaugh\nIn addition to the lack of corroborating\nEvidence we also learned some facts have raised more questions for instance\nSince these allegations have become public professor poured testified that not a single person has contacted her to say I was that\nThe party that not furthermore the PR faster testified that although she does not remember how she got home that evening she knew that because of the distance she would've needed or bright\nYet not a single person has come forward to say that they were the ones who drove her home or were in the car with her that night\nAnd professor Ford also indicated that even though she's left that small gathering of six or so people up ... am without saying goodbye and to strive\nNone of them call during the next day or effort\nTo ask why she lab is she okay\nNot the whole book and Susan Collins of Maine speaking live on the center for Kaiser\nMr President the constitution does not provide guidance on how we are supposed to evaluate these competing claims it leaves that his says and up to each senator\nThis is not a criminal trial and I do not believe that the claims such as these need to be prove beyond a reasonable doubt\nNevertheless\nFairness would dictate that the claims at least should meet a threshold of more likely than not as our standard the facts\nHis sense to do not me that President that professor for was not sexually assaulted that night or as some other time but they do lead me chicken clues that the allegations fails to me\nThe more likely than not standard\nThere for I Do not believe that these charges Ken fairly per bad\nJudge Kavanaugh from serving on the court [noise]\nLet me emphasize that my approach to this question should not be misconstrued as suggesting that I Want to sexual\nContact of any nature is not a serious problem in this country to the contrary if any good at all has come from this ugly confirmation process\nIt has been to create an awareness that we have underestimated the PR face of of this terrible\nProblem\nI have been on my arms and disturbed however by some who have suggested that in last judge Kavanaugh's nomination it's rejected the Senate is somehow can Joan and sexual assault\nNothing could be further from the true every person\nMan or woman who makes such hardships sexual assault just serves to be heard and treated with respect me too movement is real\nIt mattered [noise] it is needed and did it's long overdue we know that rape\nAnd sexual assault or less likely to be reported to the police than other forms of assault on average an estimated two hundred eleven balance and rape and sexual assaults go\nUnreported every year we must listen to survivors and every day we must see to stop the criminal behavior that has hurt so men as we all this to our cells our children and generations to come\nSince the hearing I have listened to many survivors of sexual assault many were total strangers who told me their heart\nWrenching stories for the first time in their lives some of our friends\nThat I had known for decades you have with the exception of one woman who has confided to me years ago I had no idea that they had been the victims of sexual attack\nI Am grateful for their courage and their willingness to come forward and I hope that in tightening public awareness\nThey have also lighten the burden that they have been quietly bearing for so many here to them\nI pledged to do all that I can to ensure that their daughters and grand daughter's never share their experiences over the past few weeks\nI offending fat except the Senate has an obligation to investigate and the value way this serious allegations of sexual assault I called for and support is the additional hearing to hear from both professor force and judge Kavanaugh\nI also push for and supported the FBI supplemental background investigation\nThis was the right thing to do Christine for never saw the spotlight\nShe indicated that she was terrified to appear before the Senate Judiciary committee and she is Sean attention since then she seemed completely unaware of chairman grass leads to offer\nTo allow her to testify confidentially in California\nWatching her Mr President I could not help but feel that some people who wanted to engineers that to the ... nomination\nThat it it was in the words of one\nPerson who has worked with him over many years the dropping of a veil and the scary dropping the veil and he tried to put the to mix are metaphors here to try to put the genie back in the bottled with a a an op ed piece that he wrote in the wall Street Journal today in\nWhich he said he regretted some of the things he said but he never said what those specific things were and if as I assume he will be he's confirmed he will face a period of\nTrying to persuade I suppose the outside world that's probably the as well as probably the inside world and the court that he is not that part isn't that he showed himself to be on this one occasion\nScott Detrow your thoughts on what we've just seen\nA lot of thoughts but I think a chief among them is that a Susan Collins portrayed herself as an undecided swing vote on Brett Kavanaugh and I think that was sincere\nBefore Ford's allegations came out of college was very clear that that she was likely leaving yes on Capitol she felt satisfied and our conversations with him that he would not overturn roe v way that that he was more moderate than conservative despite who his voting record\nA bug what she did here and and we know that she spent several several hours multiple trips to that secure room reading with FBI report but what she did here was say I will announce my vote got all of America\nTo tune in including us during the special cover I just have to to stop you right there to say that we've just heard the Joe mansion is also going to be a yes for capital so to be one fifty one forty nine he'll be like tanks will not have to break the tie\nA threat but okay so so she she\nGets all America to tune in and then she delivers\nA closing argument for Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court that couldn't be better scripted from his supporters this is a moderate woman who's who's not viewed as a partisan firebrand making a case by case point for his temperament for his traditional ruling and then really are going through even though she kept saying that she believes that Ford\nOr was sincere and compelling really poking a lot of holes in her argument in a way that I think a lot of people who supported Ford will view is undermining our national television so this is really quite something\nHe was in ... you said something that we were sort of saying to each other while this was happening we were told she was going to be making an announcement about her vote but it really did turn into a forty three minute\nClosing arguments some Republicans and a very good one and I did one but what do you make a of how she\nSpoke of the Democrats she would go out of a way to say the Dianne Feinstein was a good friend but accused them of also a ah putting a nut Christine Blasey Ford in a terrible situation you know there's one thing here and\nAnd please guys if I've got something wrong that I think is is is a little bit off in in the factual right a timeline and that is a day in science and got this letter in July ... or early August and kept it confidential\nOr somebody leaked the fact that there was such a letter\nOr to intercept the online news organization\nAnd but without Christine Blasey Ford's name and shortly thereafter\nA bunch of reporters got for one way or another got the name but I Do not believe that her letter was actually leak to the existence of the letter that it was just the it was the existence of the lead or not the letter himself\nAnd I'm speaking is somebody who knows something about these kinds of things one state you know that there is this kind of complaint um the number\nOf people who who actually know a little more grows and financially and therefore it the ability of reporters to find it out grows exponentially and then in this case Christine Blasey Ford\nOnce reporters started contacting her said I'm going to talk to the Washington Post I called them originally they kept my confidentiality I'm going to talk to them and not anybody else\nJust in the minute we have left here as we wrap up our coverage of this event this afternoon in Washington Scott Detrow uh I was down at the court earlier today talking to some of the protesters who have shown up there to try to stop cabinet\nAnd they believe that this was going to happen that he would be confirmed a they also said that they're going to use that this November\nWill use that this November what does this mean just in thirty seconds for the midterms\nYeah we ... we had seen a narrowing it more than ... ... yeah I'm On the Republican side I Wonder if this reports that again a this was about a year remarkably since the me too movement started now and a lot of people's minds ah Christine Blasey Ford has been ignored by the Senate and they're going to put Brett Kavanaugh on the U.S Supreme Court\nIs NPR's Scott Detrow and Nina Totenberg daily Jeremy in Washington Jeremy you're gonna be staying there do

bad thing [noise]\n\nBecause every story has a flipside\nCalifornia already leads the nation in solar electric generation getting a sixth of its power from the sun\nHas plentiful geothermal power too\nAnd it is Donald up and down by when turbans but last month California Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill that mandates that state get a hundred percent of its power from clean energy sources that includes renewables and nuclear power by the you're twenty forty five and as the state prepares to ... it might do well to remember\nThat not all renewables are created equal according to two studies out this week the environmental and atmosphere impacts of wind power needs to be further considered David keep is one of the authors and he's a professor of engineering and public policy at Harvard and he joined us by Skype welcome to science friday\nDavid on your\nShow other areas how are you very well thank you great to be on the show\nOh thank you I'm Glad you said that again I'm Talking about wind power debt has definitely got some good things going for right but this is a little cautionary tale\nDavid are you there too but I guess we have laws paper you yeah\nOkay well we're going to let me get back there to get back to David a little bit later but in instead of going to bring on the Nobel Prize winner Dr Francis Arnold she's only the fifth woman to ever be awarded a prize in chemistry welcome to science friday\nThank you so much Ira\nIt's so nice to have you congratulations\nWell thank you [laughter] I was stunned\nOr what is more spending is that the fact that you won the prize or there or is there some part of the fact that I a woman was chosen to win the prize\nWell of course I'm thrilled to be chosen I Hope it's not just because I'm a woman but I'm also thrilled to be a woman who won the prize\n... we had Sarah capital and just on the Washington Post saying that I'm twenty nine pain that the Nobel Committee has directed people or or to look more inclusive\nWell that's good there are a lot of brilliant women who do chemistry and do chemistry at the highest levels so I think that's a good thing and we'll see more Nobel Prizes to women\nI think you'll be in an inspiration for some women are worth thinking about science [noise]\nI Hope so ...\n... talk about the ... just ... in a couple of minutes we have to take to break what do you think that you're in your work what your greatest contributions so far has been [noise]\nWell I teach some of the smartest people in the world who come to the California Institute of technology to do science\nAnd over my career I've worked with hundreds of really the smartest people in the world and I would hope that my greatest contribution is the some of their creativity in contributions ...\n... do you feel like a a yo yo la I've looked at your career you started out and and and sort of when and all kinds of different directions what finally got through to where you are\nWell sometimes it's important to go in different directions you learn different ways of thinking that you can put together a new ways ah finally I stumbled on biotechnology at the beginning of the DNA revolution and\nBecause we don't understand how DNA encodes function remember biology\nMolecular biology is a brand new discipline it's been around the the structure of DNA was published in Nineteen fifty three so it's not been understood for but for a very short time\nAnd how DNA goes through all the complicated things of his cell and makes biological molecules in codes the ... the the the structure and function to these biological molecules\nIs a brand new field and we still don't understand those rules\nAre so what you mean then and what what do people mean and then when you say are the directed evolution of something what is that process me\nIt's just like breathing it's we've been breeding cats dogs race horses lab rats corn for thousands of years without really manipulating the DNA directly but now that we can\nSynthesize DNA and put it in a test tube I can go direct the DNA and\nCombined DNA from different sources different species I can dial in levels of random mutations that can direct negotiations so I have control over the underlying DNA diversity and then I decide who goes on to parent the next generation\nAnd then how do you get a useful product ... what's the next step [noise]\nThan to think about flipping an entire coin onto the other side\nThis is science friday from WNYC Studios\nAnd my ... talking with Dr Eugene Chang author of the art of ... of logic in an illogical world I'm so one of the first things you acknowledged that the real world is actually a logical [laughter] but we had a lot of use but we get we can get a lot of useful work done in the abstract\nWorld yes we can find the logic inside situations even if the whole situation isn't completely no Jekyll and the discipline of mathematics begins with obstruction wet you shave away some of the details on competing relevant to the situation to find out what's really going on at route\nAnd when you've got to the root it's bad that you look at the logic\nAnd when you shave away those details you find that a lot of different situations become the same route and that gives you a way of connecting different situations and tapping into some understanding that you've achieved elsewhere and making connections between things but\nI I think that the shape that shaving away process [noise] excuse me is probably one of the most difficult parts [noise]\nIt might be quite difficult and it's one of the things that is off putting about mathematics people often say to me I was finally mass until the numbers became lapses\nAnd somehow that says scary step but actually numbers are already obstructions that already things where we shaved away the details that two cookies and to apple well if you ignore the fact that that cookies and Apple's then you've got the concept is too and we can do this with arguments in real life\nWell where we can shave away details and discover that arguments about say voter suppression have something in common with all these about arguments about cancer screening and arguments about accusations of sexual harassment for example because they're all about what do we care about false positives mall or false negatives mall\nAnd then we can see that those arguments come up and questions about social services any questions about who should go to university and those questions all over the place\n... what are some of the most common ways that you see people being illogical when they argue\nOne of the basic ones is when they simply use the wrong definitions right to stop and this is one of the key ways in which we might think that people are using the wrong facts and so for example I've seen arguments on the Internet\nGoodness me that some bad arguments on the Internet we have a I seen arguments on the Internet where people say things like they they believe that all immigrants are illegal and that is correct or they they they support\nThe Affordable CARE Act but not Obamacare and they've got the wrong definition of Obamacare in that case that was a study a survey of undergraduate male students that showed that many of them said that they would have known consensual sex if they thought they could get away with it but they would definitely not commit rape\nWhich means they built their own definition of rape\nSo we have to agree on terms but we do and that's something that mathematicians have I castle about agreeing on Tom's right at the beginning so then and not a very common era that people make\nIs when they make a false equivalence between one argument and another argument and this often happens in what's called a straw man arguments the flight to South Dakota stool person because I didn't like Jen during things I'm necessarily\nBut if you make an argument that seems quite reasonable to you sometimes somebody will replace it with a much more extreme arguments\nAnd believe that that's what you are trying to say and then they'll knock it down because the extreme argument is much easier to knock down and that can be very aggravating because that essentially painting you\nIn a very bad light and then taking a moral high ground and\nI Know that argument well talking with Dr

races Ken we have better conversations about the issues that get us most emotional talking about how a better understanding of logic\nLogic can help us talk and listen and maybe start to bridge some of those divides or at least understand why we're disagreeing so passionately\nOur guest is Dr Eugene you chain or a mathematician a scientist in residence at the school of the art Institute of Chicago her newest book is the art of logic in Indian logical world and\nWe want to hear from you as anyone's logic ever change your mind about something some some listeners are phoning in and first one Alex is from Chicago hey neighbor\nThat neither huh go ahead so odd\nPreviously identified myself as a an aspiring feminists\nAre I mean I don't know because my logic was that I really couldn't fully empathize with some of the issues that women face I'm at the mail um and I was met with that logic from a coworker of mine who um had said you know\nOut as a black male\nYou know you might be doing things that contribute to a white supremacist system that you might still knowingly or unknowingly but that doesn't necessarily make you no longer an African American male in the same way um women or being a man who contributes suicides ... knowingly wasn't necessarily\nMake me I'm unable to identify as feminists um it would just mean that I have to do more to aspire to um to contribute to permanent system and so I'm being able to see that I can still be a male male experiences while existing I mean that's\nI'm In identifying myself in such a way really changed my mind\nUm and I thought about that that's great thanks for calling that is great that very heartening\nIs you know as part of the problem that we don't see how we are there see us\nI think that is part of the problem but I think a big problem is\nThat we often spent you know trying to defend our own points of view instead of trying to understand somebody else's points of view and we often focus on trying to change someone else's mind instead of trying to see that point of view and see what it's religious he is and one thing I found very interesting in that the coolest experience is that\nIt was a great example of using some abstract structure to tap into the person's own experiences\nSo in a way I think the logic was used very cleverly using emotions as well to say let's find an analogous situation that this person will understand from their own experiences and then hope that they can translate that\nTo somebody else's analysis experience\nI have a tweet from James research to me logical discussions do require man he requires empathy empathy is caring enough to respect the view and listen to it is that emotional I don't know\nI agree I think that logic does not require mask that logic is in a way pauses math\nThese things have poor as boundaries I mean we've constructed a lot of us official boundaries between subjects that bureaucratic purposes\nBut I Am a mathematician and from my point of view because I Am so deep piece steeped in the discipline of mathematics I find that the full discipline of mathematics helps me", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city": "Pueblo",
