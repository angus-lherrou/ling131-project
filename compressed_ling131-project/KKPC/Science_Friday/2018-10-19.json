aunts and spiders tiny as they are they're all vital parts of our ecosystem where there is food or pollinators are predators and they have another thing in common complex social behavior I think about the term hides mind right\nThis idea that all the individuals in a group are working together to keep each other alive in this crazy world but how well does that actually work out what factors make a colony more or less successful in Kenya individual behavior still took the hand of fate for the whole group\nOr the hives indeed legion my next guest looked at these questions Alice Waters is an associate professor at UC Riverside studying the wives of bumble bee and Noah ... woman is an associate professor at UCLA\nLooking at these social behavior of bees ants and even spider [noise]\n\n... what did you know I if you ask everybody you built tell you the honeybees get all the attention right now but you've gravitated to bumble bee why was\nMy actually did my PHD in a honeybee labs are but I went Robie's and work done by movies instead I started to make a PHD in two thousand sex which is the year that the honeybee genome sequenced and when it we sequence we suddenly had this tool kit that we can use to answer all kinds of really cool molecular questions and honeybees and so\nI started fell in love with bumblebees and wanted to develop something similar for them\nAnd compared to only bees bumblebees have a very different like cycle right out of the colonies gets started\nA first honeybees there what we call perennially social so they're always social on there's never a point in their lives in a life as a hobby queen\nWhere she's living on her own the bumblebees are different and um they have an annually social life cycle where queens in the late summer season new queens will emerge in the colony\nAnd he's queens will leave the nest on their own and they'll go off and mate and the over winter all completely on their own and then in the spring I these queens have to crawl out of there over wintering spot\nAnd start their own ness that they're spending most of their life living on their own and so even though their social insects and they have queens and workers and that sort of complex social behavior they're also in a sense living like solitary insects are part of their life cycle too\nAnd you weren't brought an show us with the ...\nI did yes you'll notice from the get go than it looks a lot different than a honeybee nests it's really interesting because I'm to the best of our knowledge honeybees and bumblebees to actually share a common origin of sociology so we think that\nThe ancestor to both of these big groups they shared an ancestor about a hundred million years ago and we think that that ancestor was social but since that time you know a lot can happen in a hundred million years and so they've all these differences and today they look really different the way they nest away that they led\nTo protests Roman meanwhile honeybees are extremely social all the time right yes they are and we tend to confuse the two kinds of bees is having equals lifestyles all the time we really well to be to be\nBut one of the limitations of that is it's hard for some species that you ... in the lab to make queens and so if we know how it works and we get control it maybe we could develop new species for for pollination that are locals are not shipping them around and things like that\nI'm a replay of this is science friday from WNYC Studios is it true that you want to build a bar finger Roebuck\nWe do what is that far from the movies you know I think it's so incredible that they feed one another and so and the behavior is really interesting it's very sort of intimate and social\nBut if we want to study what it is and the fear that influences development or we need a system developed where a B isn't delivering the food we need to be able to deliver the food\nAnd so the robot that we're trying to develop this something that would actually and I must have like a little arm I meant it could move around and it can dispense little bits of food to larvae to bury them I'm outside of the nest in vitro if we had a system like that we could do things like test um in in with large sample sizes\nHow toxic certain pesticides are or how certain types of plant pollens impact that the growth and health of bumble bee larvae so there are a lot of questions we can't answer right now because we don't have a a nice sort of standardized delivery system\nInteresting for him and just just to wrap up do what's the practical use of understanding and sick he would help us understand something better\nMade so one of the lines of research that I've in my lap and then for seeing recently is looking how I'm dark picture of the nest influences the way that in the dance behave collectively and so\nOne of the things we find is that you know the way that the chamber's are organizing the tunnels are organized actually influences how they um forage in their forging behavior and\nI'm a recently I Am collaborated with some architects and social scientists who are also interested in this these ideas of how the built environment um influences team work and how humans work together\nUm instill the it's interesting even though as we said earlier humans and ants have very different perceptions of the world um that was the answer you know they live in these dark environments and don't see much and humans are very attuned to lay there are some similarities that we can draw between those and\nAn end system is a system where you can manipulate things and it just ... and you can move and from one structure to another which is more difficult to do with people and so potentially by using this more simple system you can um learn things about maybe how to design robots to work together and had the same space is for people to build better team Arkansas\nWon or who will stay tuned to see what happens follows water is an

plaza in Thousand Oaks California [noise]\nHow did you sleep last night yeah me neither something about being in the wrong time zone always catches me off guard\nBut I Am not the only one I can see from the audience that just takes about sleep in the United states among other countries aren't great fewer than two thirds of us are getting the recommended seven hours per night and you've probably heard by now that it's a bad idea to consistently lose disease\nChronic health problems acute cognitive problems the whole show bang\nBut is that our ability to sleep more than just a product of our habits are schedules\nCould there be jeans at work my next guest says the answer is yes he's on the hunt for genes that regulate how will we sleep in how well we recover from last week\nAnd he's found one of these genes in a surprising place nowhere near the brain welcome back to tame appalling associate professor of integrative biology and physiology at the University of California Los Angeles\n\nIs that right you need to get seven hours of sleep a night that's what the usual requirement is\nYes for um the majority of long term studies that I've looked have found that if you get significantly less or significantly more than seven to eight point five hours a night then that doesn't work out well for you in\nTime in a lot of trouble yeah 'cause I get like sick if I'm lucky I get seven I Know someone who gets two hours a night and seems to be doing fine with that but you're saying that that\nWell I can I add in all honesty I'm going to fix our crowd myself why do we need to sleep in the first place that's one of the biggest questions actually is why it was one of the reasons I have a job actually what we do know is that if you don't sleep adequately\nBad it impairs your health so they're kind of two categories of consequences if you're not getting\nSufficient sleep every day the first star where we can sort of short term\nSo many of you may stay up tonight after you leave here you may go hang out to a party or you just made me up with the kids not get enough sleep tomorrow your memory may not work as well you may have a harder time focusing on things you may make more errors when you try to do things that you normally do\nThose tend to be um cognitive affects there are more longer term effects of you continue daily on a regular basis\nNot getting enough sleep than their health consequences I'm it impairs your immune system which makes you at a higher risk for infectious diseases\nAnd it also increases your risk for chronic diseases like heart disease stroke and diabetes\nAnd I mentioned about genetics and sleep what what is there about genes are they involved in sleeping\nAnd interestingly enough I think our genes are pretty much involved in everything we do ... what does it what\nAbout sleep what our genes control would it be the hour the than the number of hours of the quality what what is one of the genes\nDoing that's what we're trying to figure out um the interesting thing when you're talking about James is you're not just talking about how genes are expressed but you're talking about how they interact with the environment\nSo in answer to your question there are several labs that are investigating those areas right now\nBut we're still at the beginning of answering those questions\nAnd one final question for you I'm what I Would call a night person I like to stay up late go to bed late I Know there are a lot of people who are morning people you know you you know who you are out there right they did say genetic thing too is there a genetic you know about going to bed lace thing up when we're going to bed early\nThough this is something that we call chronic type corona time and yes it is to a large degree genetically regulated I'm a morning person so I'm not getting along tried to be [noise]\nI Try to do with mark did earlier when I was young person but the inability to stab like kill that out of the career so now I I'm In the lab but yes um the the very genes that regulate your criminal ... whether you're a morning person or or in the evening person\nAre a lot of the genes that also determined to a lot of your other sleep trade so when we talked earlier about adolescence delaying as they mature it's those genes that regulate those mechanisms is there any kind of blood test yet that tells us about our sleep needs or or what kind of sleep or we are deficiency [noise]\nNot yet but I don't think I Would be exaggerating if I said that that would be\nRight now among the holy grail of sleep research that is a simple blood test a biomarker to determine whether you've sufficiently slept or not if you can imagine when it comes to transportation errors in accidents industrial accidents\nUm accidents that our current medical environments\nJohn the amount of errors that result from not getting adequate sleep if there were some method for us to determine whether or not you've had adequate sleep it would potentially lead to a dramatic reduction\nIn errors costs associated with those errors in even lives actually many of the major funding agencies have set a priority and trying to um pursue a biomarker or a blood test sobriety test has to be a word used\nFor sleep fascinating thank you very much like the ... professor\nOf integrative biology and physiology at UCLA

Ninety percent of our farm destroyed but it was really like a hundred percent because with the hurricane ... no one could come here to harvest\nWow so where do we stand now that [noise]\nWell and now I mean they're trying to recover but uh you know infamously FEMA and the government were slow to respond so really volunteers start as a step to end up failing the gap\nWhen I was there there was a group of volunteers from an organization called el ... departmental delta made out of that stuff food department\nAnd they organized volunteers just on they sent a group of volunteers anywhere from you know half a dozen to twenty people will just descend on a farm for a week and they'll tenth out you know the camp out in tents and they'll do anything the farmers need Donald Dell a fix fences plant crops we fix the roof\nAnd um it's that sort of a physical support that helps get a farm back up and running but the emotional support I think she was really\nA crucial to people and you know I did a a five part series on recovery or on the island after the hurricane and I saw this over and over again you know the government didn't respond so people just you know neighbors and volunteers um you know turned to each other for help and um I think you're going to see more of that in the future\nUh-huh why aren't there more local farmers in Puerto Rico that might help I have a large local food source of this type of disaster were to happen again\nYeah good question I mean it's a you know it's a tropical island plenty of sunshine in may and it it didn't make any sense to me to begin with either but uh you could really trace it back to a U.S policies on that specifically operation ... shot\nWas initiated in the Nineteen forties and it was a series of tax incentives and access to us markets and things like that that discouraged ads in mystic agriculture in favor of tourism and industrial agriculture so growing things like um coffee and cigarettes\nUm insurance and um\nAccess and a and a large part of it has to do with um women not being able to get a ... birth after they've had their first this area and so it's it's it's it's complicated we've seen the rise I'm\nIn a particularly in North America Western Europe Latin America and the Caribbean for example Latin America it's gone from thirty two percent to forty four percent\nAnd um it it there's a bit of a paradox when what we would call 'em\nToo much too soon and too little too late so in the countries that overuse sous area and they are probably intervening too much in low risk women that really don't need the procedure and in countries such as in Africa that um\nDon't have enough access probably are under using it for the world Health Organization suggests that Fifteen Percent is about ... about right so when you you think about one in three women in the United states having um has his area and we're way\nOver last talking about over ... there's just to for example in Brazil Ninety percent of the women that go into a private hospital getting C sections are they are they requesting that before they go in what is the mechanism what happens there\nWell I Can't speak specifically to ... you know the the interaction but but you write women who are wealthier who had insurance are much more likely the majority of them will have a C. section and it's and it's and accepted norm in this part of the culture in in Brazil\nBy C section tend to have more respiratory distress and particularly if they don't have spontaneous labor so there's something about that spontaneous labor that contributes to the nurses geology and the health the baby\nAmongst later this is science friday from WNYC Studios are so many questions let's go back to the phones to Wendy in Portland, Oregon Hi Wendy\nHi thanks for taking my call so I'm actually an obstetrician\nThat I I'm working just in a hospital so I'm In a struggle hospitalist and one of the things that I Do is uh just stay in the hospital to manage labor patience [noise] um so I think one of the ways the country\nIs we're finding is that um my type of job is becoming more and more popular so that um there are just physicians that are managing labor and hopefully\nAre allowing feedback send allowing patients to labor as long as possibly safe\nUm I'm from Portland, Oregon and we have the second highest rate of attempted out of hospital birth and we have really the best um data from our birth certificates looking at transport back into the hospital and I guess my my concern is that\nI hear you know the uh when I hear people talking of\nThe the ... you know very important things that result from from having labor I had some attempt fat labor that we really should have never been there and has really resulted in some catastrophic outcomes for both mom and baby so I I ... I Love deliveries I think they're great\nUm but I think there are some moms and some babies that needs needs the sections and we need to support that and well and you know really provide provide it when it's necessary or undergoing\nReaction thanks but no\nI couldn't agree more at scenario delivery as a life saving procedure and there are certainly a many women who should not undergo a ... delivery uh there's a number of different conditions that make that unsafe\nThe uh the important thing I think um to keep in mind is\nAlso that ah regarding the example of home births in United States and sort of that being an extension of the healthcare system and promoting badge no birth I'm well home birth in many countries are is a safe option and as a way to promote ... birth\nWe haven't quite figured that out in the United states I it is important in a health care system that promotes home birth to be able to make a really clear connection between home and hospital\nAnd when ... certain threshold or reach than a patient needs to be moved from home to hospital that's the part that we haven't quite figured out here yet on and until we figure that out I think it's it's going to be challenging to really embrace that as an option to promote factional birth\nWe can try to mimic that as best as we can on in the hospital setting and certainly have patients stay at home on for as long as it's reasonable um but home birth is not yet something in the United states that we have a really great system on to some ...\nLet me we're gonna have to take a break lots more questions we're going to spend them another good ten minutes on this so we're going to talk with Kelly Kennedy and also Tony Golan or number eight for for seven to four to five five stay with us we'll be right back after this break [noise]\nMy rough later this is science friday from WNYC Studios\nScience friday is supported by target presenting future at heart a pod cast on change makers and the projects their championing in communities nationwide\nFuture at heart available on apple pie cats or wherever upon caster found\nAnd by twenty three and me a personal genetic service designed to help people understand their DNA learn more at twenty three and me dot com slash WNYC\nScience friday is supported by legal zoom dot com offering a network of independent attorneys in tax professionals who can provide the advice needed to get through the daily grind of owning a business more at legal zoom dot com slash friday and from the Gordon and Betty\nMoore foundation more information at more died or\nThe election is coming and if you're a Colorado voters you know what you're in for endless ads fliers clogging up your mailbox canvassers banging on your door\nCan be easy to lose perspective that's why we are as an election podcast called purplish each week we kick the tires of Colorado's democracy and look at where it might be headed next that's\nPurple issue one word ... from Colorado Public radio you didn't wherever you get your body [noise]\nSupport comes from Mars ... purveyor of wine craft beers in Colorado spirits for tailgating chilly evenings and dinner with friends serving up tone for Seventeen years learn more I Am wine online dot com\n\n\n[noise]\nHi this is Jim aims president of kitchens by which would\nAnd we underwrite Colorado Public radio we underwrite because we strongly believe in what Colorado Public radio was doing in but philosophy is just here's an eyeballs in Colorado Public radio is a great vehicle for years\nThere was a terrific cost benefit because we know what works we get jobs in revenue from underwriting learn how supporting CPR can benefit your business a CPR dot org\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we've been talking this hour about the increasing the number of C sections and what that means for women's health\nI guess or doctor highly Kennedy professor of mid with free of the Yale School of nursing director Tony goal and vice chair of quality in a department of of obstetrics and gynecology at the famous ... Israel Deaconess Medical center\nIn Boston and lots lots of folks from on the line and let's see we only uh gosh I Can't get everybody let me ask you how you you worked in research midwifery in the u._k. how does the approach there compared to what we do here in the U.S [noise]\nIt it it differs in several ways and actually when the land this Lancet series on C. section came out that W World Health organization also issued new guidelines to help help us look at decreasing says Erin's and\nAnd one of the things that they have recommended is what the UK does which is to have a collaborative midwife obstetrician model of care where the midwife\nDoes most of the primary care and that's what happens in the u._k. all women have midwife and some women have an obstetrician too when it's when it's really needed\nIn the Lancet also published a series on midway free very extensive review of the evidence and they found that midwifery was associated with improved outcomes increase the including decreasing C sections\nUntil one what I'd like to just mention is in the United states\nThat study came out this earlier this year\nThat mapped the integration of midwifery across each state to see how ... how friendly\nThe state was in a regulation um in reimbursement independent practice to midwifery practice and so if you look at the New Mexico which has the lowest sea section rate of of just about Eighteen percent\nTwenty six percent of berserk attended by midwives in that state\nConversely with New Jersey has the highest rate of thirty three percent and only seven percent adverse are attended by midwives\nAnd then they met that with outcomes and if you look at Alabama Alabama has some of the worst and the turtle an infant outcomes in the country and only one percent of births are attended by midwives\nSo that's not a causation it as an association type study but it is paused for thought and that is what we saw in the u._k. is that um when you have a model of care when when women have access to continuity of care with their midwife midwifery knows then they feel respected um you have better outcomes\nA tornado when you work to drive down the rate down at your hospital dealing after a decade went from forty to twenty nine percent in a in a decade what did you do there\n[noise] well first we recognize that we had a problem and I think that's step one and trying to solve it and then we looked toward the evidence I'm not just our own evidence but the national evidence about what was contributing\nTo mostly and ... mostly in terms of the indications forces areas and focus very narrowly on primary says Erin I'm first looked at the interpretation of how we monitor fetuses um while women are in labor\nThat kind of monitoring called fetal heartbeat monitoring is very tricky\nIt's quite inaccurate and it predicts quite well for us when babies are well but does not do a good job of telling us when babies are on well", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city": "Pueblo", "day": "19"}
