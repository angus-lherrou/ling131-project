T. T. F. for New York was the first of its kind in the nation it's been in business since Nineteen eighty today there are three hundred investigators from fifty six agencies hundred and Thirteen of them are in New York City cops\nAnd it comes to ... O'Neill NYPD police command might be doesn't do anything without the FBI and the FBI doesn't do anything without the NYPD that's a partnership that was forged in fire in my thirty six years in policing our relationship has never been stronger\nHis case told that story again New York city cops for a side by side with FBI agents many other agencies in Florida this morning together they brought justice as they always do\nThe wide experience of our agencies coupled with the individual expertise the members of the NYPD bomb squad or highly trained emergency service unit or intel bureau a counterterrorism bureau or patrol cops were the first to respond to CNN\nAll I couldn't be more proud of the work each of them did in this case and the work they do every day we said from the outset and\nWe would identify and arrest that person or people responsible for these acts we can make that promise because of the confidence we have no ability to investigate it deliberate precise manner\nToday's arrest means that New Yorkers in the day people across our nation are safe but its director ... said that might be more packages out there so I went still needs to take caution\nAnd if you see something out there called nine one one and in New York City we have a number also won eight eight eight NYC safe I Want to thank them as the public who contacted authorities with information during this investigation New Yorkers don't back down they step up every single time we've\nBeen listening to special coverage of the Justice Department press conference on NPR\nYou also to the media for broadcasting the photos and YPG released\nBecause it's certainly help workers around our city identify additional packages and help move forward with this investigation thank you [noise]\n\nCould afternoon I'm Jeff from in the United states attorney for the southern district of New York\nFive days ago on October twenty second law enforcement recovered the first device from a resident of George Soros\nOver the last five days as more packages were found across the country delivered to former presidents federal officials in public figures are law enforcement community federal state and local has work day and night\nTogether with other prosecutors from my office to identify and apprehend the perpetrator that has now happened\nToday my office has filed a complaint against these are say are charging him with multiple federal crimes for his insidious conduct [noise]\nSpecific way to the Senate is charged five counts that include illegally mailing an interstate transportation of explosives and threatening a former president of the United states\n\nAs the ledger the complaint the defendant male destructive devices to citizens of this country who currently hold or have held our highest public offices president Brock Obama former secretary of State Hillary Clinton former vice president Joe Biden former attorney general Eric Holder\nCongress person Maxine Waters US Senator Cory Booker former CIA director John Brennan and former director of national intelligence James Clapper the defendants conduct as charge is cowardly and reprehensible and totally anathema to our democracy\nAnd now the defendant faces a potential total fifty eight years in prison [noise]\nThis is an ongoing an active investigation we will not rest until these crimes are fully investigated and the defendant or defendants are brought to justice\nI wanted to take a moment to thank our partners the joint terrorism task force the FBI the NYPD US postal inspection service New York state police the ATF\nThe hard working career prosecutors and investigators and the terrorism unit of the southern district of New York and I also like to thank the extraordinary cooperation we receive from the southern district of Florida affected\n[noise]\nGood afternoon for ... deputy chief nine states supposed inspection service um first of all like me and my colleagues I like to thank all of our federal partners who participated in this nation wide investigation FBI ATF Secret Service of\nThat this individual had any help but that is a question they're going to run the ground and the days ahead that along with the idea of whether there any other packages out there they want to get their hands on\nA wonder if I can bring in here a Republican strategist Allison Stewart Alex he just listened to the press conferences well there I Wonder if this is a legal issue it seems like every issue now is a political issue as well if you were advising\nThe GOP particularly the president on this how would you ah recommended they respond given that it has been so incendiary up until now\nI Would recommend that they take a played a page out of Jeff Sessions a handbook that he just spoke\nAnd that while we can disagree politically it's important to be an advocate for our beliefs but peacefully unlawfully comply with the results and I think that as a key message to take away from what we heard today and I and I hope that\nThat Republicans up and down the board up from the president on down to our local officials will repeat that message because I think it's critical\nThat we are in a very tense political time and it's it's important that we have the ability to speak out and and and voice our opinion but we have to do it in a peaceful way and also\nWith the elections are right around the corner that is another way we can voice our opinion but I we all you know can take away also from the the end of that press conference when\nA several of them were asked about the political motivations and the nasty talk and the rhetoric that we had\nAnd they the law enforcement officials and director re were were quick to point out that we don't want to be a premature in our speculation as to the motive here and they're going to focus on the work and not to talk\nAnd it it's it's clear that um there's some political undertones here but we don't want to get out ahead of ourselves and speculate too quickly on what his motives were\nThat does sound good June theory Alice but of course we live in a very political politically divided worldwide how I mean now that we are getting more information about the suspect we will learn more about his political beliefs in his background do you really think that that will bring down the political heat on this or just make it worse\nI Hope it brings it down and the way that that will happen is by our elected officials on both sides of the aisle calling for\nAs we heard several times in that press conference a more more peaceful and unity amongst all all elected officials and uh the electorate\nBut there's another component to that I think it's important to note taking off my Republican had in my previous life as a journalist\nI I I think that the fact that two of these devices were sent to CNN it's important to also consider that component of\nAn attack on free press and attack on journalists and an attack on the the the values that are the the news has it in our democracy and I I'm so proud of my colleagues at CNN for nonstop coverage of this event as this was going on but\nBut what what you do every day and what Kerry does every day and the the journalists at NPR\nThat the values that they do as a free press I I I Hope that people understand the significance of that\nAnd the component here that two of these devices were sent to a news outlet and we saw the sticker on his car that was attacking CNN and and I I'm pleased to see that a Jeff Sessions or his first mention of those attacked here was a media outlet\nAnd I I think we need to consider that as well as a political component\nOf this that's Republican strategist Alex Stewart who want to go back now to Carrie Johnson NPR justice correspondent we heard a each of the sneakers is quite a lot of tore tore his own organization an agency and into each others as well\nThis was obviously part of a very tight unit that work together but what happens now I mean they said they're they're pretty convinced that they have their man if it is just one person um but does does the investigation continue at the same pace that it has been over the past few days what happens\nI think it does continue at the same pace especially with respect to this idea that there may be other parcels or other suspicious packages out their authorities are worried about that they say they are not treating this as a hoax that under the right conditions these devices could in fact be dangerous to members of the public and they're going to be searching for those devices\nThey also want to get through all of this man's um communications his cell phone usage his tax they want to search his residence they want to search his vehicle and they want to talk to people who know him like his neighbors and family members to find out if he had any help\nAnd there's a lot of work to do in that regard moving forward over the next several days remember as the authorities said in his news conference and New York\nThe first suspicious package was uncovered only five days ago so they have gone from five days ago to now with a suspect in federal custody charged with fat a five felonies crimes are by their work is not yet done\nAnother important point of view I director Christopher Wray said these are not hoax devices the crude exploded\nCarrie Johnson thank you very much

I mean you know this is going to have him but you it was brilliantly portrayed I thought a really wonderfully done or you got a sense of what was happening um through all the jargon and why Armstrong moved ahead from the creator and what do you have to do ...\nI think it was a fairly accurate portrayal my understanding that there was somewhere between ten and twenty seconds worth the propellant left on the vehicle and actually touched down so I'm sure they were on the edge of the the ads that they were doing that um that are standing there weren't a seat but uh it was very well portrayed that there was a very high risk maneuver that Neal is executing\nYeah or if I remember correctly and falling all over all the years it was there was chaos going on back [laughter]\nUm which I think well you didn't see it as much because you were in the capsule that much time watching but the coolness of Neil Armstrong during this whole thing you know hand guiding this down and you see the the fuel ticking down and he's not panicking and he's there he's finding his mind and he\nPuts it down I mean it was it was they they captured that very well with absolutely\nYeah I agree and and then the the first ... off the famous one small step now he ... he did not say one small step for a man\nHe said one small step for man you know isn't there has there been some controversy about what he really said\nAfter ... yeah I mean for years yeah but I think we can uh say that you know I think the sentiment is more important than the proposition but ah yeah we're not sure exactly what what he said I didn't see it because there were ...\nI think he said at some point after that he was a man yeah that was that was the intention was his pension and we look back at the space race this time when the nation and the Apollo\nA landing the world was United in one vision I remember all are and they show this in the film I cannot remember another moment since then where the whole world was watching one\nEvent together and it was the sort of a unifying experience and I said\nYeah I absolutely I think people forget that they were actually you know a lot of Americans who might we're not as enthusiastic about the space program in the sixties but I think that one moment in July sixty nine I think there is some kind of a cultural consensus yeah\nAnd this was one year after what I consider the most terrible year Nineteen sixty eight I ever have lived through so and then there was to have this kind of events that were everybody was sitting United together because the country was so divided over the war and feels a little bit like that now that's where the same feeling where to take a break and talk\nMore about a space travel and talked with him I guess here about maybe if you saw the movie please let us know a number eight for for seven to for eight to five five you can also tweet us at ... we'll be right back after this break stay with us [noise]\nUm I replayed oh this is science friday from WNYC Studios\n\nScience friday's supported by target presenting future at heart a pod cast on change makers and the projects their championing in communities nationwide future at heart available on apple pie cats or wherever pond caster found\nAnd by twenty three and me a personal genetic service designed to help people understand their DNA learn more at twenty three and me dot com slash WNYC\nScience friday and supported by legal dot com offering a network of independent attorneys in tax professionals who can provide the advice needed to get through the daily grind of owning a business more at ... dot com slash friday and from the Gordon and Betty Moore foundation more information at more\nOr this\nThe CPR news when you want to catch up on a lot of Colorado News Go to CPR dot org there are stories on energy and education Colorado politics and the outdoors and a lot more\nStories from NPR and connections to CPR classical and open air and you can stream the news and music any time and your comments are always welcome whatever's on your mind we like to hear from you at the website the address is CPR dot org\nActive members and network partners help strengthen Colorado Public radio through charitable giving thank you Fran McKenzie Mary Lou static and the Randy family for supporting programming that you rely on learned about giving levels on his support page at C.

inspired by the civil rights and the thing I just feel like he's just all around up really multifaceted fascinating person killed in a movie at that and I'd love to see addressed you see something about her\nYou're not in very much in agreement\nOh yeah I may Jonathan has is very cool I've I've met her a few times and it's just always a treat to talk to her about can you tell us a little bit about her history and um I I think pretty much what like the college that is what I Know of her as a she's just like a really interesting life filled with a lot of different things from science to the our\nNewsroom\nOn age and I said yeah there are certainly a lot of a background um she flew wanting to shuttle flights early ones for ah went in and and I think there'd be a really interesting story to tell their\nYep suddenly I think there would be amazing stories or um you know life is amazing\nThat it is a treat from a tweet from ... says how about the early women astronaut to didn't fly\nOr perhaps what would happen would have happened if they did\nFor like an interesting topic and there are all these behind the scenes story right\nYeah there are I mean I think um [noise] it that the mercury that Thirteen rate I so I I they're I Believe was a ... some kind of Netflix theories about about them also some kind of documentary series that was regarded as\nYou know ... and all the people who were in that control room and all the other places and you know\nAll kinds of all kinds of stories\nUm it's interesting ah this this is a movie about the heroes of astronaut certainly fifty years ago\nSo you actually have a little beetles recording studio\nI sure do I made it out of 'em out of some sound absorbent materials some nice foam on the inside and I set up a\nWhole little hole little set up and had a nice little piece of barks for the Beatles to hang out on and a and a video camera and microphone so it was it was a legitimate set up\n[laughter] I'm I'm I'm fascinated about what they are doing to make that sound how's how's that sound produced\nSo I personally think it's something very similar to a cricketer grasshoppers raft and file and so I think that there is sort of a a ridge to wash board structure on the abdomen that they're moving against hard part of the wing covers\nUm the the actual the light sure that you see on on the back of the Beatles I think they're moving that up and down across much like nails on a wash board\nUm another way to insects make squeaking sounds though is by forcing air out through holes in the abdomen through which they breed called spirit calls so if you've ever seen a hissing cockroach or they don't have a mouse they don't produce that sounded things her mouth structure that's actually from the abdomen so that's another possibility\nSo so the whole ritual goes like well you have these two male big beetles with big mourns and they fight for the right to woo the female the one who wins then plays her a song that basically what we're we have going here\nYeah basically and and what else would you know would you like to know about them if I could give you my sixty four dollar question and I'm I'm limited check which I don't have what would you what would you do what would you construct how would you use what would you like to know [noise]\nUm I Would like to know and this is what we're trying to figure out in the lab but right now the biggest question is what are females looking for males and is it different than the competitive traits that we already know are important in the competition side of things\nEven in the Beatles community that's what the question is what our [laughter]\nOur it's this is a a they joined dollar question is the age\nOr a question of ... and so how many beetles have you studied do you think\nOh gosh over the years well in in our first population a ... we caught at least eight hundred nails in one summer it was they were everywhere my uh my old mentor described as like a plague of needles [laughter] and they're yeah\nThey're just looking good description of a group of buildup leg of beetles biblical proportions anti that Jillian thank you very much for taking

looked at five diverse different so called sketchy treatments solve some of the most dangerous ones being stem cells and plan for instance central nervous system people raising money to get this done\nNow than in Mexico why the China some procedures here in the United states as well and a righty of other things also that are are not FDA approved essentially highly dangerous people and their generosity are donating these campaigns because folks are desperate for help out individuals that but not really realizing that you could be causing some real harm\nYou could be or how much how much money are we talking about here\n[laughter] so crowd funding and of itself is a this ... billion dollars has been raised so far on go on the alone\nAnd medical crowd funding is the single largest segment of that as far as the problematic campaigns I Can't say for sure because we just selected kind of a representative sample of five to a snapshot of the activity\nWe found folks trying to raise about twenty seven million dollars or five of these shady street that's a and they raised us over six million dollars\nYou know some people would say what's what's the problem here these patients have a right to try and seek their own cures trying new treatments of others have not worked for them [noise]\nYou're right and that's how the libertarian point of view and and it does exist however\nUh this is a little bit different transactions than a year you know the point that out of your own like accounts were just your own close family or friends now third party is involved and potentially\nCausing harm to yourself and that goes that that is largely go from me but the other platforms as well and so they do now have an ethical duty and that transaction\nIs there any way to know if you see one down how to find out in your own whether this thing is worth crowd funding for you [noise]\nThey're not and there should be and that's part of their critic uh that we\nIt's the

had an affinity for it\nBecause you mentioned chemo the magnificent which I remember\nSeeing what you are the fast to us and he's ever had that I remember\nThat in this in the fifties and I remember seeing it I remember a part where they were squeezing I've used burning blood out of a pipeline would be in an artery\nAnd they're stuck with me ever since and I'm so happy to you you mentioned that because it really put it on the radar screen for me yeah\nI mean I just can't I Can't even remember how I came across a bit I was a much much happier pass and once I had I mean it's it's slightly I'm eccentric shall we call it ... but it's it's just wonderful and\nIt's got it's got the poetry Scott Matheson is good science has got everything and it's yeah I I it's very hard to describe though I mean once you've seen 'em ... listening to being competitive railroads which men nights it's yeah it's quite and indescribable filmed up and that really was looking up\nLike the early days of

where the natives medicinal each in Europe was pushed to extinction\nAnd um they little widely abused\nRarely um and there was a French doctor who was one of the pony up to who was known as ... and he he\nUsed almost at preventive medicine to prescribe sixty leeches even before he'd seen his patient and but then they felt that the fashion once when the stood things like German theory and disease\nAnd because they they we used to ... to balance the humidity in the body once the humorist theory\nWent out the window and so did leeches but then in the um about fifty years ago in St Louis and ended up to you again and found that day was still the best thing of all if you have to let this congested\nBecause you have a really astonishing on the continent in saliva so when they they when they bite they and they give you this on the continent and it can keep blood flying for\nUp to ten hours so if you for example you've had something amputated auto enough and it's summer weather lots
