away from it\nAnd I was trying to come up with an analogy for what the book is like to read and I came up I was watching the film at Henry the fifth last night on TV and I was one of my favorite Shakespeare plays\nAnd if I were just to read any Shakespeare is very hard to understand what's going on in the scene but if you\nGraphic making it to a film or video and watch the actors they sort of bring to life between the words and that's what I see you have done in your book is some of these concepts seemed to be very scary but when you create the graphics\nAnd the dialogue between the characters in their lives is that scary part and you say oh that's how that works thank you that that's\nThat's what I intend it and I'm really glad to hear that that it works in that way because that's a really great an allergy with ah bringing bringing the page the words on the pace of life in theater and film and then the rate analogy think you\nKnow speaking of bringing to life on a bring on a giant eleven who is author of a black hole rules about blues I'm Sorry black hole blues and as a\nNew special on black hole down to ... this week she's professor of physics and astronomy at Barnard College in Columbia University good to have you back\nThanks and here I Am alive [laughter] and get to hear you Clifford high grade are you\nTalking about one of the ideas Clifford plays within the book is this perception in the media and the public which is string theory right or wrong multi verse right or wrong which side do you want and so on but in real life physics is not quite as black and white is it John\nYeah I mean I think it's really important that the scientists not to put a belief system first the whole point is to explore the unknown so you don't want to walk into any field and said this is what I Believe\nThere has to be a certain agnostic about everything and so I'm pushing string theory or the multiverse you may have a strong intuition that it's right or wrong but it's really important and that might try to get to ask a particular question pursue particular calculation but it's really important to always be open minded to the other point of view\nAnd that's what this is one of the strengths of this book Clifford is that you have a dialogue with the book the cartoons they\nThe novels based on two people sitting together over a cup of coffee or in the train and they're having a dialogue about something questioning each other's beliefs asking them to you know give them their opinion and sometimes not agreeing but then trying to find you know some common ground belief there\nYeah and I was trying to I I was trying really uh to celebrate that kind of conversation which are no disrespect to some of the wonderful\nA science books that are out there but it did seem that a lot of them sort of clean up the discussion in a way way you lose that that conversational aspects and and the messiness of conversation which is which which can be quite engaging so I tried to represent\nThe kind of conversation in the book\nAnd and really show the various kinds of issues that get people into heated debates and uh and then tried all sorts of shows that it it it it's just by no means clear research doesn't work in the very simple way that these these sorts of um which Saudi one debates are often presented\nTalking about uh the dialogues conversations about the nature of the universe with Clifford or the Johnson and I'm also a gentle ebb and tell them you tell us about your nova\nIt was a real experiment and also digital representation and that's a different situation because unlike cuss words back which I really admire particularly because of the single authorship drawing it himself I mean that just really has my\nMy admiration and this is a big collaboration it's a big ... a lot of people involved in the writing in that direction and the production and a lot of scientists interviewed for it and each giving their sign that it's a completely the opposite end\nAll that kind of creative experience but one right though I saw I think that I get to fly around in a spaceship I mean he doesn't want to do that I fall into a black hole I mean you know yeah [laughter]\nWell let's bring up ... because in in the book and the dialogues it appears that the black hole on if we understand the black hole we might be able to\nUnite the two on United all parts of physics now which ... which is you know the training grand unified theory gravitation and quantum physics ... is that is that when you set out to write the book to use that as a major theme you wanted to show that we might be able to unite those\nWilling to their um it wasn't one of the main things I Want to talk about but it it it did come up a number of times because black holes are tend to draw you in a both physically a narrative ... I'm a among other things and in the in the field of ... research I'm a theoretical physics trying to understand some of these questions\nBlack holes have become central because they they lie at the cost of the the the best we know about the classical understanding of space time which is on science theory of general relativity\nAnd uh and and an quantum mechanics somehow black holes turn out to be this wonderful test beds\nAny new ideas you have about quantum gravity how space and time work\nOn a mechanically which is one of the quest uh it it you have to test it against what black holes are telling you and how black holes behave and and sometimes it it either I'm Single swims on how well it behaves in the context of black holes have become this wonderful a low bar tree of ideas\nYeah absolutely I mean we we talked a lot in the show about black holes how nature actually makes them and theoretically they're incredibly interesting that for a long time even Einstein believe nature would protect us from their formation that they wouldn't be possible\nAnd the fact that nature thought of a way to make black holes which seems to involve killing off really big stars as a debt state um is phenomenal but what ... absolutely true that almost more importantly\nBlack holes are a fundamental landscape on which we can act out the the most extreme scenarios that involves the clash between\nThe physical a small scales I'm caught in mechanics and the physics on the largest scales which is the curb space time and it's really only they were maybe in the black hole that we have a way of getting clues and evidence even theoretically by pushing the mathematics of what's next\nBecause that's where they meet ... yeah to write the are both elements that are seen you seem like a reconcilable are reconciled well they have in our minds [laughter] how was reconciled yes indeed and and so\nYou know and it it goes back of course when the most famous names in the field is Stephen Hawking and it goes back a somewhat too to some of the work that was going on at the time in ... including ... but most famously hawking radiation her I ... which\nAre going to tell you to save that thought if I break [laughter] well it's a good place to go back to walking radiation Gregory Johnsen a giant eleven oh we'll be right back after this break stay with us we've been talking\nAbout the head scratching physics of the universe and how to make that science accessible at science friday we try and do that each and every week and if you value easy to digest explanations of complicated information and deeper insights into the universe around you give the station\nA call right now with a show of support here's how to help\nPick up the phone call eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty you can also go to CPR dot org\nHey I'm Grace hood I cover energy and environment here at CPR and I'm sitting alongside my colleague Ben Marcus who covers business he'd been to Africa and hey I then I don't know how much you've covered science stories but boy can it be complicated and uh I feel like you can kind of get into black holes a little bit when you're a sorry mixed metaphor here but\nI it can be really complicated\nJob to communicate science and that's what I Love about science friday is that they really distilled they pick interesting topics and they really distill it into kind of bite sized digestible pieces\nThat is a gift and science friday's really get we're asking for your support for science friday for science journalism that you hear on CPR and please contact us right now eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty CPR\nDied or you know when I was reporting in Hawaii there's a lot of astronomy research because our scopes on monarch hair\nA and there was somebody who'd printed a bunch of research on dark shift I came to explain to you what it is never heard of that but it was probably borderline journalistic malpractice in my lack of understanding what exactly does shift was so I Do have a big appreciation for Cy fried being you're having\nSome of my ... who actually knows a lot about what he's talking about these are intelligent people\nHaving smart conversations about the things that matter CPR or go to that website now give a little bit to support that ten dollars a month\nA hundred dollars a month if you're feeling really generous seems like a lot but money or time subscription was up to a hundred and ten when I finally had to\nCancel the paper delivery it's now just for twenty dollars a month for the online twenty dollars a month for some of the best content in the world whatever you want to pay for Colorado Public radio you get to set the price but do it now it CPR dot org one eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty hearing\nFrom a listener and bowler who took out at one time membership also heard from a listener in Grand junction who gave a one time gift\nUh we're hearing from listeners across the state Fort Collins' birthday Denver won't you join them right now in supporting CPR why are we asking for your support you may you may I ask a why don't you just sort of get onto safe right well let me hear me here to tell you\nFrom an underlying quantum reality and those sorts of things we're hoping we can build a into a full theory of how the world works eventually\n... certainly going back to one of the main point to me before 'cause we're we're running a little bit and I might we could talk about this forever but\nLet's talk about the eight hundred pound gorilla in the room which is a black hole heavier than me [laughter] he's he's the black hole ... gonna be the Rosetta Stone for physics\nYeah I mean I really feel the black hole is the key to providing as evidence it's giving us close all the time and and as we experiment even just in pen and paper on the surface of the black hole\nIt is not joining us ever closer to some revelation and and I think it may be what do you think ...\nYeah I I I think it\n... as I said before it it it it it has this this poll or both both are literally in metro ... which is ... which is interesting in that\nIt showing of the ... the concepts of black hole and the the mathematics and physics at the black hole lead you to shows up in so many different areas of theoretical physics um ah both directly and indirectly\nUh and uh that's really interesting to see I think his ... there's an interesting history story that's going to be told about that and um but it's also instructive physically ... Ito astrophysics is the obvious place um [noise]\nUh now an a whole new ... new way because of a colliding black holes giving us gravitational wave signals that we can detect a expanding astrophysics in a huge way but then you come to questions of the corner of nature of space time et cetera and again black hole seem to be\nA central there but then through things like string theory you find that the properties of black holes even abstract properties on the page black holes in strange space times if you work out the mathematics\nSometimes turn out to be powerful ways of re costing other kinds of physics which you can actually dress up to look like the physics of black holes for the sake of doing a useful calculation\nSo black holes are becoming this sort of ubiquitous concept and or even a tool box for doing physics so it is quite a remarkable um idea\nIn case you're just joining us talking with Clifford Johnson author of the dialogues conversations about the nature of the universe and we're also talking with a gentleman who is but you you got the nova ... the number specially the same title of your book black hole blues\nNow it's like ... [laughter] yeah well you're not black hole utopia [laughter] I'm black hole blends\nIs actually so named because ... won the Nobel Prize for the like the discovery of the ... black holes along with kept dying day there that could just mentioned um ah gave me the title because he said to me like a month before the discovery if we don't detect flat halls this whole thing's a failure\n[laughter] well I'm thinking of\nThings we haven't discovered that hit the whole idea of the theory of everything is that God is there still possible lead time that's been talked about for decades\nYeah it's not gone down that's really still in some sense what what what cliff was referencing\nWhen when we're describing the black hole can do for us it can drive us towards that Syria to everything it will be interesting if it turns out to the theory of everything is supposed to unify the matter forces which is a lecture week\nUm and strong currently which we think can be unified and gravity gravity is really the outlier know it might be interesting if again is Clifford said it turns out that it's only matter forces and gravity is this illusion that emerges from the quantum phenomena that man it's just something that we see on large scales that doesn't actually fundamentally exists your\nCountry do you still have a second act the dialogue or another book um\nI I I ah ... the original book as originally proposed was about four hundred pages long so I I cut out to vote to I'm a enough for almost a second volume I actually think it would be fun to revisit uh some of the same characters are having other conversations\nBut ... but in terms of the physics which is really the starring character\nI think I Would probably delve even more into the quantum aspects and so I Do in this book I I think there's some wonderful things going on as we've already talked about in the ... in the concepts of understanding space time and in turn them into things like that\nThat deserve a visual treatment that they really haven't been given and there's something about the language of a narrative sequential Archie Comics if you like that lends itself to physics\nMore than almost any other form and uh I I I think this is just the beginning of of what one might be able to do so\nAn experiment I'm curious to get going it just takes a long time a concern compelling and then it's beautifully written beautifully drawn very well thought out the easy to read makes you think in a\nBeautiful book great work you like it very much clearer Johnson author of the dialogues conversation about the nature of the university is also\nProfessor of physics at the University of Southern California and co director of the ... Institute for humanity their walk and talk about that some day was a journalist and author of black hole blues and she's also professor of physics\nAnd astronomy at Barnard and you can see her nova series can streaming yeah again John great to see it\nWe've been talking with Joanna Lebanon Clipper Johnson about are amazing universe and how to explain it you know each day this station helps to explain your universe and helps you make sense of the world around you but they can't do it without your support so please give them a call now here's the number\nHi this is Alex calling from little ten\nI think they should ... CPR if you're like me and you start every story what I heard on a public radio or if like me you're able to call the pledge line from memory without having to look up the phone uh this is truly a station and service I value and I encourage you to part as well thank you\n[noise] [noise] Hi my name is Denise and I live in Colorado I support CPR on a monthly basis because it is a medium that helps me find myself if you would like to find yourself as well pleased that are becoming an evergreen partner like I Am thank you\nMy name is Josh I live in Denver, Colorado a sporting yours

six Fifteen thirty hey I'm Grace hood I cover energy and the environment I'm sitting alongside my colleague Ben Marcus who covers uh the economy\nAnd you know there's a lot of different reasons let's just be honest here there's a lot of different ways to support public radio and a lot of different reasons behind why you support it or maybe you like quality companionship for your companion animal maybe it's science friday maybe you love hearing about the latest in science\nAnd you want to hear firsthand at an in depth to interview a with somebody who's thinking about big meaty scientific questions or maybe like Colorado matters maybe just kind of want to hear a conversation about what's happened in the state maybe it's Ben Marcus his reporting\nOn the economy or what's happening to housing prices sort of mystifying to me what ever the reason we're asking for your support right now when he called eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty or you can give at CPR\nDot org right what are the ways we approach over reported and especially on the business me just to give people the best possible information so that they can make decisions in their life and it stretches across anything you could hear whether it's education or health care energy in the environment business politics if you have the best information\nYou can make the best choices whether that's women or you should send your kid to private school or public school whether or not you should invest in the stock market whether you should buy or sell your home\nYou have huge decisions that you have to make and you need great information and the best information in these days in my opinion specially in the broadcast round as Colorado Public radio and you know you don't need to spend much to support that ten dollars a month\nTwenty dollars a month to go to CPR dot org ah quickly ah like a evergreen member like myself it'll take a just a few minutes to get into the process and then you'll give a little bit every month out of a checking account or credit card or go to CPR dot org and check out all the things you can get and do one eight hundred for nine six Fifteen\nThirty how have a listener in golden who's giving five dollars a month and says I Love science friday\nPlease keep it on the air five dollars a month is that something that you can do that is a latte that's a you know maybe one of your streaming a news selections for the month\nI mean whatever you can give we're asking for your support right now don't delay we'd love to hear from you eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty CPR\nDot org Jill and map that just moved here from Texas to Lafayette thank you so much for giving your pledge and\nUm they're like hundreds of thousands of other people have moved to the Colorado a front range area you're new to the place you dial in CPR dot org and you get to learn a lot about your community it doesn't cost that much to be a part of a community CPR dot org ten dollars a

broadcast media\nOr I'm getting off my soapbox our bed Marcus I'm a reporter here at Colorado Public radio I Am alive at the end of a two hour shifts or get a little body in the next few minutes forgive me CPR dot org is our website please give right now Greece hooked on the other microphones\nHe there I don't delayed this is a great time to give we just have five minutes six minutes actually left in this hour and we're asking for your gift right now eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty CPR dot org\nRooted in some barrier got her gifted CPR dot org and here in the last few minutes of this hour you're listening right now maybe ... is your show\nIra Flatow's but almost shows as long as I can remember yeah actually and I love to see him are big bang theory or to reprised his role as Ira Flatow on science friday on NPR do oranges are websites support Ira\nAnd grace and myself and all the reporters were still busy at work in our newsrooms to few steps away from the studios are trying to bring you the best\nWe can in from all corners of Colorado one eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty\nBut really I mean what is what's your CPS CPR jam is it in science friday is at Colorado matters maybe It's MORNING edition\nOr on the way to work or all things considered maybe it's fresh air you know if if that registers for you that means you're a regular listener and that's why ban and I are here to talk to you right now to ask for your support because our funding model depends on listeners support\nOr if you've been listening for many years and have never given we especially would love to talk to you right now and invite you to join a with a gift of any amount maybe it's five dollars a month maybe to sixty or fifty dollar one time gift maybe it's a thousand dollars or more you know the really cool thing here is that you set the amount\nBut Ben and I are here to remind you about how the funding model works and also say please become a member eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty CPR died or\nAbout you but I Am an epic procrastinator I'm I'm sure many of you out in the audience are as well a lot of those rare times I finish something early it feels so good\nGift that pledge get that gift and right now at the beginning of our pledge drive it will feel so much better than waiting until the very end CPR dot org is our website ten dollars a month we'll send you the Colorado Public radio socks\nUm our phone number is one eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty the Sox have been a huge hit a around the station one eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirties\nWe are hearing from listeners in Montrose in birth said in Fort Collins in Erie won't you join us right now what's holding you back ah what is holding you back I don't know what is holding you back\nOr is it that you want to just get your weekends started or maybe you're rushing back to work I been run into marrying errands whatever the reason\nThen and I are here to remind you that it really does just take two minutes to give you a gift you can phone us at eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty you can go to CPR dot org we have many easy ways to get in touch with us but the critical part is that you reach out right now don't delight eight hundred for nine six Fifteen\nThird Jacqueline in Westminster is hoping to make this happen she's an became an evergreen member thank you so much she writes the savings CPR is a vital source of information it's objective has good variety it's the only radio news that she listens to\nIf you're the same way if you don't even leave our station at all you just kind of let it sit or maybe point one or wherever you get Colorado Public radio news\nThen you should give as well ten dollars a month we'll send you the Colorado Public radio socks which are brand new an awesome CPR dot org one eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirties\nHearing from a listener in Denver who says hey I Love listening to the radio exclamation point\nWe're so happy because we love making what you hear on the radio and we're asking for you to give right now we have just over three minutes left in this hour and boy would we love to hear from you it's so critical that you get in touch with us eight hundred for nine six Fifteen thirty or go to CPR\nDied or sometimes people will be like so you've been on doing these fundraising sessions like are you tired of it at home no love it\nTelling of you know how much they appreciate the programming and what we do here and that's what makes it worth the trouble is from as hard\nIf I'd known how hard it was to put together a radio story of when I started this I might have thought twice about becoming a public radio reporter it is very difficult time consuming work to do it right\nBut that's what your gift supports the reporters doing it right and it's becoming hard to find the anywhere especially in Colorado CPR dark or our website Go there do your gift and ten dollars a month or more
