Jews\nI Know many people don't realize it but there's a big difference between conservative reform to that don't like Israel and don't like really being Jewish between Orthodox Jews that love Israel and of course the old on some\nAny personal commonsense knows that Obama is the biggest uh is all eight or enjoy it and say you got to be a fool not to believe that and went down so there is no president ever ever did in Israel which is why does everybody to bridges and is on the end after Donald Trump even a train station 'cause you know that\nI Do know that but but just at the point is Seventy five percent of American Jews don't like him I absolutely get your point about the uh twenty five percent that do I know a lot of them to do I'm just talking about collectively Seventy five percent can't stand them I don't plan on voting for for him again ... when he runs again and twenty twenty\nThat's because you know trying to say what do you think Jews don't you don't really want to be with us from trying to tell you they're going to vote for people that would not want to support Israel as I'm trying to say that surprised him either like that actually makes sense that fits everything right\nThose are my or here's my question is if they do does not support Donald Trump do you believe that person or that Jewish person is a shame to being Jewish that's my question to you\nYes with no doubt yes with no real know that really yes\nI mean you got to be a fool I mean if you really Jewish solid Jewish I mean you've got to be dumb enough to vote\nFor I don't know I I look look you're preaching to the choir about about the Jewish vote the black vote the Hispanic vote that they are all these people that overwhelming vote for the Democratic party I think the wrong to do so but I think it's another leap to say you were ... self loathing Jew with you if you don't support the Republican Party and that seemed to be to be what what you're saying Joe so that's what I'm asking you\nYes yes cut down summer prevents common sense right now you brought up to the world with common sense between ... and false\nAll right so so all the Jews who voted for Obama for example in your opinion are self loathing Jew I'm asking\nOh disgusting you refer them all the time no question self loading of course there seem to be no question that yes there's no doubt about it\nNow now you're aware Joseph that that's the same slam it's used against black people like me I'm I'm call self loathing because I'm a Republican\n[laughter]\nOkay so the two people who will work out right now after what's going on if you're dumb which is unfortunately the truth and we all know that oh you're a person just evil I mean the people to know what's going on is full support Hillary and all these people are just pure evil which is why I think Trump is so important that these days in office because he represents the truth\nIt's being Jewish Christian Muslim if you will fight for the truth you have to go for Trump otherwise\nI don't know what okay so Joseph how do you feel about people that call people like Kanye West Larry Elder Candace Owens self loading black people\nOkay so the black people that make fun of black people are two ways also there's ... there's many many most of them you know I I have a lot of black friends just on the old some supporters but they don't want the college in our poll Democrats want to keep the power to themselves they have to make sure the brother stayed pretty dumb\nBut the ... of you didn't answer my question I think you didn't if my question because you know where it leads the very same thing you said about Jews being self loathing because they vote Democrat or said by or said about black people like myself who vote Republican\nMaybe there's another alternative explanation we disagree from late nights they been one ... late nights have been one Seventy four three I M Larry older do not leave town I\nLive in the pain free relief factor dot com studios it's the same age Larry Elder do not believe\n\nWow coffee organizer the organizer migrant caravan from my doors was detained in Guatemala on Tuesday is the U.S government threatened to withdraw aid from both countries\nForgotten Man let's find out how much money we give Honduras Guatemala every single year on this line up with a kind of impact was holding this aid would have on their economy so a look at it for me what you cripple eight nine seven one S.

Christian man receives\nJustice and it's about\nThe former Atlanta fire chief name Kelvin Cochran I've been telling you about him for the last few days because he was represented by alliance defending freedom\nReduce some of this article by David French National Review quote in a groundbreaking when for religious liberty\nFrench National Review quote in a groundbreaking when for religious liberty former fire chief Calvin Cochran has reached a one point two million dollar settlement with the city of Atlanta\nYesterday my friend and former colleagues at the alliance defending freedom announced that former Atlanta fire chief Cochran had received a one point two million dollar settlement in a case he brought after the city fired him for writing and distributing to a few select city employees a self published book\nThat articulated in entirely orthodox Christian view\nOf sex marriage\nIs Cochrane was a pioneer born in Confederate Memorial Hospital in Shreveport, Louisiana happens to be black grew up to be come one of the first black firefighters in his hometown fire department ultimately became the first black fire chief or report\nObama appointed him to run the fireman is raising the division of the federal the division of FEMA after he left the Atlanta fire department\nWhich he went to after report the fire department struggle the Atlanta mayor ask them to come back you turn the department around\nNow on his own time he sought received permission from the city's ethics officer to self publish a Christian book the book is called who told you that you are naked\nIt argues in part the sex outside of marriage between a man and woman country too will of God and of course takes a position that opposite sex marriage also contrary to will guy\nHe'd still be at the book to a few select colleagues mainly people who already discussed the Christian faith with him he also shared it with the mayor three members of the city council no fire department employee ever complain to him about the book one employee did show a few pages of the book that dealt with sexuality to an openly gay Atlanta city council member\nThat led to Cochran being suspended without pay that led to the mayor and the city firing him without providing them due process\nYou've represented by alliance defending freedom of the organization that I've been raising money for for the past two and a half weeks and I'm asking you one more time to please\nHelp out chief Cochran prevailed if its foreign could happen in the Bible belt in the south they can happen anywhere listen to alliance defending freedom counsel David equipment\nI Do I see more challenges out in the in the future and I think the reason for that is and it's quite ironic it happened in the chiefs case and then all of these other cases you know we hear so much today about tolerance and inclusive easy a it was the exact\nReason that the city of Atlanta gave for firing the chief and it's quite ironic to say that we're being inclusive intolerant I firing someone who disagrees with artificial views that that's what actually happened\nNow alliance defending freedom represent at a chief Cochran for free to him but the cost\nOf litigating something like this especially cases like jak Philips the owner of the map to peace kicks chop wherever your case when all we have to the Supreme Court\nIt can be very expensive so
