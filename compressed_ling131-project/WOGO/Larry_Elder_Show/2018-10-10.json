study also found that forty two percent of putative rape victim with two went on to\nHave intercourse again with their alleged assailants behavior inconceivable in the case of actual rape in fact\nIt was a researcher herself to classify the subject as victims Seventy three percent of the women whom the researcher designated as rape survivors rape survivors said they hadn't been raped when asked directly into quote wow\nWow the other\nWell that that that's the methodological sleight of hand that has stayed with every single a campus rape survey since the Nineteen eighty five\nMen survey or the believing in this alleged epidemic of campus rape Maine's\nIgnoring females own characterization of their experiences something that allegedly the feminist tell us when she never ever do\nQuote in twenty Fifteen the association of American universities you conducted a sexual assault survey at twenty seven selective colleges\nThe vast majority of survey respondents who make a U researchers classified as sexual assault victims never reported their religious salt to their colleges rape hotlines sexual assault resort centers or title nine officers much less to the capital city police\nAnd the overwhelming reason that the alleged victim did not report is if they did not think what happened to them was that serious in the book\nWell you know we've been hearing to a Montrose from the radical feminist during this absolute hysteria melt down of identity politics insanity of the Brett Kavanaugh hearings one is\nAlways believe survivors meaning always convict nails you should not subject a so called self described survivors\nAh claims to any kind of empirical testing number two\nThe reason that\nSo called survivors do not report is because the patriarchy makes it so painful for them to do so they're they can print such horrible a skepticism from these title nine offices and what not know that is complete\nThe as Larry the reason they don't report when you ask the\nPeople who the rape researchers classify as rape victims why didn't you report the overwhelming reason as they say because what happened to me wasn't serious enough to report now I maintain\nThat in the case of actual rate which is the most terrifying experience any female can have short of\nA being murdered\nA you would never\nVoluntarily has sex again with your rapists and be you would never claimed

again it said women have voted for me okay 'cause\nI heard I heard her say I heard her say that and then she made a second point the second point was false second point was that a two time the last
