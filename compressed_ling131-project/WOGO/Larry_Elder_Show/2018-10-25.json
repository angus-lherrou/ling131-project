which Bob sitting in for Larry go right ahead sir\nTime if it's chicken tonight thank you drink a are you okay well I wanted to\nFeel a bit the migrant care of and I'm I'm Glad that I think for the subset of called military out but another aspect but he was talking about very much and the media\nMaybe the drive by not talking about either is that the process of polio as well as a bowl of migrants from Congo has also joined the bike and caravan last month we had a\n... ... migrants from Africa from Central Africa with Ebola type symptoms\nAn eagle pass Texas that was reported out of the Ebola outbreak map\nDot com website which I Try to help people out with a kind of things that happened that's not the mainstream news on your listeners probably would take notice of this aspects as well um because the drive by is don't like to\nTalk about that because I think well there's a lot of votes um migrants talking about diseases coming across the border and did you have you been to that website as well\nI have not actually no I'm not I've I've heard of it I have not visited no sir\nIt's called it's called Ebola outbreak map so I'm at like a ... like you see all the road and asked yet before before the GPS if you had the roadmap so if you do that when I was traveling ... but it just caught Ebola outbreak map dot com and that's\nReally a great resource for everybody that courage to go on there especially I ... going to be voting for Trump\nBecause I see this problem in our country with migrants with diseases and things that are doing to our country and it's just going a country that it's been so long the wrong way and this is a national as everybody even look at Kennedy JFK used to say it was a Democrat\nAnd he said that look into what you\nSaid that you should get\nKennedy said we need to do\nWith that statement that said he care what America should care about\nThat has not and we'll ask not what you ... your country can do for you ask instead what you can do for your country who was the most famous line\nYeah yeah that's that's what I'm thinking I Wish you all America's care about our country and our borders as not ... not a democratic it's just being an American and as Americans we should care care about our borders and our country\nAnd what's very why is that is a great point because you ride President Kennedy who is a very different kind of Democrats than the than the modern day progressive Democrats but that is very very true I Wonder what they would say about that that is an expression of national nationalism unlike any other isn't it\nAsk not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country what can you do for this nation but not for the world not for the United nations\nNot for you know foreigners what can you do for this country that's your job that's your responsibility because it is about us versus nation first\nNational nationals to mean that is not a dog whistle it's not some sort of a coded language it is simply a statement of I pledge elaborate said this before I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United states of America anybody who's ever recited that pledge using\nThis is where my allegiance lies I don't pledge allegiance to the flag of the United nations don't pledge allegiance to the flag of Canada or to Mexico where to France or Germany or to uh to um uh Switzerland or to\nUh to the Dominican Republic or to a Guatemala or anywhere else I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United states of America\nAnd that means I'm a national ...\nThere's no coat in it there's no racism and that there is no bigotry and it and we need to stop this nonsense right now stopped letting the Democrats defined language to us Diane is calling us next from a Greenville South Carolina

you that you're the president of somebody we don't like because it's still better than where we came from I I had been asking the same question but Diane since this whole thing began\nHow can they

there is a bigger lobbying America our politicians must answer to we the people and we want solutions to prescription drug affordability and we want them now it's time to hold drug makers accountable and put patients at a profit they've law they have their lobbyists\nAnd there are hundreds of millions of dollars but we have our voices are stories in our votes it's time to end the drug maker

something with your ... the conversation I had this morning that I was reporting for us stepping in rural of MSNBC um there's about another forty seconds of it and you did not get to hear that I wanted to do to you to hear the end of the conversation because as you can see\nIt was rather um eventful uh she she is insisting that the president of the United states is dog whistling has always been dog whistling uh in order to reach his base of white nationalist when he said he's a nationalist I explain\nIn order to reach his base of white nationalist when he said he's a nationalist I explained very clearly that no he was comparing nationalism to globalism matter of fact I Wish I'd had this queued up or I Would have played this at the time but you do remember this one the president pulled out of the Paris climate accord right\nI was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh not parents you know what that means that's nationalism representing the people\nOf the United states first not the people of the world's first that's what nationalism is what does it have to do with white nationalism when does it have to do with anything having to do with race but that's what the left tries to do is I Want you to ... to go back here just a little bit\nWe play a little bit of the stuff and he wrote conversation that I had already play and let the things in a ... minute what your reactions eight eight eight nine seven months age\nEight eight eight nine seven one seven to for three give this all is that the president Stephanie the president very clearly in Houston very clearly defined what he means by comparing nationalism to globalism\nNot comparing whites to blacks knocked comparing white America to to minority America he said global is think about the glove burst in our country second a nationalist think about our country first in the globe second I'm a nationalist he made it very clear\nThat this had nothing to do with white nationalism and it seems like people are going out of their way to find fault with it\nAnd we're going to agree to disagree given president history on racial issues giving his professional history given his father's professional history\nI prefer ... extra careful in his word choices especially as we go interaction where he is capitalizing on ... so we're going to agree to that were way than\nWell yeah we we certainly are but what I Want to know is ... how it is that you are going to take the position you are when he defined globalism before defining what he means when he says nationalism you you can't put words in people's mouths and I feel like that's not confident and it sounds like what you're doing stuff and\nI'm not putting anywhere in his mouth what I Will be able to do is look back on many many presidents had said over the years and that's why it makes me feel uncomfortable\nOkay what what exactly has the president said recently about this issue that makes you feel so uncomfortable Smith you know your your expertise is is largely in economics you or your you know Bloomberg TV a editors while you're a former anyway you know so given all of your economic history the president has largely talking about global or ah nationalism in globalism in\nWere you know it matters of trade you know he has often said look we're going to stop other countries from taking advantage of the United states if I have to use tariffs if I have to start trade wars in order to make sure that we get a better game for out of the market is that right\nNow is not not economic nationalism but is that not economic nationalism is my question\nNot if you look at the way the president of south it gives you the truth\nThat cat an impact he would engage and things like ... to point out and partner with our allies that have been\nJak Stephanie role thank you for coming on we appreciate it she is on ice and B that live at the top of\nThat music it'd be on there of course was the end of the top of a interview

is this an eight eight eight\nNine seven on stage um she said she's not putting words in the president's mouth\nBut she is doing exactly that she is saying that the president is talking about white nationalism the president said globalism nationalism global just put the world's first in our country second nationalist put our country first and the rest of the world's second I'm a nationalist she

polarization and what I think they really mean as people being nasty to each other\nWe're always going to be polarized the actual almost scientific definition of some people over here and some people

ground that's garbage you know what people mean when they talk about unity in common ground that means conservatives caving on core values that's what they want\nSo let us be where we are at stake out our turf in and fight proudly yet civil Ian smartly let the left bring its best ideas but but don't call us stupid names and suggesting we're racists don't be ugly dumping nasty we won't be uglier nasty to you let us fight hard fight smart and fight clean\nSo we're not look into deep polarized so much\nUm we're we're looking to simply return to some semblance of human decency and manners\nGood luck\nTo you but you know what that sounds like a ... that seems like a pat answer let me add one tiny sentence\nI there is no way we can wander but there's no why do we can wave to sort of way we can
