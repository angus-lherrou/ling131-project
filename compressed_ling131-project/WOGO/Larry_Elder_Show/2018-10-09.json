Eisenhower nominated Brennan and data for Congress was a Democrat controlled and also on the Biden Rule Joe Biden was talking in the abstract there was no nominee no nominee was blocked and he said to

actually do what he wants to do and as you've written in your book the long game when you do that it actually hurts democracy\nYeah well that's not exactly a thought at all what happened John you're you're completely misconstrue and whatnot but what I gave you is the history of this I Know the history of this I've spent a lot of time on this throughout my career what I did was entirely consistent

Court nominee in Nineteen fifty six John King of CNN\nThey also conveniently forgotten that Joe Biden said and I think Ninety two when he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee Democrats control the Senate Republican in the White House it was back in the uk or they wouldn't fill it\nI don't think that's right in Nineteen fifty six an hour nominated Brennan the data for Congress was a Democrat controlled and also on the biting rule Joe Biden was talking in the abstract there was no nominee no nominee was blocked\nIn but that's not at all what happened John you're completely misconstrue and
