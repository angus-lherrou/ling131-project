times article very very long article fourteen thousand words did Trump or his father or other members of the family engaging something illegal\n[noise] well you know what I'm I Can't tell a you know I haven't looked at the water hundred thousand pages of documents that they seem to provide 'em you know there's there are a few things in here which is proven to be true that was probably beyond the pale of law\nUm what what what bothered me about the uh the article is the the authors obviously showed their bias in several places I'm One of which where they say that uh the rich never really pay their full freight\nUm and ah there's a couple of places where they're under explanation allows them to make some rather crucial accusations which\nIf I knew all the facts I might be able to disapprove so I'll give you an example if you if I may sure um suppose that I buy a house for half a million dollars I put twenty percent down and I borrow with a mortgage the remaining four hundred thousand dollars or the purchase price\nNow what is that worth to me what is that included in my network if I if I gave it away at that point what would the value of the if the well the value of the gift will be a hundred thousand dollars because it would be subject to that mortgage and\nSo now let's say there's a downturn like there was in the Nineteen nineties or two thousand three or two thousand eight when everybody lost value in real estate and now my real estate is worth only four hundred and twenty thousand dollars\nAnd like a lot of clients of mine decided when the downturn came that was a good time to give away real estate to their children\nSo now it's worth four hundred and twenty thousand dollars I give it to my children what's the gift that I report on my gift tax return was four hundred and twenty thousand dollars minus a four hundred thousand dollar mortgage twenty thousand dollars left that would be the value of the gift\nNow a decade later\nThere's been improvements all around the neighborhood knew Tony retailers developments of of of various sizes and I sell my children's sell that house for seven hundred thousand dollars\nOr have to pay off the mortgage so they keep three hundred thousand dollars I'm not even going to talk about taxes at that point but they kept three hundred thousand dollars and then one could say that they got Fifteen times the valuation of the gift\nBut you see and it was perfectly legal they didn't but the article doesn't explain the leverage of real estate and so as a result I mean you you can easily said my gosh how could that ever happened how could you ever invest in something and then sell it ten years later for Fifteen times what the value was one it was given\nReal charge recharge is my guest season attack in the state planning lawyer or read you said there were a couple of things that that jumped out at you and if they could be proven to be true it would be problematic what what's the most

Lee is the Republican candidate for governor excuse me for senator sorry I have this wishful thinking going on in my mind\nI Wish you were Kennedy for both actually can you run for two things anyway for senator stranger things have been done\nI certainly true a senator of course in Minnesota and uh tell me what\nI have so much to ask you I ... I mean I've been to Minnesota so many times I Love the state I live in a state of confusion I understand California where I live I don't understand Minnesota Minnesotans are known for niceness then they vote for a mean party [laughter]\nRight right we we might have done are really really nice when they like\nThey like balance and they like because they treat others like three back and we actually we are a strange thing where we we ... ballot though we don't vote than our lane we we cracked already Democrat Republican and we like to know her big names Haley had Jesse Ventura as governor\nA Republican and we like to vote for big names here we've had Jesse Ventura as governor a leader of Al Franken as US Senator\nSo and and and even in the same year they voted the most conservative US Senator ride grounds at the same time they go to the most liberal a senator and Paul Wellstone so we do we we vote on some some different things are different from from all of those across the country that I I I think I feel even worse for you in California than it\nOh you should [laughter] you I mean you have you ever real chance now your opponent is campaigning with Keith Ellison she's almost ... is a is it is as far left as we have in American politics\nAnd she fell asleep and of course has serious charges against him with regard to abuse of a woman and I'm not seeing their true I'm not saying they're not true but they're they're they're not from high school they're not one incident punish all the\nPlay offs\nAnd white uh I'm and I'm running actually for the hash tag knee to Al Franken sea so there is a lot of responsibility in the seat and who represent Minnesota in the United States Senate and\nAnd to treat everybody equally when there is a charge of sexual harassment sexual abuse domestic abuse and then Tina Smith my opponent is showing the complete hypocrisy of herself and the Democrat because\nThe Democrats are interested in speaking out on sexual assault or harassed and when it comes to their own party and Tina Smith is campaigning around the state with Keith Ellison and she has said because Keith categorically denied these accusations then Keith Ellison therefore is innocent yet when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd the uh uh unsubstantiated allegations against a judge Kavanaugh\nUh see any for under oath that he didn't do it um she's calling for a full FBI an investigation and she's also said that Kavanaugh had committed sexual assault she said that in the video\nAnd and what ever happened to being innocent before proven guilty it's now all this and that the proof is on those that are accused and that's it that's the sad wrote that the Democrats have gone down and it's going to get discouraged a lot of people from running profit and for voting for them because this is one issue\nThat that it popped up that has really got a Republican and independents extremely extremely angry at the hypocrisy and the double standard that the Democrats are are showing right now\nOkay so that's a double standard is your what about the issue\nI have to believe that most Minnesotans on Americans who are anti covering all on on the grounds of sexual assault forgetting they're against them because they would be against any Republican nominee to the Supreme Court\nDoes she have husbands brothers fall there is shown to the love I

and not having a fair hearing and not having any sort of private process to go through and and the Democrats will do anything they can to\nUh have an issue come up and attack Republicans and the the regular person out there Dennis I'm telling you is absolutely appalled that something like this\nComes up and and can be their son or their brother or their father and it's it's so deeply fattening up is is that the road that they've gone down\nSo you just use the issue you have to climb the Minnesota is simply now more or less liberal slash left\n\n[noise] uh no no no absolutely the the pill that Tina Smith has to climate is she's such a metro area liberal elite that this is not a DSL party Democrat farm labor here in Minnesota\nThat of my mother and father's area era it was mostly Democrat back in the day and it has the Democrat Party has left the Democrat\nOr in the last ten years and it has become the far left extreme liberal socialist party of Minneapolis and St Paul and that is not who\nMinnesota Democrats are so they are leaving the party and the eighth district up on the iron range which has all historically always voted Democrat we're going to have a Republican congressmen up there down in southern Minnesota always voted Democrat that's going to be Republican\nSo Minnesota is not as Democrat as it used to be and we're ... we're seeing a real red wave here uh because they've gone so far to the left and they've left the people and that's not who we are here in Minnesota\nAre you I I just want to tell you what I see every Republican candidate for Senate ...

Democrat individually might be they represent a destructive force in America the Democratic party\nAnd they really do and it and it is a a responsibility on\nUs as Republicans to make sure that the people know what that we really are the party at education and health care and freedom and they are the party of obstruction and that's exactly what my opponent Tina Smith has been doing she's only
