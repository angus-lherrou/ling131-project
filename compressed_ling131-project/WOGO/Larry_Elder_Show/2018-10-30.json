started\nWhile the bodies were still on the floor that synagogue just started I ... you could see it on social media it was there it was opportunistic get was eggs or criminal behavior and um and it was typical typical of today's left it starts\nWith California Congressman Adam Schiff on CNN's State of the union\nNo one sets the tone more than president of United States and the tone that he sets as one of division often one of hatred and this has now become a struggle about good versus evil and the president of the United states is evil\nHoward Dean really\nThis man with friends and his hatred were fan by a president who kept talking about the caravan of refugees have favorites Harris\nI'm this is a um business of triangulation a lot of people are making this this is sort of doubling down on not just intellectual dishonesty but but just disgusting levels of scapegoating that the\nPittsburgh synagogue shooter\nWas somehow bird to action by the president's warnings\nAbout the care of in\nThe thousands of people who are headed our way in order to intentionally violate our borders that a president who is vigilant about that\nYou somehow set the stage for this kind of a reaction I mean how low will these folks go and and and I think the answer is in why is the author\nWho say frame I mean why is he out there and you had a very first thing that the president didn't first convincingly attack slipping Pittsburgh and in the pipe bombs the very first thing the media did was blame the president and make him responsible for these ridiculous\nActs you can't start putting the responsibility of individual on anybody but the individual who carries out the crime is delivered on the promises he made and if anything I think is sad I improvise said the way that every single thing that comes out of the media Ninety percent of what comes out of the media is now is negative about this president\nAmen amen and that's where our level of discourse has been dragged down\nAs you hear word afterward and page after page in speech after speech about how our our ability to get along just kind of been thrown into the toilet about our level of discourse in civility is all kinds of dashed against the rocks an observation that you certainly can make\nIs it because Trump won or because of a Trump tweet or because of some sharp el bowed a salty thing that he might have said it some rally are you kidding me is everybody that stupid\nThe reason our discourse has been dragged into the muck\nIs the reaction of people who hate him the reaction of people who cannot handle that he won the media have been biased for as long as many of us have been alive\nAnd this this is nothing new\nBut the level of hatred that's how you know the change is real by the way the level of vitriol the level of\nVenom when you have an entire dominant media culture walking around saying the president is racist the president is a hater\nHow how in the world that how do you think Thanksgiving is gonna

is it true that the regulations Ruth restrictions literally ad fifty percent to the price of housing here in the state\n[noise] Oh yes absolutely and in fact fifty percent might be an understatement 'em in there is a there was a report in uh San Diego just two days ago indicating that building\nAnd affordable housing a unit a which is not at a large unit is now at no cost up to four hundred and twenty five thousand dollars um which just just seems beyond the pale\nUm California is just the most expensive state in terms of regulation and it really does affect the price of housing in in ... it would be to\nPut a new construction and er which would which would bring housing prices and but California right now is forty nights and the country in terms of housing construction is very expensive to build and it's [noise]\nIt uh and it takes an awful long time\nProfessor my next question was going to be why aren't Californians outrage and recall studying economics in college or in in

includes households with multiple wage earners\nOnly about twenty six percent of households could afford the median price Tom in California\nAnd people often think well what about all those people that make those high salaries up in Silicon valley\nOr forty two is even worse they're only about Fifteen Percent of households in the Silicon Valley area can afford the median price Tom in that location\nSo there's no there's no sense in which um there's ... there's there's absolutely a housing crisis in California and people are becoming very very upset about this and they're looking for government ah to put in place policies that will make it easier and less costly to build a increase supply and bring those prices down\nYou might remember a few years ago professor I I got a fact check when I was on CNN when I talked about\nUm the ... the high cost of a of a of regulations and said that if you add up the taxes and regulations are all those things government takes about fifty percent away from the American people I've got a phone call from from some fact checker\nAnd they said how do you know the cost of regulation is what'd you say it is\nA and I'm a I recommended them to a number of people in a recall you telling me that if anything I'd probably understated the or the number and the argument they gave me was that regulations also have benefits and and you're not taking exaggeration the benefits of these regulations produce what's your reaction to that\n[noise] well regulation exist to provide protection is supposed to provide protection to consumers\nRegulations in the housing market when I look at them I really can't see much a protection for consumers um let's take California's\nLatest folly which is to require by two thousand twenty of virtually every single family home will be required to have solar panels on its roof top\nThis will raise the cost of a building that home by about thirty thousand dollars\nAll for the purpose of generating solar power we already have so much solar generation that we are paying Arizona to take solar power offer hands around around noon and one PM um that type of regulation feeds into\nA small number of people in the state who think it's just absolutely wonderful if we do everything we can under the sun\nTo be green um but it punishes people who have to pay those housing prices um so the residential housing market in California is not a place regulations really benefiting consumers\nI'm Talking to UCLA professor ... teaches economics his piece he co wrote is called California housing

people for example fake news events do these violent tendencies at least in some people [noise]\nWhy I think that that's obvious I had been concerned about this for a long time for about a life in the Senate starting in January about the president's rhetoric remember\nWe have a president who has talked for a couple of years now about imprisoning his political rival and Hillary Clinton who is encouraged violence against the media or just last week talking about the assault on reporter by congressman in Montana and saying that he that he's his kind of guy\nIt's hard to see this outside of the context of the president's hostility hostility towards towards Mrs Clinton who tried that briefly speak towards unity toward Iraq Obama towards George Soros\nThe president and his allies they need to dial down the the political rhetoric and they are making people let's say they are making journalists let's say and they were making law enforcement officers ... state\nWe don't know who did this or we don't know what their motive was right but it's a very obvious thread and maybe it's meant as a ruse but it's an obvious threat the Obamas the Clintons John Brennan CNN\nUm George Soros these are people and organizations that President Trump continually attack demonize us a call\nPeople and organizations that President Trump continually Patton demonizing recalls but if you look at who they've targeted so far it's almost like they're following Donald Trump's Twitter feed and starting with Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nNot with Jake certainly one question for the president one question for the White House is the rhetoric the intense rhetoric that he has been saying and his supporters have been giving out over these last several weeks leading into mid mid term elections and certainly even before that is that contributing to any of this\nSurvey I mean there are all people that Donald Trump age they are all a people that he has used violent ugly incendiary rhetoric against a weather as journalists like CNN where there were John Brennan letter was addressed or Hillary Hillary Clinton you know from the lock her up chants\nAnd you know I was in the ... thing with my former colleagues to CNN and and they're scared and one highly former colleague said this is what happened when the president calls you the enemy of the people at five and I thought my gosh you know it's it's a tone and coming from the top and now CNN has become a target\n[noise] wow [noise] [noise]\nOh Trump's fault right\n[noise]\nI got a question what about this gentleman\nI don't want to bring up
