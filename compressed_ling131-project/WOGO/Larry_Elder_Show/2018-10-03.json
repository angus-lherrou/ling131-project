Ninety six percent agreed are strongly agree that on average Americans have been better off with NAFTA than the previous trade deals so when President Trump's keep calling it the worst trade deal ever don't you have a problem with that\nI did you know and I told them I disagreed with him on that I think you know I actually help now you're helped pass NAFTA back in Nineteen Ninety two or three or Ninety four when we originally pastor when Bill Clinton was president we got the Republicans in Congress to vote for\nBut Trump also had a point that it could be approved this is the best of all worlds you know in my opinion we have a we have a a a a a a new a free trade agreement is now called the U.
