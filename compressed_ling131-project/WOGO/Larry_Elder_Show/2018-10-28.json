Joseph Smith the founder was killed [noise]\nWhat year was that when he was shot when he was killed our I'd have to see that sorry\nYeah I don't know I'm thinking it's like Eighteen think well they yeah they\nGot they got the state's arrived in Utah in Eighteen forty seven so it would have been probably a few years before that\nYeah for some reason I think Eighteen forty two okay but it it doesn't matter we can look it up so wow okay so you were raised a not just as a Mormon but as a Mormon world higher score and yeah yeah and so ... what happened in your life\nWell as as I read about in the post um I just I was a journalism major at Brigham Young the Mormon college and funny enough ah Michael aspiration in life was to get married and living in a cul de sac and have eleven children because my cousins had ten and I wanted to beat them I was I had a\nTough sometimes may have older plans but OK\nYeah have you told me I'm codes and can talk so Clay Aiken pretty foul broker to the high school age carry I think you're insane I'm I Am but yes well that I'm right\nAt so basically I had this goal to be at bat housewife and that's that's the Mormon women are are a condition to believe that that was said\nBy the way I actually am not a Mormon but I think that's a great thing snow I Love those women I've ever met her warehouse was\nHey hey you will not hearing you say anything that in fact it really upset me actually when uh the Democratic I forget her name she was insulting and ... around me and said that she'd never worked a day in her life and I'm like the one the gate or at the five boys\nWell that's the ... well ... they want you to use a million kids she could just stay home and baked cookies\nAnd you realize that well in in a way housewife has itself ... over Georgia because it's really inaccurate\nIn the sense that anyone who has raised children full time there is infinite work infant at work and that's if you're not home schooling them and I meet women who home school because I'm thinking\nYou were a teacher you're like this is just it's kind of you know stunning what is involved so yeah what let's so let's start there\nYeah I guess I I never planned to have paid work I should say I plan to raise eleven children which would have been a lot of work a which is of a different kind um and so\nThere's three you can go you can go to his own defense and stuff and I'm In a little bit easier check\nUm [noise] but basically a and again yeah there is nothing I I I I think true feminism is is empowering women to make whatever choice they want whether that thing at home and raising families were working and doing a hybrid or fulltime working and not having kids I embrace all of that so\nAh but as far as why I chose journalism funny enough part of it was I just thought it would be a non threatening major that wouldn't I'm\nA threatened male Mormons who might want to date me because I wasn't studying something harder and I could just be a nice little as like maybe freelancer on the site of color and I wouldn't have to worry about threatening someone and this is my thought process\nBut ah at any rate I get to BYU and ah\nEventually through a my journalism courses and just doing research I came upon a lot of information that ah with outside the official curriculum that really troubled me about uh the Mormon church in terms of\nThe lack of transparency the lack of uh just the full spectrum of information about who the founder was a and I felt really upset I felt like I had been like to I felt like there were\n... whitewashing um the origins of the church that they were presenting this this um pristine image of Joseph Smith and I it took me having to go to the Internet to find out the truth\nAnd it I like to say it's it's sort of like Richard Nixon where the cover up is worse than the crime Joe ... and what's interesting now is that in the age of the Internet you're seeing the Mormon church actually start to open up more and and they're open up their archives about Joseph Smith uh they're they're studying to be more transparent I think because they've been forced to\nUh and it's sort of that uh you would knock you'll eat them when they're younger so that they don't feel like they're right completely I I thought\nWhen I was the worst of it in other words you're you're saying that you were a you were blindsided by what I mean that he had many wise that they were young like what what would you like\nThat like one was fourteen which was really upsetting but also the were married to other men because they say that oh he only did it because they were widows or they they were never getting married it's like\nNo he basically said if you don't marry me and leave your husband you will be smitten by God and you won't get to heaven ...\nShould go there ... and there's ... [noise] that's interesting\nYeah and I and again look I'm not a member anymore and the church has its own responses and and the church uh also will say well he he obviously was a flawed man and you know he's\nNot or you hear that there's a kind of stuff whenever you have a you know particularly I'm a very very strong leader like you find this in a religious cult that they start changing the rules and everybody's freaked out and you know it's like you hear these weird things about these people who have this kind of power\nAnd so I don't know very much about Joe ... but go ahead and also what\nBothered me was that the book of Mormon and and you can read in the introduction to the book of Mormon they claim that it's a historically accurate factual document a and that the Smithsonian was using it as a guide for ancient history\nAnd the Smithsonian issued a letter that said please don't use our name that's not true\nUm because the book of Mormon purports to be this ancient document of a record of Jews who left uh Israel and moved to America um before the coming of Christ and that when Christ died before he rose a or appeared after three days in that three day period he came to America\nAnd that this was an ancient book of the American continent despite the fact that there is there evidence of this and also um the bookworm claims that the Native Americans are actually descendants of\nJews hang on one second we're going to go to a break folks were talking about Mormonism with Cary Sheffield stick around [noise]\nMoving here again and I assure you I have never before endorsed a pain relief product not until now starting\nTo release factor came along as a one hundred per cent drug free solutions for people struggling with ordinary pains quite simply relief factor was designed by doctors to help relieve those occasional aches and pains new to\nAging exercise and everyday living let me ask you are aches and pains keeping you from sleeping through the night\nFor keeping you from taking it was nice long walks or\nPlaying golf or tennis you can't really call it living if you can't get around comfortably for three weeks quick start from relief factor\nMaybe all you need to lower or even eliminate these banks are lot of people have already gone to relieve factor dot com and here's something you need to know the majority of people who ordered the three week ... not only Nineteen Ninety five and go on to order more [noise]\nLet's see if we can get you out of paying to go to release factor dot com\nIf you're like most people and you see two gas stations in one fell gas for a little bit west you go to that one it just makes sense every little bit helps but here's what's weird though sometimes we save a few pennies here and there and ignore opportunities to save\nHuge money life changing money if you switch to Medicare for your health care it could be massive savings for you the typical savings for a family is five hundred dollars a month\nI think what you could do that over time just\nDoing the math of six thousand dollars a year that\nThe significant and yes people love it and they love it because it works it's believers who share each other's healthcare costs more than four hundred thousand people are now members of Medicare and it's growing like crazy fight on how much you could save and why men to share his so popular go to ... dot\nCom or call aid for four sixty one Bible that's eight four four sixty one Bible met his share dot com or aid for four sixty one Bible [noise] hello [noise]\n\nI just don't see how my life can get any better [noise]\nIt's everything just feel like everything around me is falling apart if something doesn't change soon I just don't know what else I can do\n[noise]\n[noise]\nTo counseling is here to help our team of license Christian counselor I Want to help you get from we can begin a conversation when you're ready to extra phone or even video conferencing from the comfort of your own home I'd like to give you your first week\nFree to try faithful counseling dot com let's talk do right now to try faithful counseling dot com we really want to help you I mean it's so easy to get started and your first week is free to go now to try to counseling dot com let us\nBack to the Gulf shore up next we have ... ... who's a member\nOf the shelter pet group that's right a group known especially for the couch smuggling ball trees in space looked into the backyard and of course companionship\nAnd what ... would you say ...

I don't want to hang out with ... there's no time but that's the conversation is it Christianity or I read it\nNow and in fact I found my might to Mormons are desperate journals because of the founding and so I kept a journal since I was eight I was baptized when I was eight as every ... I kept a journal since I was I read my journal is a young girl and even at age eleven and twelve I was talking about how much I Love Jesus and at the time I ate it I said\nI Hope that I never forget how much that I Love Jesus\nAnd I went back and found my journal I was like starting to carry a baby carry you just you know for twelve years that didn't happen or so for lots of reasons but I think that the biggest problem is that a Joseph Smith\nInserted his own ego into the Christian faith in his interpretation\nThat I mean and there but there's a lot of doctrine that's not agreeable and went\nOn for me was polygamy a and a big part of why I lots of reasons but that's what\nAbout all all of them who they who they say Jesus is or isn't through you know the\nNature of of Jesus in God and yeah right exactly there are lots of things that are ah outside the Bible but so you so much for the central core of of Jesus as the son of God that's there's a shared belief their\n... and that's what makes it so tricky because I think that there are some Christians who would say I don't care or it's a different Jesus period case closed there are other people would say well\nGod looks on the heart and if you love Jesus\nOr if you really honestly love Jesus and ... you know your worshipping him in your heart then\nIt's ... I guess I always look at the ... chronicles do you remember in there where there's this um there's this calorie means kind of like a Muslim\nAnd in his heart he's worshipping as one but he doesn't know the difference between cash and as one and when he sees as when he realizes this is who I have confuses so it's interesting because some people get very theologically a precise\nAnd ... so anyway I don't I don't want to go further into that just because we only have a few minutes but you when you wrote this article\nYou're you're basically looking for an opening of Mormonism I have friends in the Islamic religion saying the same thing like we need to be open otherwise watch you know we become hide bound in dead and we can't even uh we can't even decide what we believe because if you ask a question people to shut up\nAnd of course that happened to the Catholic Church you know about five centuries ago when I wrote a book about it but\nThe last plant in my op ed says that we need a Martin Luther for the Mormon church so ah\nBut I wasn't gonna wait around for that so I left that I actually went to a\nDifferent Christian churches in the DC area for about a year but I left for lots of reasons in part because I didn't I didn't have a direct relationship with God I was confusing religion with the relationship didn't realize that religion is what people do in relationship is what got us\nAnd when did you find that relationship\nI I just last year so that's a mad because they realize what had happened was I\nHad replaced my meaning in life with the gifts rather than to get rid of the guests and I thought that I Would find a deeper purpose in a deeper\nMeaning through public service because that was the here and now that is sacrificing myself for something that I knew for a fact because it's tangible at to me and I actually think that a lot of young people go through that to it and I think that\nThe ... you know the belief in government as a source of higher power or hair meaning I went to the Harvard Kennedy School of government that's Kennedy said JFK in many ways became my ... you know assassinated and sacrifices himself and\nUm I I my my ... was small limited governor of of the conservative type a and then twenty sixteen happened and Trump happened and I was like that it might be [laughter]\nSo so much for what you were never Trump said\nBut when he became president did you did you become part of the resistance are part of the you know what\nNo I wasn't there part of their existence with it I was never Hillary I just could not at a policy level agree and for eight more years four more years of Obama type policies and so I was Switzerland in that sense [laughter] and ah\nTalk radio security W O O G O L e Chippewa falls over\nSafety\n\nFor usa radio

this hour you you've heard me talk about the alliance defending freedom but I'm getting ... decided because\nA man sharp we've had him on the program before a ... I wanted to get him on again but this time with his client a man who is now\nA effectively famous in the world of religious liberty jak Philips a the owner of masterpiece cake shop in Colorado I have them both on the line thrilled to have you both on the line gentlemen welcome to the program\nHow welcoming glad to be here they travel is\nYeah I I got to say a ... thanks to both of you met your there too right yes I Am yeah well listen uh ... this program I my my audience knows that we're doing a a a fundraiser for the alliance defending freedom because you guys do everything you do for free and everything is at stake but I'm really excited\nUm to have both of you on because a lot of times you know somebody like you ... your name your out there people understand you were real guy just like everybody else you're a small business owner you were a normal person I have met you and you know we forget\nThat what is happening in America\nThat the people who have basic biblical values is crazy it's absolutely crazy it's happening the folks like you in fact to you\nAnd so I Want to talk about uh the Supreme Court victory and I want to talk about the more recent trouble uh that uh that we've had so maybe I'm jak you could just describe if you would uh what happened way back when when this couple came into your\nInto your shop and asked you to bake a cake to create something not just to to sell a cake but to create something for a same sex wedding ceremony\nStarted or six years go down to two thousand twelve Thursday Afternoon to German Bakery\nAnd asked me to create a wedding cake for their shapes exploiting Crick expert safe sex weddings they were surprised I think you know to the shop other custom work cookies brownies\nRegistered sex weddings and so they got they stormed out of my store\nSuit ... [noise]\nWell okay so we have to be clear because I always want to educate my my audience so we understand these things\nIf somebody goes into a hardware store and says I Want to buy a hammer and the person who is a hardware store says using gay I don't want to sell you the hammer get outta my store I hate gays or maybe uses an even more ... term for gays\nEvery body in America would agree that is not okay if you have a store and you're selling hammers you got us all hammers to everybody it's none of your business ... what they are what are you know but we're not talking about that we're not talking about\nA lunch counters refusing to serve a hamburger or to black customers we're not talking about that we are talking about somebody coming to you and saying I Want you to ... I Want you to use your to stick skills\nTo help us celebrate something\nThat we think is really beautiful and should be celebrated and at that point you say well this is complicated because you're not asking me to sell you\nA sheet cake for birthday you're asking me to create something and to enter into a celebration of something that because my faith that can't celebrate now let's be clear you don't celebrate Halloween you know there's a lot of things that you as a Christian you say\nAnd let's be clear you don't celebrate Halloween you know there's a lot of things that you as a Christian you say I don't agree with this and you're living out your faith in your cake shop\nThat's true yeah this is October returned down dozens of cakes to celebrate Halloween because like Christian faith I don't believe that some can do\nIt and get paid to celebrate the same sex wedding\nUgly Bible teaches just between the woman to celebrate something other than the ... corps of Boise and said I'd be glad the so the cookies brownies anything else or make other custom\nExpert days graduation so it's just a great cakes go against the teachings of let's say\nOK so they want to sue you they did to you and Matt Sharp what happens at that point\nWell unfortunately or as we might expect the actually the civil rights commission and and all the way through the Colorado court system they ruled against jak or they found that despite the fact that Jack serves everyone and even this couple here he'd gladly would have served him uh you know off the shelf items cookies cupcakes but\nI'm a despite all of that they said you violated our state law that bans discrimination based on sexual orientation and so we took it all the way to the U.S Supreme Court and we're glad to see in a a strong decision a seven to decision that the court said Colorado you are\nDemonstrating hostility towards ... elite um how you've been forced is what you said about his beliefs all show that he wasn't getting a fair shake and and the state was targeting him because of his beliefs about marriage and that is in permissible under our constitution\nWell it's an amazing thing first of all I think it needs to be set against all Americans need to understand that we're living in crazy times I mean somebody might just say you know what Jack I got to be honest I totally disagree with you I think you're wrong\nIt's another thing to say you're illegal what you're doing is a crime and you're going to pay and we're going to sue you and you're going to pay and then to have the state agree and say yeah you have no right to have this point of view because I I just want to be perfectly clear\nPeople listening because ... you don't need to agree with me or with Jack you don't need to agree with us\nIt's one thing to say I disagree it's another thing to say I disagree so strongly I think you are doing something criminal and you need to pay through the nose you need to suffer for this this is not OK and the state says yeah we agree this is criminal\nThat's not America in America we have the right to disagree on these sensitive issues let's let's just be honest not everybody can agree on same sex marriage that's okay but to criminalize your views\nI mean look people like you and me who are Christians you know we believe in the devil we think that Halloween is not a great thing to be celebrated we think we have a lot of use it a lot of people just think we're crazy but you know what we're entitled to her crazy views in America everybody's entitled to their views whether you think it's crazy or you agree\nBut now we have the state saying not only don't we liked the way you think we're going to enforce it so you can't think that way so the idea that alliance defending freedom has to step up with its great lawyers and say we're gonna have to go to court\nAnd this goes all the way to the Supreme Court when was it heard at the Supreme Court\nSo it was argued December yeah go ahead go ahead Jack\nGo ahead no you go ahead okay it was like nobody I Know in December the fifth December the fest okay here's\nTwo thousand Seventeen so almost a year ago we went to Washington DC it's on the court room we saw it goes for Gorsuch Kennedy Roberts all of them\nAnd it was set on our two let's be clear when they seven to two decision seven to two okay now this is a big thing I Want to say this again are we in America need to understand this was a seven to decision meaning that the Supreme Court\nIs not you know divided always divided or ideological here politically whatever seven of the nine Supreme Court justices said the jak Philips has a constitutional rights had been violated\nSo this is where we are as a country is that even though seven of the two Supreme Court justices agreed the Jack was wronged you still have to fight these legal battle it still has to be argued an argument argued 'til you can get it to the Supreme Court and by the grace of God they ruled correctly but it's an amazing thing most Americans think that\nWell if it's right or wrong you'll be figured out right away no the state of Colorado gets this totally wrong you guys have to argue with all the way the Supreme Court what would that cost\nA match sharp in legal bills of alliance defending freedom doesn't exist and somebody who has a little cake shops as a okay I guess I'm gonna have to fight this now so I don't get run out of business I mean what would that cost just for this one case all the way the Supreme Court\nTo take a case like this is the Supreme Court you're looking at hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars of attorney time and fees and all of this involved because you have multiple arguments um the preparation for it and everything and and I'd say I'm the\nBest part of my job is that we're able to look at someone like jak a hero and say you know what we're going to stand with you and we're going to do it free of charge to you all the way\nWell I mean of course to go to the Supreme Court you're not going to get an average lawyer to argue from Supreme Court this is a big deal this is a big deal and everything's riding Idaho person's life reputation\nYour whole business jak Philips I mean this is when you're talking hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars that's your business you're you're going to go out of business and so what are the lines of printing freedom do they do it\nFor free and that is why I have you on the program right now because I Want my listeners to understand\nThat this most basic thing that will be happening all across America if we don't fight it because if there's no price to pay more and more people are going to try this kind of stuff to shut you down because they think you're a big it\nAs I Want to say folks we

shops in Lakewood, Colorado jak is that right did I say that Lakewood, Colorado that's correct\nAll right and I'm also talking to a to match sharp as but the winds defending freedom and so you guys are facing\nYet another battle that somebody has come to you and said okay you're not done we're gonna make you fight again we want you to make a transition cake which almost sounds like a joke like it sounds like is this real a transition cake\nI when I heard that I thought\nThis is just um it's just extraordinary somebody's you know sort of playing head games it's like let let's see if we can get ... to make a transition cake\nA and now you have to go back to court effectively don't you\nYesterday with allies to freedom is right back to help us again shirts is what are the best lawyers I Know so a cheaper but juries are going to be working with is hopefully we'll get to straighten up this time\nFor a while now ... where do you see this going I mean uh what is the next step who ... what's the first battle\nYeah so it's kind of two two phases one we've got to\nThat same civil rights commission that the Supreme Court ruled against it is\nDemanding a hearing on this um and so I think it's ... scheduled sometime in February but we're working with jak were going on the off chance on that since so we've actually filed a lawsuit against the the civil rights commission and the state as essentially trying to put a stop to desperate enough is enough jak has already been in the six years\nIt simply trying to put a stop to desperate enough is enough jak has already been in the six years we got a ruling from the Supreme Court\nThe state has got to stop 'em and so this is part of our strategy and all of this is asking the federal court to dismiss all of this to dismiss this a formal complaint over the transition gender transition cake and to just let go jak go back to operating a shop doing what he loves doing which is to create incredible works of art there is kicked design\nYou how much ... getting done [laughter] if you're constantly having to go to court and it's kind of not\nYeah not enough food to still keep busy\nRight um my goodness I just ah [noise] it it is that a cat\nThat's a torch I'm oh somebody watching the door okay you know so in a\nJoint I Do have time to read and I'm rereading if you can keep it\nAll ... everybody should read it\nGosh that's pretty incredible I got to tell you I ah I get so honored when I hear stuff like that you have no idea I mean the principles in that book of course it's not like I came up with them but I Do feel like I Want everybody in America to know\nUm what it means to be an American and how precious it is and what we're describing your religious liberty in the history of the world nobody's ever had religious liberties the rarest thing\nA really never had an a nation to Seventeen Seventy six and by the way uh we've had so much of it that most people don't even know what it is and so I Do think that one of the reasons I Want to have a both of you want us to to help people understand what is at stake this is not something that just happens in the newspapers this is real people fighting\nUm thank you for um referencing my book or a Jack and I I uh but I Want to say right back at you\nOr you become a hero to so many people because\nTo have to go through what you've been through um you did not pick that says we just said you did not pick is and if it weren't for the alliance defending freedom who knows we don't really want to think where you'd be right now\nUm but it's terrible people's lives are being ruined a and we have to stand up and fight so now Matt let me ask you you said that you're you're taking this\nIs it are you arguing in front of the civil rights commission first is that what you just said\nYeah so it it's happening parallel at the same time that we're actually trying to get all of the civil rights commission it's hearing or it's biased proceedings dismissed and so we're actually asking a federal court to step in and\nPut an end to all of this um so that jak doesn't have to be dragged through the same six year process again and that he can go back to doing what he loves\nOkay and and the ... which federal court is that can you say\nYeah so we're in the federal district court of Colorado and so kind of the normal process you know will argue there hopefully get a victory but if not it will go up to the court of appeals and\nPotentially back to the U.S Supreme Court um but we're hoping that uh we don't have to go that far that we can get a resounding victory and put an end to this ongoing hostility towards jak by the state of Colorado and\nAnd is it your feeling that uh the the president of the ruling the Seventy ruling in December or will help the lower courts decide this\nYes or when the Supreme Court since a clear message that tells Colorado you can't have hostility towards jak you can't\nBring these proceedings against him because you don't like their beliefs and then as you know within weeks after that rolling Colorado is back at it again saying oh jak we're going to find another reason to find you in violation of our law we think that's a
