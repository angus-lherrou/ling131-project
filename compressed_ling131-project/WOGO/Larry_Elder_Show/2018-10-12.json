still staring 'em up icy or talk to us about and talk to us about what's going on with the California DMV as a result of this motor voter law\nWell you know the DMV it's it's kind of taking on a DMV is kind of like shooting fish in a barrel I mean the ... are are just a competitor across you know going to the DMV it's like a cross between a bus station and the Soviet red line you know the five six hour wait we have now so\nWhat I thought was if we're doing a motor voter what worse agency could you can you have to ah to deal with this stopped in the department of motor vehicles\nAnd you know no no government agency or that does a pretty good job with databases and the DMV is notoriously awful it basically everything it it it does\nSo now we're going to allow the DMV to register voters and this was in a state where and I'm not against having driver's licenses for for non citizens just for practical reasons but it you could just see the problem coming right and I wrote a column for the union Tribune\nAre back in two thousand and Fifteen when this was proposed and of course accused of of being a racist\nOr by now we see all these sorts of problems so we've got a thousands of of a voter registrations that you're the DMV report it last month at a big twenty three thousand voter registration errors resulting from\nWhatever they they blame it on other Fifteen hundred ballots are potentially a you know mistakenly registered by the DMV\nOr the DMV insists that no illegal or legal immigrants of as a gotten them but it looks like some potentially some non citizens gosh that's how I got me these ballots and then the the LA Times look at a software that they may have been Seventy seven thousand voter records that were misreported\nSeventies that was your shoes me Seventy seven thousand\nSeventy seven thousand that were misreported to the DMV in some cases allowing duplicate valid in other cases um the envy seems to inexplicably have changed the party registration of some voters\nSo we've just we've just got a total mess\nAnd uh you know it's become it's a big scandal that even the Democratic controlled California's somewhat of a scandal and the uh you know again the DMV insist that are no illegal residents voted or whatever but you know it's really hard to uh\nIt's really hard to trust trust what they're doing and this comes against a backdrop of you know with the ... id law\nWhich is the federal law mandating you know new driver's licenses to where people provide a you know our information about thirty six years ago on airplanes\nWe've got these enormous backlogs\nAnd the DMV he's had these huge commercial license backlog so that drivers would go through school they get they get a job and then it would take months for them to get a commercial license just because the DMV process so how do you allow these folks\nTo be in control of a voter records and then the law and it was passed in two thousand and Fifteen one of the big problems with um you know it had some amendments to it um\nWhere you're not a lot where really limited the ability of the secretary of state to check out the ah the immigration status of the of the person or you know who who is being registered and in the law said if a person as as quote if a person who is eligible to vote becomes registered to vote by operation of the California New voter motor voter program\nThat person's registration shall be presumed to have been affected with official authorization and not the fault of that person so if you accidentally get\nRegistered and you're not eligible to be registered to vote it's presumed that it's not your fault so it's just we're just looking for trouble right\nSteven Greenhouse gases article surprise DMV may have registered non citizen voters Steven I was not in favor of illegal aliens getting driver's licenses and I was called a racist you are in favor of illegal aliens getting driver's licenses and you're called a racist so I'm not quite sure what that right\nYeah that exactly the libertarian at at I'm not you know my views on immigration are really quite you know quite a courts I lean towards bloody as many people and that's as possible uh provided they follow some rules so I'm not exactly you know some kind of\nImmigration restriction asked them yeah I I you know I get it to we all get it right\nNow uh again if somebody who's an illegal alien inadvertently get registered to vote and he or she votes what happens to that person\nWell according to the law nothing nothing zoom that are ... and less and less I guess you'd have to prove that they get so will fully uh but you know ... basically when I pass the motor voter laws and I am against those in general\nBecause uh like if you can't go through the trouble of of the minor process of registering that maybe you're not uninformed voter and maybe you're not to be voting ... and the state the state's low turnout we're very low turnout it's caused by a lot of things that
