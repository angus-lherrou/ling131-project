David I'm going to need to see some ID because a lot of people claim to be related to Rush Limbaugh and I'm not going to believe every Tom Dick and Harry they walked in here are you really a brother of has a sibling of some kind of\nClass when I Do go to the family reunions these distant cousins come up and say I'm related to ... is\nNot rush I'm not I I Want to talk about Russ\nI Love the idea that even his own relatives can't say rush\nWell nobody's ever been named rush before rush but and that was an are you younger or older than Russia younger you're younger you know what I was just going to say how come you look so much healthier and younger than your brother died because you were younger than he had exactly the kid ... year his kids either of your kid brother okay well ah look\nUh the reason you're here is not because you're related to Rush Limbaugh although congratulations on that very few people achieve that in their lifetime like that it's not like that I tried for a while and I was just not going to happen but um\nBut you've written a book you've written so many wonderful books and here I'm holding in my hand another one the title of Jesus is risen\nPaul in the early church you did not used to be a Christian and you certainly did not used to be a Christian Arthur you have to you you dove into this thing almost like you believe that\nYeah yeah uh interesting I've always so enjoyed our interviews because you bring up things that no one else does that wasn't one of\nThem when I asked my points now but you know what I Want to know seriously you are you you said it's on the program before before my listeners people just tuning in how did you you're a lawyer how did you come to faith what happened\nI it was a skeptic as you mentioned\nYou come to faith what happened I it\nWas a skeptic as you mentioned and but I was a seeker I I always believe in God that I didn't embrace the God of the Bible didn't embrace Jesus Christ didn't really believe that an all loving God would allow people to suffer a much less a turtle damnation and all that\nAnd um I finally started studying it reading apologetic books\nPaul Little um you know Josh meant dal\nNorman guys are and I finally uh overcame my so called intellectual doubts\nAnd then I later place my faith in Christ but I\nI just I I don't understand how anyone can think that there isn't a card I mean Romans one I don't understand you know you look at the creation you look at the I look at everything I Know the cynics can point poke holes and all of that but if they have an open mind they will understand\nBut but embracing got Bible was a little difficult than what I didn't realize is that people had placed\nSeeds in my path all along when I didn't realize it until after I became a believer little things that if they hadn't happened if God in his Providence hadn't put people in my path dropping those seeds I may not have become a Christian of course I was always destined to be one because God I don't I'm\nNot as you because you believe in their predestination garden I actually don't even know what whatever whatever I don't wanna get into that but but seriously you ... I I just want to see how how you were raised because how many how many kids were in your family just rushing us\nJust un Russell yeah [laughter] and I call him Russ Russ un Russ where they were just two kids know how many years apart are used to have you now this is beyond is have you always been two years apart yes it's amazing\nYou see that's very rare it is that's very very rare of fluids elated that it was just the two boys you ... you're like me and my brother we're we're about two years apart and\nUh I guess my question is did you go to any kind of church on Sunday oh yeah yeah we were raised in Methodist Church in what in what a part of the state where part of the country or southeast Missouri okay so you went to church so you didn't think it was a bunch of bologna\nNo no no no and my parents were Christians and and I I it's not like I was cynical about it I just I had trouble with it I didn't understand how it was fair and all that\nBut but what I was going to tell you a minute ago when you so rudely cut me yes I always tried to cut people off rudely otherwise what's the point yeah ... what was that I hadn't really given it a chance it's like okay so I'm passing judgment on a thing that affects my eternal life\nRene not to be confused with\nThe great Keith Richards a who's had many blood transfusions at fifty thousand dollars a pop but we can't get into that now 'cause I'm sitting here with the brother of Russ Limbaugh David Limbaugh book your book is just a beautiful book for many reasons\nBut the title a Jesus is risen that is you you realize that that title alone is a kind of spiritual warfare when you clear Jesus has risen\nThe demons tremble that's a fact uh the subtitle is Paul in the early church the demons do not Trumbull at the subtitle but uh but it's just so great that you're writing all these books but I Want to get back to your story because I Love the idea\nThat you're very rational that you're a lawyer and he got the point in life we for some reason and and listen let's be honest it was probably your wife's prayers for you because she knew that if you did not become a Christian she was in sin for having married you so she had to prove\nThat somehow she knew ... of knowledge that you'd be Christian otherwise she's in trouble right\nAnd we wouldn't raise our kids in an overall Christian home\nWhat right we do not exactly good things so now so she's praying for you and I suspect strongly actually that that's part of the reason\nYou're you're a thoughts began to focus as they did although who knows right now but I just love the fact that you've dug into this to see if it's really true but you live in a culture and I live in a culture where unless you're hanging out with Jesus freaks you believe this stuff\nMost people are very happy floating along they don't even say their secret they're not seekers they're floating along I think kind of\nWanting it not to be true because uh it it might their lives might have to change or something like that\nLike there's no question about it that are intellectual doubts are sometimes masks for other issues that we have in our lives whether it's wanting to continue to sin I'm not talking about major sin murdering people or something what drinking too much whatever\nUh that that you whatever lifestyle you want to engage in\nA ... so it might be a deterrent and you and it might be a deceitful thing where you think this is intellectual now there are some intellectual issues\nBut I don't think that's ultimately what keeps people from believing I I think Christianity is based on solid evidence overwhelming evidence actually and and it's based in reason\nBut faith and read and and so faith and reason are compatible but they're not the same thing and you you ultimately take a leap of faith was as a matter of the will but in my case I had to overcome my so called intellectual obstacles before I Would allow myself to take that step\nBut but state by its own definition requires something more than just the uh the rational thought you can't argue someone into the kingdom because it is a matter the will and some people are are are\nYou can't argue someone into the kingdom because it is a matter the will and some people are are are predisposed to dispose against it or their mindset is against this war will be thing and that\nYou can argue with the what you can discuss things with them you can show them how they're some of their doubts are not grounded in reason right ah and we have affirmative evidence to show how Christianity makes more sense than anything else but you can't ultimately get them to take the leap\nI think it's interesting because I I Would say a lot of people say you know faith ... he's a leap in the dark and I I've always disagreed with that I've said faith and sleep in the light because good when you believe in something that is actually true it's like saying [noise] I don't know this one plus one equals to thing I just I'm not convinced and it's like\nIt doesn't matter whether you're convinced it is true so when you leap\nTo grab onto one plus one equals to you're grabbing on something that is true and not to grab onto it is really to be foolish but the point is that even something as simple as one plus one equals two on some level requires an act of the will to accept it you know and and to accept face\nI've always said I'm anybody knows I mean I've written a book on miracles but the ultimate miracle is conversion why because there is no way a human being can come to believe\nIn the God of the Bible apart from the grace of God you know it's kinda like Lazarus is a rotting corps he didn't do anything to sit up God did it All right\nAnd so it's not like we're sick and we're in in need of all of a little medicine to feel better we're corpses in need of resurrection ... face is just like that when somebody goes from not believing to believing\nSomehow God has to be involved and that's the this is the huge mystery so you're right I mean I've done the same thing I've written books of apologetic and stuff that you're trying to help people along because it's not like that's not important\nBut at the end of the day it's prayer and it's God and so that they're to me that's the mystery you know like why did this happen to you when it happened 'cause you could have just kept drifting\nNo question but when you look back and when you remember that people like a a friend of a friend who was visiting a ... from his law school my friend and he both with law school in Texas they were visiting over Christmas I was um we went to my friend's\nParents' home started talking and randomly Christianity came up that wouldn't come up and my ordinary conversation and Steve Springer my friend's friend who was with him as a cool guy cool guys aren't Christmas especially not then there are a lot of them now right but in why if we would have been caught dead at those nerdy think excuse me what is in way of\nMethod is you've found Asian or what they do something like that yeah maybe that's not what it is I didn't even know and then I Know what it was whatever it is was on cool man yeah and it's so ... so\nA Steve start talking about it and\nI'm kind of making fun of it in a non non smarter way but I wasn't very charitable he's he's a cool guy all the girls loving Christian Girls it can't be but but now he goes into his\nBedroom and his where he was staying at his friends my friends' parents and brings back a Bible in any started showing me reference by how you know if I'd ever seen a reference Bible I didn't wreck noted for showing how\nOld Testament passages are tied the New Testament how New Testament an Old Testament are internally integrated I must tell you a light went off right there and\nUh he also was very patient with me a ... and told me about Jesus in his lab and everything I kind of filed that then later Twenty years later or maybe ten years later or whatever it was he came back to visit my friend Peter\nTender and I said bring him over he came to my house\nI he I was a Christian then I went to my library got the Bible that he'd given me came back and the guy got really emotionally couldn't believe that I that that had such an impact on I'm telling you without that pivotal piece I may not have become a Christian I'm not saying it was random by the way I think it was superintendent by got for us you know what\nI think it moved him so much you wanted to talk about it in his church back in Texas a and asked my permission if you could give his testimony and talk about that\n[noise] I Love it you know I mean everybody's path is different and it's so fascinating to me but I I Want to encourage everybody who's listening this is not for other people this is this for you and the the true for it's not and if it's true\nBy the way it can only bless you there are people I think they have this fear it's comparison me it's going to make me live that that is absolute garbage I Want to date that clearly that is garbage\nIf you think that believing in Jesus will make you into a weird person it'll only make you into a weird person if you want to be ... percent but honestly\nIf you want to be who you are supposed to be you know if you want to get to your grave\nUh always wondering who am I really supposed to be well then you can avoid God but God is kind of like the gas in the tank cars and go anywhere without gas in the tank and I I just want to say to people you know who find themselves in a position like you to say honestly the idea that this is scary in some way is a total why\n... and picking up on that I I think there's a there's a lot of paradoxes in Christianity in my view and I talked about some of them in one of the book\nBut I think some some of this pre Christian had this fear that Christians don't have fun they don't enjoy life there like I said they're ... they're they're regimented the robotic they don't they don't live a robust life\nAnd if they do is just to be goody goody isn't the kind of people you wouldn't wanna hang around with math because you've Baskins didn't enjoy just 'cause they're they're not happy people for some of 'em they'll kind of I'm not so there are a bunch of well\nI I Know I can give you named after the show\nOkay [laughter] but [laughter] but what I didn't understand until later and I began to study it I said how can you reconcile this idea that Christianity gives you a liberty Paul talks about in ... it it'll set you free ... believe in Christ in such for what okay here's here's the answer to that paradox\nBefore you become a Christian\nYou are a slave to send it is your master I don't mean that kind of sin your terrible person all we're all the praise but I'm not in just vernacular labor macular I'm not saying if you're a terrible person may be a very nice ...\nBut you're a slave to that kind of lifestyle in his it has dominion over over you when you accept Christ as your personal savior\nYou are a liberated from sin and you become a slave to Christ now what does that mean that that that doesn't mean you're free ... and Paul addresses these cars that me and I'm Free to sin no emphatically no\nIt means you're now a slave to Christ slave I don't want to be a slight know what you understand that you been out of love and the ... you want to even raise yourself to a higher standard of morality\nOr out of obedience and love for Christ and and what it all means but you're not bound to you're not living under arbitrary not are not living under the the set of rules they transcend that Christ goodness and love\nA transcends all that and you want to be a beating and you're no longer a slave descent\nAnd I want to follow up with this when we come back folks were talking to David Limbaugh brother of Russell and uh this is the architects of show I'm not a sibling of Russell's but I'm aware of his work we'll be right back to the book is Jesus has risen\nAre something that somebody\n... moving here again and I assure you I have never before endorsed a pain relief product not until now not until\nRelief factor came along as a

you've done in your book now this is the new one Jesus has risen Paul in the early church\nYou are effectively entertaining the scripture another's you're doing a Bible commentary even though you you you're presenting it as a popular book because it is a popular book\nBut the point is that you're also doing a Bible\nCommentary you're helping people because and by the way that is biblical people always say well that's the word of God it's not about the word got well by the way in the word of God says uh unless somebody explains it to you how you can understand that you need somebody who gets it to help you understand what it says that if you just open up the Bible and start reading a lot of people are going to get stuck I\nGot stuck you need somebody to help you and that's what your books are doing\nExactly thanks for saying I I saw a guy and Twitter somebody promoted my book on Twitter and some Senate comes on there no thanks I I got the Bible that's all you\nKnow that's not all you

are people will say that thing and guess what in the Bible in\nActs okay Paul is in in in Athens okay preaching to the Athenians what does he do he quotes pagan poets in the scripture absolutely okay so there's this idea you can't even escape pagan poets when you read the word of God\nSo folks that that's going to challenge some people the logically but I'm not challenging you the Bible is challenging you\nAnd by the way he he he cited pagan poets not only to show that he was learned but to relate because he he said I become all things to all people don't sweat the small things I'm going to uh relate to people whoever I have an july's because I can get into their\nEr into their framework and they'll listen to me if I Know something about their world you don't compromise you

history of the world not because I say so not because I'm a great now because your great but because\nThe ideas behind this country or a gift from God to the whole world we are stewards of these ideas of self government and freedom and basically uh we have to take that seriously it's like somebody gives you an extremely valuable object worth a\n... so much money it's so fragile you you can't say that it's not mine I don't care that they've given it to you even trusted with it you need to take it seriously and I think that\nWe have to take what we have seriously and and part of that means we have to understand how it works and so what's been going on with the Kavanaugh nomination\nA has been depressing because people I'm On the Democratic side of the aisle\nTraditionally have played by certain rules and I think somehow they feel now they no longer can play by those rules because there's so much at stake I'm that's bad for everybody it's bad for them it's bad for the whole country so I'm asking you if you're listening to this right now [noise]\nPray for this country now people we always say that pray for the ... I mean genuinely pray when there's a commercial or when you have\nFor the ... I mean genuinely pray when there's a commercial or when you have a second say a prayer whether you're in a car wherever you are say a silent prayer or spoken allowed prayer for this nation for this confirmation process because this is dark stuff right now we're we're talking about\nWhat a man did or didn't do when he was Seventeen years old whether he got drunk or whatever I think wow this is this is madness has descended on America and then when the G O P ... relent to pressure and says okay we'll drag this out again will have the uh uh an FBI probe of course Feinstein\nAnd others say oh it's not the right kind of FBI program not deep enough it's not broad enough which really means that they wanted the latest forever and they're using every political advantage you have to see it for what it is folks you've got to see it for what it is\nBut it's it's as nasty and unpleasant as anything I have ever seen a and so I Want to ask people pray a pray for Kavanaugh but more than that pray for the country please pray for this country that we can heal and that people who are\nNegatively part is in a would would understand that we have certain standards that we have to abide by no matter what that was my that I wouldn't want to say that my fear is if Kavanaugh does not get a a put on the Supreme\nCourt and the Democrats take over in November\nThat that is the one two punch that will knock out while there is this is why thank you for reminding me to say to everybody you need to vote and actually I Want to say particularly to pastors out there\n... who's with the alliance defending freedom you know about them I've talked about them on this program does a banner on our website where you can find out more about them\nAnd we have cheap Kelvin Cochran or whose case uh being fired after seven years as the fire chief in Atlanta\nFor having had the audacity to write a book\nIn which he mentions what the Bible says about sexuality oh my goodness gentleman um I'm thrilled to have you back to talk about these things it's an honor to be here is is this a wonderful and you know are we talked last time we were together achieved talking about your story but there's so many other\nStories out there right now and I know a ... David accord menu as senior counsel and VP of litigation\nAnd ATF you've seen these stories I think a lot of Americans just don't believe that this kind of stuff happens in America or if it happens it's very very rare but the other side\nSeems to be very nasty and very litigious they want to come after people\nSo it goes against the narrative that we were just told those live and let live let let people live their lives and now we're seeing that no if you dare step out of line if you publish a book where you mention what the Bible says about sexuality you're going to pay a price\nThat's nasty that is not tolerant but that is what's happening and I'm sitting here with a man had happened to you or a chief Cochran I mean I Wonder if some of these other cases that we're seeing right now or that you you yourself David have litigated\n... it's incredible because it's not limited to\nNew York or California or the places you would think it's everywhere in the Bible belt it's in Georgia it's in Kentucky it's from coast to coast so people think well those are in isolated spots around the country they're not they're everywhere\nAnd as we mentioned last time or if they can come after that the chief they're going to come after anyone and we've got cases are throughout the country we've got 'em we people have heard from the Supreme Court case about masterpiece cake shop\nWhat's amazing about that if they're all those years we've got a gentleman who has a bakery who serves everyone but because he's a Christian he doesn't do all messages and promote all the vets\nSo he doesn't do for example Halloween cakes he doesn't do cake celebrating divorced that people do sometimes\nHe doesn't do anything against God or family or country patriotic gentleman as as the chief is\nAnd so when someone came to him and said we want you to bake a cake to celebrate to participate in our same sex wedding ceremony he said look I can sell you anything in the store I could make any other take that specific I cannot celebrated promote that event\nBecause it violates my beliefs they go against him they sue him we go all the way up to the Supreme Court recently we had a great victory you've talked about that well apparently it's not over because they've come after him again okay they basically have an activist now\nWho set him up and came after him and said we want a couple of things I Want to kick that celebrate their transition from a man to a woman that goes from pink or blue on the outside to pick on the inside\nThey asked for other cakes with say panic symbols and messages sexual ... messages and they're finding discrimination and going against him again\nOkay so this is so this is what I Want my my listeners uh to to understand because again I Know a lot of good people in America and they just they have this idea I was one of them you have this idea that listen if I just keep my head down and be good person nobody will bother me [noise]\nJak Phillips is the definition of a good person he is friendly to gay people he is not a big it OK so somebody comes to him a while ago and says we want you to bake a cake celebrating our same sex marriage\nTo him a while ago and says we want you to bake a cake celebrating our same sex marriage and he poll lightly politely if he doesn't say\nYou know hey fags get outta my store he doesn't ... he is a loving generous man now you'd think that he would have said something like that that he would pick up a baseball bat and said I'm not going to serve your kind whatever absolutely not\nShe says that anything that ... that goes against my religion including baking a Halloween cake he would not pick a Halloween cake he will not bake a cake that says down with the u._s._a. ...\nI mean it's like going to a portrait artist is the same thing and saying like you know I I Want you to paint my portrait and my wife's portrayed and we're gonna be naked and we're going to swastikas on us right we're going to pay you and you got to do it\nNo you don't got to do it right so if you go to this guy he's ... he's the name of the the stores masterpiece cake I mean it's this is he's doing art there's just not just like he's selling you hamburgers okay so\nHe is persecuted because somebody says we're going to ... we want to cause trouble we're going to come in there and we're not we're not we're going to we're going to say if you do not bake a cake celebrating our same sex wedding\nOr your you know you're you're going to get it you're going to get it so so this nice man has to go to the Supreme Court thanks to you an ATF and everybody he wins the case okay\nSo we think we're done with that\nAnd now you're telling me that somebody in Colorado has decided to come after him and if ever anybody needs to prove this is why I Want to talk to you about this if anybody needs proof of the nastiness of the vindictive ness of the other side on this this was not live and let live\nCome to him deliberately to cause trouble and they say we want you to already knowing he's jak Philips already knowing you one of the Supreme Court they come to him and say we want you to ... bake a cake celebrating transition\nFrom men to women is that right okay that it's almost funny like they want him to do this they want the cake to be but as a blue on the inside them but whatever I think on the outside or whatever\nBut here's the kicker and I'm gonna I'm gonna try to say this for my listeners so they can get this if you want to understand what you are dealing with right now folks listened carefully [noise] because I read this [noise]\nThe people wanted him to put a satanic symbol\nOn the top of the cake and it's just it's a satanic figure performing a sexual act if I were to describe it on the program it would have to be censored I I don't do a program where children cannot listen we're husbands wives cannot listen without getting embarrassed\nBut what these people asked this Christian man jak Philips this humble man\nOr to do was vial pornographic satanic genuinely pornographic we're not talking soft porn\nAnd they decided we're going to play with this guy we're going to where we want this kind of trouble that's how vicious they are so now that this happened where are we\nSo here's what's incredible about so you have an activist who set this up and they file a complaint with the civil rights commission which are not there didn't name only and and rather than seeing it for what it is as a set up with this pornographic ... say panic\nCake or they basically find cause to investigate are now going after him again now this government commission that set up\nWhich are completely biased to set up in the first place in fact what's interesting about these commissions one of the requirements is and and\nDo just think if this would ever be allowed for a jury right\nThat the majority of the commissioners have to be someone who's either in would be discriminated against or is part of a group of people that that would have been discriminate wait a minute wait a minute you're kidding me that's that's built into who can be a commissioner so right there it's it's so they said they set that up\nThat's right and and so that's how it set up so of course they're coming after people like Jack or minding their own business\nPeople like the cheap or minding their own business\nAnd it's it's not activists who are out there and people's faces these are people living their lives\nAccording to their faith and they're actually finding them seeking them out and going after them in jurisdictions\nAway so that this is why I say if if a real Americans do not stand up against this violence is if this is my listeners folks this is you right now right if you don't stand up now and do something\nOr if you don't if you don't understand that this is happening you're you're going to be part of the problem you cannot stay silent because the people have soda so to speak come at a closet on the other side there are no longer pretending to be nice nice they're not playing Patty cake no pun intended they are out\nFor scallops they want to take down anybody who dares defy what they say and we're talking about nice people like the chief who's sitting right here nice people like Jack folks in other words\nThe real big it's they don't want anything to do with the real because they want to come after nice people who are definitely not big it and they want to say\nWe're going to make an example of you you're going down we have the courts on our side we have the media on our side and it's why I said in my small platform on this radio program I Want people to know\nIf you allow this to go on you cannot complain when they're going to cause they will come after you are somebody because this is how nasty it as if you say the wrong thing they're coming after you and so alliance defending freedom you guys are are practically the only game in town I mean you have been doing this for years fighting\nThis battle and it amazes me that you have pro bono lawyers how many lawyers do you have across the country that are working for you guys\nSo we have about sixty five lawyers internally for ATF but then we have a over three thousand lawyers were allied attorneys are also committed pro bono our okay for the\nWorking for free that's ripe for free so I I say to my listeners or if you can give something to alliance defending freedom there's a banner on my website but this is just insane we need to know what's going on I hate to talk about it except we

the lights of any freedom you guys do what you do for free which is why I Hope people will\nThat and and give a\nTo what you do so how does it work I mean there are people all across America as we're having this conversation being intimidated or teachers are being intimidated people everywhere are being intimidated in fact sometimes a timid themselves by self censoring they say oh I better not say that because I get in trouble and I think\nThat is that it's flat out wrong when you when you in America you have the right\nTo religious liberty you have the right to talk about your faith where ever you are we all know when it gets you know appropriate\nBut the point is that when people self centered say oh I don't want to I don't share that oh yeah you don't want to share the good news you don't want to you want to help a kid in your classroom whose life is all messed up and and you could share with the kid after class about about God or something like that it's like no better not it better not\nSo people can\nCome to you in and say\nOkay I'm being persecuted first of all how do they reach the alliance defending freedom if somebody has a genuine\nOK I'm being persecuted first of all how do they reach the alliance defending freedom if somebody has a genuine case sure\nI mean there are several ways to reach us that we have a one eight hundred number one eight hundred tell ATF um ATF legal dot org is our website but what's what's what's amazing about about that is is what the other side is so good at is is name calling and berating an accusing\nSo what better way to to win a debate as to silence the other side and the way they do that is by putting you know you're a bigoted your homophobic you're a hater I mean how much are we heard all that stuff\nAnd so what happens if someone says well I don't want to speak up because then I'm a hater or I'm I'm a big at all those names are meant to silence you rather than having a debate on the issues we get into this ... that has nothing to do with what's going on and simply to silence folks I think you're right by telling people to to take a stand\nAnd there there are people there are are so called Christians are who are confused on this where I I haven't been called like on Twitter accused of making like a racial remarks I saw these people are insane they don't know what real racism is they don't have a real bigotry is I mean go around the world where you will see\nReal bigotry real racism but people are are so sensitive now that you're afraid to talk and I I Want to say I want to be a leader in this and say folks\nThis is not right this is like\nThis is there something viable when in a free country groups are trying to tell you shut your mouth do not share what even if what I Want to share is wrong I have a right as an American to speak my mind even if I'm a fool\nI have the right to speak in America so I'm not telling you you have to agree with me but I have the ... have the right to speak but we're self censoring people are afraid and as you said\nThere's there are people out there that they know\nThey they can't win the argument so all they can do is say shut up and if you don't you lose your job you'll be ... you know that is it's so vile that I think most people when they really get into like they get angry they said this is this is despicable I'm not going to stand for this I Hope people listen to this program understand\nThis is not right and you need to be part of the battle I don't know what that means uh some some people can write a big check to ATF I Hope they will other people can just educate themselves and speak up when you get an opportunity because if you don't speak up some day folks you won't have the ability to speak up we're getting we're getting there [noise]\nYeah and what's what's interesting is it as you mentioned this happens in schools that happens is that colleges and universities\nI mean if if people follow the news there are\nThese biased response teams which means is a student says something that happens to offend someone they report them\nThe administration then comes after them with its like sensitivity training and so they're actually going into these situations where you can't speak your faith because obviously that's going to offend someone I'm trying to shut the students down even before they get into their careers and into into the public square so they're getting them at a young age teaching them that\nIt's better not to share your faith which obviously we know it's important to do so and they're getting a when they're young there are people\nAround the world being killed for sharing their face their people around the world being killed for being Christians\nAnd in this country we're afraid than somebody
