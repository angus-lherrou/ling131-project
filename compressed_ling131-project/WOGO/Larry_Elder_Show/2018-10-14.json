I talk about religious freedom on this program don't I I think I Do just about every single day I I usually mentioned the alliance defending freedom a and I'm asking folks to uh\nTo help them or help Americans are with\nReligious liberty cases I thought would it be great to get somebody from the alliance defending freedom who's in the middle of these battles tremendous battles often with the U.S Supreme Court on the issue of religious liberty something that we understood as a nation\nBut have ceased to understand so now we have to have big court cases are and if it weren't for the alliance offending freedom I don't know how people like Jack fill up to domesticate masterpiece a cake shop and others uh would defend themselves they wouldn't be able to defend themselves the lines of an agreement stepping up so I wanted to talk to a\nTo match sharp is the senior counsel and director of the center for legislative advocacy at the alliance defending freedom and he's on the line right now that Trump welcome\nThank you for having me well listen there's so much to talk about but but maybe we can start with um this past got Thomas Case ah I just last week a mentioned that on the air uh for for those who aren't familiar with this please tell us what is going on this is a huge case right now\nAbsolutely so ... Thomas is a mother in Decatur, Georgia and her five year old daughter was sadly\nAssaulted in the girl's bathroom by a young boy that had been allowed to use that under the school district's policy that said boys who identify as girls are allowed to use the girls facilities and so as a result of this very bad policy a posh is young\nAnd so as a result of this very bad policy a posh his young daughter was sexually assaulted and and this goes to show what we've been talking about what the dangers of adopting these policies and schools allowing students to to use the restrooms of the opposite sex\nWell I don't really understand how can a little kid identify as gender fluid I haven't my notes here that in in Decatur, Georgia at the au cursed elementary school uh this boy who identifies as gender fluid a entered\nThe girl's room and somehow sexually assaulted a this little girl I mean ... was it actually a sexual assault or was it just an assault or what what are we talking about this sounds so bizarre\nYeah the the school district\nPolicy made this possible it was a pass sort of under the cover of darkness oh about two years ago and it said we're going to allow students to make their own determination of whether they're a transgender gender fluid however they identify and we're going to respect the desires of the child in the ...\nIn this area rather than establishing good policies to protect the safety and privacy and so as a result of this as ... as ... daughter was using the restroom as a young boy that identifies as gender fluid was also dismissed and went in there and did um assaulted her in a in a sexual nature\nOr do we know how old this boy was\nHe he was also he was actually in the same grade or as cautious daughter and so given a very young child that that obviously has um issues going on but with the the bigger problem is the school enabling dissemble\nWho but as we Lincoln ... who identified him as gender fluid that's just insanity what does that even mean for a five year old that you did they ask the boy\nYeah that I think that's part of what the investigation that the department of education is launching is looking into but under the school policies and indicators unfortunately not alone in this but it it really is determined by the child and so if a child walks in and says this is what I Am or this is how I identify today the schools essentially say okay\nWe're not going to question that we're not going to determine\nWhether that there is a better accommodations we can\nThat we can offer rather we're just going to let you use whatever\nRestroom or facility you want to ... regardless of the impact it has on other students\nOr in America why do you think it is that what really wasn't an issue twenty or forty years ago you suddenly an issue an alliance defending freedom has to step up\nAnd be defending all kinds of people left and right because there's so many crazy situation suddenly popping up in my in my wrong in thinking that it's more of a recent thing that it wasn't happening some decades ago\nYeah I I agree this is definitely been a growing trend within the past two years\nAnd I think it's a couple of things one I I think there's a loss of\nRespect for the importance that religion plays in the lives of so many people when you hear stories of people saying the jak Philips just bake a cake and things like that and they don't recognize that for jak this is about a biblical view of marriage and and his desire to\nDo his artistic designed with cakes consistent with that and so I think there's just a a lot of people looking religions say oh that's just something you do on the side and not realizing that it is\nCore to the lives of so many American\nWell I guess the other oh no no I'm so I'll I'll make my point later go ahead\nAnd and then I was just gonna say and I and I also think there's a growing 'em just pure hostility like I view that not only are these belief you know something you on the side but they are terrible believed to have to begin with and and I view from\nYou know live and let live and we can have different views about a lot of issues including religion to know your view as wrong it's bad it's awful it's bigoted and we must drive it out and punish you for even holding such as\nWell um I think you're you're right in saying these things and I this is why I guess I Want to say to my listeners folks if you do not fight\nIf you don't understand that we're going through a tough time you you you better vote you better get your friends to vote and you better if you can give to organizations like alliance defending freedom because they're pretty much all it stands between us in a country that demonize as people of faith\nAs bigoted now again you know I always want to be clear this is not about defending Christians or anything like that if you're a Christian you understand that you're supposed to stand up\nFor everybody so religious liberty is for for everybody but we're living in a strange time right now where people seem\nTo think that biblical values which are basic and which have been taken for granted in this culture for a long time that's certainly\nA there on the wrong side of history suddenly if you disagree with whatever the pundits are or the cultural elites are saying is true somehow you're bigoted and and we need to understand I think everyone in America needs to understand the basics here\nBigoted and and we need to understand I think everyone in America needs to understand the basics here that when we have this thing called religious freedom in America what it means is the government now listen carefully 'cause I don't want anybody to misunderstand what I'm saying here\nThe government can't take sides on issues that touch on the ultimate questions right religion touches on the ultimate question what is a man what is a woman\nHow they relate what is marriage all of these basic things what is a sexuality what's appropriate sexually all these are big questions and typically the government\nHas stayed out of this but suddenly now\nWe're having the government forcing views\nOn Americans with regard to marriage with regard to a transgender a number of these things you just mentioned it I'm Matt with this passion Thomas Case that\nThat the government is kind of pushing with all the might in Maine of the state uh with all the the tax dollars that we give the state and all the power that you get from those tax dollars they're pushing of view\nThat is actually now limiting the religious liberty of people who have traditional\nValues so that if I say well I don't want my daughter to go into a restroom if there are young men in there who are playing these had games that they say I'm a girl or maybe they think they're a girl but we don't know\nThe it's now incumbent\nOn your average American to stand up for religious liberty and they say we we've got we've got to be careful uh we've got to be careful about what kind of going with the flow going with the cultural flow because the cultural flow is now\nReally discriminating against people who are either serious about their Jewish faith serious about their Islamic faith serious about their Christian faith those people are\nHaving their own religious liberties abrogate it and that's why lines defending freedom has to step up and so it it's a strange thing 'cause it's not about defending Christians it's about defending a principle of the U.S constitution I just want to be really clear about that [noise]\nThat's right and unfortunately even with policies like the transgender policies were discussing they're being even\nEnforced on churches so we had cases we had to file in Iowa and Massachusetts where the go local governments were saying churches you must open up your restrooms to the opposite sex because you are open to the public and so now we've got even efforts to go in churches and micromanage\nHow they use their restrooms and locker and other changing facilities and all the churches wanting to do is operate consistent with a biblical view of male and female and yet the government is enforcing these policies are trying to even in in congregations in churches\nI mean it really is madness but I'll tell you if people don't fight this then it's on them and so I Want to say to all the people listening to me right now\nIf this stuff rubs me the wrong way if you understand that there are problems the world's going crazy or ... you need to do something first of all to any extent that you can be involved in government in school government whatever it is get involved\nAt least vote folks at least vote because right now in America we're seeing a takeover of radical I'm a ... of people with radical views this is not that the Democratic party of Nineteen eighty this is ... ... people\nWith really really radical views out of the mainstream are are being so pushy that they're pushing any moderates in the Democratic party out I mean try to say that oh I'm I'm pro life and I'm a Democrat that was easy to do Twenty years ago plenty friends of mine identified as Democrats and they were strongly pro life\nTry it now see see what happens\nUm we're living in a time where\nWe have to speak up and and I want to say to people getting we're doing a fundraiser for alliance defending freedom or if you want to or Ken I'm asking you if you don't want to give to this gift to something else but please folks\nUp put your money where your mouth is if we don't step up right now and defend

to mention is so folks understand because typically we don't mention this what what ... was asked to do was disgusting it was pornographic is like a really sweet word to describe what this is this was absolutely foul\nSexual on a level that I wouldn't even dare try to explain it on the air because it was disgusting and it involved Satan right just in case and was wondering where these people coming from right\nSo this is what we're dealing with right now and so this man has to go to court otherwise he's going to be forced to bake this I mean it's just\n... if every American is not outrage I Want to say to you where do you are legion says why we're we're in an existential battle for the soul of this country if you cannot stand with a man like this now what have we become\nAs a nation what have we become as a nation\nWhat have we become as a nation what have we become\nAs a nation we once believed in in civil rights for African Americans that was a noble battle and and the African Americans when you think of Dr King the way he fought that battle he would never dream of anything vial\nLike this uh Rosa Parks was a woman a tremendous Christian dignity Jackie Robinson was a man of tremendous Christian dignity it's why\nWe went along with what they said they they shown a a mirror or or a light on us and we looked at ourselves in in in in a new light and we said you know what\nThey're they're right we need to change the way we think as a country we need to change our laws but we're talking about right now is as far from that\nAs you can imagine it is absolute found this absurdity it's playing games with people obviously a jak Philips has not really meant to make this could these people are looking for trouble the alliance defending freedom has to step in and defend this and I just want to say to folks\nYou need to understand this is an existential battle for the soul of this country we need to vote we need to take action this is it's not okay that people are having to defend themselves against this kind of violence this this should have been\nThrown out I mean nobody should have to take this seriously but right now jak Philips and others have to take this seriously in the ice defending freedom has to defend them I'm Matt this is a really crazy cases it not\nIt absolutely is and I think the the icing on the cake so to speak with when the civil\nRights commission that had just lost at the Supreme Court used jacks\nCase against him and said oh we're going to fight your own case\nDefined probable cause against you again and it just shows the hostility that this commission that the state of Colorado has towards Jack and his beliefs this isn't about letting him\nContinue to operate as business and serve every body but give him the freedom to decline certain cakes this is saying we hate your beliefs and we're going to punish you as long as you continue to hold those and try and operate your business consistent with them\nWell again I think that um your average American really would would rather ignore this kind of stuff and I'm telling you folks\nAh one we're fighting the civil war when we were fighting the revolution there always people that want to kind of ignore the fight but sometimes you have to fight\nA and if you don't fight you'll be held responsible for not fighting when you were needed that this is a real battle folks that we're we're going through right now and I just want to say that\nThis is a battle for everybody it's just not us against them God Forbid the people in the wrong side of this battle are fighting against themselves these are crazy people who need to be protected from themselves the very idea that they might get away\nWith this kind of deeply cynical behavior\nToward their fellow Americans is it's just not right and but we have to stand up so the least we can do as I said his vote a please vote folks vote your values are get serious don't don't uh\nDon't so many people have such excuses please or if you don't vote don't ever complain again a and I want to say uh if you can give to the alliance defending freedom I don't know anybody\nThat is doing this a kind of work right now so I Want to say go to my taxes talk dot com you'll see the banner every penny you get will be doubled up please give what you can\nVisit folks this is why God gives us money\nAn energy is is to use them for his purposes and right now I'm this is something that's about all we need to fight it it's tremendous because they will come for you eventually you know of everybody just looks the other way uh eventually\nThey're going to come for you and you're going to ask you to do something that violates your values when you say uh where do I turn well uh I like to think you could turn to

I always know who is getting the award who's just by some guy\nAnd when I heard your story I just flipped I said this is nuts and in part I think of the best thing about you're getting that award is that\nIt made me realize who you are so I could have you on this program so that all of my listeners not just the people in that room at the closest but could get to know you in the work that you're doing a at the at the woods and center in it is it's magnificent to me now that night\nI'm part of what made it interesting is you had a number of these men whose lives that you have seen transformed so to review for people who just tuning into this program\n... you're in the business of a a a retail uh you you you are working with people you've created the woods in center to to work with people that are struggling with drugs addictions are all kinds of stuff and get them to turn their lives around and you have decades\nUm ... in this in this world\nAnd as we talked I was saying that it must be discouraging because you're fighting an establishment that you have seen from over fifty years ago that that that the what the civil rights movement morphed into\nA kind of a grievance a thing it's just not something you saw from the beginning that it was not going to work and you dedicated your life to something else and I thought it must be so hard but you said it's because of these men that you put a smile on your face that you keep going\nYes Mother Teresa or when she was walking in Bombay with senator Packwood the time and he said to her Mother Teresa you must be frustrated that you are more successful after all you can only help three hundred people at your hospital and do you have three million who need help\nShe said God God does not require success of me just faithfulness\nIt's for him to determine when and if success is to occur and that moved me to to just continue yeah and when I reached out to those young men and I saw how some of them I could ... when I first met them\nThey were just looking evil and I said to myself there's no way this guy's going to ever change what I'm saying to myself\nAnd then within two weeks I began to see something awaken in him and then next thing you knew he took his same leadership for for evil to turn it into good\nAnd he became suddenly just Joseph is inspiring figure and then he went on to inspire others uh and and so I I was just moved in and uh and and so we look for in other words\nThe principles of the market economy applying the social the economy in a market economy only three percent of the people are ... entrepreneur but they generate Seventy percent of the jobs so when we're looking for ways of solving problems in the social economy\nMost of the innovation of curves among a very small number of people like the Derek Ross's and others but because of their witness and their influence they can begin to take\nBut because of their witness and their influence they can begin to take a what they have done and influenced the majority of people\nThis is a is this the trickle down theory and it works I mean it's it's really an amazing to me because you have these leaders are you ... they have an outsized effect somehow that people look at them and it just has an amazing effect so it's like a trickle down of wealth but it's cultural well\nIt really does see and that and that violence reduction we we've we we've refined those principles and we have an operating for Fifteen Years in Milwaukee school system I just got an invitation from the chief of police of the city and the head of city council\nIn Indianapolis, Indiana to bring our violence free zone program to one of the most dangerous ZIP codes in that city we're going to be working through pastor Webster Emanuel missionary Baptist church\nPastor Webster has a very unique ministry where he has had hundreds of men where they called a boot camp as his church\nThe hundred and fifty men most of them ex offenders come twenty straight days from five thirty in the morning to seven no breakfast so you have to be intentional about wanting to change but past works there has done a tremendous job of helping to transform and redeem people well we're going to take\nThis this ah um I took a gym daily there and he did a A N are folks on the ... so we're going to this is a rich resource that\nExist with in that community and I'm going to take our skill and talent and training and take that and apply it to that dangerous ZIP Code and so we're going to demonstrate that we can reduce violence in almost any community by twenty five percent in three months\nOK so obvious question Chicago or I mean are they not desperate enough to reach out to about\n... and I have made three trips to Chicago talked to various groups offered to bring our approach there but there's the the the resistance to this is if people feel that they didn't invent\nIt [noise] it doesn't exist and if we have spent\nThree to four million dollars at the University of Chicago school of criminal justice\nAnd their interventions having worked if we put millions more then how can you uh work so what we're fighting against is a tradition of failure that has become ingrained in institutions that resist anything new but\nFortunately we have some cities like Indianapolis and others and Eric I Hope to be able to demonstrate\nThe effectiveness of it in some place and we can get the kind of public attention to those successes right and maybe we can change it well\nI mean it it it's extraordinary you you know this situation in Chicago it seems beyond belief at this point\nAnd I guess I you kind of wonder I Wish I could uh read the mind of the current mayor of Chicago to wonder what is he thinking what where does he think you'd go does this just go away maybe just goes away\nA but it is so bad there and you're telling me that you have the solution you've done this for decades this is not kind of like hey here's a crazy idea it has worked over and over and you've seen it work over and over\nYou can talk about it intelligently this is not just some crazy idea that happens to work you know why it works you can just cry than you do describe how and why it works\nUm do you depend I see that with the center dot org means that you're a non profit so yeah so you depend on donations yes contributions contributions ... I I really hope a Bob that there's somebody listening right now\nThat understands that are you guys you're proving it I mean when somebody ... you know you you you want to invest and stuff that you know a ... it's not a joke it's not a crazy idea it's working and this is something that's working it's very simple it's not very complicated right you're doing it is working but let me let me\nJust walk you through how it works yeah um because we took those principles that transformed those young men and we find it and to operating principles and others have you have a school like I started in Milwaukee Fifteen Years ago one school the Bradley Foundation gave us a grant\nTo go into one school if you have a group of ... or let's say a thousand students are controlled\nBy ten percent and that ten percent ten percent\nSo if you so if you get youth we put about eight to ... and young adults from the community many of them have dropped out of those same schools they have been transformed and they are moral mentors and character coaches so they they spent two weeks to identify who the shot call this the people\nWho is this is really funny this is a movie by you understand somebody needs to make a movie about this 'cause this is real\nAnd so what happens if you're a dentist by that ten percent of a cohort and then you reach out to them and and you give them a respectful way to be peaceful and uh and then they influence the other uh a Ninety percent and that's\nWhy we're able to go into a school most dangerous schools we only went into one and the principal said\nUh I'm not getting reports from teachers or something we what do we call it climate survey we as teachers is\nDo you feel safer than the principal and the superintendent said hey the police are not getting calls to the school every so we did this one school\nThen we ... we went to a second we created the demand for it then the principal said and the superintendent can you do this to six schools so now we're going to Fifteen and it's Fifteen Years now we have been but it is a Milwaukee, Wisconsin\nAnd this is a dramatic this dramatic wonderful stuff I Want to keep talking to you and I will keep talking to you folks to the earth my taxes you I'm Talking about what's in if you want to know more go towards the center dot org if you don't want to know more what's wrong with you senator dot org we'll be
