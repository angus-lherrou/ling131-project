I Do for this reason all of the suspects are that are key party and our and truly do foment a violence and disruption of these other ones and it's like they put their finger on the scale to say see you guys are it's one of the equation you guys are just as bad if\nNot a writer and invent would and that is the that's that's the the the big plus for the left lately is for a couple of days we're not talking about Mitch McConnell getting barked out of a restaurant we're not talking about crazy Maxine Waters are advocating or\nWho get in state behavior we're talking about liberal victims an empathy is gathering properly I Would add for liberal targets of a terrible thing\nAnd that makes a lot of people go isn't this handy isn't the time they're curious so let me give voice to that well you've done it Lenny substantiate it for you and if I can very humbly suggest how to walk around saying things that are\nResponsible versus irresponsible right if you're walking around saying oh no this is a leftist hoax stop it stop it yet because you don't know anything about ... here's what I'm doing keeps me mentally healthy I offer it as a recommendation let the game come to you\nThere are you know how many investigators there on the story right now you know how many people there are looking for who the person is behind these\nMysterious packages plenty I Am a massive fan of and believer in law enforcement I think we're going to have a suspect\nAt some point probably sooner rather than later I told my local audience this morning I and be happy morning host\nHere at six sixty am answering Dallas Fort Worth and I told them not tell you what I have no idea what to believe I uh I I absolutely field for anybody who receives a package like this it's scary it's terrible and should never happen to anybody but before I go up presuming that what we have here is a conservative counterpart\nTo the baseball field shooting in the crazy Democrat Bernie Sanders guys are going now we got our guy\nLet's see what we got let's really see what\nWe've got because or their hoaxes sometimes\nDo people scrawled racist things at a university just to make people think they're terrible racist at the university and then you find out it was black guys then it just doesn't just we would go there's evil people either racist people university are are there are folks who you're swastika up a synagogue\nAnd you find out that it's people who just wanted to spark sympathy for the synagogue and make people to God Nazis are everywhere\nThis happens a lot now do we know this is the case here do we know that this is the left doing this\nIn order a false flag whatever you want to call it a hoax wherever you want to call it to divert attention from the terrible things that liberals are pre ... doing the the leftist provable doing on camera\nIs this is only games are kinda and an opportunity just to springboard this into waving a finger at Trump and blaming him for the whole thing is this just a sinister hopes do we know this no we don't know anything about God so stop pretending are saying that you\nKnow than it is however is it okay for you to wonder about it of course it is is it okay for you to wait\nFor actual facts to come in before jumping to the conclusion that everyone wants you to jump do you bet you can with my blessing and I told the audience this morning\nI Will believe that this is a right wing terrorist when we have a right wing terrorist handcuffed and in custody until then\nGame on wide open anything's possible let the game come to me because I I have no idea what's going on here and either you authorities are going to work on it let's wait for them to do so right we're in Fort Worth\nMore high Mark Davis in Larry how you doing good\nI'm going to talk about that if I ever had a comment Rocky Mountain carry on a table in the morning and stuff I don't you read like a Fox yeah and\nShe went from like a white guy but she got she lost her job\nRight hey here's here's here's my thought it was just dumb for her to think that it's okay for white people to walk around in blackface my dog knows that's not okay\nAnd the reason it's not okay is there is a really bad there's there isn't really there is really bad history of of because they just didn't want to employ black actors they took quite actors made them you know minstrel up with black faces and\nBig wide eyes and read lips it's a terrible racist legacy that makes it not okay for anybody to go is Diana Ross or Emmett Smith right but I Love black people I'm going to do this it's a bad idea now\nSo maybe you didn't know that and that was a man I'm almost done Megan didn't know that that was a moment for her but ... but is it a death penalty offense I think the shit out of episode maybe
