there\nYeah it really doesn't matter how big your author and the double when\nA lot of run in that focus\nAnd it was the number back you're going to pitch it out of the right side and the move down to about the seven yard line by Ben Stein Mets again [noise]\nBut I have I think they carry [noise]\nSuch a high taking time off the clock is the second quarter moving a lot faster than quarter number one dead and its shy put for touchdowns on the board and then the second quarter with yet another angle touchdown [noise]\nWell you wonder how seriously the gym you guys even warm up in the first half of the game probably don't see that too often I figured any action at all yeah before they're ready to go [noise]\nSecond goal from the seven yard line [noise] end up right up the middle of the ball

back\nJust barely Joseph forester the senior running back so they bought for ... trying to get on the sex and he got stop just short it\nBy looking at the world you want for your call you look at the rest of the ... of the class act out there under the pen standing up outside the tent rooting for the software to them [noise]\nAll right for thing going from the one picture the quarter back\nUp again to forester and he's going to get\nSaying this far and no farther and that's probably the biggest highlight that I learned on the line I don't know\nYeah and so forth and then move though for the ... cardinals to try to get forest or the touchstone that would have been his first touchstone of the season so they bring him back out there to give the senior a touchstone huh it was that close\nYeah second to last game of the year boy that you're just buses by doesn't it\nYou know we don't we\nGive the or give them some credit he got hit by about three or four guys whereas we caught her got that ball\nAnd now the huskies come back with their starters as they've got Bennett mayor and the quarter back\nOn the hand up up the middle\nAnd that again to Barbie and more than a workhorse Sammy Barbie the junior running back for the season than a short and gain a two yards out\nTo the five clock inside of four and a half minutes to go in this first have huskies\nMoving it left or right the long way to go to Peter mayor under center pitch outright side got to get out of that ends up and the huskies do\nRico daily on going for the safety on that one over shot it allowed the running back to get to the inside of the cut off for maybe a couple of yards\nAnd that was a sophomore who's got some pretty good speech [noise]\nAnd he's able to get out to about the airlines that's thirty five\nWell often simply you know you don't want to go up over a certain number of defensively you always want that girl so you see we still got the starting defunds out there [noise]\nMayor on the hand off up to a mental how much do and on that one so now it's going to be a fourth down for the huskies after they hand out to Barbie and very Little Rock right on that one more down to the horse down and [noise]\nHard to not point here\nWell we'll see what they do that where he's punting from right now the punter will probably be having his back feet right yeah back\nIn the goal line which is going to make it tough out there at the guidelines\nFor the ... from the eight [noise]\nAnd the punter is Bennett mayor the quarterback so keep that in mind mare you're going to catch it and ...\nAnd are sending bonds back and hit the forty six forty and it's going to go down the hill that by him as a thirty five forty forty five fifty or forty five forty thirty five a flag is throughout\nThis

flag Jeff you must lesbian at least one of them they're all over the field [noise]\n... how about the mood on that side line with all those or\nUnderclass men getting some action\nI think they're pretty happy here are just last play it even though you didn't ask me about it I'm going to comment that looks like a confetti party out there with all these yellow flag yeah\nYeah and they're all different penalties too 'cause they don't learn sitting up here well into the run but this one's coming all the way back where he initially caught it looks like there's a flag sitting at the thirty seven yard line so China's probably going to start at a twenty two yard line\nThat looks like a forgotten flag but it's yeah it's way back where he had drafted\nI think the other ups were just trying to knock from down with a flag\n[noise]\nBut you know France you might as well see it through I mean you just never know right so\nBut it doesn't take anything away from the run of the really the

they had a far too often from their perspective see either\nNo gain a boy you know you look at a record\nLeading the leak in the tackles for Lawson\nYou have to say that that's probably part of why he's gone on for tonight to go after four or five of those\nThird down at nine for the huskies from their own twenty six pitch outright side and again the third different runners\nAre there to the lobby Rico dealing on was blocked by Charlie Walter yeah go ahead blocked by two guys are held by one of them fight through it for a loss of three on around the world yeah from the twenty six back to the twenty three so the sophomore Walter is least productive Jerry\nOf the night so that's kind of an interesting I think that's kind of interesting from Sandy jerseys get three of her ... none of them his main carrier Barbie and trying to make some headway but nothing doing\nYeah I mean he must just be throwing a mix it up and and and get something going there but uh we've had a couple of

that they have not done in this conference and that is run the ball away from Rico\nI'm actually really surprised by the number of teams that run it right out of his brand down the best from behind the curve all brothers from rice lake as fast as they are drug I'm going for by just run the ball to the other side I\nWhat are we got here to start the second half it looks like we're going backup quarterback for Chippewa falls as we had a little glimpse of him earlier and that's never travel Brady fixing her and are going right side for the cardinals going to that original line of scrimmage of the twenty eight down to about the twenty five yard line on the far side\nOf member thirty nine out of the ... and that's his fifth early on targets in yeah remember Eric Torkells sort of the Green Bay Packers back in the day was a backup running back special teams layer inside the twenty four for the cards they're going to call it the twenty three second in five or\nSix hundred quarterback runner in motion coming across taking it across the twenty down to about the sixty I by the court wrapped up there by number\nEighty four Oakland or that's a number thirty six Bruce Sanborn off the bench and Jacob Fisher the senior with the tackle\nAnd they're going to cost the seventeenth so make it a gain of about six first down ship off all the cars knocking on the clock running continually no matter what\nEight minutes left here in the third quarter with the cars up thirty five and after the third differ on our side that I met the right side down inside the ten\nYou know you gotta feeling in the first half of the jury begins Rodolfo there were probably like what do you mean we're going out there we never author now there are a little bit more fired up they understand the early

one that nothing was six forty four that's the only time they do stop it I guess with the score like that otherwise would continue running clock during game action and so I Wonder if we're going to see someone else attempting to kick here\nEven yeah we are and it's going to be twenty seven Jake Karen\nJ Karen rather than Nathan costs are now\n... is a junior themselves and customer is a
