profile lax\nBefore his dismissed I I think the only reason he's not being dismissed by the president is goes all the issues and people you know with the Mueller investigation and everything else that's going on and his next attorney general wouldn't be approved right now with you know what do you want another ah Kavanaugh hearing to take place this is not the time\nBut he's never lived up to the expectations I have for him and I think many others did too I mean I remember he was the first one that came out for President Trump's certainly among the first senator who did so and he took some whatever risk so you think he's got courage he's a risk taker nah\nJust like that pumpkins back I call her but not for long welcome\nTo go as a tasty treats where every season it always surf rush to

don't [noise] don't\nCall in now and join the conversation eight eight eight or nine seven one eight eight eight nine seven on seven to for three setting fire to the airwaves it's Larry Elder show\nMark I'm filling in for Larry Elder of the pain free released factor dot coms studios and as I said we're taking your calls at eight eighty nine seven one saying what you call in about\nYour reaction to everybody in the media seems that way to me are certainly on the left trying to blame President Trump for what this crazy guy did as if this guy did it because of what President Trump says because of course everything that goes wrong is President Trump's fault and everything goes right like our economy\nIs because of President Obama and if you didn't know that just that person will pop up he he mentions it all the time I was calling me that's because of what I started okay which by the way explains why they were so against now justice Kevin Oh it wouldn't have mattered if the president had nominated left is like the pope\nWhatever the president's for their against remember they were against whoever the nominee was they didn't even know the name it didn't matter they have their son's ready\nThat is their basic platform this November and it doesn't matter if the president has done a great job none of it matters say hazing and they hate him with a passion you know I felt that we reached the uh the top with George W. Bush and their hatred this one is being surpass\nThis bumbling fool could never had beaten their candidate and they will never acknowledge the great things that he has done\nSo these acts will not long be about this evil did you notice just like it wasn't long about Paisley Ford that didn't last it wasn't about her it was about the Democrats regaining power so she she's like an asterisk now that's what she's going to probably be an industry\nSo it'll just be always about harnessing President Trump and all Republicans because we are evil and they are not you get it would just\nTrump and all Republicans because we're evil and they are not you get it which is even more reason why you have to vote tell me what you think is a set of eight eight eight one eight eight eight nine seven ones sage\nIt has also been amazing to see the Democrats in the meeting in action you know the Democrats they're going to use these acts to their parties and the vantage\nPoint for the media to be so blatant in their advocacy this is all new in the age of Trump they haven't been on partial their views for many years now with a lot of us know that that's not a secret\nBut they used to pretend here's the difference that they were non biased no more now does out in the open with their advocacy and you can even see it in their questions what's his name Jim Acosta from CNN hardly hiding his disdain for the president I'm telling you you could see that in his questions\nThey're out to get the president and make no mistake about it and the media has an enormous power to influence the debate in our elections\nAnd the president is right to call them out on this so the president has rightly call that the press for who they are and the press cannot deal with it in their righteous indignation\nAnd just today I was watching getting ready for the show there was Shepard Smith on Fox saying that Trump's phrase lock her up and the chance to encourage in that vein and CNN sucks are the kinds of things that ... that people like the suspect on so Mary was Trump is responsible for it\nBut those of us on the right lane people with bad values were bad acts not those who share their political views\nBut of course that we're on the right blamed Bernie Sanders for his support or remember who shot and seriously injured Congressman Steve ... and the other cars and he would wipe them out if he could\nWhat President Trump is responsible no matter what he says even when he tries to unify us he's no good\nCNN is hopeless by the way I I Try to watch what's the other one MSNBC it's it's not easy watching each house I I live in another planet and there's a real argument to be made for not letting Hillary Clinton be above the law yeah CNN is hopeless that's my point and President Trump is right\nAnd a lot of supporters are people who argue with me when I'm done other shows\nThey said how could you say you know because here's my position if Hillary and bill will agree never don't bother us again and leave the scene which is I Know it was impossible it's not gonna happen then I might agree not to indict here if I had any power to say that oh you could imagine the calls I got mark how could she be above the law and they had a great point\nThat is not inciting people to write or to physically harm someone that is a legitimate political ask and see\nWhat it's asking us to see on the right and for the Democrats and the left and now the media that is unacceptable\nSo they're almost all on the left and we're fortunate to have someone like President Trump call them out\nWe've had so many we presidents in the past and it's absolutely refreshing to see someone take it back to them\nEven if the media the left the Democrats can't take President Trump is not responsible for the craziness in our country\nTell me what you think as I said eight eight eight nine seven one ... and let's try to get a call or two in Houston, Texas let's go to Mark Mark you're on with mark high margin\nHigh marks a the Mark I'm what you were a bringing up about a media is absolutely true they don't want to report the fact that the a cycle and he is a psycho prior to the threatened to blow up Florida like power and I I don't know some other bomb threats to\nSow what Trump responsible for though no\nHe happens to be just you know the ... the the course of the ... now and another distinction is the fact that\nYou know Trump literally to not say let's go blow them up right to work you said a few times during his is a a a not his candidacy while he was trying for a couple of times he said oh yeah go ahead on the face or something like that that would that but he hasn't done anything like that where\nThe the lab whether it's the actual a political or people or the news\nOr they've all actually said that are going out and confront them and and and and and run 'em out of the stores all this other stuff so I'm again that that part of the contrast in different\nYeah like Maxine Waters right get in their face wherever you see them you know don't let them leave especially if you know they're in the cabinet ... this is what they do when they do it's OK mark don't you get that [laughter]\nOh of course it's the the the ultimate double standard that everyone recognizes that except them well they'll they recognize that they're not going to say than even\nMost of the hard core I Would say\nYou know a intelligent Democrats because that's the other thing to what they're doing and the people that are acting out these acts of violence most of these are actually borderline psychotic that are reacting to something there that way if the Trump to arrangements so now they could argue that that's the cause of it now too and that makes them psychotic\nYeah it ... you know that's what they would say no question about it\nBreaking ATF news just recently the U.S department of education announced that\nActing on a complaint filed by alliance defending freedom against the Decatur, Georgia city schools is opening an investigation into a horrible assault of a kindergarten kindergarten her in her school bathroom as a result of the boy being
