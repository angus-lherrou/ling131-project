program\nThanks for having me Eric well anyway and congratulations on your new Donald Payne said swam\nI thank you for being aware that I have this book coming out I'm all a Twitter about it literally and I have to tell you about actually before I forget I wanted to tell my my audience\nThat you have been really involved in exposing George Soros and all this kind of stuff but I Want to say that a lot of people would know you from your book finding God at Harvard\nOr which came out a number of years ago when all kinds of awards finding God at Harvard and then you begin what's called the baritone forum hard to believe you you began it so long ago suddenly Nineteen Ninety two is a long time ago and it's in over two hundred universities\nUm it it it's just amazing very tough former explores you know the the tough questions with regard to biblical truth and Jesus and whatever it's just tremendous stuff I Want people to know a little bit about who you are um but\nToday we're talking about George Soros now by the way did you know Kelly or because you've spent a lot of years now investigating George Soros and what he's doing with the evangelicals but did you know that he might be a figure in my Donald drain the swamp book\nReally really exciting thing here\nHe might he might not there's a there's a dinosaur in the swamp he's the scariest when he's called the George Soros and some people some people have said he resembles George Soros obviously it's not intentional by just that you'd find it funny [noise] um and by the way the journal that represents Mitch McConnell\nMichel ... it's not fair to say that it's Mitch McConnell because you know what every turtle to be perfectly honest whether it means do or doesn't looks exactly like Mitch McConnell of what I mean what do y'all do that's turtles you can't blame the yeah the last\nFew weeks ago I think he ... that are beyond\nThat isn't that interesting it's a it's like he and Lindsey Graham they came out of the swamp and are they going to stay out of the swamp we'll see I I Hope that that that\nThey started listening to America imagine that\nYeah imagine that okay so let's we've got to expose the truth here you've been doing it but I Want to do it on this program tell us what you discovered with regard to George sources billions and evangelicals in America\nSure and you know it is a little bit beret taught scenes truth is is not a very tough for I'm I'm getting now can be clear however I became very concerned about America and they said in fundamental transformation\nI became very concerned about America and they said in fundamental transformation that is not\nInevitable uh it ... the decline of America is not an inevitable I realize we're being outmaneuvered my husband David called a novelist who wrote a little great novel called breaking babble\nAnd we literally followed the plot it was fiction predicting life reality\nAnd it was a global billionaire trying to swing the U.S election by funding fake kind of fake ministers into great prominent why to divide the actual faith vote\nSo they realize you know let's get we ... we started doing research and realize that Soros was funding through open society foundation that Soros dot org twenty five billion dollar foundation now\nWhat's funding Jim Wallace Sojourners faith in public life faithful America\nCatholics for choice Catholics in alliance for the common good\nI mean if you're able to be on and how deep this goes a ground I Believe that George\nSoros and Jim Wallace in Sojourners who again they've taken a I mean the Sojourners and the evangelical left has taken a sharp left this is not the left\nOf the eighties or the nineties and so they've gotten to people like John Case like people wonder what happened to John Case like that's what happened in ... various\nYes when listeners begin to think what's happening to my church and why is that suddenly the social justice agenda that defined by the laughter followed the money that's what we learned it's sad but true uh where\nYou know sorrow to its funding Al Gore and John Kerry for president they lost that was a meeting why do we do we need the faith narrative and it sounds a wicked kind of a lens tactic and and storage began funding groups like Sojourners to literally\nUm teach the left to cherry pick a few Bible words\nTo sound like ministers they dress up like ministers and confuses busy you know our mall an American ships they don't understand and so um it's a clever tactic and we just need he just said ... and it's and it's that well you can learn about it look\nLet me let me say this and this people are gonna think this sounds a ridiculous ... but I don't because I I Know\nThe story and I've done the research when the church in Germany was infiltrated by the national socialists okay they were very clever they understood\nThat if we can work with people who are biblical he is not illiterate I\nDon't know the Bible particularly well we can sell them whatever we want to sell them\nThe same thing is happening when America George Soros funded people they throw phrases out there you just said they grab a Bible verse like oh we're supposed to welcome the alien blah blah blah and people say on that are of course means open borders and I say wait a second\nThat's insane that doesn't mean open borders it means we're supposed to be loving and we're supposed to welcome the alien it doesn't mean we're supposed to change national policy so that no American is safe and we don't know who's coming into our country and we don't know where country begins and ends to make that leap is lunacy but people\nCan be persuaded because they don't really know what the scripture teachers or they don't have a sophisticated understanding of how you marry what the Bible says to public policy they just\nUse these catch words like welcome alien it's that simple doesn't the Bible say welcome the audience what George Soros has done and it is really dangerous and if you and if you think that the church\nCannot be taken over in America and that the government can't be taken over in this way\nI just have to point to the Nineteen thirties long before anybody was talking about death camps or the Holocaust\nThe German church was saying hey you know what we can work with um with the national socialist and the national socialist pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed until the church got infiltrated and that is effectively\nWhat has happened to many parts of the American church the but the fact that you've done the research Kelly snuck people want to find out more about this is there any place they can go to our website\nYes yeah so we we\nCreated some American eating and ... with an ass American evangelicals dot com and there's a\nGreat wealth Fifteen minute video sources formula for failing America a guide for Americans but then scroll down and you'll see a new three minute video sources rented evangelical\nAnd it gets into that and just three minutes if you shared it on or go to our Facebook page American Association of eating out a share to your friends it's an amazing eye opener\nAnd that our American evangelicals dot com it's kind of an informal growing coalition that that's three things why he shares that Christ centered gospel ... teaches political world view on issues and three engages\nOpposition to the gospel and nation we want to be a good hands are made that stand strong\nI I Love it okay so the website is American evangelicals plural American evangelicals dot com well Kelly you've been heroic a and your husband David ... has been heroic you you you too have spend\nYour time in your money to focus on doing the journalism and the investigation that journalists today are not doing and so you've uncovered this stuff and\nPeople need to understand this is real they they can look it up they can look into it\nAnd people have an sinking Lee as I just said with regard to you know welcome the alien that you think wait a second you're grabbing one scripture verse and you're saying that you can beat people over the head and say that we shouldn't have borders and we should change or policies ... based on one scriptures\nThat is insanity I mean it's no different than finding a scripture averse to promote slavery I mean you know you're you you can't you can't do that you have to try to understand what is the scriptures teach us of course we are supposed to be welcoming but it doesn't mean that we're supposed to change or national policies and so\nSoros 'em and Jim Wallace and others have very\nUh cynically in some cases in in source case it is totally cynically and Wallace his case a ... I think it might be well meaning late but ignorant Lee has has twisted the scriptures and people have\nSwallowed it I have many dear friends that have swallowed this stuff\nAnd and they've decided that you know they need to vote for Elizabeth Warren or they need to vote for here he know or they need to vote for for Chuck Schumer whoever is out there that sounds compassionate\nBut in fact their policies are brutal they're not compassionate and they're not doing what they ought to be doing and expressing themselves and loving ways they just they're moves in sheep's clothing so it'd be ...

overreaching folks I Am talking to my friends are from Texas I'm Talking to my friend Kelly Monroe cool Burke uh Kelly before I forget you know here we are talking about\nUm young people being led astray\nOr by George George Soros funded groups a lot of these groups claimed to be a evangelicals they're really a socialist\nVeering toward secularist left these and it's disturbing so I Want to put in a good word before we continue this conversation some people know that I'm always talking about Hillsdale College\nIn Michigan why because they are doing just the opposite they teach young people or what it means to believe in American style self government and liberty or it teaches kids what\n... in American style self government and liberty or it teaches kids what is good and beautiful and true that's the whole point of education and they're doing it there but the reason I bring them up is because they're also trying to do this they're committed their president the or the president of Hillsdale College my friend Dr Larry aren't\nThere all committed to reaching beyond\nUm the walls of Hillsdale to reach everybody in America so we've got a website ... taxes for Hillsdale dot com if you go to my taxes for he'll still dot com you can find out all the stuff that they want to do\nFor you they're they're just reaching out they often offer actual college courses with actual Hillsdale professors to you that you can watch on line really great stuff that I'm In Texas for Hillsdale dot com so\nKelly Goldberg um the website that you have set up is American evangelicals dot com um do you think that this election hangs in the balance because even ... are being swayed in this direction\nI Do have nearly and sadly millions of evangelicals don't even vote and I just think I could see if you're\nDying or dead and then having not voting but I Can't imagine any other reason given what's in the balance a and so this is why Soros dire and these guys are trying to break up the evangelical wise\nUm tendency to to vote for the party that Republican platform right it's not it's beyond a President Trump ... it's it's the future of the country so that we're talking about and so the reason and sorrows and others Obama even what funding through the state department\nUs some faith groups to see the mass migration was that it was quickly connected to a voter registration right\nAnd so this is about power\nAnd period and a sadly open society foundation is it twenty five billion dollar foundation funding all this\nA lot of the stuff around the world America is one of dozens of countries what that is undermining and demoralizing so we need to wake up to what Jesus said the ... Center for new stuff and we need to vote and we need to bring our wives friends with us\nIt's it's really amazing I you know I speak all around the country and I and I often say that if you were ever tempted not to vote or to say politics is not for me that Christian and politics don't mix that is bad\nTheology he had his bad it's not biblical if the Bible said that I'd be screaming about it on this program because it's important to do with the Bible says but the Bible doesn't say that people\nSince the beginning of time at miss understood scripture so it's really important\nThat you take the responsibility to understand what it says and does and doesn't say and I really think that a lot of sweet young people have been swayed and pulled left towards you know hashtags social justice because they missed understand what it says of course we're supposed to be compassionate but the question is how\nAnd I I have to say with Kanye West or you know appearing to praise this president for his policies a lot of young people are thinking\nYou know what maybe we have been getting it wrong maybe Donald Trump's policies are compassionate may be the policies of the people who talk about compassion are not compassionate and I really think\nWe have to think for ourselves you can't just when somebody says that we believe in compassion we believe in helping the poor doesn't mean they're doing it and this is the thing is that if you want to destroy\nYour future and if you don't want to help the poor and then you float along with the socialists tied but the fact that evangelicals are being very cynically drawn into this\nUh ... it's just so good to have you wind up to wake people up to understand that a huge effort has been made it's been going on since the Obama administration and before two thousand and eight in two thousand twelve or I mean you know that for a fact don't you\nI Do and I think it's time for all Americans to\nLook past words like progress that actually read grass and compassion let's not compassion we have to Jesus said you know that for you know the tree by the fruit and so American evangelicals dot com we make tried to make the case\nThat biblical

Margaret least comedy castle my car was packed full of all of my items and I drove off to New York city and and why did you do that because I was doing comedy in in Michigan\nAnd I want to know you had a lot of parking tickets and you wanted to get an area that's part of his door okay so you said I'm going to New York to do my comedy\nWell in New York I was doing ... already been to New York if you're not funny way to let you know they'll say something like you know a pony uh-huh so I wanted\nIn and out now like in Michigan where people are sort of polite\nDutch people in Michigan interview and they're all phony sometimes yeah I'm just telling you straight up right now they're all ... all those Dutch Michigan people and they will not tell you the truth and say for example hey\nThat's not funny so you had to come to New York for that I used to play double Dutch too so ha ha ha ha to hurt me twice as much when you said the yeah exactly and the double decker bus\nSo we can we can sing that later but let me ask you when you came to New York when did you have a plan or you just going to come here and you know I had NO PLAN ...\nAsk you when you came to New York when did you have a plan or you just going to come here and you know I had NO PLAN\nI actually didn't have any I Would I was just like I'm gonna do whatever it takes to try to get into it leads to break into somebody's comedy clubs sort of comic strip lie which I think his do around on are you there are some with the first club I was able to finally break into it was so hard to get into his club they used to have an open Mike on Tuesday nights\nAnd and now ... broke and did you have accomplices or you just did that on your own oh cool I'm about I was going to the jokes are just\nToo and I tell you something let me tell you something pow [noise] you know I see an opening I'm going through I see that All right I'm ... and with these ... when you broke into the club you what happened tell us the story\nSort of where to get into this club is on Tuesday nights they have a ... an open Mike seven PM comedians who are new in town start lining up at like six o'clock in the morning wait a minute really know for like ... they have it his whole honor system where you got Fifteen minutes to go to the restroom you have to like it was really hard\nTo find them I turned to perform and this and in this comedian named George Wallace walks here who you probably know I Know George Wallace awesome to George Wallace water legend a life ...\nWhy why do they have like a legend they're when they're supposed to be try outs for young comedians\nWhere it's open Mike not in any legit like George Wallace whoever can show up whenever they want to and kick you to the curb exactly and I'm next and he walks in\nAnd I know I'm about to get bumped up the managers already walking over to me but this is actually where a guy shows up for the first time of life well this is where I noticed uh yeah so the manager says to me hey uh George ... do you want to go and vote for him or [noise]\nI think you want to go before him I just asked St Louis won't go on George to crush it and then you've got to go next that way\nSo you're going to tell us why the film is called more than funny are Hoeber Eighteenth why is it called more than funny yeah\nOne night only people so if you're going to Nineteen when we watch it renders them so you want you know and you don't want to do that you you don't want yeah\nSo about ... years ago and doing the show and the Los Angeles comedy club and right before going to stay how to change in mindset about comedy [noise] normally when a comedian gets on stage I'm all about getting laughs when people right without a ship take place where I felt like instead of trying to get laughs when people I should give them an opportunity to a ...\nYear changed everything wait a minute yeah that that sounds like a head game what you just did write so instead of trying to get laughs from the people you're talking about giving them an opportunity to laugh exactly okay here's my question\nWhat was I mean\nOh [laughter] it means [laughter]\nIt means intuitively as a comedian ha ha you get on stage to receive yes but my whole everything shifted to I'm getting on stage to give\nAnd I can't tell you how it's changed everything so that same night so you so this is not just so you mean as seriously that that you before you went on you had this thought you know and it ... it affected how you perform that night absolutely absolutely because here's the thing if you have a gift for someone\nYour job is really just to present the gift it doesn't even matter how to respond to the gift\nYour job is to present the gifts for people like it if they don't like it didn't matter in fact what I've learned is it actually takes to control out of the audience his hand\nSo I Do the show tonight and I leave the club and\nAcross the street among ... people taking pictures autographs ... every time I leave this club don't you hate that and get away from me man backup give me my privacy backup lady who just want it's not my fall I'm famous and attractive to mine get away with just one brain ... yeah yeah so I look across the street says her most beaches have you been here before but now I'm really nice area\nAnd uh I'll look across the street and I saw homeless guy\nNo I've never seen a homeless guy also I just Columbus for ever and I've been there many times\nBut that doesn't mean he wasn't there before but just means before my mind was to get laughs when people so why wouldn't even notice homes do so I noticed when I was like what about him how can I give him an opportunity lab for real four days later this lady was in my autograph line she says to me hey\nWould you consider coming to the homeless shelter where a volunteer at doing comedy and I was like a no it's just\nSo I did I went to the homeless shelter an idea of comedy and it was pretty awesome a lot of my friends I Would have been a laugh but here's the thing I'm not there to get laughs um they're simply to give them an opportunity lab and it just so happens they see the opportunity\nSo then when we do our next tourist season\nI decide hey in ... in the cities we go to let's stop at a prison a homeless shelter abuse children facilities and let's do comedy there before the big showed at night\nSo it was ... men is due in and the stories I Would hear from the homeless people in these abused children are caregivers were crazy so one item on stage were about twenty two hundred people here and so when I Do comedy ... ... and you notice because you think so it's like you're you're never really\nI mean if you want to be in a moment you are but you can be far ahead of the moment I Try not\nTo be in the moment yeah I'm running for my sock right now you're not even in right now right now actually I'm already I've already moved on in my mind the Oregon\nCool you know before you leave to further so sorry as a comedian I'm normally presented joke number one\nYeah cool before you leave to further so as a comedian I'm normally presented joke number one but at the same time I'm doing the math on what joke number two should be based on how you respond and Joe ... and then I'll move on a job number three and start doing the math on how that joke will go based off all your ... responded to joke number one and probably will respond a joke number two\nPeople do not know that ... comedies that cerebral right like seriously that's very absolute was doing that on the fly while you're being funny while you're thinking about the\nSo I used to go seven jokes deep and I wouldn't know but but the reason I'm doing it because I'm trying to get laughs when people what joke is going to get more or less what joke is going to get more or less but since I had to shift in mindset the question I'm asking in between the jokes is really what can I give to this audience\nThat did this come as a result of your face or was this before the same thing happened to have this was after\nI became a Christian for sure I mean was because I just really feel like I'm here to really help people and most of the time that's laughter but if it's something else I have to be willing to give that as well so I'm On stage is twenty two hundred people at this event and I feel like I'm supposed to share one of the stories\nFrom the abuse children's facility I was at earlier that day which is crazy 'cause the story is not funny\nIt's not funny abuse children is not a not not a place you go to get laughs\nExactly but remember I'm not there to get last I'm there to give them an opportunity right and we had been laughing for probably thirty minutes ... mhm so now I feel like I'm supposed to share their story and I share them telling about the little boy who is being abused by his mom she was on drugs and when she was doing she was pulling out is toenails\nSort of whole room is froze you can imagine there are laughing at all and then she the grandmother explained to me that the little boys so afraid of his mom everywhere he goes where Spiderman Costa\nSo now it's time for me to do a show for for this little boy his caregivers and all these other abuse children and I'm On stage and I know all of her stories\nNow if my mindset was to get last from people there's no way I Would have been able to do the show but it was giving them an opportunity laugh so I had to do to short part of my time so I Do the show were twenty minutes in and I hear a voice in the voice says my name is Ronan\nAnd this little boy was all this mask and you are done but we actually put we posted a video of all you do like it is but ... so I tell this to my live audience and they're just done and you think\nNo more or less to go after after this because before that were on a scale when the ten were laughing at like seven and a half\nDuring the store we drop to zero after the story aired we probably jumped up to twelve\nAnd it's not because they were insensitive is because we ... I gave him more than just funny which is what the movie is too we actually went around the country and found three stories and filmed them just like that so in the middle of the jokes you go from stand up\nTo abuse children from stand up to special needs kids from stand up to adoptive families and it's pretty powerful\nI had to say ah you know as I'm listening to talk you sound like an incredibly nice guy and I know for a fact you're not [laughter] so I just want to say this has to be God oh you know what I'm saying what has happened to be God because personally I Know you're just not this nice yeah and they actually in their mind by the way\nI Want to have you know that you are in case you didn't know though and I ... I usually like human rights says this is [laughter] it's just\nSo I mean it's hard to surprise me on some level like what you're saying is very daring I mean to do that\nTakes real courage and also I Would say incredible self confidence and I don't just mean in yourself an incredible maybe I'll put it this way incredible faith in God that he will back you up you're doing something you think is right mhm everything would tell you do not do that\nDo Hollywood I took this going to some people say here's what I Want to do and they were like we don't know what that is and they don't it's never been done before now like this has never been done before ever like who in the world why would our it all started with me just simply ask the question what can I give\nAnd that one audience show me that they want people show up to laugh to entertain but the more times than not they actually want a little more and that's why we called this thing more than ... on the outside people think is extra funny but the truth is\nThat I was just going to say that more of a title implies like its extra funny but in fact yes exactly yeah that's a double entendre that you're going over there to now listen we're going to come to the end of the segment I just want to know do you have a last name other than junior\nOh so we'll find out on the other one is do I need to do I need to like Google you actually do that is actually at the end of the movie that is that true [laughter] it's like a bigger is or you don't want to ... that's right that's right now that's not true it's not really at the end of the movie really no I mean maybe you\nGot to be you're always in a moment I don't know do nothing while put a knife to I don't even know I don't even have to continue this interview then they tell you right now folks so I'm sitting here\nThinking grief from a funny man and let me just tell you something seriously when you tell me that you're doing this because I've never done stand up but as you know when I'm speaking from you know sometimes I'll be funny or absolutely but to go from that from doing funny funny funny into this other thing and then to come back\nTo be funny three down on that to me is\nA unique I've never heard anybody do anything like\nThat and it's not like just water ... it's the same sort of comedy I've done on NBC's Tonight Show Jimmy Kimmel so it's the same quality of comedy but it just happened to ... in fact the comedy has to be super strong in order to go with the stories that are completely cut contradicted boost to the ... you know what I think\nI figured you out your Jesus freak\nThat's a compliment I'm ... I'm also Jesus freak but that's really that's freaky stuff because you're walking out there talking about walking is it like a sit out every net like would change is like a super duper freak occurrence in ones that come on at night you're ... or ... or ... she has a different as soon as we can go their brother you harvest okay yeah that's different\nThan it OK folks are you stick around when we come back we may find out\nThe last name of my comedian guests Michael junior or\nHow to deliver a punch line ... ... oh yeah All right when we come back we're going to do that stick around for\n\nMidterm elections are right around the corner and it's obvious now the level will do anything to win you may not realize that even your cell phone bill is used upon liberal cause\nSo which now through the nation's only conservative cell phone company patriot mobile patriot mobile provides nationwide reliable service with unlimited Zach insects and know hidden fees\nWas patriot mobile automatically donates a portion of your bill to the conservative causes your voting to protect\nKeep your number bring your own device or select the new one from our great selection including I enjoy the ... beginning of the only four dollars a month [noise] ... mobile that going to get started today and when you use the upper go news they'll even wave your activation beef for up to to\nStop supporting big mobile and liberal causes and make the switch to patriot mobile today ... mobile dot com or call one eight hundred a patriot patriot\nMobile dot com or one eight hundred a patriot one eight hundred to seven to eight seven force it\nHave you racked up more than ten thousand dollars in credit card debt or you barely getting by making minimum payments you should know the credit card companies are tricking you into thinking there's no way out\nCredit card companies would rather you didn't know that there are ways you can become debt free and you don't have to pay the entire amount you oh there are debt relief programs that help people like you escape overwhelming credit card debt\nNational debt relief has helped tens of thousands of people just like you reduce more than five hundred million dollars of debt\nNational debt relief is help so many people there a persuaded by the better Business Bureau you don't have to declare bankruptcy or take out a consolidation loan\nYou have the right to settle your debt for a fraction of what you owe reduced a large portion of your debt now called national debt relief at eight hundred nine for two forty seven thirty eight hundred nine forty to forty seven thirty that's eight hundred nine forty to forty seven thirty\nImagine a politician saying this today\nI have wondered at times with the ten commandments would have looked like it Moses had run them through the U.S Congress that\nIs a quote from Ronald Reagan he showed us through his life his faith in with his words the Judeo Christian values and principles matter you can help spread the legacy of Ronald Reagan and you can do it by getting a Reagan email address\nRight now if you have a Gmail AOL Yahoo or other big tech company email address\nYou help them market their service with every email you send in return they scan your emails and target you with unwanted advertising well thanks to our sponsor Reagan privacy dot com\nYou can instead share the Reagan named with every email use and and they won't ski and your emails they leave you alone get an email address you'll be proud to own at Reagan privacy dot com your very own\nPersonal private email address is available to you at Reagan privacy dot com get your Reagan\nEmail address right now at Reagan privacy dot com\nWhen you're thinking about a high visibility easy to find out as they are your business consider the communication center on business highlight fifty three one twenty four hour crash sometime it's\nLate right now WWE jail pay for rent with more than ... says conference room and reception area versus lord two thousand square foot office area has great access to all ...
