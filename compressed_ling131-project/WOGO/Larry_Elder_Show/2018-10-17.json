did she say she attacked\nA video of course but she made a false statement in this statement she put out\nA she said that the Republican candidate for Senator John hardly had fortunately embedded somebody in her campaign that is not correct I had nothing to do with Josh ... never spoken to him he I I was the main investigator involved in this investigation\nAnd just your listeners know our investigation from McCaskill campaign showed\nMultiple staffers saying that uh that ... and the cat's gonna bottles policies\nAre the same but quote people just can't know that other staffers talked about banning semi automatic rifles and mechanical herself was caught on hidden camera in the office talking to someone she thought worked for her\nSaying that there would be a gun ban of some type show McCaskill's now just respond on local news in Missouri are claiming that the Republican Senate candidate had something to do with this which he did not\nAnd um but she's definitely on defense if you look at the uh a response that you just put out\nCheaper I looked at the video not only the first ever talk about banning semi automatic rifles he talks about banning semi automatic firearms\nThat's right they're talking about handguns\nClara herself talks about um when she gets into the Senate will vote with so called Chuck Schumer wing of the party obviously there's a red state Democrats have to walk a fine line because\nMost of the people there are a moderate they're not leftist their their their moderate\nTo pro life pro gun Democrats door thing in Missouri do thing in the swing states so what is an investigation exposures is that in order to get elected in order to get elected you have to lie to the people and that's what all the staffers are things got nixed arose says\nI'm you know can't let people know that Obama and McCaskill the same views another staffer says looking pretty shocking\nCapital of the name of Glenn Winfrey McCaskill campaign when asked if\nModerates will be upset once they do a bait and switch and they impeached Trump\nWhat the staffer says his quote get over it unquote he's saying the moderates we'll just have to get over being lied to very devastating very powerful I mean maybe the most powerful undercover investigation we have ever done it because it involves a sitting\nUS Senator has now responded to all of her staffers calling or wire\nHere is Claire McCaskill response teams will do\nWell in in some startling that Josh how I Would be part of fraudulently and betting how many in my campaign\nThe attorney general of the same Missouri you're supposed to be going after fraud not participating in it [laughter] so um there was nothing there I've been very upfront about all my position in fact now I remember that very individual talking to me\nTrying to get me to say trying to get me to tell him to say something different\nAnd then what my decisions are and I said no you just got to tell people on the doors it is what it is\nI made no secret that I think we can support the second amendment\nAnd universal background checks and banning bump stocks my gun record is out in the open for everyone to see what's really telling about this is how how far they're willing to go to ... somebody in my campaign\nUm that startling I've never seen that in a U.S Senate campaign before in the state of Missouri\nDreams [noise] well first\nOf all it's a I mean it's a bold faced lie it's categorically unequivocally stalls get Josh Hawley had anything to do with our investigative journalism I've never met him at the for her to come out and said that he is part of Raj slowly embedding somebody\nThat his fault and she just lied on local TV in Missouri second of all you saw her waffling and bumbling and stumbling and her answer about guns per staff said that she supports a semi automatic rifle ban\nShe told her that she supports a ban on a ours those are her words so she found these things you know and and it's a really amazing thing is the\nForward beyond the fence and lie about me and I'm I'm ...

all our problems remember when Joe Biden said yeah it's a big deal I I thought it solve all our problems\nWell I'll tell you what Obama said you can keep your doctor if you want to and that was like this one here you can't keep Medicare Bernice planned replaces Medicare itself with Medicare for all the different kind of policy\nNot only that is twenty two million Americans people who have

literally dying and it's a shame socialism doesn't work because the socialism the individual means nothing\nYou know I often ask people this question whenever I have a discussion about this Canada Great Britain they have a socialized medicine Canada has the what I think Obama wants to have which is single payer are in Great Britain has something very similar but when you take polls\nThe majority of citizens in both Canada and Great Britain seem to like their system why is that\nBecause if they get a sniffle they can go into a local clinic than they wait in line a long time but they
