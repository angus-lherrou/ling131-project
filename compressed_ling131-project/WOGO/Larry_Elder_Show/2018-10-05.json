W O G O sports but we come into this one tonight that the last couple of weeks for the cards\nAre putting up a good fight against superior and especially against River Falls boy through three quarters a tie game last week at ... park for home come at a at the right field for homecoming a River Falls one of those teams along with ... the first place in the conference kind of pulled away from their day but boy through three quarters of the cars were just uh\nYou couldn't be more even than they were with River Falls\nOn a couple of teams in the big rivers conference getting recognition in the state rankings River Falls one of them and that division to rank and so\nYou know the the big rivers is shaping up to be a little bit stronger than we thought it was but at the same time cardinals hung tight with just about every team that we play this year had some chances if we wouldn't have turned the ball over at a inopportune times and and the cardinals really that has just been a bug that's been them all year long the turnover margin has just been terrible for this team and really\nYou know you look back to the rice lake game where we give up the ball one second before the happens and not only do we give it up when we're on a thirty five forty hard line but they take it back for a touchdown and yeah it's hard mentally for the kids to bounce back from that but that's what our seasons but like and so we find ourselves after the river falls game out of the playoffs\nSo you have an Oakland north ... obviously struggling this was a team that that almost every one of the big rivers have marked off as a wind before the season started it's worked out that way for most teams\nShy high was looking at this as as kind of a break hopefully by the Hudson was a battle to get into the playoffs are now it looks like this is just a battle to make sure that we aren't the ones that are in last place in the conference or Hudson getting we're going to be nothing but a spoiler\nUh although statistically you know they say that there's always a chance you can get in and even within ... basically the way it works is they take all the teams that automatically all of my mind having a winning runners in our time for all and then I'm all the spots Arnie filled up and take the next best teams that are\nHave a lot of other qualifications but the the next best record\nWhich means that team that has nine conference teams time may have a five and four record for four and five record winds up being\nBetter than a three and four so the odds of us getting in her extremely well technically we're not all\nBut I think it's so personal pride and obviously finishing your all of these seniors for them their last high school football action you got one tonight that on paper\nSherbet even right now it's working out to sort of a a as unexpected an unscheduled less than ten minutes on the clock and we haven't seen a ship all falls here so far north has gotten off the field as well but the rain has only been light year and that's been good news and we saw the forecast a saying the possibility of showers here on a\nFriday night got killed and I have been introduced in the game almost every time this year than\nWhat a beautiful nice to play football and I'll tell you that well you know what that means that if you're a football player or not the crowd not a good night to be a fan but as far as uh a football player sometimes it's fun to get out there in the mud you're not going to have that on a nursing field obviously but you know it's fun to get out there in the rain and and the muck and just\nYou know have some fun out there 'cause you know they're they're hot anyway so there's cold rain is going to bother them but not a good night to be a fan on her\nOther action and the B our seats in Idaho clear memorialize that Hudson yeah\nYou got two and three memorial in the conference against the Hudson\nForeign one one of the themes tied for first in the hour see you've got that rice lake at the nominee again rice lake is three and too many many foreign one River Falls foreign one as there at superior tonight taking on the two and three ... and this is the fourth and final game and the big rivers conferences Oakland or their hung coming\nAs they're hosting ... falls here tonight the huskies are oh and five and the conference on seven overall
