California\nWhen I heard about this bus tour is calling us on the way tell us about it\nWell you know our position is that the state has just been rendered unaffordable by the political class I mean the highest rate of poverty in the country the highest housing prices gasoline water electricity\nWe've got forest fires threatening our homes we got a rising crime rate we've got the schools that are forty seven of the nation or the political class has driven California end of the ditch we're going to fix California Larry and I think people are ... are ready for it\nJohn Cox the governor of

helicopters a lot of them have bullet holes in 'em from Vietnam I mean\nThis is really obnoxious and people are sick and tired of it\nNow John on your policy agenda your first item is or the repeal of the fifty two billion dollar gas tax increase\nThat would limit it last year and I assume that the repeal of that gas tax increase will be popular the measure is called a proposition six uh it's on the ballot to repeal this gas tax but it turns out according to a poll that just came out a couple of days ago\nThe majority of likely voters oppose proposition six they want to keep the the gas tax what's what's what's the deal with that\nOr is this the same polling firm that predicted that we'd have to Democrats in the race for governor or not sure about that uh now I think just repeal is wildly popular Larry it's because the\nPolitical class has mismanaged Caltrans Caltrans spends twice what Texas does to build a mile a road and\nYou know the the roads in Texas are far better they are that better than they are in California so you know they are the politicians are drafted the pilots summary in a way that is going to make it a little bit tougher but\nI'm telling you for anybody paying attention uh they're not happy about this the gas tax and that's going to be repealed up I promise you that\nMy guest is John Cox she's running for governor in California as a Republican his website to John Cox for governor dot com John Cox for governor dot com John Cox a superior court judge recently ruled that charter cities cannot be forced to abide by the sanctuary state law was signed by Governor Brown explain that to people\nWell yeah and this was a monumental decision because the sanctuary state law for basically protects MS Thirteen I mean that's what it was there to do it\nAnd Gavin Newsom is all in favor of that but I got to tell you that the mothers and fathers of young or Hispanic kids as well as other kids in this they don't want I must Thirteen and California recruiting their children and uh it's going to be repealed or when I'm the governor but\nRight now and I met a young uh Huntington Beach a city attorney who mounted this lawsuit\nAnd very gratified that the courts held that charter city don't have to comply with the uh sexually state law and let me tell you it's going to be a non issue after him the governor of his ... going to get rid of it\nJohn Cox before this happened I didn't know the difference between a general city general lost city in a charter school he turns out\nThat the largest cities in the in the state uh San Francisco or LA San Diego Fresno\nThese are all so called charter cities which gives them a lot more control over things like I'm a police authority and therefore they can uh cooperate with a with the federal immigration authorities they can if they want to uh during routine traffic stops and worry about the immigration status of people\nUh this is not what the governor wants to happen but apparently if you weren't charters city and there are about a hundred and twenty starter cities in the state\nComing about two thirds of the population you have all these rights but you don't have as a general law city\nAnd uh but I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for San Francisco to do anything about this or I mean\nYou know there there are in the process of trying to get the state to approve a a legal injection sites where addicts can shoot up in a nice clean environment which I think is it's certainly ridiculous and it's not going to solve the problem of the horrendous drug addiction that's afflicting California\nJohn Cox when are you in a debate your opponent next\nMonday at ten am on a public radio station he doesn't want to face me across a table on live television Larry I mean he's afraid that my good luck 'cause\nThey're just going to overwhelm as a yeah\nBut really it's really actually uh he'll look like such a youngster next to me a a which is good and I promise not to use his youth and inexperience against\nThem\nJohn Cox speaking of of good looks he he is a a good looking guy a guy and and I'm thinking maybe that's why you been able to get away with some of the stuff you've gotten away with this is the guy who had an affair with his best friend who was his campaign manager the wife of his best friend who was his campaign manager who does that it can still survive\nA I don't know that's the broke called people tell me a\nLesson no Larry I got so many issues that people in California you don't want the rest of the California looking like San Francisco

Lamberth lying under oath 'cause I had him testify during the Clinton years in a deposition in fact twice because Lamberth may come back\nStephanopoulos was one of the heads of the war room alone with Hillary Clinton James Carville and himself base near the number of women they did that\nAt the direction of Hillary and Bill Clinton and they did it to protect the president so for him to be talking about you know how cabinets defending themselves and how the president is backing him up by saying that\nUh you know he never take the side of the accused I mean that's totally hypocritical and of course one would expect from George Stephanopoulos\nTell me the women you represented and tell me what specifically are stepping up all this to malign them\n\nBut with regard to Gennifer Flowers and

Annapolis under deposition twice did he ever admit under oath to doing some of the things that you claim you've done\nWell he had a very good memory the memory you know the the favorite phrase of the Clinton people was\nI have no specific regular recollection means I remember something I just can't remember now on the front of the of the bart justice so no he wouldn't have gotten anything and like I said he he was found to glide on those\nWere given the fact that he won't admit the anything how do you know that he himself has done these things how do you put his fingerprints on these things\nThat's been widely reported him in Reno because actually ... you wrote a book called the war room which became a documentary\nWhere in that book he admitted to working with Rick return to
