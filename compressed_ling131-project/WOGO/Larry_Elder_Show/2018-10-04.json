especially in the national services industry for ten years and sadly you know we haven't made all that much progress a little bit now more than\nMost recently but that having been said I think that um if you force the issue by quotas you end up with unintended consequences undermining the industry a little bit and and the gender representation\nAnd so as a result I I Can't say that I'm On board with quotas but what I Do think we need which is sort of what we're seeing here the pay is not true because if there isn't some type of the pressure\nWith the perception of their consequences on the back and you know I think the excuses for inaction running so it's really incumbent upon us too I think with that little bit of pressure keeping the spotlight on the issue is a type of thing that hopefully\nIn that white light people feel that the needs a new and then once you actually start to get a more balanced representation just a little bit you get to a tipping point and then it becomes

what I'm I Can't tell a you know I haven't looked at the water hundred thousand pages of documents that they seem to provide 'em you know there's there are a few things in here which is proven to be true that was probably beyond the pale of law\nUm what what what bothered me about the uh the article is the the authors obviously showed their bias in several places I'm One of which where they say that uh the rich never really pay their full freight\nUm and ah there's a couple of places where they're under explanation allows them to make some rather crucial accusations which\nIf I knew all the facts I might be able to disapprove so I'll give you an example if you if I may sure I'm supposed that I'd buy a house for half a million dollars I put twenty percent down and I borrow with a mortgage the remaining four hundred thousand dollars or the purchase price\nNow what is that worth to me what is that included in my network is like if I gave it away at that point what would the value of the if the or the value of the gift will be a hundred thousand dollars because it would be subject to the mortgage and\nSo now let's say there's a downturn like there was in the Nineteen nineties or two thousand three or two thousand eight when everybody lost value in the real estate and now my real estate is worth only four hundred and twenty thousand dollars\nAnd like a lot of clients of mine decided when the downturn came that was a good time to give away real estate to their children so now it's worth four hundred and twenty thousand dollars\nI give it to my children watch the gift that I report on my gift tax return watch four hundred and twenty thousand dollars minus a four hundred thousand dollar mortgage twenty thousand dollars left that would be the value of the gift\nNow a decade later\nThere's been improvements all around the neighborhood knew Tony retailers developments of of of various sizes and I sell my children's sell that house for seven hundred thousand dollars\nOr have to pay off the mortgage so they keep three hundred thousand dollars I'm not even going to talk about taxes at that point but they kept three hundred thousand dollars and then one could say that they got Fifteen times the valuation of the gift\nBut you see that was perfectly legal they didn't but the article doesn't explain leverage of real estate so as a result I mean you you can easily said my gosh how could that ever happened how could you ever invest in something and then sell it ten years later for Fifteen times what the value was when it was given\nReal charge recharge my guess he's an attack in the state planning lawyer or read you said there were a couple of things that that jumped out at you and if they could be proven to be true would be problematic what what's the most serious one\nBut well the one that I really found to be a very serious there's there's there's a there's a statement that when Donald Trump's a casino was in very bad shape or you know just ... drowning in debt that apparently his father\nOr sent an emissary to buy three million dollars worth of chip\nRead them and put you on hold for for for for this we're going to take that
