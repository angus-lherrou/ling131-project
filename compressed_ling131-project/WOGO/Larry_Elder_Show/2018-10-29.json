thirty two trillion dollars over ten years all private coverage\nUnder his plan Larry would be outlawed and you know a hundred and sixty million Americans have employer sponsored insurance and the

Bernie started this back in twenty sixteen I'm Single parents being around Medicare for all for a long time but only in twenty sixteen when he was running against Hillary for the Democratic
