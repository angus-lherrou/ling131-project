or at least a part of a logical answer to the immigration problem we're happy\nTo stop the remittances from here to Mexico\nMexico Honduras Guatemala\nI I Would imagine we do have the technology to do with the question is whether or not or would be effective are these people are already here are and the question is what do we do to prevent more illegal alien from coming here and that's what the president's trying to do\nOr if he were to somehow try to stop remittances or and or remittances that his money coming from people in this country to Mexico\nBecause I Believe they're a second largest source of income after oil\nUm I don't know it seems to me that doing that would also exacerbate the problem in in Mexico I hear people say that\nUh if President Trump for example withdraws the aid from Honduras in Guatemala it'll simply make conditions there even worse or and or would create even more so called migrants it seemed to me the argument against Mexico his that Mexico's economy under developed\nAnd needs to be developed and you stop the remittances if even if you could do it legally\n\nI'm not sure how that would create conditions that would make it better for Mexicans to stay in Mexico as opposed to coming up here illegally but thanks for the idea of you and I'll look into it tight is in San Antonio Texas tiger in the area of the show\n[noise] Larry love your show man thank you so much thank you um so\nYeah that that testimony from that gentleman a fantastic one that as a conservative or for now a long long time one of the\nThings I've understood is that the Democratic party has had an absolute saying well hold on the black community now and the mind that uh for about six years and they had no intention of ... what is going to take what you've done among like them to get out of their cells\nAnd so\nBut but to my point you you had a caller ask you how many legal immigrants are accepted into this country um and I happen to know living in San Antonio I'm married to a Hispanic woman her family is from Mexico\nWe as a country per year except about one million legal immigrants of which about six hundred thousand\nOr residency changes I don't know maybe they have dual citizenship and they're moving to America I'm not sure what the situation it but that leaves you with about four hundred thousand so that boils down to almost eleven hundred per day okay legal citizens that we are accepting into this country and at this point in our\nHistory we have the most legal immigrants that we have ever had and that's thirty seven thirty seven no if you if you estimate on population at\nYou know you and do that math\nThat comes up ... percent of our population ... illegal immigrants mhm so you know to make the argument and this is through not only democratic uh you know presidency for Republican and medicines and and this has\nBeen going on for a long long time um but you know\nI wanted to ask you you mentioned earlier on your show that Mexico has that when the policy for ... body who enters the country illegally that's right my my bigger question my bigger question is if Mexico is\nAnd from what I hear they have a blockbuster and the willingness to help you you say that they're they're pretty much just escorting them and kind of you know I'm just protecting them or whatever they're doing now is that these people are not rounded up by the federal rally immediately or at least\nA medium that they caught him for the the the integrity of Mexico's all walls themselves\nMhm we'll talk\nIf they're if they're entering illegally you know after that one so why should they why should you know if they're if they're agreeing to help us and we just went in to a new trade deal with\nThem it just seems like the third mainly ushering me people to our border and then they're going to see how we handle\nThat's exactly what's going on why do you think Trump is so upset what do you think published so angry [noise]\nBecause the Mexican

was an ... and he came to believe that they were being infiltrated\nBy communists and and people who were really too far left he really felt like it was going to bring the demise of first perhaps Hollywood and then the Soviet Union and so Reagan's politics began to skew from the ... to the right\nAnd he happened to have been really powers in Hollywood with um with two actors William I'm Dick Powell and a Robert Montgomery and they were passionate Republicans and they went to work on him\nAnd so you can see the whole shift in the book it happens graduated but it it it happens decided already but he was from the left to the right and really embraces conservatism\nBut it's also told me that he believes we can learn from President Reagan and his compromising with the other side of
