[noise]\nMy two guidelines or you don't poison me other parents\nAnd you don't spoil the child [noise]\n\nRight yeah so the question posed into my earphones as well so you do everything in the\nKids still not happy listen there are a lot of all I'm happy kids who have parents intact the divorce the divorce should not be a happy you miss a game changer okay that's my point\nIt is a a a a sad perhaps even tragic moment or ... time in life fully acknowledged the ideal isn't is intact family that's definitely the ideal human species is a complex species\nAnd while we must retain our ideals there are times where divorce is morally\nNecessary and I say morally necessary the idea of that are good people decent people should be\nCondemned to a miserable life\nDecent people should be condemned to a miserable life just to stay together is strong has always struck me as morally indefensible\nBut a child a child's happiness my point is the child's happiness should not be permanently yes it will be temporarily of course\nBut it should not be permanently affected by divorce however if you spoil the child or a few bad mouth the other parents it can be permanent that's my ... big big deal it's a big deal okay\nWe'll and ...\nWhat's the new one for me is how do you pronounce your city in Georgia\nThat took over Georgia okay to call a high\nAs the pleasure and I I certainly agree with everybody else around codes and how much they appreciate what you have to say a ... a little bit different and the um like the ... of adult children of divorced struggling with the um and I I just it seems like there's um\nThis phenomenon that somebody knows about but nobody really talking I'm certainly I think my son's struggle with um um moms over there that are over here and the ... of course are addressed in my case I'm the father things like\nAh is the one that given up um it was kind of what I've experienced in but it's mostly about um adult children struggling with their parents and\nHow old are your children when you when you divorced\nMy two older ones were let me think er and er just graduated college and uh and then I have a younger son on a fixed and\nWell so okay well the youngest son is obviously not an older child oh no\nI have some I have a lot of thoughts on this question and one of them is just for people to think about people who stay together for the sake of their children do will divorce after they graduate high school or will divorce after they graduate college\nOr it doesn't seem to work out quite as they think and in many instances precisely for what you point out that it really or has it emotionally affected them even in college or after college is that your point\nYeah and even into adulthood and\nI mean even in adulthood OK yes okay so I'm going to just use this to say a few words and I thank you for your call\n\nThis is a very uh it's a very interesting topic and one that I I'd like to have some therapists on the show one day and not necessarily the happiness our even I Know a man a very good men who divorced and his daughters were in their thirties\nMid thirties when he divorced\nAnd he stayed with their mom in large measure to
