'cause they're making their keyboards and the Guardian's\nThe accordion tease out their role and literally some guys pouring a bunch of plastic beads into one end of this thing in fact one of their machines and even have a guy a truck pulled up\nWent down to ... mall just automatically fed this machine on the other end there were spitting out these plastic parts right\nNow you can do that and trying to do and you can do that America too and there's no labor involved right really know liberal very minimal labor involved well in that situation may be America's better okay maybe that's why the glide guys keep it in America because when it comes to commodities like plastic\nOr comic cameras to abs tiring [laughter]\nYou know one member of the people who said it was [noise] was made out of you know we didn't want us to plastic as we thought it was cheap food sales salary the\nWhole abs diary and that sounds expensive bicycle [laughter]\nLittle selling to boil selling seeker call your boss they gave me a starring everybody thinks of some high quality stuff including ...\nHowever cells go back to the point the point is if it's a machine that just got plastic beads and things are being split up near aside America's probably better I'll tell you what the labor so you just took away the Chinese advantage right hey you took away the costs because to cook it in God's succumbs to get down here\nAnd on top of all that on top of all that uh\nUh you know you know the the locations closer see it's probably shave there should be ... and see who are horrible they guy guys those they have a machine that runs twenty four hours\nOr does he got that ... not barcellos all day long right so I think that this summer the summer really is is what is my invention made out of what is my product made out of his it plastic\nI is it a machine automated thing well maybe America should invest in those machines by the way or the plastic I'm Out among that I've known intimately is this whole piano keys things\nSo I saw the guys in China may piano key this guy's in Germany make piano keys or to make piano keys were all using the same machine\nAnd by the way plastic as a commodity the same price everywhere there's no cheap or plastic in China or cheaper plastic in Germany or cheaper plastic in America these plastic things he's recycled we can do by recycle you could buy the best Irene a freshman you not recycle bottom line\nSome machine turns up his fellow at the bottom line to tell us go into a machine that melted down ... points out there and\nIt doesn't matter because the plastic is the same price and by the way when you know go she I don't think if you hire us to help you in the manufacturing don't think we're not on the phone yelling and screaming at the Chinese guys going seriously do the same plastic or it the machine you're using\nOkay so you got some cheaper labor but there's nobody touch and the thing so you better come out you know the understand what I'm saying so comes down to manpower really comes down to skill set of manpower right and the Chinese for years have had this advantage but it's changing\nHis changing the second thing China does which\nWhich you know a which I guess our current administration is pushing a vase subsidize what they're doing over there they're dumping All right let me explain dumping tip so we're seeing them in terms of the panel dumping thing I mean what happens is let's say I'm going I'm going to call a piano or Chinese piano factory\nAnd they missed it they make a black ebony beautiful grand piano alright what they would do in order to grab the U.S market and peel it from the American manufacturers\nThey would sell it over here under their cost\nYeah I remember those old dumping grounds\nAnd of course they were puppies guy old American guys out of business I mean Baldwin and world or in Kimble and all these guys and we can probably names and more they're struggling because these big companies in China with the government was but don't forget it's a it's a lot of cars communism over there it's not an entrepreneur ism in some form of it but the bottom line is they still control and\nThey were dumping it into our mark and they're doing with cars to that's called dumping so therefore the prices were cheaper artificially\nAnd they're also probably artificially manipulating their currency so those are the factors that I think the current administration fighting right now and here's the other thing\nWill they steal your patent\n... the bottom line is\nUsually know right now for some strange secret and that was happening right now is a trade secret you make NDA what they are there are there are some ... there's not always know but the companies I mean when it comes down to to glide guys and Joe cubs coaster boroughs nobody I mostly do guys don't take us in a respectful but nobody really cares about changing laws were not winning wars without right\nHowever there is a thing about cell phones and apple of a buddy of mine posted something I barely show the apple Mack was knocked off so well but he thought it was a Mac\nUntil he sat down to ... wait a minute about America at all\nSo they are copying technology so you have to worry about your patent protection and there'll be so scared of it I think I think I mean everybody as soon as they steal everything they don't they don't they just feeling this subject matters to the probably winning wars and stuff\nOr or something that important so that's number one number two comes down to the labor labor costs and number three it comes down to shipping so you've got to take all those into consideration whether you do in America for China\nThat's just my two cents worth of all the experience\nWe've had and billions of dollars of selling it so that is telling secret today and you learn a little bit about abs tiring to call it ... his they know you're being plastic that made it a lot of little abs got rid of the other hand so that's the selling secrets my cool and mention you have the next hundred million dollar right here you know you got to keep moving [noise]\nIs George story from coast to coast am and
