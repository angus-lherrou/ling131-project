I don't I don't think flake realize what he was doing by even this week let's go to um oh I promise to the finish a Janet ... ... you didn't quite get to your point go ahead\nYeah that was saying that it was absurd that she said she said hello mark judge when she saw him six weeks after the supplies that attack that he was involved in any any teenage girl woman what it\nIs very laid probably yelled at him or spin on it or something not say how long she was trying to say how uncomfortable and he was how was she so comfortable seeing somebody had been involved in that that was ridiculous thing besides ... unbelievable\nYeah I I think you guys have been you know looking ... yeah I mean you know you you can't go back to everything said but I Would have said this and I would have said that that is what I say we we got to be careful on this that she's not facing the same kind of inquisition in a sense that he is that you're looking at every little thing right\nTrying to find something although I must have been some of the ... Michel did such a bad job of she I mean you know like I said I think she when she was done they were going to go out for T. I. Travis in Chicago a lot of calls from Chicago travesty around with mark\nAnd mark how you doing good morning to you to\nA point I wanted to bring up that I ever been hearing all but one time on the judge senior bureau show we've all been led to believe that she has no all through your motive for doing this she's just doing it for the hurt specific duty and everything else but how come as you mentioned the fact that judge Kavanaugh's mom was a circuit judge\nWas involved in foreclosure proceedings against her parents in the nineties not too long after it's been ruled against them and they lost or oh\nYou're going to be black drawn every conservative talk show that there is and I don't hear ... when I was all very\nYeah but we're back to the story about she's not the one on a trial and she's not the one trying to be a Supreme Court justice\nSo in that sense I and you got to be careful look you know now I'm going to be trying to see Mitchell side the prosecutor side right\nThey they picked a woman in the first place because they didn't want to eleven men questioning her the fact that we've come to this point in the stage of America where you're the gender matters of the people questioning you just don't want the truth and you don't want the best people for a job\nThat you got to have someone what am I just read California just ... I think brown signed this then on the board of directors\nThey have to have a I don't want it to women for whatever you want enough force companies to have we women on the board why not just pick the best I've set for years if you could get me and this is obviously relevant nine conservative black women on the Supreme Court I'd be thrilled\nI don't care what their gender is why why have we gotten into this\nYou know it's not the world was thirty forty years ago companies should want to pick the best people but in California no you're mandated to have a certain number of women now so going back to my point to defend them they thought they had a woman they would look bad I mean Republicans were afraid of our own shuttled right\nThe courage is not there there's flake cause someone a costume wherever it was an elevator on the floors of the Senate or whatever\nAnd starts yelling at him he admits that was part of his decision to suggest that we have a another week of the stuff I mean we're we're as the courage Democrats would give them credit for one thing they circle the wagons and they fight for their own and they know the battle or in that's been the problem with the Republicans do we really know\nWhat we're up against for them this war this is their religion this is their God for many of them a lot of them probably do believe in God that's not my point\nI'm trying to say this is everything to them who gets on the Supreme Court because they've been using it to legislate\nAnd I understand why you're so unhappy a someone says something about the less than I Am maybe they dropped off waiting over an hour but let's go to Trisha in Denver, Colorado Colorado Tricia you're on with mark\nMark Hi Trisha under I think the that\nThey needed provable desirable\nAnd and our first mistake what's what the leftist spraying and our ... to it too old drinking behavior that ... ... even relevant get all we were still took Frank insurance that\nThere can be no further or denial

reasons President Trump is so enduring to so many people yeah it gets himself in trouble with his tweets\nPlease like the first person to really stick up for what he believes in any you can't push 'em down you know and cut them off\nA and he actually says what he means kept himself in trouble a lot of times but isn't that what makes them so enduring that well we've been crying out for instead of these mushy Republicans and and a little Collins of Maine and Murkowski of ah\nThe Alaska and I mentioned insurance just reminded me Ann Romney goes ahead and says I support this week to hit us
