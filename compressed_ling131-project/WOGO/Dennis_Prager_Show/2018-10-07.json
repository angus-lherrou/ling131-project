wise to bowl a tile and it's organic and as a compound at the video see\nSo what happened is I was not allowed to ship my all of a star none of the blue I couldn't shipped to California anymore because the concentration of my banana oil was too high\nHere's a little stretch for you so I have to start lowering\nThose concentrations wow right and a matter of fact to make my standard I'm over in California less affective but you know they had the rules so he's a kind of the tricks and things that you fall into when it comes to a a come comes to chemical here's here's one out of everybody can relate to\nHave you ever noticed that your dishwashing soap today kind of sucks [laughter] I really don't agree that the board you know what is the last day she's I I go through it or what do you do is you got a big thing of vinegar\nAnd she's never had to have every second dishwasher she's she's taking the vinegar bottles you throw it in the minister are showing there's got to get in there as well because all the hard water sparsely water spots on our stuff they're more you know and then she goes it doesn't clean anymore and she's right\nIt doesn't clean anymore because a couple of years ago they banned phosphates tonight strayed from our dishwashing alright and no one noticed because you know there is washing some companies were coming up standing on their soap operas or our principal ingredients of our dishwashing soap is no longer allowed\nBy the way it was a good thing they banned it can spots where it's an actress are destroying the environment\nHowever kept ... really clean and sober dishwashing soap companies did which I really kind of surprised where they started coming up with is about all this in the one change their name from one to another right my brother was that one could was cold I Can't remember the guy is now it's called vanish\nThe whole name change federal our rebranded them and now they started doing tricks like who look to different soaps ones wait one little blue and the little tablets\nThey started distracting us with different marketing ideas and packaging ideas but the truth was made it's not their fault the truth was that the the the principle of greens have changed and you're so doesn't clean anymore\nAutumn line and why that happened is because the chemicals in formulas all these restricted that they're being changed and and for good reason I mean I mean we probably don't need to kill the environment because we want clean dishes\nI don't know washing dishes may wash your own dishes you don't need to have all that and find a way the phosphate the nitrate is what they were doing and the dishwashing stuff 'cause I'm a chemist and helped sheet the water off okay okay All right actually you\nKnow you don't need a lot of dangerous chemicals to wash dishes you need a little Saudi Laurel sulfate or those soap and you know and that's why people do it in this thing with a little you know squeezing hope\nYou don't need that basically pretty in that you need you know basically it's even get the plan derivative type soaps that aren't very toxic to the environment that's why these companies like method and these guys have all come out even are still has not toxic\nSo what happens is uh you know they have a um a thank you I was finished don't Tony just finished brand became van or something then I Can't remember they change the press\nSo you don't need a lot of toxic chemicals in Oakland dishes the trouble is in a dishwasher right when it's extreme heat and extreme stuff you've got some issues because the water evaporates really quickly on what happens is the water spots but they are because they want to heat that thing get a dry five so what happens is your dishes\nHave water spots on them that they didn't have before an alternative to that if you want cleaner dishes cancelled the drying function and let the mayor dry no trouble with that in our house you couldn't do that because between washing cycles\nAre we would have a lot of dirty dishes because if we allow the Arabs they are dry we would have two or three loads into sink before the thing dry so that the little little little a sort of chemistry lesson for your dishwashing so then the area that it's really chemical dangerous in your house is you're you're washing machines soap is for your for your laundry yeah\nThere's been a lot of sort of controversy about these cards and stuff kids are eating what was that trend Tony that was your generation what why was your generation swallowing dishwashing so washing machines so they don't want why were you guys doing that\nDon't put that on me who have I don't know I they were younger than me I can tell you ALS not ALS not digesting dishwasher washing machines so back to and so what do you mean swallow in river water and rocks\nOr yeah yeah I don't know what he says while the river rock there's a lot of other kids were all all all sorts of hide\nPot challenged the tide part challenge\nWhy isn't it like ours to the challenge like what's wrong with these kids I was surprised he didn't try to get in on it when you're out washing machine all I Know\nIs I really believe in I guess that's what they called natural selection Darwin's evolution that we just kill themselves off all they do so so yeah there was a kind of controversy about so because the washing the washing machine or your your your clothing so\nHas a lot of that stuff in it to 'em you know so and this does is a ... and so I always tell people try to avoid certain things\nAnd if you're an inventor and entrepreneur selling these things it kind of have to stay on top of my goodness gracious as a change there's always changes on you as the business that we're in and how do you keep on top of it a while there is a you can just Google it right you can just Google that sort of thing that uh you can Google the material safety data\nSheets people and and I'm just keep on top of the regulations because these chemicals do change for the good you know I I Know it'll be easier to sell more dishwashing soap and water sheet it off but you know the animals are dying and the trees are dying and our planet Stein we might want to just you know slow down and Don drier dishes a little longer\nThat's a little less selling secrets in the chemicals in formula they really
