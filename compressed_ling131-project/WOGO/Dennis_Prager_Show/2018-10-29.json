Hillary below the in the lord ... speaking about the immigration care of him how come they never in the lord ... speaking about abortion\nSecondly actively walking up to separate children from their parents order why is it that they never talk about the separation of those innocent children from their parents and their families as a result of the\nWealth course 'cause they they don't want to admit that it's a viable baby inside the totally on the other side craziness and here's someone I think wants to challenge me let's go to Ben in Columbus ohio bend you're on was mark\nYeah I guess my question would be I mean it's a great can is issues about safety I mean how many illegal immigrants and you know that as a reporter who have committed in that\nYou're you're not you're not something you can also on debt on marriage and\nCommitted to talking on the air talking about rescuing for these immigrants whose kill more people\nOkay so now respond to so and I'm going to you gave me a great segue 'cause I Want to get his whole it illegal immigration debate\nIt doesn't matter if they committed mass shootings they murdered innocent Americans so it's like the argument that people make and I was going to make this roller over there and some of the others and I don't even think it's true the percentage of illegals or he won't admit their legal she calls them undocumented who commit crimes or even less\nThan an American native born Americans so what if they commit one crime in the here legally one murder like Cape Stein leach and we go on and on then that's one that wouldn't have been committed if they weren't allowed to enter the country\nThat has a crazy argument less opposed to trying to think of President Obama will do set up a straw dummy it doesn't matter\nFrom the percentages of same they shouldn't be here ... those people would be alive like that girl can't think of her name in Iowa was her name but musician resources\nAre better spent on these\nAnd shouldn't be here who are committing crimes rather than people who are here legally committed the crime\nYou spend the resources on anybody who commit crimes yeah Molly tip it's what's her name was put up with all due respect band it's a phony argument so maybe they didn't do it you know a mass shooting what what is your point there\nYeah it doesn't make any sense they shouldn't be here and the first place and I said it gave me a great segue but I Want to go to turn in oak Claire Wisconsin tournaments you're on was marked\nYes turtle bomb on there and help on earth along praising and cutting down Trump Trump it's been in ... not only on helping our country but other countries who just want them to be able to have their own culture and we can have our culture\nNow we see what Obama can't when that Sony town came out on all that that freedom of speech put that movie and I liked that movie I even laugh at that movie and really\nI Would like to kill Kim Jong il All right so then he would like them to kill him John earning Kim John and said why do they want to kill me Trump went in as a totally different way you can write to him he realizes\nThat Kim genre one wants to do right about his background any take that into consideration now what do we have we have the south Korean president who are Catholic [noise] taking a letter to poke a friend\nTo come over and visit North Korean peninsula we no longer have that boy missile that came at Hawaii and I met so finally worked and shot it back he's not wrapping\nMissiles into their place near Japan are flying over it or threatening to attack on Guam\nAnd that's the only one thing he's gotten in other countries and and the stuff that he had done in our country to point eight per cent raise and Social Security this year for all people on Social Security\nYeah he's done he's done a lot there's no doubt about that and they don't want to acknowledge that in any way let's go to Jerry in uh San jose jury you're on was mark\nCan I can\nOkay great my point is when a President Trump has asked for someone to get rough stop whatever it's somebody talking squabble and it stopped particular person but what appalls me is that democratic leaders would say\nKick everybody be on civil to everybody and I think that's the point that the American if you're like oh because if there's any disruptor he should be taken care of us
