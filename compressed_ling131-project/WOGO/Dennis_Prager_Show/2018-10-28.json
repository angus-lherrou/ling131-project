these going Soviet send us some uh pass it along to the buyers up there\nAnd get over to the buyers that Michael gadgets and see if we can promote some business up there just driving drunk some some up for you yeah let me ask you a question about the price because I I Want to talk about pricing a little bit 'cause I find fourteen Ninety nine an awkward price you know to me\nSo I mean I see your point because if you go to twenty bucks or are you getting enough for twenty dollars that's the question right\nAnd so so um how long have you come up with the fourteen Ninety nine price how did you get there\nRight now I mean I mean I\nOkay [laughter] like when I hear your\nPlan everything in the world and they cut out\nAll right so can I give you a little picture advice you got a perfect you've gotta you've gotta perfect what I call it doubled drop a perfect doubled dropped there for example here's how the devil drop works double job is when you give somebody to things to things that perhaps close the deal for example\nWatch that does sound better it's Nineteen Ninety nine\nAnd ... have your son your ... going to sound fantastic what the sound and better and today only Nineteen Ninety nine but wait there's more if you act right now we're going to give you a second sound burger that's right for free you don't get one sound better you get two of them had to hang on we're not done yet on top of that we're going to throw in\nFree shipping and handling that buy one get one\nFree shipping and handling all\nFor Nineteen Ninety nine by now see what I did there that was a double drop high\nPitched the first one I gave the benefits I don't sell the two together I sell only one\nThat I Try to convince you that Nineteen Ninety nine is a great deal for the one of them and then what I Do is I Do a double drop\nSo then I throw a second one in for free and then I go to a free shipping and handling them there there's your double drop and last energy that'll give you a positive stuff and it sounds a lot more exciting than to for Nineteen Ninety nine fourteen Ninety nine in fact when you presented it to me I didn't even think I didn't realize there was the second one in the right so\nA double drop on a pitcher I wouldn't budge from Nineteen Ninety nine or ... it's an awkward price the ... you know if you open your wallet right now in your pocket the most to calm in the U.S bills in a wallet today right\nIs it twenty dollar bill and its single that's it\nFinds intends are hard to find twenty dollar bills in singles are the most common item and if you're gonna go for a twenty dollar bill take the twenty dollar bill don't give change because of his you know at least Fifteen Ninety nine sixty Ninety nine Seventeen that it just rains right what do I do with my change our throat mastery of my car that's where the change goes right I I\nI don't even put it in my pocket it's not even worth putting in my pocket and says this is a lot of twenty you know it's not in my pocket it's not a single where I can go buy a few things\nSo that's why I always say twenty dollars is a great price a double drops a great way to do it and you've got it and let me tell you something but I like your item I really do it's going to give some up for me angry what for me to sums up brawls outcomes I didn't even think you've got a great product in fact I think it might not too many

I have my address on it but there were no markings\nI opened it that's conversion I opened it\nRight the other males all the fancy colors and graphic through that I didn't even look at it I throw straight to the trash can or they they they they could have been sending me a hundred million dollars and I would have ignored it when the gossip but if I'm\nA letter with my name on it you know not to official looking kind of personal looking and that's the best converter right now snail mail apparently is converting really well for the money you spend\nThe money you receive so knowing your audience so so Andrew how do you think you can get some advice or how ... what are good ways to learn to know who your audience is\nAll that together well obviously you're going to first of all think about who's going to use your product right that would be the number one thing\nThe demographic demographic right ... that's a hard question you know because you know we asking vendors that who's your demographic\nAnd they gave me these really general answers that demographic answers not different than deciding what TV station what cable station on Internet platform to advertise on the same thing knowing your demographic is really important and I am so surprised\nThat people don't know their demographic biggest demographic is the very filter on how we promote our products right so you should really spent some time learning about the demographic\nI was just going to say about when we used to when we used to sell pianos we used to have at the shows and it was like we are pitching\nBut it and the problem the thing there is that you have to filter out the people so that are interested in the product so see that that a little bit more difficult so what we learned to do is qualified well we call the qualifications so we asked questions\nThe question would be like oh this isn't that great and then of course if you get it yeah it looks great perfect this step number one number two oh does anybody play piano in your family\nNo not yet but we're thinking about oh great there's one step number three then you've started filtering down to where you want and that then you started filtering down and then when you ask the question so can you take it home today and then you'll get a yes because you've now filtered down to only one question and the one question would be as to buy it\nSo there's a technique that goes back to the Nineteen nineties you know the people on the Internet making the most money today against what they're doing click funnels bottle marketing right to heard about that it's a very same thing when it years ago and right\nExcept that it on the Internet so people are saying to me like I Know all you guys have a website so you guys have Web sites\nAnd they're telling me that landing pages funneled landing pages are convert better than ... did you know that on there that's kind of interesting isn't it so you should learn how to filter your audience kind of the way we did on the ... war\nBut on the Internet you can do it very many ways a survey monkey you can do it had run surveys that way to ... as an just that filter filter filter filtering then after the audience that you think you filtered well enough with the demographic it's been filtered out\nClicked photos if you look at click funnels all kinds of stuff going on a cook finals right now there's certain Google Search the word click funnels and learn how to apply that to your business\nAnd really what that is because it's filter your filtering filtering filtering so you've got the big audience and you keep bringing it down to where the value is right here and that's where you spend the money on the value proposition as opposed to the general audience so the very same technique that we used to use years ago\nA and you know when when you think about it the television is a big advertising filter\nAnd they've been using it for years we were using it to buy qualification anybody has done some sales training always understand qualifying questions or your filter and on the Internet you have to apply the very same filter and that's what I think I advocate for click finals without some success but by\nAnd people are telling me that single page landing pages\nConvert better than websites now the difference on our website is\nYou have this you have home you have contact you have or more about it in my ... more more products all authors in up so look at all the funny pictures so you get distracted where a single landing page is very focused on one thing and they convert better\nAnd it's like it's like saying like having an ice cream shop and the guy has a hundred and fifty different flavors so people walk in there and they're like ah\nYeah I was in a quiet if he only had three right he would sell them right away right right\nIn fact in fact one of these techniques we use all the time and our promotion is good better best right at old technique is still works today good better best Dr I'll never forget\nNever forgot one time we were selling pianos and with a guy walked in the shop and of course we will take them to the cheapest piano because we thought we should do\nSo I started taking the most expensive beyond the poor guy with three kids coming there and what the wife and I go on a grand piano as well that's fantastic how much is that was the only twenty five thousand dollars you know what do you want somebody must be grumpy out it was only a ten thousand or what but here that are protected by the time I got the three or four thousand dollar when the guys like\n... ... they lost sure easier to come down and it has to go up living in a couple of ... makes you try to promote and sell your product hero Michael inventions\nI Hope you took away some stuff from that whether you have a hardware store or whether you're\nSelling gadgets or whether you're running a business or you're a lawyer or you're an inventor\nAlways filthy your audience know your audience and focused on the conversion right 'cause that's where you blow your brains are financially that's that's where you really have to focus on getting the best bang for your buck right\nAnd that's how you know I tell you the little selling techniques for you\nAnd remember guys if you're a washing the program you want to get on to our program and you're in intervene or
