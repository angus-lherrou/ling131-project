hello my friend's\nDennis ... here speaking to another great a professor at Hillsdale and by the way it has no connection to the fact that the hills there was a major sponsor here I just I'm totally open with you about when things are related\nI have professors from all over the place or you just happens to have written important book and he's a lot of fun Bradley ...\nThe book is in defense of Andrew Jackson but since I mentioned that you should go to Craig or for Hillsdale and that's where you'll learn about this remarkable college they're not asking for money they just want you to know about their courses in about them prime is an about their students and so on trigger for Hillsdale\nAnyway back to you professor and we're talking about his book in defense of Andrew Jackson\nSeat where we're not allowed any longer and this is I I lay totally at the feet of the left we're not allowed to have any moral\nNuances it's everybody basically who lived before us was uh in various states of sin and the left today is the purest of the humans that has ever left that is really how they look at themselves I promise you folks I'm not in any way exaggerating\nAnd so all of these ... the founders were were were worthless because they had slaves and uh you just go down the roster\nBuddy ... the the Indian issue was a very very complex one\nAnd there were there were terrible things done to Indians Indians have terrible things to others including blacks who may enslaved including other Indian two million slaves and torture was for some tribes routine so ... it's\nAnd torture was for some tribes routine\nSo it's so there's no is no easy answer to this problem Andrew Jackson made his reputation aside from the war of Eighteen twelve in finding a Indians\nAnd uh he adopted an Indian child now so I just reviewing what we've said do you recall the point that you were making were should move on\nYou know actually thinks then as soon as I Would love to jump right back in the court yes\nWas it of course I Am I Am just didn't really go commercial but the point I wanted to make was dead at the time Jackson was actually considered as a moderate on the issue of American indian some people that really\nReally went after him for being as they would have called it an American Indian water\nAnd the reason was because as president as he's really cutting costs cutting the budget which he did very effectively he also was laying out tons of money for the removal of the Indians and put their resettled in West there were a lot of people thought why is Jackson spending\nMoney of white people so that read people could settle in these great areas on the great plains\nI it was really sought after land so jak than if it's so different from the day and as you say we have no moral knew what the third week of left as a ... at the time it was a really complicated issue in Jackson was very worried without question he was worried that\nThe whites and blacks would have very very high procreate of birth rates that they were just going to destroy the Indian culture simply by surrounding the male populating them so removal to the western territories was a way to actually protect the Indian cultures that we used to be thought now the again the execution of it was horrible\nBut his intention I think was generally a good one [noise]\nThat that's fascinating and that's one of the book is an important book now you don't only defend him on the Indian issue you have a general defense of Andrew Jackson\nYou know it's one of the things I've found so I think we all know that and it's true that Jackson was an incredibly violent man there's just no way around that in every way he was but he also had really certain rules\nSo that violence never ever can be applied to women or children that was the same ... actually for blacks as well as for Indians in white he had a deep respect strangely enough or beautiful enough yet a strange interesting respected women are buried deep respect\nTo the point actually he's almost ... times and he treats again Indian women as well as black woman and white wearing very very well but\nThe other thing I found about him so he's got this violence but he's got this ethic that's really interesting but I also found that has been you know counter so many current politicians the guy was just\nUnbelievably honest in everything he did and you know I think it would've killed his soul she would have done something that would have been misleading or dishonest\nThat that's how much of a stickler was about living out this deep deep profound honesty and integrity it's really quite stunning\nHow did he get the I I ... how did he get his a bullet wound\nOh well so he had a couple of getting quite a few good things in a number of Jules\nBut he had been a preteen and then it seems as a Thirteen year old he thought in the American revolution along with his brother and they had actually been captured in Jackson during imprisonment and mouth
