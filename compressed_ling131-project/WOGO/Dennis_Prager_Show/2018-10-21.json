around this guy's this guy is going door to door Florida Florida's pounding the pavement in these selling tops the thing I apparently he's in his car right now he's going door to door probably do the hardware stores now\nNow I I Know because I've done this before I got my career started when we were literally go when I was in Canada so we weren't going ace hardware stores but we're going to home hardware stores the same sort of independent a deal up there\nAnd the Canadian tire stores and we were around the ... there and we were going to\nThe old sellers and Hudson's bay company and we were in there I was I've done the parking lot thing we do trade shows all the time but it you know one year but he's a hundred trade shows in a single year teams of people out there and that's how we got our started so tell everybody what is it like to be an entrepreneur\nHustling grinding the pavement so tell me your typical day as you go up there and promote the convention\nIt's ... you just set it up [laughter] hardware stores you go and I mean you know what I'm saying is you got to market yourself shameless you got to go with you I mean don't be afraid to have somebody tell you know a regular afraid that\nThen then then you're just you might as well stay home but I mean I have literally set up in parking lots and up to the owners of the store and they let me set up in a parking lot or I you know go to the like I said the hardware shows and set up and then when the people come by the ... you don't let them walk by you you bring them in\nAnd do you got to hustle and you because this is your only opportunity\nYou got one chance to test with a U.S if you fail you're selling yourself but you gotta get up and and not be afraid to work\nOur rights and not be afraid of work hospitals shamelessly you heard those two key things there that's what we're learning about are there still hospitals shamelessly that's actually a very good term 'cause it's exactly what we do um so are you in any major retailers\nAre we are in a major retailers and we're going into the um we're getting ready to go in a big rock sports and that's going to put us in Bangor Iraq sport that is the largest uh independence sporting goods distributors across the nation and we're getting ready to go into a\nMass pro so I I got I got some tips for a little to fry right um\nSo Mike I'm associate producer Michael do vote a stop to this thing they vote at my cool inventions dot com put stops to sing dot com so you can buy the product up there for\nSo to speak with producer might get back there so I didn't tell you something I think one of the ways to get into ... one of the way 'cause we did we have to do it ourselves we have a outdoor political the survival steal or we saw the I don't know how many of those things my career got started with survival steel\nAnd we used to go to the cooking bullet shows right I mean what I call by hooking bullet the outdoor shows a sportsman shows right um the sports shows for example the most famous one we used to go there was up in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania you guys are taught you've heard me up to\nHave you ever they're smart I ever done that shows now I have not had to do that show I'm we're working on it you got to do that show the\nTwo thousand nine hundred thousand hundreds fishers gatherers outdoorsman show up an outdoorsman would\nPay attention to those products like slap in the face but we have to have regular so we used to go up there and we can sell fifty grand in cash in ten days right and we spent a couple of granted the booth I Know the booth costs as scarier\nBut I'll tell you something that's your audience that's your audience right there are ... and then you and you want to go up there ... and there's a whole the whole circuit of them we used to start over in Philadelphia and then we used to go to Pittsburgh that we do Harrisburg if you just focus on the northeast\nThere's like a whole line of the Long Island in Nassau County up there's parts of the show and the gal Newark ... every weekend you do a sportsmanship and we could do well over a million dollars\nBy hostile um the pavement like that and your product\nOr is is like that I think it's the demographic I think your demographic I Know you're trying to focus on I mean the first ... this this reminds me of bird species that quite frankly frankly\nAnd bart's be same color scheme is Burt speak verse bees was you know people just like yourself hustle and the payment and they got bought out that serious money here they're very your whole line of products\nAnd and they they were the primary threat first was truck stops uh-huh seriously truck stops and now they're in every single retailer I'm going to take a little break coming up after the break we're going to continue the conversation with my folks and stop to think we're gonna talk about hustling and grinding the pavement we're talking about they're promoting your product promoting your business shamelessly\nI got to tell you something I'm with this guy is exactly how we used to do with\nAbsolutely hate Muslims [laughter] we had a gardening product we're in front of the gardening center is every single Sunday every single Saturday all through may June and July British talk about ... going to promote your business in today's world of the Internet and how do you get that product out there so a big brand will pay attention to you or retailer paying attention to you\nTo stick around after the break we're going to take a little buzz pay some bills and we come back talk to stop this thing mountains [noise]\nBroadcasting to over a thousand radio stations juicy on programming is in all of the largest market did you see an advertising career could be the business opportunity you been waiting for companies need hardworking representative of just like you to handle their needs while you are a residual income which can last for years\nCompanies are

one you put in your signature wind have your signature that's the one you when somebody wants to know what the product is don't give them a description because no one reads that I have a hundred a ... ... email us right now I\nNever read them I guess if I don't have the bandwidth for I Am out of time every serious marketing person that you meet is out of time but we don't it's not money we need we need time so if you're going to get somebody's attention is that twenty second tweak the you're going to get their attention with that important\nAnd that's just the first step\nThe big step is to do transaction will be like TV commercials pre rules for examples watching CBS ... NBC hey guys I saw on your TV show NBC called the manifest what a great show that is\nBut as I'm watching the manifest there is going to show yeah they go for it I guess the lead from Jamaica and they write five years later yeah [laughter] like a rally never left the planes yeah so anyway but I saw the ... as I was watching it on NBC dot com map and and what I saw was the twenty second that they do commercials in a commercial break but only one minute of them\nSo I think that is three twenty second commercials sometimes a little longer than a minute especially when it gets to the climax of the undergo two minutes or something but if you watch the commercials are thirty seconds long twenty seconds long\nReally short my son Peter he's up in ah in New York City he's a ... analyst for digital senior executive up there and he's been telling me for a couple of years now that you've got to get into this pre roe market pre rules for the money is you know why 'cause it's cheap it's really cheap so inexpensive today\nThat the big companies like American Express and sip it and big fortune five hundred companies was throwing millions of dollars on it because it pays out why does it pay up it's just cheap media\nThat's the key what I Want to teach you is is is\nPushing at first okay because it pays the bills gets you out there gets your pitch honed gets your grind done and the daily grind you hear the image onto that all the time\nYou're grinding you're learning but then you've got to cross over to poll marketing the polling marketing is transactional video period I don't care whether it but he says it's not Amazon it's not that in fact I think Amazon is evil evil giant ... of the others other around about that some other time\nHowever what I Need you to do is create a market pull it into the market and you do that with a TV commercial you do that with digital commercial you do that with digital advertising you do that with pre roll all that bundles into media which are hunting for cheap media\nNothing's changed in the last Twenty years nothing why did infomercials work back then why do crazy glue work because the media was cheap they were giving away for nothing\nRight they were they were turning the TV's off for twelve hours at night I'm old enough to remember the test pattern that there's all at the national anthem last night just hours so they ... somebody came along and said I don't think that media not cheap I'll give you ten cents for them to of course the TV companies figured out that both my goodness they're making money I'm not going to let our\nJob however all that happened in the last Twenty years his the media migrated from place to place\nRight now on the Internet right now it's it's not I'm not in the funding from the Internet anymore it's pre role it's those twenty seconds he watched it on YouTube is this one is that because you're watching it on Netflix or Hulu says twenty seconds on the CBS dot com at those three rules are the cheapest meaty out there right now\nAnd that's why people chasing it\nTransactional video guys and Mike I Want to tell you that you need to go into pull market alive shopping is pull marketing it's it's it's poor marketing to affect life shopping in retail there's no connection by the way people think there is but there's not\nI I'm a big mistake I ever made is always think that by going on to a system by going on to even by going on to Cuba is the I'm going to get some retail pull on it you never do\nIt's not connected people make the mistake it's connected but it's not connected right so that's another piece of advice I give you however it's not bad getting those five thousand unit orders that oh I'm Sorry I was nine orders like how it helps pay the bill to your retail push right\nSo those are the kinds of things I Want to teach I always take the segment to try to teach people something and that's what I've learned so were you telling of paying attention to the details it's even more simple than that\nThe central part is\nCheap media Oh absolutely I Wonder what's what's the cheapest media you can pay right now it's TV commercials and digital pre roles that's it there in a nutshell I just told you that's the secret puts it costs to get in there not that much\nPre role as a couple of grant a it's a it's you know and TV commercials that twenty to thirty grand because he got to get out there and you got to create a name for some distance here potential I mean it's something I give this a seven on ten\nRight this is kind of got books be feel to it you create if you refer went up feathers with this thing someone's going to buy our oil right here\nAnd that's what you want one last thing I'll teach everybody before we go actually will stick around for the fourth one I got I got a hold on hold for the fourth one too [laughter] I I Am on there and you also we're going to sell something or what am I but we'll keep talking\nSo he created enough attention to this thing and he starts thinking shelf space office competitors his competitors are buying just that simple and by the way you should also sell your inventions never get into a business\nThat you don't know how you're going to exit from if somebody walks up to me right now is is what do you want from Michael inventions what do you want for my business I have the number who took my time it's always there I think about it all the time\nAlways know your exit strategy are not going to ask you a question if I wrote you a check for this right now how much is it for a million dollars four million dollars what'd you
