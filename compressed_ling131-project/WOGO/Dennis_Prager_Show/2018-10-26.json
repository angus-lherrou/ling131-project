obviously that's fine though\nThere's nothing wrong with that it doesn't mean that others were bad or that you hate others that's that's that's what you learn in graduate school but it's not true in part because you did learn to graduate school\nSo I if I if you if you celebrate being French then you're not celebrating are being Paraguay him as that is correct or American that's fine I I think it's great you celebrate being French that's good\nSo long as I mean if someone's there aren't obviously immoral components to your celebration but there'll be true but anything\nBut if you're a human
