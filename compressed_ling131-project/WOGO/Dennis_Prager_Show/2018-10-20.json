of this old house in today in the final day of production we're right here and actually in the garage out of it is a lot nicer than that sounds surrounded by the cameras and the sauce to bring you the story of a very ... just completed\nBy the spectacular team at this old house now if you're not familiar with this area it's a very unique place with a lot of history Jamestown Rhode Island\nIs a coastal town it's it's just across the Narragansett Bay from Newport which is home to many many famous mansions\nBut if it didn't happen to be named Vanderbilt door after Duke you may have decided to build a more modest cottage right here in Jamestown and many of these houses do from the late Eighteen hundreds and early Nineteen hundreds one summer visitors\nBuilt them to enjoy the ocean breeze isn't the Sandy beaches but today many of those dwellings remain on insulin\nAnd since they were originally built just for the summer season there was really no need for inflation back then and that's what brings us to this old house which\nNo need for insulation back then and that's what brings us to this old house which was rebuilt to increase energy efficiency but keep the old charm now to kick things off I'm joined by this old house any contractor Richard drifted we welcome Richard thanks so much\nSir Richard when we say that the goal was to make this home energy efficient we're talking like insanely energy efficient here because the plan was to make this a net zero house over those are not familiar with ... zeroes kind of explain that there's a bunch of components to\nOne is to make it insulated really well to make it incredibly tight and so we did that with our thirty walls and are forty ceilings and [noise] and we made it\nTight tight tight and then on top of it we\nWe did another thing called aero barrier to make sure that we\nWe controlled infiltration unbelievably I'll get back to the minute right so you got to make the place where the type then you've got to be able to make some electricity so we put\nEighteen solar panels on this brilliantly designed garage which just is behind the building away so nobody sees it it's perfect angle so it becomes this terrific collector for us and so we could make about five kilowatts of electricity so\nWe can make electricity were super tight we can make electricity in the last piece to have a really efficient heating and cooling and ventilation system which we we did a and then some and I'll tell you that in just a second so the combination of those three pieces is that when the sun is out right\nWe make electricity and we spend the meter backwards back to the utility and then when it's not out at night or and cloudy days we use electricity as we need to for heating and cooling and running the building\nEssentially made all the energy that it needed now to do that you need to rely on a lot of systems were one of which was the installations we'll talk to me about the insulation that made it possible here\nYou know as you said this was a summer cottage are designed a\nYou know in the Nineteen twenties or so where you had some structural framing members that were only geared to support you know the roof load itself right now today's standards with the insulation in the energy codes we've got to make room for insulation or\nAnything like that does not even a\nSo we had to do a combination of insulated from the inside with super high a fish and stuff like\nClothes so a spray foam right then we also had to insulate on the exterior of the building so we added to the outside just as much as we added to the inside because we didn't have all room on the inside right now they advantage to to adding to the outside is that you create that thermal barrier\nAround the the framing members which are much more conducted transfer heat also\nSo that was a critical part of this project now to the inside the finish I tend to just walk through the house earlier just amazing carpentry in this job you guys that are really terrific uh works here with all the detail in the trims and she owns and stuff to talk about not\nWell uh I give credit to the architect on powers who are really just bought about every space in the house and took advantage of his expertise and the design world and and really created a masterful\nA depiction of of water cottage built in you know cozy atmosphere would be in a you know all we did was follow his lead and not and execute um but I I give credit to him he he took advantage of every single corner in the house\nLos Altos are good partnership and unusual for you to have the architect is the home or your children's wipe as the designer\nYeah well it was it was really a little bit intimidating to start with because um I you know held to a little bit of a higher standard has left us through it it really turned out to be a really mutual relationship you know we collaborated on a lot of things Don wasn't a\nSo you know our meals are already you know right we were able to exchange ideas and um\nThey were right down the road so it eliminated a third party and the middle so it really ... really did work out\nWell and but as you say communication really is key now the exterior of this home and a lot of work done landscape you hit a landscape architect helping with that but ah you had to organize that part of the construction as well what was the challenge\nWell the challenge was a it was a short period of time where we had to make a lot of things happen and we had three different porches which uh\nYou know cascaded down into the hearts gate\nAnd then we had a really extensive landscape plan\nYou know it caught me by a little bit by surprise but when they started bringing the trees and the plants and I was amazed at how many plant things we ended up having and then they the landscape architect Tom Ryan did just a wonderful job that segment in different areas around the yard which are all\nMeaningful and well planned in a you know it it it came together\nCan't wait to see it rollout chefs winter the builder on this project thanks so much for stopping by the money pit that was my pleasure you can follow

five years is general contractor Tommy soda you just keep getting younger don't\nYou don't yeah [laughter] well almost thirty five years there wow five thirty six years I mean yeah it's amazing I hear and I'm Down in the first few years [laughter]\nWay played hard to get I ... well maybe that's it that way and turn it down because I work for my dad we would just do my dad he didn't want any part of the details anyway but now we're too busy she already exactly\nTV stuff so I Want to talk with you first about the fact that a lot of the construction here was pre fabricated and I think when people think prefab a factory built they think well maybe it's not as good as what you could do my hand but that's not really the case here and ... you weren't just simply to things that you did hear that were this fascinating to me\nThe foundation first she said oh you can make everything in the house but you can't make the foundation now you guys actually got a foundation three hundred miles away and brought here they bring in ... well pre cast\nFoundation it insulated it and it has a concrete reinforced steel reinforced studying it insulated so there's no thermal break in that\nSteel reinforced studying it insulated so there's no thermal break in that in that position and the studs a pre drilled for the electrician to run his wires through and it's a fast efficient way to put a foundation and that's basically waterproof the same time\nWhile in the building that we're in right now this is actually the garage that it probably the nicest girl jak you've ever seen right but this was back to rebuild as well as it always right this is a pre cut building well you\nPut it together everything's caught on a on a CNC so yeah so you know what's going to fit exactly right but the puzzle together and you've got a beautiful barn that looks like it was built onsite\nNow the challenge on this property was building at the net zero which means that basically has to be so tight so well insulated and uh so perfectly heated that essentially makes all the energy needs to operate that involved a lot of different types of insulation or want to ask you about that because I I think it's unusual to see\nSpray foam used to different types of Spring Hill open and close when it closed so and then you had sold ...\nIn which a actually I Love that isolation I mean I think of it it's it's basically rock ... molten rock and and and you know you it's an right insulation for sounded need for insulation and its water resistant well you know if it gets wet it's going to dry out\nNow you guys use a technique cold warm blankets on the exterior walls what does that mean well\nThat's where you take the insulation\nThe the stone will insulate or you can also use rigid form and you apply it to the exterior surface of the building so you frame the building in this case we had the old building we had to deal with the conventional walls right those will spray foam on the outside of the sheeting you have to put a thermal barrier\nBecause you have to worry about the thermal bridging of the structure when you when it meets that different installations so in other words it could be some transfer a different temperature\nFrom the actual study and so you got to worry about condensation forming on the inside of the outside insulation is that makes sense is that what it does enter they'll sandwich right so in other words you're\nPutting something like a um it's it's called like a house wrap that you put on before you put your installation is like arranged screen Jill if any any condensation should occur in between that insulation it will run down and not damage that she\nWas actually has to be completely storm only separated ... ... yeah yeah it's almost like when you're building sounded the buildings you put separate walls and never touch the same idea here right now which are firmly separating everything's good than inflation ... exactly right yeah that's the trick\nNow you also had to install solar right which is on this building and you also have a beautiful wouldn't shingle roof here now which single roof if they're not done right and I've seen an awful lot and I know you have to they write like crazy say right\nFast if they're not you you have to ... you have to think of that ... uh which single today is not like ... it was say fifty two hundred years ago right the wood that you get\nFrom lumber is really farmed\nTrees younger trees because all the big old tight reign trees are gone so now the wood will absorb moisture and so on down the line so what you would do years ago you would have what is called skipped sheeting right basically it's like strapping a roof with\nSpacing between it so the air could get underneath the roof shingles and dry and from underneath and from the son of\nA wood roof is like a wooden boat it has to get saturated with water as well tied to the joint and then it becomes waterproof\nThe shingle itself is actually ... and if it's laying on cheating without any air air it it runs from the under some help out yeah so you have to put some type of a breather", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Dennis Prager
