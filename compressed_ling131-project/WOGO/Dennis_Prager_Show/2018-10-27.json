that's nuts\nI Know I messed up but\nBut I'd like to be paid for my mistakes then okay [laughter]\nWell now let's call it in full swing you might be finding that between all that patio furniture and lawn mowers an outdoor equipment and anything else you've got for the warm weather Steve and you're running a real tight and outside storage shed can be a great solution and also again project our project\nBut before you began that there are four important things you have to can hitter and we've got the chips in today's ... project presented advisor dot com\nNow first the average cost to build a shit is a pretty wide range we're talking about between eight hundred and four grand it depends on the troops to choose whether you're going to build yourself or harm or pro but what do you decide to the white or not there are several basic questions you need to ask you something before you start shopping\nFirst of all do you need a permanent I think a lot of people forget and thanks to my house and I can do whatever I Want and I'm going to do their thing or I'm going to put up a fan\nYou can't always just go and do that you have\nTo check your local building called the first to determine if you need a permit to build a shed on your property now you don't want to find out after you finished the project that it's got to come down because it violated some building code orange zoning code I mean that's the last thing you want to do it and that's a bunch of money and then have to take it all down and then do it again\nNow the other big thing you've got to think about is what does your ... and what do you want it to be you know do you need something simple and you know primarily for jets business needs putting things in there and not making a cute or any other functions or do you want something get hurt in\nThere are so many different styles and size is out there that you really need to evaluate your home and your property and how you're going to use that you can determine the best style from what your sheds going to be\nAnd your property and how you're going to use that ... you can determine the style from what you're going to be\nYeah and part of that as a society where the shed is going to go I mean depending on the size of your property you get a lot of different options for the placement that shit now folks very commonly might put it close to the house which makes running power in ... or\nSometimes folks will talk it sort of to the side or the back of the property so that it's less obvious but put some thought into that because you're gonna be going back and forth a lot and you don't want to regret that decision\nAnd finally what's your budget I mean did you get a tight budget you can do that very simple ... gets the job done without a lot of frills\nBut it's got some wiggle room you could think about ending some extra features like integrated shelving inside decorative trim on the outside or you could go all out man cave or she shed and maybe at electricity heat swimming\nWall to wall stereo I don't know you know you can really totally decadent those are fun too but I think it through in mind that budget so that comes out just the way you expect\nNow if you do go pro we recommend getting asked Mitch them at least two or three contractors before you choose the one that's going to help you with the project\nAnd I said ... projects presented by their dot com with me that there you can get matched with top rated homes service credit in your area we verified review is an appointment on mine all for free\nNo matter the type of job advisor makes advanced in easy to hire the best local pros\nThat Tammy in Philadelphia on the line was looking for a better shot or how can we have\nUm Hi I'm calling because I wanted to find out um I had an old Victorian house and I had a a three three three\nI had an earthquake in ... and when I was going to travel on a second floor and then I Want to take a shower or in the water up there on the air for the shower go with coke and I've been an egg creme contractor than my plumber and I'm not so I like to remedy that come to our remodeling\nOkay so are you opening up walls as part of the remodeling\nYes I Am completely stripped Anthony\nOkay great so first of all the reasons you have reduced water pressure an older homes are generally because\nYou have old steel pipes that suffer from internal resting and they clog the closed down like a clogged arteries and then you can't push enough water through it and that could be your main water pipe it could be the supply pipes that are inside the house\nOr a combination of them and so since you're taking the walls are part of the general rule of thumb is whenever you expose these old steel pipes you want to replace them with copper pipes um or with tax was different newer type of plumbing pipe now the other thing is you may have enough water pressure coming in from the street\nOne of the pressure is not that big of a deal because I think the pressure kind of guy and he's just like basically we have to there I'm going out and you can only use one at a time by the water completely goes ice cold shower somebody comes and eager to think\nWell that's because the the pipes may not be supplying the hot water they may not be moving into hot water which I was worried or do you have\nUm quite a gallon or what's minimum size but should be okay for for two bathrooms okay and is it an older water heater um now I just\nFor fun or to hear when you replace it that they're changing the plumbing around that this is going through the steel pipes\nI changed high around or not I don't think\nYou need to talk with your plumbers about what kind of pipes you have whether or not that's concerning the problem and need to know what the water pressure is at the street because if you're not getting enough pressure that could be the whole cause of it\nOkay now I go there and I saw something online called a um a pressure balance now what where many issue at all\nSo a pressure valve valve is designed to be used primarily in the shower and what it does is it keeps them mixed between hot and cold balance so that you don't get scorching or freezing cold waters when the pressure drops so if somebody wants to say run hot water downstairs and now Rob all that hot water from the upstairs shower\nIt would not change the balance of water from the mix of water between hot and cold so the flow would be less you'd have less of the stream but it wouldn't be\nThe temperature wouldn't change okay right okay no that's not it I don't think that's the cause I mean that would that would certainly be a good thing to have something you should consider but I don't think that's the reason you're not getting hot water on the second floor I just don't think I'm moving enough water up there\nOkay so basically what I Need to do is tell them to check the piping around the water heater\nGetting a plumber should know this not only to run the water heater basically if you're going to one of those walls what kind of pipes do you have\nAnd are they corroded and should they be replaced to help groups are up to help alleviate this okay I'm In of all else fails you could always had a second water heater upstairs you could get into a checklist water heater which would be a really small unit and it was applied additional water and the second for bathroom\nOkay okay okay well I think that kind of remedy the problem\nAll right thanks so much for calling them money pet Haiti fresh clean water delivered\nEvery
