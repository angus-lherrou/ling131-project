away from the building the building doesn't really moving the sled as we move much in a\nIn the garage itself but the driveways will tend to shrink and pull away and you'll get a gap ... open up so what you want to do there is there is a product called a backer rod which is if you ever seen the pool noodles that the kids play with the polls in summer or like phone tubes of course yeah\nIt looks like a tiny poodle right it's about a one inch to one and a half inch diameter home rod and you you buy the size of the amateur you want and you stick it into that gap right and you push it down so it's sort of just below\nThe surface of the of the ads for the driveway by like you know maybe so it's just maybe half inch blow and then on top of that you put a product called floor where things are number ... you can use\nThat will flow over that backer rod and and connect basically the driveway and the slap in the garage in some way to expand and contract not open up again and what that's going
