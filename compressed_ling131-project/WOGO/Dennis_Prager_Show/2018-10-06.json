Oh yes of course okay now I'm the old rule did have an e stringer same problems not really no your home shady\nUh yeah some shade or in front of the house yeah\nYou get more strict on the front of them I\nJust noticed that in the front of a little bit right right like above the entrance of the door you know ... but I got like a a body shape a typo so\nOne in thinking here is that typically the area where the roof rafter touches the roof she right where the would\nBe squeezing solid contact that's a cooler spot than the average the right and left of it so sometimes when we get these stripes on the roof it's a condition called ... and it's because you get more conversation\nA in those areas that are cold near his dinner warms the left and right and now also on the shady side of the house or wherever you have shade you're also much more likely to pick up a little algae or like in March\nAnd that can also cause standing on the roof\nSo before we jump to conclusions what I Would suggest you do is use to take a very simple approach is a roof clear out there that's called spray and forget\nIt's available and ready to use bottled you basically just snap a hose and garden hose onto\nAnd then you could spray the roof down\nAnd just kind of walk away and see what happens I actually haven't had an extremely dirty shed roof that has so much moss on it and it was crazy 'cause it just hadn't done anything wrong times so\nSo last summer when I was painting the fence knew the repairs outside of decided I Would take care of that and I got the springs forget and put it on once and then I walked away for about a month\nNotice that almost all it was going to put it on one more time and it's perfectly clean and put it down doesn't happen instantly because basically what it doesn't stop the growth from forming think of it in a sort of a weed killers moss\nAnd it brightens the roof and then there's a residual and stays on it and kind of protection of the law also I Would try or product like that it's very simple fairly inexpensive\nAnd see if that doesn't pay and then if it does then you've got to know what you're dealing with um one natural thing that you can do to ... though that group down to ... try to get a little more sunlight on that area sometimes I've told folks ... trees and and that's should just enough weight on ... sunlight is a natural middle of the

on where to put the insecticide how much deployed\nAnd also the insecticides they're very specific and they were moving the insects that they're supposed to remove and they don't remove the beneficial insects\nThat you want to leave behind so if you're having that much of an infestation I Would stop shopping for my own pesticide and call a pro and have them treat the house and once you get the populations down to where they are manageable kind of more normal\nThan you could try to use some of those other products just on a maintenance bases that makes sense\nIt sure does but here's that here's down the question when everybody else is having the same problem and the mall kids all around the whole entire neighborhood it gets made by and going to help stop at\nWell yeah it'll create
