might actually been a good predictor Val parades oh Indiana Tony Hi\nHi down there it is an honor to speak with you share like Indians and experiences\nThank you very much a\nSo my wife and I've been married about nine years on and when we got married we both recently joined the army so we were active duty soldiers and I'm\nAri uh we were heading off to Colorado we were stationed in Colorado so I ended up getting married um and then we just had a nice little dinner found the cheapest a hotel we could in Chicago\nStay the night together um and that uh that that a couple of days later a packed up the car and drove to Colorado to start a new life now being that we were both\nI'm active duty military waiting for the first thirty six months of our suffers three years of marriage we were\nNoah Terry waiting for the first thirty six months of our ... three years of marriage we were together physically together approximately Eighteen months at that\nTime now what are my point is I guess for your listeners that we principally are are pretty frugal people and when I look back on our on our\nOr when you brought up this topic and I applied my own experiences of a honeymoon um\nYeah but you ... you you didn't have a whole honeymoon right that's the point I\n... and it's basically yes because we couldn't afford it\nRight when he did was okay so so yeah go on\nA day the point being is that down ... that that was a foundational principles and our relationship is we didn't we don't live outside of our main belt that if\nWe had this ... lotion I own a you know\nAnybody who stayed the night of his marriage at the cheapest hotel in Chicago is frugal I got that\nWell it was that you know I K O five ferret out it was a camp up for us All right but it all serious\nMission your your your actually eat your story which I thought would actually the gate my ... my provisional theory\nI actually sustains it is that there really is no relationship between the honeymoon and and marriage it it it's it might be good at might not be good I mean you're another example of no honeymoon great marriage\nRight well we we all say plan that you know we discuss it hey well you know when we can afford it and the time is right well we'll take a hunting within a couple of years ago we actually\n... you know get on a cruise\nTogether without the kids and what not but you know I could afford it\nWell that's part of that my dear Tony thank you it's a it's a thank you for your service to both of you that is another subject which I have in fact cover it and I need to do it again and woman remind my producer about that\nI Am a a big fish in auto a family but I Am in even more adamant to fish you know all of a marriage and therefore I think you need to take vacations with out your children\nOn occasion with the children it's great fun even if you could take that many vacations more power to you\nBut if you can't\nYou need to you need you need to get to you need to have time together\nAnd death at family vacation a is generally knocked a romantic get away for parents and that my friends is what is known as an understatement okay thank you Tony so far we're pretty consistent\nAnd let's see what a it's a method for example of the basic Bloomington, Minnesota and borrowed the famous barber Bloomington Hi\nHi thanks for taking my call partner my sorry we're both
