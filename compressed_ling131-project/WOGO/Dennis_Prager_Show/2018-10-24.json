folks I don't use hyperbole and I don't speak for an effect I\nSincerely believe what I say\nAnd I sincerely hope I'm wrong but my fear is that a vast number of young men today do not have ambition as we have understood it\nTo be successful in life and to take care of a family to the two big ambitions of males throughout history or throughout western history and much non western but I Know western better\nAnd they are a product of a of a society that has told them that they are no different from women meant that women should carry their weight they don't have any specific responsibility that if a man thinks he has a specific responsibility he a sexist and he is\nPerpetuating patriarchy\nSo men and ambition is the issue and go to Paul in Columbus in South Carolina Hi Paula Dennis Prager\nHi Dana thank you for taking my call it's an honor to talk to you\nThank you so much time\nYou're on screen or I feel very strongly about that I agree and I feel like our health care\nVery strongly about the science degree with the er I feel like our culture\nIs and that's getting writing men and I have a personal example\nOn my son who is now twenty seven uh when he was in middle school this would have been like two thousand and four he had a science teacher who had a lot of posters on the wall and one of them was\nIf you want something done right ask a girl and he can\nThat's no way to you know one hand on that one one second yeah the I Need to write people know this is true for one second so this was a ... he's a poster in middle school\nYeah and I watch city what city\nBut this was in Seneca South Carolina\nAnd about what your ... what about one year\nOr two thousand and three or four\n\nOkay so if you want something done done right right and when you got to why good something dumb right Ashby girl mhm okay how did you how did you know about this poster\nWell he came home and he told me about it and he was a sad\nAnd um I said you know I had just finished reading James Dobson book bringing up boy\nAnd in that book he talks about how our culture has created a nail persona called the stupid guy\nAnd in our in commercials and Vaseline in commercials and on television and you had so many week none as either heads of house hold or\nYou know in ... particularly in commercials you would see them in a relationship where they get put down by a female who's obviously smarter\nAnd and and I'm saying that you know to the ...\nNo no object what I'm saying I'm a commercial she's smart yeah\nRight right and and or television shows you know that the woman is she's the one that rule the house and the husband always look stupid so\nSo I had my antenna up for this and so I went to the science teacher and I talk to her and I said and I don't know if you realize what this says two boys and these boys around the cause of Manhattan\nAnd you're communicating to ban that they are less than um than you know got\nRights or we got that she wanted the teacher said\nOkay so he's so I gave her the examples\nOf the oh it was a female teacher it was a female teacher that was it was a female team okay go on go on why don't you say\nSo I gave her those right I gave her those examples and she she stopped for a minute and she said\nOh my gosh you're right he said my husband feel this way when he sees certain shows any changes the channel and she took that poster down on\nAnd on and you know well that is not as an exceptional teacher and part of the reason I Am convinced is it South Carolina and it is not LA New York Chicago et cetera\nThat's a powerful story I wrote it down and I think you and Michelle San Diego California Dennis Prager Hi\nHi how are you that it will thinks it's a ...\nYear my intellectual hero and great for taking my call though I think that kids today are really\nI think there is nothing more important than raising children with that woman studies minor and taught in college than men and women are virtually this phone and then I got married and had kids and that you had children you know that that's not true\nAnd uh I think that the parents because it\nCould it have a baby so hey stay home and take care of the baby and someone else to make money and then the money maker isn't really motivated to which is harder now to make money than it used to be\nA and then everything is located now we have in common than most households children are being raised by I'm not sure who\nAre boys and girls after school programs and I think everybody listen\n[noise] well I I think that that's to a large extent except when you know obviously quite both the homes could afford a on a few ... or at least one and you know we can work but for the great majority of people I don't think it has worked with security will\nI thank you for

to get a job be successful and have a family um I I have a girlfriend who was like two and a half years and like I Want to marry her but like I don't want to until I'm able to support a family\nYou know I don't happen to agree with you by the way I I don't I don't understand since you want to support a family and since you both have to live on on some income at this point\nI don't I never I literally have never understood the notion I won't marry until I couldn't afford to a show stay on with me cause I admire you tremendously for your attitude but I don't understand this Simpson is that you only get married when you're financially capable\nOf taking care of the other person the other person\nCan also go for help take care of herself in the meantime as she is white now back in the
