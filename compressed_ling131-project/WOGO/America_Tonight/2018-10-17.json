delay any America Tonight right off the bat we go to Bob Ney the former congressman from Ohio from TOP Media news well Bob it is the end of the line as far as that confirmation you and I talked about this for months and what do we tell you that right at the very beginning you couldn't imagine he wasn't going to be confirmed\nBut you saw the turmoil that resulted of uh protesting really all they both died because now like sports teams the Democrats and the new Republican why did the Republicans prevail and what did the Democrats do wrong\nFor the Republicans I think made a couple of weeks for everybody or public is really the key look let's take a look into this\nI think after that when they came back and we haven't seen the worst but I think we can change so\nAfter that it was more of a Haitian she's in the short only came where for example judge\nThe one guy the actor for his ideas for what happened you know that helped the degree to which he just you know\nI think sort of a psychological momentum frankly for the Republican side just said look\nInstead of you into any pressure I think\nFrankly you know the fact that they just kept moving again that'd be I think really what flick\nFor yeah\nThat report I think really helped what flake called for\nYeah and so now I for Kavanaugh who he moves daunting there's the swearing in ceremony on Monday the president I'm apologizing to Brent cabin on his family but the terrible pain and suffering\nThat he's they endured after his confirmation Supreme Court for Kavanaugh he moves on right and just takes the high road that would you advise him to do and not making comments about it\nYet you say you raise a great question because in my opinion you and I talked about this\nUh one of the downsides was his demeanor of just attacking back yeah you you know especially when he turned to the center to the one senator and said have you ever had a blackout drunk yeah and that to me\nRaise the whole different set of questions also he had friends of his who supported him but he had a different version of that night\nA different version of how he he drank years ago et cetera so\nThere were ... and everything I think for him\nAnd it's a very important ... on because guess what this isn't done in the sense that he's going to hear the word impeachment impeach Kavanaugh you know if the Democratic side takes control he's going to hear right out front they are going to to begin impeachment processes against him [noise]\nAh and that's going to be monitored used by the Democratic side for this mid term election I Will tell you this I Would bet money\nLook out if you live in Pensacola look out if you're just south of Tallahassee it could be one of the worst hurricane to strike that sort of big Ben and Florida Panhandle region is what they call it\nI mean I'm Sorry you were trying to with than a hundred and some ... mile an hour when you're not going to win that battle so they have a hurricane warning in effect\nFor that Alabama and there's some of you are listening to us there and in Florida for that Alabama Florida border up to the ah swam the river so so really take this to heart and also on that border to Mississippi Alabama border\nRight there right in that the the beach and it means to storm surge heavy rainfall hurricane force when all the things that that entails and most of the people there no I mean listen you know not to fool around with this so there's thirty five counties that have been declared\nAn emergency state of emergency\nBecause that means the funding Florida stake\nTheir clothes their clothes from Tuesday through friday this week that's how serious they're taking it no way to take a chance to make sure all of the students and any of the faculty is nowhere near there because this is right where it could smash into even\nAlabama governor Kay Ivey said the same thing state of emergency because power outages when damage debris and the debris and what also can be so deadly you know when we had to last hurricane that came through\nA tree falls down smashes into a trailer house whatever or you've got power that's out people trying to come back in ...\nSo I think when you look at the two I think people are heating ... for the most part\nIt's actually after they watched what has happened\nEarlier in this hurricane season even Florence with the flood 'cause it's always the flood thing afterwards that you're worried about but it's Michael past boy oh boy I mean it really is coming up through the panhandle\nAnd it could intensify so that's the thing maybe it's the cat three but couldn't ... shift to a four let's hope not 'cause then you're talking\nA little jump up and the wind miles per hour you know hundred and thirty a hundred and fifty something\nYou got five hundred Florida National Guard members who are activated of course 'cause you got to plan the logistics of it all where are you responding words everyone being deployed basically when it happens and then five thousand more that are there so\nI mean is this happening fast\nSo fast so that means you know that's why they're clearing the deck\nIn 'em at Florida State because they know that this thing is bearing down quickly and it'll strike that panhandle\nTuesday Wednesday really Wednesday it's probably who you're talking about a storm surge of about twelve feet for some of the Florida coastline and twelve feet and some of those low lying areas I mean that's that's deadly is what that is\nSo hurricane season it is I'm telling you it is\nUnpredictable at times I mean predictable we ... we have the watches and you can look at the different maps thank goodness much different from those of you listening you get it tornado versus hurricane which is worse I mean it's almost a ridiculous question and since I have been in both not the worst of the ...\nWorse I mean it's almost a ridiculous question\nHim since I have been in both not the worst of the worst with a tornado the aftermath of a tornado yes\nThe worst of the worst in the middle of a hurricane yeah right in the middle of a hurricane I experienced what that was like\nWhere you're basically trapped year in lock down so I Love that the cars and I was a kid so I Love that the evacuation really happened and people he them where we didn't\nUsed to do that wasn't quite the same thing it doesn't mean that nobody clear it out but not the way they do it now it's much much different\nI Would have sex from this hurricanes into the New York limo crash I mean\nThe status ever and I it it is one of the deadliest road accident in us history so anywhere you're listening to me were saying the deadliest you know why twenty people were killed it was over the weekend\nAnd I was watching one of the college football games and I thought it was a mistake I thought\nOh no they must mean that people were injured and a couple of people were killed now we're saying to stretch limousine killed Eighteen people in the limo to people who were walking and it and that twenty\nSo ah I mean that's terrible and what happened was that this limo went through a stop sign and boom I you know unfortunately just collided and kill the people that were\nIn the limousine and it was um I mean obviously awful\nTerrible and when you when you start to look a deadly crashes and you see where that ranked I mean just the worst up victims tax to the limo was in terrible condition minutes before the crash\nSo you had various surrounding that one of the victims\nThat killed everyone on board the terrible conditions limo and this was twenty minutes before that whole tragic thing happen or even the New York governor Andrew Cuomo said on Monday that the limousines\nDidn't have the this is what the scary didn't have the necessary federal certification to operate failed state inspection last month how do you know that right you see this limousine company you look at it on Yelp or wherever are you asking about that or you digging into that now\nSo they're investigating it was a winding\nRoad about a hundred and sixty miles north of New York city and this was a birthday party at the uh Cooperstown brewery though two people were killed you had um\nThe people that were in this limousines you you had um husbands and wives and you you had family members and their friends that were that were there and um\nThere was attacked the tech methods I just mentioned\nComplaining about the limo is because there was a last minute replacement after a buck tired to shuttle the group broke down because that's the first thing that happened I mean what\nAre you kidding me and then look at it I mean just absolutely a horrific you know in their twenties and thirties\nUm yeah really just really really\nOne of the biggest losses of life and and this is what the first responders are saying that they've seen a long time and in just in an instant like that it slammed into to give you the further details on the story it's a dilemma ran a stop sign slammed into a park SUV and then the two people\nOf you know that halted uh before the crash that were standing there them they were hit so it's a\nIt's just awful and it does make you kind of think and I don't know why 'cause I got to say what are you doing if you order a limousine you're asking people have you know when my company hey are they good uh-huh hey I'm One of the people say about them out there on time they get\nYou know are they do they know if they have a federal certificate ... probably not are you looking for that kind of gives you pause to think okay if I'm putting a bunch of people in his limousine\nYou know maybe I got asked a few more questions or find something else out about that company because those people were thinking that they're just thinking how are you going to be kidding me this first we have this break down then we get in the limousine and this happens and then the worst thing possible\nI mean just absolutely possible happen All right we've just scratched the surface here in his first hour of America Tonight other things that we're going to talk about include demand came and got baseball playoffs enough football to

would be the one\nSeat that it's right there in the middle did you see what you had to pay on sixty minutes I did I saw it she said and Heidi Heitkamp it's interesting because hike camp brisket risk her seat\nAs she is definitely she's a Democrat and I and a Republican area and she voted against Kavanaugh and Susan Collins\nWho has a lot of voters who are independent\nEspecially in Maine she voted for Kavanaugh\nAnd there are people that are they've already built up the coffers for money to run against her and what not and I saw both of them on sixty minutes and I look I give him credit 'cause\nHeres what they both said in different ways that they they voted the way they thought they should vote and they weren't ... they weren't they weren't weighing the politics of it all is what they is what they said and Susan Collins\nSaid that that that she talked to Kavanaugh and the thing that you liked about Kavanaugh is she felt that he was about the letter of the launch she felt like he would go by that because she's pro choice and meaning that weighing the law and the precedent and all that kinda stuff um\nAnd she said there ... there was no evidence there she said there was not um there wasn't any evidence of of that so she couldn't go in that direction but she certainly\nIs bearing the brunt of a lot of of anger\nOf having to have guards and her people having guards and her family being guarded but at the same thing was Dr Ford I mean ridiculous like let's let it go\nEspecially in her case okay it's done it's over with he's confirmed and now they still can't go into their house I mean come on\nThis really I like I said we live in America we have different opinions give me a break right\nVery hard to um well let's move on to something else because we could just to go not this all night long or all show long anyway here's one from a Frank who says\nKate it's so easy to talk about the whole capping off thing but I Want to jump onto 'em something completely different horrible about that limo crash\nThe twenty people were killed and the fact is they failed their inspection and hey the driver wasn't even licensed\nWow I think there's questions we all need to ask in the future when we rent the things that we don't find ourselves in a death mobiles [noise]\nUm yeah that's interesting because that's what I said I said I Would never I just wouldn't have thought\nOf asking I I wouldn't have thought to ask this question to be honest I hate to be naive I Would ask somebody about them out of their reputation I Know exactly what I Do but now I Know what I Would do if I was ever in that situation and by the way this is right by Cooperstown where the baseball hall of fame is near Albany New York\nOutside of New York city I I mean I I guess a lot of rules were broken and it it set up this tragedy so um they were writing and the two thousand and one Ford Expedition that have been converted into a limousine\nAnd it wasn't expected and failed\nThe inspections and wasn't supposed to be on the road driver needed a CDL a commercial driver's license with a passenger endorsement they didn't have it\nThe limo company of course get nailed for this but it doesn't bring back all those people\n[laughter] I mean what are they going to say they in the company actually said they voluntarily took their fleet off the road during the investigation\nAnd they're meeting with people except for in the NTSB investigating if there weren't skid marks but there were rows conditions that were I guess kinda damp so they're saying that maybe that's a factor in it\nCould have been a whole bunch of different things one family\nLost four sisters they all died in that\nCrash wow I mean wow wow wow wow wow ...\nI if you understand me your thoughts you always can

said night [noise]\nDivided\nSaw they say so the midterm elections are going to be interesting I think if it really interesting to see what happened in the wake of the Supreme Court confirmation wow a crazy crazy wild few weeks there is no doubt about it\nAnd you've got all the justices sitting in the front row the White House in the East Room on Monday and the president saying he thought his second nominee to the court deserve better than a terrible\nPain and suffering that he was forced to endure he said\nUh for his part Kavanaugh said he would assume the role with gratitude and no bitterness that was a really great response because it has been nothing but bitterness over the Senate confirmation process which was emotional contentious outrageous\nAnd a rip the country apart and this is far from over I think\nWe're going to see many more protests are going to see some fallout from this or or not one of them is going to be Senator Susan Collins she certainly is on the hot seat the president mentioned Susan Collins as somebody who was um\nSpot on basically in the wars that she used when she addressed the Senate because she resolutely defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh both on his judicial philosophies and again that's sexual assault allegation\nAnd what happens now in fact she said because there there were donating that are ... million dollars I think now that were put out there saying that if she voted yes on Kavanaugh\nThe all the credit cards would be process to there was an active campaign against her\nAnd she said it was a classic quid pro quo in a violation of federal bribery law she said I think if our policy can come to the point where people are trying to buy votes and by positions and we're in a very sad place she was on sixty minutes when she made those\nComments so a group of liberal activists began to campaign last month to pressure her she because they knew she was the key swing vote in Kavanaugh's nomination process and if she voted no like I said the donations would it would be\nI Would not be taken for the donors the ask the pledges word process\nThough now\nOwners and the ... the pledges were process\nSo now whoever the main Democrat is in two years they'll get that money that's being raised an interesting we just calling\nOn friday heading into as we can announced he would support Kavanaugh's nomination amid all these old allegations of sexual assault to setting concerns about threats to roe v Wade with predominantly conservative\nJustices on the Supreme Court so after um it was all said and done now it's you know over the three million dollar mark like I said and it's still two years away that you know the bottom line is still two years away for that\nSo too early to tell if it will have that kind of an effect\nBut I look at what Michael doing and the that\nRed spot intensify and I look at that one hundred and ten mile an hour winds and I think now I live there and I'm Alone that Florida Panhandle I Am gone color me on\nCars a hundred and eleven miles an hour forget it to making landfall on Wednesday afternoon or evening between Pensacola really in the far western panhandle it's looking like just

that\nThe you know if you're gone you're gone that you can't replace wife and then coming back and horrific conditions no\nThere's nothing there there's no power you can't get back in that would be awful I Hope it veers I Hope it dissipates but boy does not look like at a keep checking that map\nAnd it's not that's not happening to this looks to be very very serious very very serious and then sadly what they're talking about some of the places that were hit by Florence\nAnd they're being cleaned up and that was a horrible they're talking about maybe some more flooding depending on the track of the storm it knock it they're not going to get the hurricane force but they might get that crazy flooding that with a crushing and the first place and parts of the Carolinas\nSo that's a possibility in New York\nThey're not talking about hurricanes are talking about the state of limousine crash who the bad beat all the way around and when I say that it was because not the the limo driver didn't have the right license Leno wasn't supposed to be on the road they failed a state inspection and as a result twenty people ended up\nDead on Saturday including ... in an area and I started to look at the map and I've been in this area because it's right by Cooperstown at the outside of\nAlbany New York and his dad the it's a beautiful area and there's these winding roads and

this for months and we tell you that right at the very beginning you couldn't imagine he wasn't going to be confirmed\nBut eats all the turmoil that resulted of uh protesting really I'll play both sides because now like sports teams Democrat and a Republican why did the Republicans prevail I'm went to the Democrats do wrong\nWell for one the Republicans I think made a couple of Jeff Flake from Arizona I Know ... everybody or public as I was angry at him but he said look let's take a look into this [laughter]\nI think after that when they came back and we haven't seen the report of course but I think we know nothing changed\nAfter that it was more of a he said she said nothing you know start ... who came out where for example ...\nUh the one guy the doctor for ... was there you know obviously in case his ideas of what happened as a result I think that you know that helped the Graham speech which he just you know\nIt was on fire I think it gave a sort of a psychological momentum frankly for the Republican side and then you just said look at a press ahead\nInstead of you into any pressure I think\nFrankly you know the fact that they just kept moving again at at the report I think really helped what flick called for now\n[laughter] and they're now offer Kavanaugh who he moved on and there's the swearing in ceremony on Monday the president I'm apologizing to Brett Kavanaugh and his family since the terrible pain and suffering\nThat he didn't they endured after his confirmation Supreme Court here for Kavanaugh he just moves on right and just take the high road is that what you would advise him to do and not making comments about it\nIf you raise a great question because in my opinion you and I talked about this\nUh one of the downsides was his demeanor of just attacking back here you know especially when he turned to the center that was senator and said have you ever had a blackout drunk yeah and that to me\nRaised a different set of questions also he had friends of his who supported him but he had a different version of that night\nA different version of how he drank ears ago et cetera so there were ... and everything I think for a\nVery important because guess what this isn't done in the sense that he's going to hear the word impeachment peach Kevin you know if the Democratic side takes control he's going to hear right out front they are going to to begin patron processes against him\nAnd that's going to be in Monterey used by the Democratic side for this mid term elections I Will tell you this I Would bet money\nLook out if you live in Pensacola look out if you're just south of Tallahassee it could be one of the worst hurricane to strike\nThat sort of big band and Florida Panhandle region is what they call it\nI mean I'm Sorry you were trying to within a hundred and some ... mile an hour when you're not going to win that battle so they have a hurricane warning in effect\nFor that Alabama and there's some of you are listening to us there and in Florida for that Alabama Florida border up to the ah swam the river so so really take this to heart and also on that border to Mississippi Alabama border\nRight there right in that the the beach and it means storm surge heavy rainfall hurricane force when all the things that that\nEntailed and most of the people there no I mean listen you know not to fool around with this so there's thirty five counties that have been declared\nAn emergency state of emergency because that means the funding Florida State\nTheir clothes their clothes from Tuesday through friday this week that's helped theories they're taking it no way to take a chance to make sure all of the students and any of the faculty is nowhere near there because this is right where it could smash\nInto even Alabama governor Kay Ivey said the same thing state of emergency\nBecause power outages when damage debris and the breeds what also can be so deadly you know when we had to last hurricane that came through a tree falls down smashes into a trailer house whatever or you've got power that's out people trying to come back in ... it's a nightmare [noise]\nSo I think when you look at the two I think people are heating myth for the most part\nIt actually after they watched what has happened\nEarlier in this hurricane season even Florence with the flood 'cause it's always the flood thing afterwards that you're worried about but it's Michael past boy oh boy I mean it really is coming up through the panhandle\nAnd it could intensify so that's the thing maybe it's the cat three but couldn't ... shift to allow for let's hope not 'cause then you're talking\nA little jump up in the wind miles per hour you know a hundred and thirty a hundred and fifty something\nYou got five hundred Florida National Guard members who are activated of course 'cause he got a plan that logistic little where you're responding words everyone being deployed basically when it happened and then five thousand more that are there so\nI mean this is happening fact\nSo fast so that means you know that's why they're clearing the decks\nIn 'em at Florida State because they know that this thing is bearing down quickly and it'll strike that panhandle\nTuesday Wednesday relieve Wednesday it's probably who you're talking about a storm surge of about twelve feet for some of the Florida coastline and twelve feet from the low lying areas I mean that that deadly\nIs what that is so hurricane season it is I'm telling you it is\nUnpredictable at times I mean to predict a belief that we have the watches and you can look at the different maps thank goodness much different from those of you listening you get a tornado versus hurricane which is worse I mean it's almost too ridiculous question and since I have been in both\nNot the worst of the worst with a tornado the aftermath of a tornado yes\nThe worst of the worst in the middle of a hurricane yeah right in the middle of a hurricane I experienced what that was like\nWhere you're basically trapped you're in lock down so I Love that too because then I was a kid so I Love the the evacuation really happened and people he them where we didn't\nUsed to do that wasn't quite the same thing it doesn't mean that nobody clear it out but not the way they do it now it's much much different\nI Would have said from the hurricanes into this New York limo crash I mean\nThe status ever and I it it is one of the deadliest road accident in us history so anywhere you're listening to me were saying the deadliest you know why twenty people were killed\nIt was over the weekend and I was watching one of the college football games and I thought it was a mistake I thought\nOh no they must mean that people were injured and a couple of people were killed net out were saying to stretch limousines killed Eighteen people in the limo to people\nWho were walking and it and that twenty [noise] so ah I mean that's terrible and what happened was that the limo went through a stop sign and boom I you know unfortunately collided ...\nAnd boom I you know unfortunately it collided\nAnd killed the people that were in the limousine and it was um I mean obviously awful\nTerrible and when you when you start to look a deadly crashes and you see where that ranked I mean just the worst a victim tax did that the women who have been terrible condition minutes before the crash\nSo you had a serious surrounding that one of the victims\nThat killed everyone on board the terrible conditions limo and this was twenty minutes before that whole tragic thing happened or even the New York governor Andrew Cuomo said on Monday that the limits deems\nDidn't have the this is what the scary didn't have the necessary federal certification to operate failed state inspection last month how do you know that right he's limousine company you look at it on Yelp or wherever are you asking about that are you taking into that now\nSo they're investigating it was a winding\nRoad about a hundred and sixty miles north of New York city and this was a birthday party at the uh Cooperstown brewery so two people were killed you had um\nThe people that work in the limousine you he had um husbands and wives and you you had family members and their friends that were that were there and um\nThere was a ... the text message I just mentioned\nComplaining about the limo because there was a last minute replacement after ... hired to shuttled or group broke down because that's the first thing that happened I mean what\nAre you kidding me and then look at it I mean just absolutely a horrific because you know in their twenties in their thirties\nUm yeah really just really really\nOne of the biggest losses of life and and this is what the first responders are saying that they've seen a long time and and just and then it says like that land and to to get because it further details on the story it's a dilemma ran a stop sign slammed into a park SUV and then the two people\nUh you know that halted uh before the crash that were standing there them they were hit so it's a\nIt's it's just awful and it does make you kind of thing\nAnd I don't know why 'cause I got to say what are you doing if you order a limousine you're asking people have you know when oil company hey are they good uh-huh hey I'm One of the people say about them out there on time they get you know are they do they know if they they have a federal certificate\n... probably not are you looking for that kind of gives you pause to think okay if I'm putting a bunch of people\nIn his limousine you know maybe I got to ask a few more questions or find something else out about that\nCompany because those people were thinking that they're thinking now you've got to be kidding me the first we have the break down then we get in\nThe women's Nina and this happens and then the worst thing I saw the bowl I mean just absolutely possible\nHappen we've just scratched the surface here in the first hour of America Tonight other things that we're going to talk about include demand came to the baseball playoffs than uh football to talk about remember this week of course would have another nail the score but next what do you think we're going to the mail bag\nOn America Tonight [noise]\nMm\nI'm a veteran we hit on line and Vietnam when I came home I didn't know where\nTo turn as America's veterans

right there in the middle did you see what you had to say on sixty minutes I did I thought what she said\nThe middle did you see what you had to say on sixty minutes I did I saw it she said and Heidi Heitkamp it's interesting because\nI Can't Britain is written her seat as she is definitely she's a Democrat and I and a Republican area and she voted against Kavanaugh and Susan Collins who has a lot of voters who are independent\nSpecially in Maine\nShe voted for cabinet off\nAnd there are people that are they've already built up the coffers for money to run against her and whatnot and I saw both of them on sixty minutes and I look I give him credit 'cause\nHeres what they both said in different ways that they they voted the way they thought they should vote and they weren't ... they weren't they weren't weighing the politics of it all is what they is what they said and Susan Collins\nSaid that that that she talked to Kavanaugh and the thing that you liked about Kavanaugh she felt that he was about the letter of the launch she felt like he would go by that because she's pro choice and meaning that weighing the law and the president and all that kind of stuff um\nAnd he said there ... there was no evidence there she said there was not um there wasn't any evidence of of that so she couldn't go in that direction\nBut she certainly\nBearing the brunt of a lot of of anger\nOr having to have guards and her people having guards and her family being guarded\nBut this is the same thing with Dr Ford I mean ridiculous like let's let it go especially in her case okay it's done it's over with he's confirmed and now they still can't go into their house I mean come on\nThis really I like I said we live in America we have different opinion give me a break right\nVery I tell 'em look who've onto something else because we could just to go not this all night long are also show long anyway here's one from a Frank who's says\nKate it's so easy to talk about the whole cabinet thing but I Want to jump onto 'em something completely different horrible that the limo crash the twenty people were killed and the fact is they failed their inspection and hey the driver wasn't even life and\nWhile I think there's questions we all need to ask in the future\nWhen we rent the things that we don't find ourselves in a death mobiles\nUm yeah that's interesting because that's what I said I said I Would never I just wouldn't have thought\nOf asking I I wouldn't have thought to ask this question to be honest I hate to be naive I with somebody about them out of their reputation I Know exactly what I Do but now I Know what I Would do if I was ever in that situation and by the way this is right by Cooperstown where the baseball hall of fame is near Albany New York\nOutside of New York city I I mean I I get a lot of rules were broken and it it set up this tragedy so um they were writing and the two thousand and one Ford Expedition that have been converted into a limousine\nAnd it wasn't that did\nAnd failed the inspections and wasn't supposed to be on the road the driver needed a CDL a commercial driver's license with a passenger endorsement they didn't have\nThe limo company of course get nailed for this but it doesn't bring back all the people\nI mean what are they going to say they the company actually they voluntarily took their fleet off the road during the investigation\nAnd they're meeting with people that are in the NTSB investigating if there weren't skid marks but there were rooms conditions that were I guess kinda damp so they're saying that maybe that's a factor in it\nCould've been a whole bunch of different things one family\nLost four sisters they all died in that\nCrash wow I mean wow wow wow wow wow ...\nI if you understand me your
