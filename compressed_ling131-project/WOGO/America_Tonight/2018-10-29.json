about a synagogue in Pittsburgh and the man's name Robert powers at forty six destroying his life and more importantly he\nUh destroyed the lives of eleven people and others to eleven people dead six let seriously injured including a couple of police officers what happened is before ten o'clock he went into the tree of life synagogue in a suburb of Pittsburgh\nAnd he opened fire a he was screaming anti medics thing I Can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered and screw your optics them going in and all these other kinds of\nUm horrible thing so because of the anti Semitic rants on social media\nNow the FBI is investigating the attack as a hate crime doesn't bring back the victims they ranged in age from their fifties two brothers\nWho are up to their Ninety that people were stunned people who lived in the neighborhood where some people who go to the Pentagon were stunned and we've heard these words before it was a rampage here's alone guy by himself\nHe was trying to leave the synagogue after when he did and then they are guide them they forced him out a shoot out he was injured but he's fine\nAnd it is really\nThe Pittsburgh FBI special agent in charge said his name's Bob down here that it most horrific crime thing in a twenty two years the victims were brutally murdered\nAnd because of their face and act on line for federal charges you know twenty nine ... it could lead to the death penalty attorney general Jeff Sessions for that and the attorney general for pets\nAttorney general Jeff Sessions her ... and the attorney general for Pennsylvania Josh appears that the shooting occurred after synagogue during a baby naming ceremony\nLooks and I don't care what religion you are how you worship going into churches going in synagogues going into any in any house of worship I'm for that matter killing any innocent people but let's stick with that for a second is just despicable beyond belief\nJust despicable reprehensible I mean I can use all kinds of words doesn't bring the victims back it doesn't quell the hate I think moving forward as the question of what do you do I talked about this and another hour and the show\nI had a conversation with one of my buddies in Los Angeles and think of Los Angeles and we talk about gun debate and all that and which is not the place for that but he said that in his church they have people that have concealed carry 'em and that they agreed that during every service\nSomebody two to three people would be there who are certified and um practice with their weapon except raw and they would be in the church in case the worst happened so in case the worst happens sad that we even have to think that way\nBut moving forward there may be more people that think that way where they either get security or they have to lock the doors a which is equally as sad and you know here's the bottom line\nOf people have Pittsburgh we wrap our arms around you there's vigils being held for them there's money being raised there's comfort that's being served up 'cause that's the kind of people we are but it doesn't bring back the victims and I don't know about you but I think of my grandmother\nOutrageous outrageous a range of things to happen and the people in Pittsburgh are reacting um you know hatred can't we\nGet in the city of steel that where they find that you fall out of the Pittsburgh game the Pittsburgh Steelers winning their game but the focus so much of the focus on thinking of the poor people the victim that that that we're we're water and then of course people are coming together to\nRally around the folks are that the kind of world we live and that kind of people we are in the United states and I hope that that's not forgotten and all of this on the global and sanity and hateful thick twist and a man's mind that\nYou know is now accused of this and charged with the terrible things that nobody was expecting\nHappen and I say things ending the life of people who live long lives and we're not expecting you know to get the phone calls about their grandparents people weren't expecting that were in their fifties the two brothers I mean yeah just awful how I feel like\nYou know we need to and people are choked up people can barely talk or the SWAT Team except for uh the I'm\nIn the Pittsburgh synagogue gunman told plot that he wanted to kill all Jews to die wanted them to die and soaked up though so many and\nWe had three hate filled kind of crimes three hate filled suspect that have\nCaused havoc to other people there was the grocery store I haven't even mentioned that and I'm One of my favorite states Kentucky Jefferson town Kentucky just outside of Louisville and it you know it's\nUm think about it there was a guy who banged on the door First Baptist church\nAnd tried to pull it up and couldn't pull it up and couldn't get inside\nSo then he went to a Kroger store he shot to people both African American the first with sixty nine sixty nine year old Maury Ballard who was with a twelve year old grandson the grandson Derek all\nYou're buying a poster board I don't think about this for a school project really the second was a sixty seven year old woman who was killed in the parking lot\nAnd the guy fled uh the mayor there that I'm picking heartbroken an angry as I Would feel that way about any act of violence and cruelty and this guy had a history of mental illness made racist rap repeatedly called his ex wife the N. word all kinds of\nUm things are coming out about that because of course you look into the history and want to know what could possibly\nWhat could possibly make that happen what would drive somebody could do that to Gregory Bush fifty\nOne years old I'm fifty one year old white man would try to do that\nWhat what does it what what what pushes in that direction and then we had the whole bombing thing and the fifty six year old Florida Man than they are so I act and he now fourteen and I thought it was Thirteen now they're saying fourteen a pipe bomb they didn't detonate but they were real\nUm his hatred obviously was there and then the woman out the gunman who went into the synagogue\nAnd some really really rough\nWeek a couple of days really for that kind of stuff that stuff that we\nWeek a couple of days really for that kind of stuff that stuff that we don't want to happen here in the United states disagreements not caring for the\nWay I'm from the rhetoric goes all that fine but to have this happen you know I mean terrible absolutely\nA indescribable that's it I described will move on to something else to talk about something else it's likely mean you know Halloween is coming up in a few days after Halloween is going to turn us around but we need something to bounce back on right what what are the positive\nStories out there that are happening in the positive is what so many of you are doing reaching out in helping other people and um then we see that everyday examples of that and pulling people out the neighborhoods and\nAnd I choose to believe really I Do that we really are a nation of people that are givers and care about other people and stronger ... you know stronger than hate is something we are stronger than that the steel city is stronger than that were stronger than that you know\nAbsolute absolutely I mean absolutely I'm going to I'm going to go in that direction with ah with everybody else I look at a couple of other things\nUm you know I talked about the Powerball thing and somebody asked me well jeeze if you want power of all which is\nStill do the show absolutely ten years on this show you think you're getting rid of me that easy of course no of course I'll hang around I did not win the Powerball I'm not usually a lottery player but\nUm I did I did play the lottery it just a little a little amount nothing big I see people that are pulling out big bills to play and I'm thinking maybe they know something I I don't know but I but I'm not sure it's gotta be something different right something different than than\nUm than what I Know that's all I'm saying I just move on to something else that that caught my attention and\nThis is this is one of those stories where luckily I saw him in concert but bravo families Trump's career\nMichael ... blue play blue bootleg easy for me to say I do play he\nHas been talking about some cancer and you think of cancer and what cancer does I was watching one of the ball games over the weekend and they had stand up to cancer and everybody of course has a sign almost everybody touched by cancer any room you go in\nSome survivors but some that have family that didn't like in my family my mother who I adored dying of colon cancer five years ago when a grandmother and last night as a kid from breast cancer so anyway\nMichael ... play did an appearance on\nStand up to cancer episode of care uh carpal karaoke on Saturday and he\nTalked to James Cordon about a five year old Noah who was diagnosed with liver cancer at age three and he said you know it's hard to acknowledge because it's so painful to talk about we got the diagnosis and that was in my whole life ended he's\nMarried to an Argentinean actress and they have three kids together um two sons and a daughter he said his extended family relocated to LA to be closer to to his son Noah while he underwent treatment and\nUm they take\nIt day by day and he said we're all moved by what's happening and we have the best doctors and you know they're just focusing on their time with him he said he wasn't going to tour anymore do any of that um\nHe you know they're focusing on him they're focusing on anything they can do with him and ... you know again you just don't think of a three year old\nBut then of course we know that that happens and that doesn't matter money um\nInfluence except for cancer cuts across all\nCuts across all areas of life and\nIncome levels and there is just another\nExample of of that but I'm\nCertainly they don't want for anything but\nIt's they want for their son to get better you know that's the bottom line I don't know about all of you and I'm going to end this segment on this but what is the one of

Bowers forty six years old has been charged with twenty nine ... eleven people killed and that happened on\nSaturday you know there's all the court documents that people are talking about and what the court documents provided\nGlimpses of the stuff back then you know twenty minutes of bloodshed is what it is it the tree of life congregation synagogue in a in a squirrel hill and that neighborhood and even the mayor of bill a ...\nAt a news conference promised that he would be stronger from a very very dark day and what can you say we've been knocked down before we get up we stand back we worked together and people are really reaching out thank goodness and we ... we know where that kind of country but\nThis is what happened so he goes in he's shouting anti traumatic nonsense he opened fire on the people that are there he's got a an A R Fifteen semi automatic rifle three glock hand guns and\nThree of the weapons were were purchased legally because that's what happened in the conversation turns to that but at least ... you know nobody had anything there\nTo defend themselves and I've had the conversation with a few people wear concealed carry and some churches so it can happen in any church any house of worship the ... they got people\nPlanted bed have concealed carry weapon to protect the people now that is going to be more I think of the conversation 'cause 'cause

twenty nine cats make that clear in synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh\nThe criminal complaint is saying what I just said\nIn a God shooting in Pittsburgh the criminal complaint is saying what I just said that he said a lot of anti Semitic stuff I Want to kill Jews got kind of thing they're committing genocide my people he kept repeating that then it becomes that hate crime kind of thing

face of the earth and seeing people that are going to worship whatever their religion is and not coming out alive is just to pick a bowl and on it unacceptable so the answer is let's move forward what do we do how do we do this what can we do\n'em the eleven people killed in the pits Pittsburgh Pentagon you know certainly it shouldn't be a political frequently what happens shouldn't be political I Would agree with that any Democrat or Republican and says that\nI completely agree divers for Republican from Ohio the head of the national Republican convention committed any\nCommittee rather are

come together and make that happen in bravo yes\nYes yes yes\nAnd of course the president and members of both parties are condemning the explosive devices address to former President Obama Hillary

was raised I Know a lot of you are good people you weren't raised that way\nDefinitely when you have the rhetoric of in a in a different direction is what I say hey by the way hats off to the people who are donating to the synagogue victims they raised more than three hundred thousand and one gay there's been vigils all over the place\nTo how to repair broken heart and when this happened um and\nYou know again trying to help families\nBeing same violence all of that whatever it takes by the way the suspect has been charged and on supplies the\nGamut twenty nine count stemming from the attack including violating hate crime laws um so you know very go with that\nIn the meantime while that's happening\nYou know wild thoughts are there and so much is the lunar Lewis pick nonsense um is going on there there are other things believe it or not hard to switch gears though right I mean the Pittsburgh Penguins are you going to have a blood drive to collect\nA collection to help the synagogue victims and there's you know all kinds of people doing all kinds of things and how do you have it on this but there are a couple of other things that are\nHappening obviously the elections big vote you want to make a difference going vote get involve locally that's where it starts know who you're voting for when I was a kid that was and it's probably stems to me during the show current event knowing what's happening all that stuff\nVital and in my life because my mother\nCurrent events knowing what's happening all that stuff\nVital in in my life because my mother told me don't come to the kitchen table if you don't if you're not versed on what's going on and I applaud her for that so she knew that she wanted to raise two people that were going to be involved in what was happening in this great country you know growing up\nA stone throw away from where the founding fathers met with a declaration of independence but by the Philadelphia anyway\nSo I always think of the the right to vote as a really sacred one name always in my life that will be important\nAnd I hope it's important in your life to then when you want to complain you can lay claim right um\nAnd that's what I that's what I think I mean honestly\nSo we've got um\nJust a couple of weeks and then the official and then do you know voting that's it the Democratic campaigns and outside fundraising groups are expected to outspend the Republican in the final stretch for the midterms that I was looking at some\nUm numbers heading into that we can actually not Democrats are expected to spend a hundred and forty three million on TV ads in the house races compared to the ... for the Republicans\nAnd there's a big surge on an ad by then you know what's going to happen there the Republican National committee and sell the fundraising has a fundraising\nAdvantage over the Democratic National Committee committee rather joined the cycle\nThe Democratic congressional candidates combined raised more than one billion that crazy this election cycle through September compared to the seven hundred and nine million for Republicans\nAnd there's all kinds of numbers surrounding that but here's the bottom line Democrats are looking to get the majority in the house and Senate in the midterms\nThey have to gain twenty three seats to retake the majority in the house they have to ... do the same thing in the upper chamber I think a lot of these races are close to close to call in and they're going to come down to the wire and that's why again voting is so important for what you think\nShould happen look at who's running where and what's happening in your world because it could be closer than you think and you could have an incumbent that you think is naturally going to win\nBut maybe it's not you know maybe it's not as obvious as you think that they're going to win it might be much much tighter let's put it that way\nI was talking about money for a second so many of you ask me about\nWhat I think about the stock market I think if you're talking about investing in anything any kind of investment you have if you can I don't care\nIf you have a few dollars whatever it is I'm being serious up to diversify right diversify I've heard people say oh you can't make money on bitcoin but I Know people that made a lot of money on bitcoin because they believed and they got in in the beginning when it was right to get in so it paid off dinner for them\nWe have definitely cooled down markets and part of that is on earnings people taking back money that's what happened I think it's all said again I said at last week that the ... called the market correction that's what happened I mean would it be great if we could all put money in the stock market and walk away with a ton of money\nYeah or you have the four oh one K. and then you work for a company luckily maybe from a view where you get that money and you put it in and\nIt gets matched and then you've got to pick the basket of\nYou know dark and you pick who you help you pick on why agree but you know with\nOur bunk and just correction are armed chartered territory so we call\nIt heading into the weekend the the market was was down again the NASDAQ the tech having our that closed down over to point with chairs and Amazon losing over seven percent of Google suffers down to your point two percent and you know has it run its course the Dow\nJones ended two hundred Ninety six points or one point nine to ... percent and almost eight percent from ... percent from its high on October third the answer is you pay attention you watch what's happening and\nYou know you get all these gangs and it actually is going to come back and it's going to there's going to be a correction some of it is higher interest rate\nLike um you watch and you pay attention to what's risky and you pay attention to what's going on negative\nI stayed with us as I said yours are coming up with so I was\n\nBy this is self self

matter killing any innocent people but let's stick with that for a second\nIs just despicable beyond belief just to think of all reprehensible I mean I can use all kinds of words it doesn't bring the victims back it doesn't ... ... the hate I think moving forward question of what do you do I talked about this and another hour and the show\nI had a conversation with one of my buddies in Los Angeles just think of Los Angeles and we talk about gun debate and all that and which is not the place for that but he said that in his church\nThey have people that have can field and carry 'em and that they agreed to during every service somebody\nTwo to three people would be there who are certified\nUm practice with their weapon except for a and they would be in a church in case the worst\nHer in case the worst happened why that we even have to think that\nBut moving forward there may be more people that think that way where they either get security or they have to lock the doors um which is an equally as that and you know here's the bottom line of people in Pittsburgh we wrap our arms around\nPleased that and you know here's the bottom line of people in Pittsburgh we wrap our arms around you there's vigils being held for them and there's money being raised there's comfort that's being served up because that's the kind of people we are but it doesn't bring back the victims I don't know about you but I think of\nI'm On an outrageous\nSub rage rage of things to happen and the people in Pittsburgh are reacting um you know hatred can't we\n... the city is Neal that were the signs that you're all out of the Pittsburgh game the Pittsburgh Steelers winning their game but the focus so much of the focus on thinking of the poor people the victim that that ... that were were slaughtered and\nOf course people are coming together to\nRally around those folks are that's the kind of world we live and that's the kind of people we are in the United states and I hope that that's not forgotten and all of this on the global insanity and hateful sick twist in a man's mind that\nYou know is now accused of this and charged with the terrible things that nobody was expecting\nHappen and I say things ending the life of people who live long lives and we're not expecting\nYou know to get the phone calls about their grandparents people weren't expecting that were in their fifties the two brothers I mean yeah it's just awful\nNow I feel like you know we need to and people are choked up people can barely talk or the SWAT Team et cetera the um the Pittsburgh synagogue gunman told\nPlot that he wanted to kill all Jews to die wanted them to die\nIs soaked up though so many and\nWe had three hate filled kind of crimes three hate filled up that that\nCaused havoc to other people there was a grocery store I haven't even mentioned that and I'm One of my favorite states Kentucky Jefferson town Kentucky just outside of Louisville and it you know it's um\nThink about it there was a guy who dangling door first\nChurch and tried to pull it up and couldn't pull it up and couldn't get inside\nSo then he went to a Kroger store he shot to people both African American the first with sixty nine sixty nine year old Maury Ballard who was with a twelve year old grandson the Grantham their uncle\nHe's buying a poster board I don't think about this for a school project really the second was a sixty seven year old woman who was killed in the parking lot and the guy\nWhat are the mayor there that I'm picking heartbroken an angry I Would feel that way about any act of violence who called me\nAnd this guy had a history of mental illness ... threats repeatedly called his ex wife the N. word all kinds of um things are coming out about that because of course you\nLook into the history and want to know what could possibly what could possibly make that happen what would drive somebody can do that to Gregory\nBush fifty one years old I'm fifty one year old white men would try to do that what what does it what what what pushes in that direction\nAnd then we had the whole bombing thing and the fifty six year old Florida Man than they are\n... and he mailed fourteen I thought it was Thirteen now they're saying fourteen a pipe bombs they didn't detonate but they were real\nUm his hatred obviously was there and then the woman giving\nOut the gunmen who went into this synagogue is a really really rough week\nA couple of days really for that kind of stuff that stuff that we don't want to happen here in the United states disagreements not caring for the\nWay I'm from the rhetoric goes all that fine but to have this happens you know I mean terrible absolutely\nA indescribable that's it described will move on to something else to talk about something else it's likely means you know Halloween is coming up in a few days it was just about Halloween is going to turn us around but we need something to bounce back on right what what are the\nStories out there that are happening in the positive is what so many of you are doing reaching out in helping other people and um then we see that everyday examples of that and then pulling people out the neighborhoods and\nAnd I choose to believe really I Do that we really are a nation of people that are givers and care about other people and stronger it you know stronger than hate is something we are stronger than that the steel city is stronger than that were stronger than that you know absolute\nAbsolutely I mean absolutely I'm going to I'm going to go in that direction with ah with everybody else I look at a couple of other things\nUm you know I talked about the Powerball thing and somebody asked meal geez if you want to power of all we should still do the show absolutely ten years on this show you think you're getting ready to me that easy of course no of course I'll hang around\nLing ten years on this show you think you're getting ready to me that easy of course no of course I'll hang around I did not win the Powerball I'm not usually a lottery player but\nUm I did I did play the lottery it just a little a little amount nothing big I see people that are pulling out big bill to play and I'm thinking maybe they know something I I don't know but ah but I'm not sure it's gotta be something different right something different than than\nUm than what I Know that's all I'm saying I just move on to\nSomething else that that caught my attention and this is\nThis is one of those stories where luckily I saw him in concert but bravo family trumped career Michael ... blue play\nBlue ... easy for me to say ...\nHe has been talking about some cancer and you think of cancer and would cancer does those watching one of the ball games over the weekend and they stand up to cancer and everybody of course has signed almost everybody touched by cancer any room you go in\nSome survivors but some that have family that didn't like my family my mother who I adored dying of colon cancer five years ago when a grandmother I last night as a kid from breast cancer so anyway\nAh Michael Blue play did an appearance on stepped up to cancer episode of care uh carpal karaoke on Saturday and he\nTalked to James quarter about a five year old Noah who was diagnosed with liver cancer at age three and he said you know it's hard to knowledge because it's so painful to talk about we got the diagnosis and that wasn't in my whole life ended he's\nMarried to an Argentinean actress and they have three kids together um\nTwo sons and a daughter he said his extended family relocated to LA to be closer to who his son Noah while he underwent treatment\nI'm sure they take it day by day and he said we're all moved by what's happening and we had the best doctors and you know they're just focusing on their time with him he said he wasn't going to tour anymore do any of that um\nHe you know they're focusing on him they're focusing on anything they can do with him and you know again you just don't think of a three\nYear old but then of course we know that that happened and that it doesn't matter money um in foreign except for cancer cuts across all\nCuts across all areas of life and income levels and there's another example of of that but I'm\nCertainly they don't want for anything but\nIt's they want for their time to get better you know the bottom line I don't know about all of you and I'm going to end this segment on this but what is the one of the topics of conversation constantly house back to the Internet the AT and T. is saying that they have completed the world's first five gee connects\nHer yep first they're claiming that they have it they're lying around they said they have done it the first millimeter wave 'em what will be soon commercially available and five gene so wow
