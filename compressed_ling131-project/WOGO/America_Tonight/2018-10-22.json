St Clair or give us a call the three nine is ... ... to ... [noise]\n\nDid you realize there are sixty nine days last\nIn the year and then we swing into twenty Nineteen officially really starting to feel like the holidays and also like sparring politically speaking because any where you live I'm sure you're seeing those lawn signs all over the place\nIs not a presidential election year but there are some big snakes out there for these mid term elections some big seats\nAre you voting hopefully you're registered to vote I like to say if you want to complain wine kick\nThe can down the road or whatever it is you want to do if you vote at least you're part of the process right it's so easy to say\nThat I don't like anyone running if more people voted then you would get people you liked running and if you've got a little bit more involved in the process I'm not here to lecture though this is supposed to be talk show where I definitely express my opinions and my opinion is because we have\nThe greatest country in the face of the earth where we've got free\nVoting meaning we are free and clear to vote how we choose they're not putting guns in our faces I saw that I witnessed that\nAnd we're not seeing stuffed ballot boxes in front of our eyes were were getting pushed to the ground told to shut our mouth so it's important in the mid term elections are very important there's been a lot of debating going on it's been a lot of campaigning I don't know about you but how many tax can I get\nFrom I'm In my case the cruise campaign or ... you know a beta Rourke it's crazy but I mean I'm getting bombarded from all sides but other people are telling me the same thing\nSo the big hospital is on especially where the races are close in that Senate race\nSo the big hospital is on especially where the races are close in that Senate race is actually a little closer than then um I think the cruise people would like and they've had a lot of debates and there's a lot of\nGlad handling going on shaking voters hands going out kissing babies doing the things\nPeriod you know that you do so we get closer to that that's part of the buzz but I think the other part of the buzz\nHas nothing to do with elections it has to do with a lottery mega millions\nBig big big it's up to a billion in fact one point six billion is the jackpot\nIt could be where some people when and split it could be one person wins the mega millions that could be a group of people go in at a factory at an office or wherever and they end up winning you know they say according to one paper in Nebraska anyway\nThey say they can figure that tickets sold for this last drawing at a rate of about four hundred minutes on friday ooh wow\nSo nobody won\nIt balloons up one point six million\nAnd it makes you wonder wow it's so big Powerball to nobody won Powerball so that shoots up as well\nAnd when the pot gets bigger people get more excited they buy more tickets or more people buy tickets and it becomes a lottery fever so now it's lottery fever\nAnd um they're investigating it there what are they going to do have a they say there's no change to what they're doing to manage the lions now in that area but\nHe does it does again illustrate how you can even when you think you know animals and the old thing if the animals can talk to 'em because this was unexpected not a not at all what you expected\nTo happen when they had this great behavior all the way through and of course they study that and then to\nSomething happens and its unexplainable on this very sad like I mentioned a lot of people certainly we're talking about it because\nI Know that I had I Know that I had people asking me questions did you hear it happened at the zoo and sadly after that I did not what happened that the ah the [noise] so we moved from the Indianapolis Zoo\nAnd it much different direction if you will and talking then about\nThe weather and talk about what's happening weather wise now that we're starting to see the big turn into the fall and after these hurricanes on through hurricane a Michael ... is happen with the the tragedy and it's much worse\nThan what some people thought happened in the aftermath thirty two people\nFrom across Florida Georgia North Carolina Virginia were killed Fifteen and Florida Bay county where it made landfall as a category for\nAnd the theory is still being seen because they're finding the rescuers are still finding people as of late date they're finding bodies and that's why the number has risen\nGet twenty five hundred structures damaged hundred and sixty two destroyed\nSo they've got transitional shelters up but you have people that are just still in shock 'cause you just imagine and I say this just imagine that what I don't care what ... what you're living in what kind of how how big it is whether that what it is just imagine\nThat you don't have electricity you don't have a house don't have anything and then you've got to figure out I granted with insurance and all that but you got to figure it out and everybody around you is to figure it out so this isn't happening overnight\nThis is going to take some time to sort it out get the checks get um ideas of where you're going to go you know really honestly\nPick up the pieces and it's tough to pick up\nIt's tough to pick up the pieces and just a reminder of that especially in being you know especially in and seeing that they're still finding people\n[noise] so it's not completely there are still areas where they're clearing it out there streets that are closed there's places where they don't have electricity and that makes it very very um tough and credibly tough\nAnd then there's this I read this story the other day between three hundred and seven hundred barrels of oil a day have been spewing since two thousand and four and a say in the Gulf of Mexico where and oil production platform\nAnd I said in the Gulf of Mexico\nWhere and oil production platform owned by the Taylor Energy company sank during hurricane Ivan\nBut for years there wasn't much conversation about it for ... year long oil leak off of leak off of the Louisiana coastline wow that's gotta be one of the worst in history I saw some photographs made me think of it because that's on some photographs I had no idea\nOf you know you think of Deepwater Horizon back in twenty ten but you see this\nAnd it's what's happening at the Gulf\nAnd the some of the biggest expansions of leases for oil and gas industry are in that area and that entire outer continental shelf to offshore\nDrilling it's such a a mixed bag I mean of course does does anyone want these oil leaks these oil spills no\nBut for teen years because they have broken wells that are releasing too much so much oil that researchers needed respirators to study the damage so when it took down that platform\nThat's what's happened so they can't even study it correctly\nUm they are doing you know that they say they're doing what they can but it's a very very difficult\nTo to figure that out on average\nThey say three hundred and thirty thousand gallons of critters spilled each year in Louisiana from offshore platforms and on shore oil tanks and of course the Gulf though is one of the most productive oil and gas regions in the world not just off the coast the United states\nAbout six hundred million barrels this year twenty percent of the total thinking this twenty percent of the total us oil production another forty barrels underground waiting\nTo be recover\nSo for every one thousand wells and state and federal waters there was an average of they say twenty uncontrolled releases of oil or blow out every year wow and knowing that that they have to deal with that\nLike BP for example sets aside money they've got sixty six billion for find legal settlements clean up\nOf all of that and it's the same with some of these other companies what they have to um rely on I mean what they have to think about because of\nThese spills and then that's true it's a tricky thing\nAnd the clean up and it's obviously pretty tricky\nWhen most people don't even realize what's happening there and certainly I'd have to say I was one of them I mean I knew their birth spills but I didn't realize there was one that was continuing continuing continuing to go I guess we're in that direction\nThe president has signaled some opposition to the nuclear waste site in Nevada uh despite the budget proposal to fund it to the president told a reporter he'd be inclined you'd be very inclined to be against storing waste near Yucca Mountain the administration has designated a hundred and twenty million for the\nProject so it looks like ... who knows is that going in a different direction or not um\nIn both of his budget plans to Congress they a designated the money for that\nAnd just to find the funding proposal energy secretary Rick Perry said we have a legal responsibility we have this waste out there we need to have this licensing issue addressed 'cause there's a licensing deal that's being discussed and\nAnd that divide all that they have that happen\nUm you forget about the whole Yucca Mountain thing until you talk to somebody who knows more about it or they're kind of in that I guess there in that somewhere near that area I suppose are we talking about numbers\nAnd some of the numbers for the box office have been pretty interesting you know we do our cheap movie review and uh the box office for star is born\nThat has been pretty good and not movies only been out a few weeks and that of course this Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper but venom is really ruling especially internationally you've got\nVenom crossing over you of star is born crossing over into the numbers that they thought they would see so then um had the number one spot abroad thirty two million from sixty five markets\nA total is Heathrow in North America that four hundred and sixty point two million a star is born the same thing they're cracking all kinds of\nMarkets it's generated twenty\nTwo million from Seventy five overseas markets the tally is Seventy four and totally globally is two hundred and one million but look at the comparison\nPrevent them four hundred and

kind of stuff some of those that I mentioned that you know it's big like people will spend money and do that isn't that wild um\n'cause I think it's become more controlled so I wondered about that if it was different\nAs I said we talk about the bus in the backyard so there is conversation about Halloween because people are decorating houses I've got a house near me great older couple their kids are grown and gone and all that but they still love Halloween I Swear they have eighty inflatable some not exaggerating I'm going to take a video and I'm going to posted on Kate ...\nIs Kate till any

missiles\nHe says he's gonna he's gonna dump out of that a Trump said Moscow has violated the\nThe intermediate range nuclear forces treaty and so he's going to hold the agreement why why bother he's thing\nTo do that uh you know that doesn't make any sense Russians violating it\nThey've done it for years we're not gonna let them violate this kind of an agreement and go out and do weapons then we're not allowed to it's ridiculous I agree with them if if if we say oh okay I don't do it we sign it it's been there for most of the Cold War U.S Russian summits were dominated\nBy nuclear weapons

it for one second to last segment of our one and it'll be our show that is um Wednesday Wednesday in to Thursday is the show where we do that to just\nRemember\nWednesday into Thursday unless there's something weird that comes up and I'll give you the heads up ahead of time on this was one of those weird things because I got trapped in the airport in Las Vegas the Dallas Fort Worth area has had\nMore rain I think we're having a crisis of identity where we were all of a sudden the Dallas Fort Worth area things in Seattle and the rain just keeps on solid and falling and it's messed up a lot of the flight so I\nCouldn't do that unfortunately at the tail end of the week or or I Would have but thanks for asking me that question it how about this\nThis is from a Mac who says\nKate what's your favorite scary movie census is Halloween what's your what's the one that's scared you the most well that's two different his favorite scary movie and then one that scared me the most I kind of like Ben movies but um\nBut since movies are different than flat out scary movies slasher movies I think are\nUm not not scary it's there because there's no sense it's the suspense that gets you so when I was a kid I was way too young probably to see this movie when I did but the movie Halloween I saw that movie and Michael Meyers that was scary to me\nSo now they have the remake forty years after the first original Halloween I guess forty years that's crazy so it it to open in first place Seventy seven millions\nIn ticket sales there's something about Halloween and Jamie Lee Curtis is back in this\nYou know all these years later and I wonder if the she was a teenager I think when that first one came out so I guess in the ... of it I don't know just the whole idea Halloween to movie Michael Meyers and that's um that's what's so to me the scariest movie 'cause I was so young\nSo little Saul Halloween that scared me and I would say um that to me was a scary scary movie suspenseful movies are the ones that will get me all the time\nAll the time because it's a central on what's going to happen next you know there was a movie called kissing the girls and who is in that movie I Can't think of it now I'm Morgan Freeman was in it\nAnd it was pretty scary so I Would put that ... up there I just moved I Love these the mail bag is this all over the place by the way\nInto onto more serious types in the mail bag and I get it so how about this one um this one is from Mitchell who says Kate\nI listen to the show a lot this is probably the second time I've emailed you I don't know I feel compelled to tell you that 'cause I guess everybody always says things like that um this whole thing about that 'cause shockey deal or to show the however you say his name\nIs just mind boggling to me and very sad how does he go on a consulate and ends up in pieces where they don't even know where his body you can't even say anything about it say they arrested people all seem like much baloney to me and it is\nReally frightening to think what they did and just member ing him and it puts us in a very awkward position when you think of dealing with the Saudi family the money with weapons\nThe ally ties to you know to um the crown prince and the post where he was a contributor is calling for investigations into his death by the United nations and Congress\nIncluding may say whether the Trump Administration has conspiring with the Saudis to cover up the murder of a distinguished journalist [noise]\n'cause his columns were pretty critical about the Saudi regime\nAnd he

sparring politically speaking because any where you live I'm sure you're seeing those lawn signs all over the place is not a presidential election year but\nThere are some big stakes out there for these mid term elections some big seeds\nAre you voting hopefully you're registered to vote I like to say if you want to complain wine kick the can down the road or whatever it is you want to do if you vote at least you're part of the process right it's so easy to say\nThat I don't like anyone running if more people voted then you would get people you liked running and if you go a little bit more involved in the process I'm not here to lecture those since we'd talk show where like definitely express my opinions and my opinion is because we have\nThe greatest country in the face of the earth where we've got free\nVoting meaning we are free and clear to vote how we choose they're not putting guns in our faces I saw that I witnessed that\nAnd we're not seeing stuffed ballot boxes in front of our eyes were were getting pushed to the ground and told us that our mouth so it's important in the mid term elections are very important there's been a lot of debating going on it's been a lot of campaigning I don't know about you but how many tax can I get\n[laughter] um I'm In my case the cruise campaign or they do a better work it's crazy but I mean I'm getting bombarded from all sides but other people are telling me the same thing\nSo the big hospital is on especially where the races are close in that Senate race is actually a little closer than than um I think the cruise people would like and they've had a lot of debates and there's a lot of\nGlad handling going on shaking voters hands going out kissing babies doing the things\nPeriod you know that you do because we get closer to that that's part of the buzz but I think the other part of the buzz\nHas nothing to do with elections it has to do with a lottery mega millions\nBig big big it's up to a billion in fact one point six billion is the jackpot\nIt could be where some people when and split it it could be one person wins the mega millions that could be a group of people go in at a factory at an office and wherever and they end up winning you know they say according to one paper in Nebraska anyway\nAnd they say they can figure that tickets sold for this last drawing at a rate of about four hundred minutes on friday ooh wow\nSo nobody won\nIt balloons up one point six million and it makes you wonder wow it's so big Powerball to nobody won Powerball so that shoots up as well and when the pot gets bigger people get more excited they buy more tickets or more people buy tickets\nAnd um they're investigating it there what are they going to do have a they say there's no change to what they're doing to manage the lions now in that area but\nHe does it does again illustrate how you can even when you think you know animals you know the old thing if the animals can talk to us um because this is was unexpected not a not at all ... you ... ... expected\nTo happen when they had this great behavior all the way through and of course they study that and then to\nSomething happens and its unexplainable on this very sad ... like I mentioned a lot of people certainly we're talking about it because I Know that I had\nI Know that I had people asking me questions did you hear what happened at the zoo and sadly after that I didn't know what happened to the U.S to do so we moved from the Indianapolis Zoo\nAnd much different direction if you will and talking bad about\nThe weather and talk about what's happening weather wise now that we're starting to see the big turn into the fall and after these hurricanes and through hurricane a Michael is happened we see the tragedy and it's much worse\nThan what some people thought happened in the aftermath\nThirty two people\nFrom across Florida Georgia North Carolina Virginia were killed Fifteen in Florida's day county where it made landfall as a category for\nAnd the fury is still being seen because they're finding the rescuers are still finding people's as of late date they're finding bodies and that's why the number has risen\nYet twenty five hundred structures damaged hundred and sixty two destroyed\nSo they've got transitional shelters up but you have people that are just still in shock 'cause you just imagine and I say there's just a magic and that what I don't care what ... what you're living in what kind of how how big it is whether that what it is just imagine\nThat you don't have electricity you don't have a house of anything and then you got to figure out I granted with insurance and all that but you got to figure it out and everybody around you is to figure it out so this isn't happening overnight\nThis is going to take some time to sort it out get the check get um ideas of where you're going to go you know really honestly pick up the pieces\nAnd it's tough to pick up it's tough to pick up the pieces and just a reminder of that especially in being\nYou know especially in and seeing that they're still finding people\nSo it's not completely there are still areas where they're clearing it out there streets that are closed there's places where they don't have electricity and that makes it very very um tough incredibly tough\nAnd then there's this I read this story the other day between three hundred and seven hundred barrels of oil a day have been spewing since two thousand and four out of sight in the Gulf of Mexico where\nAnd oil production platform owned by the Taylor Energy company sank during hurricane Ivan\nBut for years there wasn't much conversation about it for team year long oil leak off of leak off of the Louisiana coastline wow that's gotta be one of the worst in history I saw some photographs made me think of it because I saw some photographs I had no idea\nOf you know you think of Deepwater Horizon back in twenty ten but you see this\nAnd it's what's happening at the Gulf\nAnd the some of the biggest expansions of leases for oil and gas industry are in that area and that entire outer continental shelf to offshore\nDrilling it's such a a mixed bag I mean of course this does anyone want these oil leaks these oil spills no\nBut for the teen years because they have broken wells that are releasing too much so much oil that researchers needed respirators to study the damage so when it took down that platform\nThat's what's happened so they can't even study it correctly um\nThey are doing you know did they say they're doing what they can but it's a very very difficult to to figure that out on average\nThey said three hundred and thirty thousand gallons of critters spilled each year in Louisiana from offshore platforms and on shore oil tanks and of course the Gulf though is one of the most productive oil and gas regions in the world not just off the coast\nOh so is one of the most productive oil and gas regions in the world not just off the coast the United states about six hundred million barrels this year twenty percent of the total thinking this twenty percent of the total us oil production another forty barrel underground waiting\nTo be recover\nSo for every one thousand wells and state and federal waters there is an average of they say twenty uncontrolled releases of oil or blow out every year wow and knowing that that they have to deal with that\nLike BP for example sets aside money they've got sixty six billion or find legal settlements clean up of all of that and it's the same with one of these other\nCompanies what they have to um rely on I mean what they have to think about because of\nThese spills and then the ... it's a tricky thing\nAnd the clean up and it's obviously pretty tricky when most people don't even realize what's happening there and certainly I'd have to say I was one of them I mean I knew the birth still\nBut I didn't realize there was one that was continuing continuing continuing to go in that direction\nThe president has signaled from opposition to the nuclear waste site in Nevada uh despite the budget proposal to fund it to the president told a reporter he'd be inclined\nIt'd be very inclined to be against during waste near Yucca Mountain the administration has designated a hundred and twenty million for the\nProject so it looks like ... who knows is that going in a different direction or not um\nIn both of his budget plans to Congress they a designated the money for that\nAnd just to find that funny proposal energy secretary Rick Perry said we have a legal responsibility we have this waste out there we need to have this licensing issue addressed because there's a licensing deal that's being this stuff and\nAnd that divide all that they have that happen\nUm you forget about the whole Yucca Mountain thing actually talked to somebody who knows more about it or they're kind of in that I guess there in that somewhere near that area I suppose are we talking about numbers\nSome of the numbers for the box office have been pretty interesting yeah we do our cheap movie review and uh the box office were star is born\nThat has been pretty good and that movies only been out a few weeks and that of course this Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper but venom is really ruling a especially internationally you've got\nVenom crossing over you of star is born crossing over into the numbers that they thought they would see so that um had the number one spot abroad thirty million from sixty five markets\nA total Heathrow in North America that four hundred and sixty point two million a star is born same thing they're cracking all kinds of\nMarkets it generated twenty two million Seventy\nFive overseas market the tally is Seventy four\nAnd totally globally is two hundred and one million but look at the comparison prevent him four hundred and sixty point two million for stars born two hundred and one million although I think those are the total climb up perhaps even a little
