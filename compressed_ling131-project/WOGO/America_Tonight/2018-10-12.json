worst hurricanes of all time you know we're not fooling on this one\nAnd the descriptions of it looked like a bomb we've heard that before when there's been catastrophic damage after tornadoes and

thinking that you have to have emergency kits are you really doing that and the answer is yes\nBecause imagine this is going to hit landfall what are you got packed up what about your documents 'cause wanted shredded like tooth picks you're not finding those bills you're not finding the stuff that you need to find to to get through a what you have to get through\nYou're not finding it and hopefully you got it written down somewhere and that's basically what it looks like it looks like people are just trying to piece things together I mean people lose all their belongings like that too if you're just stuck you know somebody that when they were asked about it why didn't you get out\nI think are not even part of the equation office there of what happened was that I Know\nYou cannot bring back a life in some of these cases of twisted sick despicable and human acts so I think it's warranted of course is someone\nShouldn't receive the death penalty and it has been investigated to within an inch of any possible evidence that it would be the best case scenario so Thursday's\nThe Washington and people are listening to us from Washington Washington Supreme Court declared its death penalty unconstitutional\nAnd um it's the twenty states to band or to bend anyway capital punishment\nThe state's highest court didn't rule the death penalty illegal in of itself but rather the way it's been carried out so saying that it's an arbitrary and racially biased\nA lot of people who are legal scholars say that this is the latest step\nTowards the\nContinued abolition of the death penalty that this move and instead you know having these life in prison sentences is going to become more of the rule than the exception you\nKnow we've seen other legislatures current things over court six hundred New Jersey New York\nAnd there was a nationwide moratorium on the death penalty that was lifted in the mid seventies so executions actually peaked at Ninety eight Ninety nine but they've declined since ... twenty three and twenty Seventeen Eighteen so far this year and it's the\nDilemma it's the moral dilemma is the ethical dilemma it's the legal dilemma it's the wrestling with that it's people who disputed\nIt see because I'm open minded and look at all sides of it and I get that if you want it to look at all my ideologies they well they don't match up and I don't care because that's why I say I don't care if you're left of left or right of writers somewhere between or you say\nI don't need a label I Am who I Am and I vote for the person that I look at the issue\nAnd so for me diving deeper was the norm in my family and humid up your own mind whether people agree with you or not in your own family or outside of your own family I think\nThe good thing is and the places where it slow down\nWhen people were deciding the death penalty and the harshest punishment they could decide they really took things into account let's say\nThey really taken into account now one of the big argument that I'll get is well it's supposed to be a deterrent but isn't really a deterrent health of deterring heinous crimes because we're still things terrible things happen\n\nAnd I guess it depends yeah and it also depends on your philosophy sometimes religious belief\nCome into play are you an eye for an eye\nPerson do you really feel that way I just know from myself personally having covered crime at a very young age and seeing some on believable a brutal things happened to completely innocent people destroying their families making\nSo many weep uncontrollably and bringing them to their knees like I've never seen before in my life and knowing that definitely they had nailed the case shut that this was the way to go and does it bring relief does it bring\nUp a a rapid loose than to tie up for the family now because once somebody has taken away you can never get them back\nAnd it doesn't necessarily have that feeling maybe some would say that but I think most it's the opposite they they say they thought they would feel they would feel relief but they don't\nThey would feel relief\nBut they don't necessarily feel relief though where this goes is going to be pretty telling him pretty interesting I think\nI'm politically speaking ties to the path that kind of thing but the fact that\nThe impact of the jury's decision as to impose the death sentence if there is a racist hate to it to the practice of it than no\nA African Americans make up about Thirteen percent of the U.S population they account for thirty four points three percent of the defendants who were executed those are clearly statistics from\nDeath penalty and information that er I'm Seventy six percent of the victims in that case\nAnd the cases that result in an execution were white so
