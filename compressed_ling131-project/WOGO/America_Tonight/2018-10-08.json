C. but the country so here we are putting a I'm a foot\nIn the sand again on the Kavanaugh sandbox debate as to what happened and to me that now with so intriguing and I said the last couple of days that I thought it was going to be you know sixty forty\nThat he gets confirmed based on my conversations people I Know in Washington DC who are connected who are constantly on the hill who are and who are aids or who know aids or who are\nUm ... senators and all that kinda stuff so really decent sources but even season sources are not really sure because\nThey see a step back a step forward at this point though I think it's the steps forward so I'm I think it's Seventy five percent that he gets confirmed Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is advancing the nominations Supreme Court he did that\nBy insisting that they're going to get the results of the FBI supplemental background investigation it's going to be finished then of course there was a secret secret room in the capital and the senators Scott\nOf course there was a secret secret room in the capital and the senators got to go and look at what was then that report\nAnd the I'm going to be made public but but the\nDeal was they expect some of it to leak in certain areas where there was an evidence of assault those who have seen it say there's not enough there there's not enough to to say that\nIn this report it doesn't corroborate some of what was being said it's a forty six page report\nOn allegations of sexual assault by the Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh we know that right\nSo the FBI background investigation was like a compromise after the testimony from I'm Christine Ford and Kavanaugh about whether he attacked her during their high school years Nineteen eighty two at a party\nAnd in exchange for a vote to move Kavanaugh's confirmation to the full Senate Senator Jeff Flake was granted his request for an FBI investigation into charges by four to one of Kavanaugh's classmates at Yale Deborah Ramirez so Democrats and Republicans\nAlternated and going over the report and to our segment and it was the rotation they kept up all day long on Thursday\nAnd you know there were ... there were a centers whining about it that it's unusual circumstances in the process was unusual\nAnd the report was laid out in twelve section so they could easily swap them and make the most of their limited time and there was only one copy\nIf you are a brew crew fan the brewers when the national league\nDivision series first game they did it um\nAnd not the easy way though because it was the extra frames tenth

the mobile app and get it that way but um I I I picked him in the beginning of the year there there that team of not everybody's so famous on the team but they had that whole team attitude [noise]\nSo I think that's what it's about I think they've got that common goal and it really is about for the win for the win not so much for the me the means to me that I think it's I think they really have found that group will they win the world series that they got to get through this and it's one game\nRight so there's a lot left to come how about the Dodgers the Dodgers slug past the Braves and their National League\nUm division series they the Dodgers led the theories one or they leave that there is now one nothing they beat the Braves six nothing\nAnd um that a power display I mean that's what it was they were swinging away or whether it was you know a lead off home or whether it was I'm a solo shot in the sixth inning by and Ricky Hernandez whatever it was they did it to now game

he said I'm disappointed there aren't more students I think we're trying to address that I don't think they're entitled to anything\nUh I think he ought to be first come first served they don't want to come to the game they don't want to come but I'm sure there's enough people around here that would like to go to the games and we'd like for them to come to support the players how 'bout that

look get the best person on the bench period whoever the best person is\nLifted that this person on the bench because that's a lifetime appointment and it is an incredible honor to be tapped the egg to be picked for that it's something I'll never get paid for it something that nobody listening to this show because I guarantee you know the Supreme just listening to America denied I doubt it so I'm\nYou know what would that be like to be\nOn the bench in the highest court in Atlanta I mean that is an incredible honor to to to do that to be pegged as somebody who gets confirmed goes through and then\nHas the ultimate safe part of that process uh to me that something's really sacred and I hope we don't trample on all of that really honestly I Hope not\nSo the Republican save that Republicans are of safeguarding the FBI report\nAnd one by one I guess people are filing in and they're gonna read it and however long that takes a while to actually if you think about it\nWhat is really wild and really sad and more than wild [laughter] very very sickening I think is what happened with these officers six officers were hurt one killed in the south Carolina's shooting\nKnow I've heard this before because I have family members who are police officers that domestic violence that's where you can have a debt when you're a cop\nSo what happened was that was a two hour standoff and nice residential neighborhood in Florence County South Carolina\nIt was a man who had children hostage he fired on the cops from multiple agencies 'cause they were from a couple of different ones the kids were unharmed that's the good thing it started about four o'clock eastern\nWhat happened was the shares the Orange County sheriff's office tried to serve a search warrant at home\nI'm In a subdivision not far from where the flooding from Hurricane Florence\nReally the ripped up places and then the suspect started shooting they said all you can hear you know shops all over the place\nAnd the where he was positioned his view of fire was several hundred yards who had an advantage they say and imagined again trying to serve this\nSo I'm the wounded officers were evacuated they were transported to a hospital and the the one that was killed was a thirty year veteran of the police department and I mean really John ... um\nYou know talked about it I'm just ... talked about who it was a parents care away they say and I I just gosh it just breaks your heart when you hear these stories I mean how difficult it an awful lot and a lot of people were ...\nTo hurt when you hear these stories I mean how difficult it awful and a lot of people were tweeting out about a senator\nI'm Lindsey Graham said heartbroken oh God Bless the people who to protect us from their families a president tweeted out thoughts and prayers with the Orange County sheriff's office and the Florence police department tonight in South Carolina were grateful for law enforcement\nOfficers\nAnd then here's\nThe reaction and just a little more detail about the officers being shot\n\n'em and the more of that reaction is vi I'm governor from South Carolina said simply devastating news from Florence the selfless acts of bravery for men and women in law enforcement is real\nAnd it's um you know looking at a map and it really was in the middle of all the devastation that happened with the heavy flooding because of the hurricane and it's a\nIt's a city that's like kind of in the northeast because I spent some time now as you well know in South Carolina like in the northeast corner\nOf the kind of the of South Carolina and it's right where two majors thoroughfares or interstates you intercept Ninety five and twenty it's a pretty decent size city and I'm here is that reaction more reaction\nWas offered one of their\n... random\n[noise] yeah so random search warrant you're not looking for that to happen and this has been in domestic violence\nIs as I've heard from family members this is where is the scariest when they walk into a situation that they don't even know\nWhat they're walking into they have absolutely no idea ... wow [noise]\nIn the meantime with a little bit of this and that meaning things that we might miss out on the map up quickly I'll go to a couple of stories that I was looking at earlier in the um earlier in the day and\nOne of them was a this one and it it has to do with the fact that you've got um\nWell I like to have no idea what's going on with these airlines because we keep\nSeeing that none of these things are happening and they're having to to land a plane and when I say that there's kind of a may there was a mayday call with this Australian flight and it it you know the horror was\n... I mean what's going on because they just hear this mayday mayday just really creepy but they United a flight ended up landing thank goodness and ... it's\nA it landed safely in in Sydney after the hysteria over that it was seven eighty seven Dreamliner from Los Angeles\nAnd they had low fuel low fuel oh my gosh really oh that's awful so what do you do when you have low fuel while you do a mayday because what's gonna happen if you can't get there\nIt's going to it's going to trigger response and says two All right if you've got low fuel where can we possibly get you down and it was looking like\nThat's what was going to have to happen they were going to have to figure out a place where they could dump this flight and um it did it did land and then there was some kind of weird mechanical issue but they got to the gate the customers got off\nAnd are you at a hundred and eighty passengers for teen crew and it was a a few things that there's an international standard that requires when you get down to your fuel reserve you have to declare a fuel May Day you have to do that\nIn case you can't make down my God\nEven closer roads around the airport my on my\nWay to go to

least a hundred and forty million for sure like where it was tied\n'em there's the in the report they had a whole bunch of ways that this was being buried and now New York's department of taxation is vigorously pursuing this so when you look at this\nDo you think\nThat um this puts the presidency in peril or do you\nThink that um it could be just a matter of he's going to pay a ton of money back\nWell I think if there's this fraud and\nThe New York tax board goes after it and they can uncover the way it was being funneled\nThen they could charge interest and all of that on top of it and I think um yeah it would be a money thing it couldn't be criminal thing because the statute of limitations I've said this on another show would be up on that but um\nIt could be\nThat is the money thing that the ... they'd have to pay\nThe taxes whatever tobacco taxes were and if they go way back to think about the interest with that interest I guess look like would it look like\nI mean I think

a vote there's going to be a vote on um\nOn Kavanaugh and we keep hearing about these swing senators and what does that mean ultimately it is the talk of not just DC but the country so here we are putting a I'm a foot\nIn the sand again on the cabinet sandbox debate as to what happened and to me that now it's so intriguing\nAnd I said the last couple of days that I thought it was going to be you know the forty that he gets confirmed based on my conversations people I Know in Washington DC who are connected who are constantly on the hill\nWho are and who are aids or who know aids or who are um prepping senators and all that kind of stuff really these sources but even these sources are not really sure because\nThey see a step back a step forward at this point though I think it's the steps forward\nSo I'm I think it's Seventy five percent that he gets confirmed Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\nIs advancing the nomination Supreme Court he did that by insisting that they're going to get the results of the FBI supplemental background investigation it's going to be finished then of course there was a secret secret room in the capital and the senators got to go and look at what was in that report\nAnd the um without having made public but but the deal is they expect some of it to leak in certain areas where there wasn't evidence of the salt those who have seen it say there's not enough\nThere there's not enough to to say that\nIn this report it doesn't corroborate some of what was being said it's a forty six page report on allegations of sexual assault by the

think they really have found that group will they win the world series that they got to get through this and it's one game right so there's a lot less to come out about the Dodgers the Dodgers slug
