of Joe Biden is kind of interesting I was very surprised by that except for that he has not completely that I guess that he won't run and have in terms of the run before in\nA in a race that if it ended up um Biden who said he's not running for president at this point what if it was Joe Biden\nAnd\nPresident Trump would that even be close would that be close I mean not in fantasy land in just to put everything in sight and really honestly think about that for a second would that be a close\nA a close race at all and I look at 'em I mean definitely has people who would support him but in a in a wider range of election when you're talking about head to head of the two of them\nBoy that it's he's Seventy five right so then you look at Donald Trump\nAnd and then you look at what's happened I guess economy wise and what's happening with the as we talked about before what was NAFTA and now what that turned into\nSo he's Seventy four\nAnd Donald Trump is Seventy two so you'd have\nPut the years a couple of years from now add that on to it wow so a fascinating to me that people were talking about president that it would eventually be younger but it's the opposite of that most of what the polls\nAre showing\nOur it's older skewing older regardless I think it no matter what is being said now I just had this discussion with somebody who is pretty high up in the Democratic party to me it's really about\nIf the economy is doing well if there are seeing that everyday American see you know what's in your wallet all politics are local if all of that is going well and then you have an independent who could good decide one way or decided another way\nHow how are you swinging not as charismatic just the same old people that are being thrown up again how are you really running a campaign re feel like you have a really good chance to ignite a bunch of people\nI don't know how are you doing that to me if I'm if I'm\nA campaign manager strategist I guess would be the the better title if I'm a strategist is that what I'm looking for is that the direction I'm going in right\nI got to think now they there has to be some other way to there has to be somebody else has to be some other ... rather than going back into the pool for years later ... more maybe I'm wrong maybe it's the people are familiar with the names I don't know\nIt doesn't make any sense to me to me\nAre familiar with the names I don't know it doesn't make any sense to me to me you think that there'll be somebody there'd be some somebody that would be would be being talked about that came out of sort of\nKnow where if you want to think of people that have come out of\nNowhere a Bill Clinton would fall into that category Obama would fall into that category I'm taking Democrats because they didn't come out of nowhere that nobody thought that that was a possibility but then all of a sudden they were there right governor of Arkansas senator barely Obama was\nBut not a lot known about them rather than this long history of somebody that run a few different times there was that experience over unknown is it a different quantity how do you had to have you beat someone if the economy especially\n[noise] is doing well because\nIf if politics or about that and they are\n'cause it's feeding your family it's what the future looks like if you have children oh my gosh how are they going to school are they going to school or their trades they can still going to or their jobs or they're living wages are there you know are there incentives for companies to stay in America that all that kinda stuff\nIs plays into it it does it plays into how you'll elect somebody so if the Democrats are going about it that way\nSeems so I don't know it seems backwards to me seemed backwards you you might have seen this maybe you didn't the pressure as did a sixty minutes interview with Leslie stall and he\nWas asked there was it was two segments I thought he was asked a couple of years that's a lot of different questions from you know allies enemies what's going on domestically people in his White House you know that kind of thing\nI'm now that we just had a hurricane Michael he was asked ... it's all asked him about the impact and what he changed his mind and is there really climate change and he\nSaid I'm not denying climate change but it could very well go back you know we're talking about over millions of years and Lesley Stahl said but that's an eyeing it and he said you'd have to show me the scientist because they have a very big political agenda\nAnd the other thing that came up on the one on one situation Kim Jong un\nAnd she asked um him\nDo you trust him and he said I Do trust him yes that doesn't mean I Can't be proven wrong\nAnd she said why would you trust him and he said well first of all if I didn't trust him I wouldn't say that you would not be foolish to tell you right here on sixty minutes he said the fact is I Do trust him but we'll see what happens and um\nYou know he he said\nOne of the things she said that I thought was interesting and his response was interesting is she brought up millennia Trump and her comment in an ABC News interview last week where\nShe did she didn't she didn't trust everybody in the White House and said it's harder to govern you always need to watch your back\nAnd the president said I feel the same way I don't trust everyone in the White House I'll be honest with you so that was interesting 'cause you know we've seen people that are fun now there's speculation all over the place and then\nThe Russian meddling in as so asked about that and\nTrump said ... you know Russia wasn't alone he thinks China meddled too and other countries and Lesley Stahl said this is amazing your diverting the whole Russia thing and he said I'm not doing anything he said you are so there were it was awful cantankerous actually 'cause he answered the question\nAnd she asked the questions that if he didn't answer them\nThe way she wanted he or she you know kept asking him questions one of the things that was also interesting she asked Trump about his sea legs as president and he said he found that a little surreal to save president United States is that in the beginning he quickly said now I very\nMuch feel like ... I Do I feel like the president and she said and you feel comfortable and that was you know kind of that there were some of the takeaways\nThat I think people will talk about from that\nInterview for what it's worth um you know these are the things that are that he talks about anyway over Twitter but just a one on one situation what um what the answers were to you know we're to that what were the ... the biggest\nConversation pieces I guess in that interview and I think he I I mean honestly I think\nThat's good I think he should do more of those kinds of interviews if he if there's people you know from all kinds of different people in the ... the media why not because he certainly\nKnows how to handle media and there's more steps ability I suppose in that\nI I'm not saying all the time but to just do a couple of these uh a quarter even would be good especially if it's run up for the election and then we'll see what the Democrats do and what happens with the independent stay with us\n\nI this is Dave states like I've been with W.

really cool interesting technologies we have in these products that really kind of lead to how guys clean and you know the clean delayed delayed delayed delayed male cleaning regimen\nThis odor eliminating sprays that mechanism where you can continue to not clean and still have the appearance of cleanliness\nGuy appearance of cleanliness so as somebody who knows how to market just kind of stuff I mean that's a real house I know that you can get it on Amazon what made you decide on the packaging and how you were going to make it available to people\nSo it was a couple of things right now our product line out in the marketplace there are it's four different products it's a laundry detergent edition hands so an all purpose cleaner in the odor eliminating spray that we discussed\nThe product line was put together to mimic a male cleaning regiment of that cleaned ... this is the least number of products you would need to clean everything in our products are multi use you can use it on everything and they're not going to hurt anything so for example\nYou know the major cleaning companies would love to have you by Seventeen different spray cleaners to clean every little different surface like need one for wood and tile and marble and\nIt's all the same stuff basically and so far all purpose cleaner you can use on every surface or dishing hand so probably it's great on hands is great dishes is good Greece cutter if you need to make soapy water to wash your car before it's all very flexible we spend a lot of time trying to figure out All right\nHow can we make this guy easy simplify this whole process of guys don't clean a lot in the kind of confused with a myriad of products down their front packaging standpoint we wanted to make sure that it felt\nVery male so we have a new branding and packaging looked it's launching actually next week and the products that around the marketplace right now are very kind of modeled after automotive looking products and we had a lot of reaction from the retailers it all looks a little too automotive and so\nOur new packaging is going to be dark it's going to be very ... acts\nAnd maybe for men and do for ... plus care for men so we have like gun metal gray bottles and the labels are black with carbon fibre texture on it and so we went in super aggressive so when somebody walks down the cleaning products out they look at our brand\nThey're going to know it's for guys because she had to look so different than anything else in that style and we're really just trying to make that connection just say hey listen if you walk down the personal care Iowa you kinda get a sense that everything's going dark and manly and all that with the men's personal care products gorgeous\nRecreating that and the cleaning products style I Love it and\nIt you know you're a kid who grew up as a write your father worked for Proctor and gamble for for decades\nAnd he was a career Proctor and gamble a guy for sure yeah he's retired for food Eighteen Nineteen years and kind of a running joke in the family as a dad and trying to ruin your retirement for some reason to feel threatened at the moment but hopefully we can change that\nNot threatened I Love it here's another thing we want to make sure that I tell everyone yeah though for here a dash clean dot coms where you go but also a portion of what you make goes to veterans tell me about that\nPart yeah so we wanted to be a company that you know obviously creates great products were trying to create a new\nCategory and the cleaning product style but we also want to give back and when the brand started evolving in the hero name and the star it just screamed military\nAnd so back when I was putting this altogether a friend of a friend was starting a charity called the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans of America the guy named Paul ... off and he's ex military ex Wall Street fireball I mean super super super ... is a hugely Energizer Bunny and he created this\nCharity that really focuses on a lot of peachy as the issues they're very involved in a lot of the government regulations as far as the VA hospital and he's one of those guys who's sitting\nAnd senator and house member offices all the time he was just getting off the ground when we were getting off the ground we sat down we met and we have very similar views of our respective world as far as disruption and there's a different way to do this and all that and it just kind of clicked and so we can partner with them we give\nSeven percent of our net sales to them\nAnd we bring them to a retailer meetings so for example Paul and I are actually going up and sitting down with the senior management of target and a few weeks to come up with new ways that they can help veterans that work at target and their guests that are also that so we want to be one of those companies that doesn't just write a check we want them to be part of\nThe fabric of our company and so we're doing that in a daily basis trying to figure out a new and better ways for our brand also help them try to make it successful run for us\nThe chicken might eat he a hero clean my thanks thanks so much for having me\nNever wonder how

was just kind of an exciting game sometimes football can be the unite or let's put it that way so it is the mail bag and some of you did say something about the game so I'm just going to go to a couple of quick one this one\nIs from jak who says Kate I'm going to get in on that action I Swear it I Swear it I saw it I just fall asleep I have crazy wicked hours sometimes I'm On the third shift but that's usually when it's your day off\nAnd um I listen to the show all the time I Love that I even turned my wife onto it\nAnd we love love love nailed the score I promise you one of us is going to represent the Sam on believable Sunday night game I'm certain you saw it I've heard you on the other network as well very cool\nAnd I can't believe that it came down to a kick with the time winding down that's just vintage Brady but you got to give the chiefs credit they played one hell of a game and it was very very fun to watch that and forget about everything else for a while\nI have this one this one is from Tom and he says Kate\nOn the misery index I have to tell you that my daughter in law has a house that had the roof ripped off outside of Mexico beach we were scared to death\nFor um her and her friends and for others that we knew that were kind of envy the area but luckily nobody was killed and for the most part\nThey survive with their homes somewhat intact pillows going to be some rebuilding their\nAnd a neighborhoods are math they got to tell you that in a lot of different pockets that you would be\nProbably surprised about take my mind off of all of that I was watching this Sunday night game normally\nI wouldn't necessarily watch that because my team is the rams so I'm always busy watching the rams but don't watch very much of anything else I get\nAll uptight about politics and then I'm focused on my own business so I have to tell you I did watch and I was so impressed with this kid quarterback from Texas where did he go to college he went to Texas Tech cut my home he did he went to Texas Tech and\nHe was um you know highly touted but did we did anybody think that he was going to explode like this well of course any of the guys that\nDidn't coaching him from the time he was young I could tell you what kind of guilty had but a boy he is really showing off those skills to that loss of the patriots just by kick forty three forty or the high scoring game and it's funny Sunday night games seem to be so close to the last one was all about defense and this one\nWas all about off and so I guess that's just you know the\nIt goes and it was a decisive kind of a thing and it was a game that\nJust kind of had championship Britain all over it so there you go I just move on to something completely different\nHow about this this comes to us from Julie and Julia Says Kate I just got to tell you I understand Saturday Night live and all the poking that they do Donald Trump and the administration I Know they always do that with anyone who's in office and the politics of the day\nBut I'm just tired of Alec Baldwin and it's our put states as it was I have to say I'm a Trump supporter but I'm not offended necessarily by joke however this joke is like gone on too long it's just not funny any more sort of like\nYou know when you tell a joke over and over again it's become a joke over and over again [laughter] oh well you said it I mean this is what happened on a show like Saturday Night live especially because\nIn it's heyday remember there were only a handful of stations to watch now it's I'm sure very difficult to get viewers so anything politically speaking especially in a polarized nation that is going to trip the needle\nPolitically speaking especially in a polarized nation that's going to trip the needle in any direction [noise] that's exactly what that is exactly what's going to happen especially to lead off a show\nIt's interesting a politics of another note there are a lot of you were talking about the midterms and what did I think about the midterms will be finally see a lot of people come out and vote\nAnd I got this one from Barry who says Kate do you think because of all the vitriol between the Democrats the Republicans the undecided then whatever you want to say\nWhat we saw with the whole ... thing and what we see what the Russian investigation and just constantly every single day the conversations do you think we're going to see more people vote in the mid term elections this time around ...\n[noise] you know if you look at polls when people are asked are you gonna vote and have you registered and they kept popping out all the list of ... when when you had to be registered by across the country you would think that and you know my thing is this I don't care how you vote vote and then you can complain\nSo we live in a country where you're not getting shot when you go to vote you they're not stuffing the ballot box like I saw in Mexico's scared me to death when there was shocked that were above my head because we were with a camera crew and I had no clue what was going on between the pre in the pan east is but I Know that I saw that\nIt was frightening 'cause to me it seemed like such a lay up in our country it is to just go and vote and I think you you owe it to yourself to to exercise that right and I think what happens is for some people\nThey'll say who cares I hate I hate what's happening I might have over anyone but that I'm\nBeing like that and not paying attention is what allows us to keep going down the same lethargic path and then complaining about what we don't like there's a better chance you might find somebody that you like you might encourage somebody runs starting locally\nAnd we could change\nYou know the game around but you can't do that if you consistently have that that attitude so\nI I I'm always hopeful that more people will vote in any of the elections and I hope the midterm elections bring anyone out who's eligible think about your own neighborhood you know locally what's happening in your state some important issues what's on the ballot it's so easy to find out and you know\nArm yourself with the fact that you want to hear about and go and vote now the latest poll I saw that Seventy seven percent of voters are they there are certain to vote in the mid term elections let's see what those numbers add up to be\nHow about this I got this one from Gordon he said Kato would you still do the radio shows if you won the mega millions or the Powerball\n... well that's like a loaded question because here's the thing nobody hit the Powerball jackpot on Saturday he might want to go buy a Powerball tickets\nAre nearly a billion dollars are you kidding so if you look at the if you look at mega millions I guess in the Powerball we're talking about serious money so the mega million jackpot for Tuesday is\nThe largest ever in the game it's six hundred and fifty four million the mega millions is six hundred and fifty six million and I'm\n... so the jackpot for the Powerball is going to be three hundred and forty five million I guess it's crazy to mega millions record of six hundred and fifty six by the way\nSo I don't know if I Won [laughter] if I Won\nA that kind of lottery I just you know what I Do I have some cool people and radio that have had to really eked out a living I probably would do the answer your question honestly I just buy a radio station right I'd talked gee the N we'd syndicated\nPrograms whatever\nAnd that's the answer I mean I Love doing this so in some form that wouldn't go away um but all the people I Know that have been messed over in the business and that are awesome at what they do\nI Would get a gift for them that's what\nHonestly at least for a while at least for years though right now what are the chances of me winning like a zillion\nI\nI'm a veteran weird on line and Vietnam when I came home I didn't know where\nTo turn as America's veterans face challenges ... there\nBy the judge didn't never given the whole night was just always there to remind me we have a life\nTo live da de provides a lifetime of support helping veterans of every generation get the benefits they burn ... [noise] but after I got out I was going to use alone and home every year ... helps more than a million veterans so they could reach victories great and small\nJewish family to support to get back on my feet now I'm Judy brings rife with my family\nAnd finally admitted it might be TST I wasn't doing well\nLook there's more to be drawn in more victories to be one\nNow I Wish I'd found Davey sooner\nThan I Am a veteran [noise] my victory and just enjoying each day [noise]\nThe red Sox beat the Astros and the second game seven to five\nOr so we may see a I think both of these have the makings of a good championship series on both sides\nTo fight for the right to be in the world series\nWas did you know the NBA is going on well yes of course it is and people are talking about predictions and what's gonna happen and what the season looking like and all of that because this is the time of year that you do that and we\nWe look at later on it's all about LeBron James and has moved to Los Angeles\nAnd people are picking the warriors still for the three peat so is it another Oakland title\nBefore the um [noise] you know before\nThe move or not because after forty seven years at oracle arena the warriors are going to move to the case that are in San Francisco\nIt's always tough are loyal fans and you think well you know how far apart is that if you know anything about San Francisco or some of these big cities that like a world of difference\nPlaying at oracle arena versus San Francisco getting their all that stuff blah blah blah playing in Oakland versus playing in San Francisco it's all about stadiums how much money is being put up\nHow much in the taxpayers are paying what is going on with sales tax what is the owner\nHauling in where should we put the stadium I've worked in places where that's been such major discussion when I talk about the bus in the back yard and the man cave that's part of the bugs cars do you want to pay for it or not\nAnd a lot of times people especially if they have no interest in it why are we paying how can we have to pay more\n... and sometimes you really get jobs on what you think is going to be\nA good situation because you always get soldiers idea that how wonderful is going to be and then it doesn't turn out the wonderful and it's kind of depends on where it is I suppose the team and then what's around it and how easy\nIt is to get in and out does it gum up the traffic in one way or another because isn't it all that traffic I mean what is what the common denominator always say the weather is the traffic is one of them right\nFor sure the um\nWork situation that's another one where you work and do you have hang dog look when you're pumping the gas and you're going to work and the person next year's does something and uh and you just want to get in and out of work quickly or is the opposite I mean these are the three major major bullet points for aid\n[laughter] but the arena when there's ever a fight over an arena and there was a fight over this arena\nWhen there's ... whenever there's a fight then it becomes sticky and\nPeople get upset when are getting left behind the fan bases don't like it\nAnd then who's pulling you know who's paying for it and how are they pulling people in and then what happens to the ticket prices because a lot of times these ticket prices which are out of reach for the common than become a little bit higher even after that\n'cause they have to they have to charge up somehow and they pass it on\nA little bit ticket why even if they have specials which especially in the NBA a lot of times they'll have some good specials and they do that major league baseball I Would venture to say really 'cause it's such a\nCrazy marathon and baseball during the regular season it may be of all the sports the cheaper sport like when there's like dollar hotdog nights or whatever to get\nCheaper kick it especially the team is doing well if the team is doing well yeah forget about it it's a much different situation\nAnd college football a lot of people whether they went to college or not it's a college that's in there we'll houses in their backyard\nPeople always liked to talk about college football and it was an interesting week because Notre Dame now is in the running for one of those semifinal games will see what the college football selection committee says but Notre Dame\nAnd the a P poll comes in at number four so that would put them in the range is the selection committee agrees with that you've got Alabama of course the runaway number one\nOhio State to LSU jumps back to number five LSU\nWith a huge win beating Georgia and number two really for laying them college football's may is\nSo interesting on Saturday when you wake up and you start watching the ... how many games crazy right now there is only\nTalk here teams and then the others the out of eight ranked teams overall that lost on Saturday including ...

you're talking about\nFinally kids are coming back to Florida State in Tallahassee and some of the other universities around there\nBut they're search and rescue crews even after these couple of days still kind of picking through the rubble of these neighborhoods that have been completely shattered Seventeen people at least that there could be more entire communities just wiped out by a cat

like first you thank God when everybody in your world is alive\nAnd hopefully that was the case for most I said there were Seventeen that died but um you know it's the process of rebuilding and ... it's tough it's devastating their significant damage that required all kinds of things for for people evacuating coming back\nAnd then here's the other part of the there were some houses where there

are completely ripped apart by storm picking through their stuff is just so sad to me right um\nAnd what most of the I've seen lots of interviews with people but most people are saying is they're sifting through what's left and they'll manage to figure out what to do and if they can save anything they'll save whatever that is but boy oh boy it's um\n[noise] it's crazy to look and see if

two of them\nBoy that it's he's Seventy five right so then you look at Donald Trump\nAnd and then you look at what's happened I guess economy wise and what's happened with the as we've talked about

to me that people were talking about president that it would eventually be younger but it's the opposite of that most of what the polls are showing\nOur older skewing older regardless I think it would no matter what is being said now I just had this discussion with somebody who is pretty high up in the Democratic party to me it's really about\nIf the economy is doing well if there are seeing that

wrong maybe it's the people are familiar with the names I don't know\nIt doesn't make any sense to me to me you think that there'll be somebody there'd be some somebody that be would be being talked about that\nCame out of sort of know where if you want to think of people that have come out of\nNowhere a Bill Clinton would fall into that category Obama would fall into that category of taking Democrats because they didn't come out of nowhere that nobody thought that that was a possibility but then all of a sudden they were there right governor of Arkansas senator barely Obama was\nBut not

companies to stay in America that all that kind of stuff\nIs plays into it it does it plays into how you'll elect somebody so if the Democrats are going about it that way it seems so I don't know it seems backwards to me seemed backwards to you\nYou might have seen this maybe you didn't the predators did a sixty minutes\nYou might have seen this maybe you didn't the predators did a sixty minutes interview with Leslie stall and he was asked there was it was two segments I thought he was asked a couple of years that's a lot of different questions from you know\nAllies enemies what's going on domestically people in his White House you know that kind of thing and I'm now that we just had a hurricane Michael\nHe was asked Leslie stall asked him about the impact in what he changed his mind and is there really climate change and he\nSaid I'm not denying climate change but it could very well go back you know we're talking about over millions of years and Lesley Stahl said but that's an eyeing it and he said you'd have to show me the scientist because they have a very big political agenda\nAnd the other thing that came up on the one on one situation Kim Jong un\nAnd she asked um him\nDo you trust him and he said I Do trust him yes that doesn't mean I Can't be proven wrong and she said why would you trust him and he said well first of all if I didn't trust him I wouldn't say that you would not be foolish to tell you right here on sixty minutes he said the fact is I Do trust them but we'll see what happens\nAnd um\nYou know he he said one of the things she said that I thought was interesting and his response was interesting is\nShe brought up millennia Trump and her comment in an ABC News interview last week wishing that you didn't she didn't trust everybody in the White House and that it's harder to govern you always need to watch your back\nAnd the president that I feel the same way I don't trust everyone in the White House I'll be honest with you so that was interesting 'cause you know we've seen people that have fallen out there's speculation all over the place and then\nThe Russian meddling is so asked about that and\nTrump said try you know Russia wasn't alone he thinks China meddled too and other countries and Lesley Stahl said this is amazing your diverting the whole Russia thing and he said I'm not doing anything she said you are so there were it was awful cantankerous actually 'cause he answered the question\nAnd she asked the questions if he didn't answer them\nThe way she wanted he or she you know kept asking him questions one of the things that was also interesting she asked Trump about his the legs as president and he said he found it a little thrilled essays president United States is that in the beginning he quickly said now I very\nMuch feel like ... I Do I feel like the president and she said and you feel comfortable and that was you know kind of that there were some of the takeaways that I think people will talk about from that\nInterview for what it's worth um\nYou know these are the things that are\nThat he talks about anyway over Twitter but just a one on one situation what um what the answers were\nTo you know we're to that what were the ... the biggest conversation pieces I guess in that\nInterview and I think he I I mean honestly I think\nThat's good I think he should do more of those kinds of interviews if he is there's people you know from all kinds of different people in the media why not because he certainly\nKnows how to handle media and there's more ability I suppose in that [noise]\nI I'm not saying all the time but

knows how to market just kind of stuff I mean that's how I Know that you can get it on Amazon what made you decide on the packaging and how you were going to make it available to people\nSo there's a couple of things right now our product line out in the marketplace there are four different products it's a laundry detergent edition hands so an all purpose cleaner in the order limiting spray that we discussed\nThe product line was put together to mimic a male cleaning regiment of that cleaned ... this is the least number of products you would need to clean\nEverything in our products are multi use you can use it on everything and they're not going to hurt anything so for example you know the major cleaning companies would love to have you by Seventeen different spray cleaners to clean every little different surface like you need one for wood and tile and marble and\nIt's all the same stuff basically and so\nFar all purpose cleaner you can use on every surface or dish and hands so it's great on hand is great do dishes is good in Greece cutter if you need to make some water to wash your car up before it's all very flexible\nWe spent a lot of time trying to figure out All right how can we make this guy easy simplify this whole process of guys don't clean a lot and they're kind of confused with a myriad of products down there\nFor packaging standpoint we wanted to make sure that it felt very male so we have a new branding and packaging will it's launching actually next week and the products that around the market place right now are very kind of modeled after automotive looking products and we had a lot of reaction from the\nRetailers that it looks a little too automotive and so our new packaging is going to be\nDark it's going to be very ... acts and it'd be for men and do for ... plus care for men so we have like a metal gray bottles and the labels are black was carbon fibre texture on it and so we went in super aggressive so when\nSomebody walks down the cleaning products style they look at our brand they're going to know it's for guys because it'll look so different than anything else\nIn that style and we're really just trying to make that connection to say you know hey listen if you walk down the personal care Iowa you kind of get a sense that everything's going dark and manly and all that with the men's personal care products gorgeous\nRecreating that and the cleaning products so\nI Love it and it you know you're a kid who grew up and they write your father worked for Proctor and gamble for for decades\nAnd he was a career Proctor and gamble a guy for sure yeah he's retired for Eighteen Nineteen years and kind of the running joke in the family as a dad returned to ruin your retirement for some reason he doesn't feel threatened at the moment but hopefully\nNot threatened I Love it here's another thing we want to make sure that I tell everyone yeah they'll for here a desk clean dot coms where you go but also a portion of what you make goes to veterans tell me about that part\nYeah so we wanted to be a company that you know obviously creates great products were trying to create a new category and the cleaning products style but we also want\nTo give back and when the brand started evolving in the hero name in the star it just screamed military and so\nBack when I was putting this all together a friend of a friend was starting a charity called the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans of America\nPaul Reich off and he's ex military ex Wall Street fireball I mean super super super easy easy Energizer Bunny and he created this\nCharity that really focuses on a lot of peachy as the issues that are very involved in a lot of the government regulations as far as the VA hospitals and he's one of those guys who's sitting in senator and house member offices all the time he was just getting off the ground when we were getting off the ground\nWe sat down we met and we have very similar views of our respective world as far as disruption and there's a different way to do this and all that and it just kind of clicked and so we've been partnering with them we give seven percent of our sales to them\nAnd we bring them to a retailer meetings so for example Paul and I are actually going up and sitting down with the senior management of target\nAnd a few weeks to come up with new ways that they can help veterans that work at target and their gas that are also that so we want to be one of those companies that doesn't just write a check we want them to be part of\nThe fabric of our company and so we're doing that a daily basis trying to figure out a new and better ways for our brand also help them try to make it successful run for us\nChicken out might eat me or if you're a clean my thanks
