what does that mean ultimately it is the talk of not just DC but the country so here we are putting a I'm a foot\nIn the sand again on the cabinet sandbox debate\nAs to what happened and to me that's now which so intriguing\nAnd I said the last couple of days that I thought it was going to be you know sixty forty that he gets confirmed based on my conversations people I Know in Washington DC who are connected who are constantly on the hill who are and who are aids or who know aids or who are\nUm prepping senators and all that kind of stuff so really the sources but even season sources are not really sure\nBecause they see a step back a step forward at this point I think it's the steps forward so I'm I think it's Seventy five percent that he gets confirmed Senate majority leader Mitch

left to come out about the Dodgers the Dodgers London past the Braves and their National League\nUm division series they the Dodgers led the series the one they leave that there is now one nothing

doing a detailed internal investigation to determine the cause of the accident but\nI think that you got to look at limousines man and we look at regulations and weather really they're good enough\nWould you want to get into a limousine right now realizing what it's been converted from and yes I mean just because somebody has an accent that that's the most horrible accident we've seen him in a very long time do you panic I think it makes you\n\nTake a closer look at what you're getting into his ear trusting with your life\nAnd doing a little sleeve things even before the accident some of the people in the limousine we're taxing that they didn't feel safe\nI it was kind of like a foreshadowing moment so this needs to be I think a wakeup call to Amy one\nWho is thinking of renting a limo just be very careful with these converted limos because a lot of them are converted they're smaller and then they make them big or just a big thing because of the way they jacked up the way they look\nThey look cool but how are they link thinning them how are they raising them how are they making the after market adjustments that they make how are they modifying it that's gotta be a very very big concern to anybody who's thinking about this anyway\nI went off on a tangent but a couple of you sent me notes about this I got this one\n\nFrom Alford who says Kate I've driven limousine I've taken limousines in my life and I think what's really to blame is the fact that somebody gets a limousine and they do all kinds of adjustments to it and then they take too many people in it\nAnd that's the problem it's human error I mean the driver wasn't even certified for goodness sake of someone who's driven limousine I Know just how risky that can be then I got this one from pat who says boy I'll tell you what\nA I've written and all kinds of situations have been picked up from parties gone down town from further away in big cities I live in a rural area and often I take the whole over lift deal but I don't\nWorry so much about that there's people that I've come to trust to know when I look at their record but that's different than the limousine where they were ... stuffing them in like they were stuffing all of and obviously there were a lot of problems you feel really sad when you\nRead the story of the the crash and um\nDid the story of the the crash\nAnd um what happened then and how many of those more family members and no matter what the NTSB says Kate it can't bring back the lives of the people that were lost and they were young there was even from newly wed yeah there was some newlywed that\nUm we're in the limousine is supposed to be a big funds party and\nI think it was I said this what was that was listening to the first responder\nReally start to cry get choked up saying that people were alive when he's pulling them out and of course none of them live so I Hope that other people take a close look at it I mean look that funded riding a limousine have you written in the limousine\nBut there's different kinds of limousine so I guess it's good to to really dig into the background um sometimes we get fooled into that\nSecurity that that sense of security\nAnd we don't poke around enough and I hope to make people laugh\nTo more questions that's all I Hope I have this one this from Anthony on hurricane Michael okay looking at at uh Pensacola scares the Jesus out of me I have family members there I heard you talk about Florida State\nAnd the fact that I'm Florida State is basically shut down\nAnd telling people to go home and that's a smart decision because thousands of people would be there on campus and it's right in the eye of what looks to be a horrific\nStorm and who knows what the water is going to be a wall of water\nAnd trying to escape that would be ridiculous so I Hope people are paying attention to the people in their local news that cetera and they are boarding up and getting out and they're gone by the time you possibly read my email\n\nAnd things that read the big giant chunk of ... that just scream get out of there and that's what it looked like to me I mean it's you know nasty nasty a stuff and then there's this one from Craig ...\nAnd Anthony wiener who screwed up a lot of lives is being released from prison early I think it was one of the dumbest moves with Hillary Clinton to pick with his wife\nHad am I Am theme when Anthony wiener was so toxic but anyway he's supposed to get out of prison three months earlier than originally was scheduled to what gives with that\nYeah he remembered this since twenty seven teams he pled guilty to one in charge of transferring obscene material to a minor in a federal court\nAnd there was a Fifteen year old girl and it was and social media site for a couple of months so um\nThey're saying that there for good behavior for whatnot\nThey he gets those um month I guess shaved off he was sentenced to Twenty one months altogether in a federal prison so his prison term would have ended in August the twenty ninth team his new release date I guess is is may and it is because of\nGood conduct time earned that kind of thing and uh that's typical of what could happen which is why you know that that's why they're saying that so I'm wow he you know\nHe really did he packed a lot of people I mean ... I think he tanked even more a tank Hillary Clinton's because remember the whole emails saying the FBI investigation surfacing you know the email server on his laptop and uh the former FBI Director James Comey announcing his\n\nAction day and yeah he he he definitely has some serious egg on a safe for not just that but a couple of different things he gets the past the first\nTime around when it happened again something happens and then he has the latest thing that happened um was the Fifteen year old girl and twenty six teams that was just like I said\nToxic everyone around him [noise]\nI haven't heard that name a longtime Anthony wiener\nHang with us we jump over the other side and we're going into the man have capital of port Huron America Tonight [noise]\nIf you want to live longer you don't need to take every day you exercise [noise]\nAnd get your sleep and just like your body your car performs best one needs properly cared for by courtesy auto in trucks\nCenter may be certified to explain what your vehicle needs with their prices and free service loners plugs quickly services on Saturday requested an appointment courtesy auto and truck dot com and help your car live longer courtesy on trucks and just off highway twenty nine store [noise]\nEconomy furniture that\nTo gym but\nDon't have to wait for me the median\nEverything prices on the best friend Dave finances in June of\nPresident George Herbert Walker Bush and how long is he around after um after her death\nBut he seems to be okay from some of the latest conversations I've had with people who are familiar with who knows the bushes who know the Bush is um [noise]\nSo that was a mega deal at the time Seventy million but that is a song compared to what the than a family gets and what the chargers would be is value waited at the the numbers when they look at the the I was just looking at a story about the NFL next five one hundred million\nMega deal what would the contracts in the NFL look like one hundred million is a crazy number isn't it quarter back\nA hundred million looking into the crystal ball who would that be when you look at Russell Wilson the quarterback for the Seahawks one in the way he gas for years eighty seven point six million he is a free agent and twenty twenty you\nLook at um [noise]\nWell you gotta think pat ... homes is going to get paid something something something [noise] but he's not anywhere near that the um\nThe salaries and the the salaries for different the different kinds of players but really quarterback has where pops open\nJimmy ...
