whatever\nBut there definitely were people that I'm more on the left that her the intended target so that's again the thing all the targets\nAre are usually the ones that you hear repeatedly criticized\nBy the way stationed at ah the joint air force base in Charles than so they're investigating it officially ...\nWhoops daddy I think a Humvee is common and that is that it's just crazy and I fell a picture of it to picture this giant plane cargo open like a movie like Indiana Jones getting a fist fight with someone who is someone or maybe a Mission Impossible as Tom Cruise gonna fly off the bat does he have a parachute\nAnd instead it is a Humvee that comes flying out of the back of it but like I said nobody was hurt they had a drag it out\nYou can bet they were not thrilled to have to report that uh yeah we got a problem here sir\nAnd it has to do with the Humvee\nIt\nWent in the opposite direction of where it was supposed to go\nTo the scores are pretty easy but not so easy for the Dodgers the red Sox even with two outs they're driving in runs there ahead to zip and the world series over the Dodgers\nThey won on Wednesday again for two was the final score it was a big win

runs off of three hits but he also struck out five and um\nThe good news is not a loss pinned on Boston and instead it's it's a good win for the red Sox who would like to be able to bring back the world series trophy\nTo being town but they're going to go to LA and we'll see what happens when they switch gears in the world series and ended up going to\nUp going to a Los Angeles 'cause that's

his way out of the room before signing it she then directed him to return to the bill and there was some laughter and then he signed it and she at one point addressed the media to\nTalking about are calling for um peace as far as some of the rhetoric and what happened with the whole because it was in light of what happened with the um [noise]\nWith a pipe bombs that were being reported because it just boom fell out there are all of a sudden it you know in the afternoon was when the news broke and that became\nBig news and and obviously conversation as to the what the reaction from the White House\nAnd reaction from people on the hill Congress folks and senators are as well I the caravan the migrants ... van of arriving at this point in\nUh southern Mexican town so\nAnd that's a southern Mexican town so in the pre dawn\nHours of Wednesday the ah they were inching their way up there ... along the highway and the migrants\nAnd their supporters have said they'd been forced to abandon their homeland countries like Guatemala\nBecause of corrupt governments extreme poverty and horrific violence from gangs and other criminals where lawlessness rules the amounts of people in the caravan may have fallen to about thirty six hundred because some people are dropping out\nOr are seeking asylum in Mexico or they're even going home just depending so the numbers seem to have\nDropped most of them are from Honduras Nicaragua er or Guatemala like I said El Salvador and that caravan though is pushing on to that or what the numbers are like the numbers I just said\nOr or the numbers increase decreased whatever that is still happening so it has not been called off and dispersed in any way\nBeen neat makes the move 'cause you know the Disney theme parks attract noodles with people from all over the place for weddings birthdays engagements that kind of always say what the happiest place on earth\nI Can't imagine the happiest place on earth is when there's ten million people pressing against you to get on line for a ride this can take an hour and a half to get on but that's why they have a fast path that's what they have oft times but what are the off times for Disney World and Disneyland\nAnyway custodians at Disneyland Anaheim and at Walt Disney worlds in Orlando claimed the parks are prefer place for guests to\nScatter their loved ones ashes to\nDid you know that yeah so people sneak in their families\nMembers ashes and plastic bags of ill bottles or or they're hidden in person or backpacks when they're inside they spread them throughout the landscape and the park and flower beds and water rides including pirates of\nThe Caribbean um\nOther popular areas the haunted mansions\nIn fact they're saying that the hunted mansion probably is so much humid ashes that it's not even funny wow um there was a a woman\nWho was quoted the other day at forty one year old Missouri native is saying that she later father to rest and you're just the world gates earlier in the air to memorize there's a to memorialize rather their summer trips together I don't know that there's something nice about that right\nBut how about this the Anaheim police department did confirm\nThey've answered calls regarding ashes before Disneyland\nLike yeah you're not really supposed to do that\nBut he sees people sneak they don't better to just do it and not ask for permission right\nI guess that's what the theory is just do it and and that's it who's going to know that they're not going to know so we're just do what we think is the ... is what they would want or what we wanted or you know whatever it might be\nI don't know I think there's a there's something I'm\nIt's hard when you lose somebody right so I think there's something about spreading the ashes where you have the memory or what they wanted their wishes\nOr is there something about having a site where you can go to the site and visit and lay flowers and I mean it used to be that\nThere is no way you wouldn't have a headstone that you wouldn't go in and be able to honor them and lay flowers on the grave sites and they even called them blankets related over the whole site so pretty ... pretty interesting how that's changed I think a little bit more cremation\nAbout Nintendo the video game makers teaming up with a nonprofit Institute of play to bring their do it yourself ... cardboard gaming kids to a hundred elementary schools around the country very cool they want to teach two thousand students between eight and eleven during the year this upcoming year\nThe kids which

and up up up up up I mean listen like everything's computerized for kids everything's going to be about living on the mobile phone so anything they do in that direction it has to be as a classroom experience\nThere has to be something to that worthwhile coming out of that because it's the principles of science and technology engineering and mathematics [noise]\nAnd that's the goal so if that's

I Would I Would assume that someone or some group is behind all of it because we know from the reports that the ... the a similarity you know of the devices that they're they're the same type of device is\nYeah scary stuff in a obviously we'll see I I think we're you know ... they're going painstakingly and this is what they do for a living but they're taking apart all of the pipe bomb

understand you know what I research today and heard from friends up on the hill I'm the these are not sophisticated type of explosive devices you know they're sort of pipe bombs and so\nBut news of the bomb\nKinds of comments and as a Bob Ney said the former congressman from Ohio if you missed him he was talking about that his his people on the hill that we're talking about everybody was talking to these manila envelopes the first package turned up\nA was addressed to Soros the billionaire a finance ear a left wing heavy donor to the Democratic party\nAnd the male envelopes were rerouted who were return address on the packages\nAnd it was at least that one was Debbie Wasserman Schultz the who the woman who formerly chair the Democratic National Committee\nSo how 'bout that it was to the Florida office of us representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz the FBI said that if confirmed to other uh packages which I mentioned was waters and they think there could be some others out there too\nSo and the CNN bureau in New York on a package address to Brandon is a lotta times he's an analyst frequently they're so he's seen in the building that would be the reason that it would have gone

I\nI think there'll be able to turn them over because of the clues they may have left how long that takes or what happens from here who knows but it is a big deal obviously and bomb than white powder scares and everything else is\nIt is absolutely frightening there certainly were other things that happened on the day\nThe caravan is on everybody's mind that\nSomething about you know something that so many of you were talking about I always say\nThat America Tonight is about the buzz in your backyard in mind and that is one of the things that is buzzing with going to happen with this caravan but because of the packages that were found and who could it be and then the ... you know the last ... from some about it\nAnd um\nWhat some are saying about you know the angry rhetoric can that's firing this stuff but that's why the president obviously was trying to say\nYou know that's doesn't get us anywhere and I it's been fodder all day long so while that's happening the caravan is still full steam ahead but\nThe you know these caravans what happens ultimately when you get to the doorstep of the U.S the idea is well you're going to be turned away that hasn't happened yet but we're not there yet and there are troops that will be on the border so what that is going to look like\nIt's going to be interesting to see if we're going to have some kind of clash our people let through what

tell people who you are if you win the lottery and somebody very near Greenville went into a store got a ticket and they want it to the single ticket\nSo the mega millions tickets sold for that jackpot just shy\nOf the lottery record oh who was that person that can be listening to us because we have a great affiliate right there so the ticket was told that Casey Mart and Simpsons bills just about Ninety miles North West of Columbia there was a banner at the convenience store that red\nLuck today luck struck here that is big luck\nOh yeah that is crazy\nThat is so crazy that somebody one that that they went into the store plunked down a few dollars walked out and what are the chances we hear the ridiculous chances and their chances were right on because they hit it\nI mean what is that like what does that feeling like\nGetting all those numbers and do they even know they might not know so we've got a great affiliate there are one hundred point seven ... and ... in Columbia

face it but it has been a swim tech stocks boom\nThey they were performing pretty good at the beginning of the year they have been the biggest decline ers\nAnd so much of that I'm sure has to do with

Laney America Tonight that's where we're at we're talking about pipe bombs eight of them that went in several different directions the eight packages that American mail bomb or they're looking\nFor that person as they go through\nAt Quantico every single piece of the bombs and try to place fingerprints or find fingerprints to find pieces of evidence totally makes sense so they were intercepted before they reached the targets\nObama's former attorney general Eric Holder former CIA director John Brennan a prominent Democratic Party donor George Soros two packages were sent to California congresswoman Maxine Waters the VP Joe\nBiden uh-huh\nBrock Obama former press former secretary of State Hillary Clinton all on the list CNN as I mentioned the FBI says this is ... ... ... of course investigating acts of\nTerrorism so what you heard there as you heard the president he was at a political rally in Wisconsin saying that there's going to be an aggressive investigation and that any acts of threats of political violence or an attack on democracy we one side's come together and peace and harmony and\nYou heard bill Blasio before that\nThe mayor of\nNew York talking about you know the media that there's no place for for that for sending bombs which I Would agree you can't disagree with media you can have people on TV on ready on whatever think they're lame think they're making things up or love them or whatever\nBut of course bombing they're going to catch you you're going away for life was it worth it I'm going to say it's not worth it so\nThey confirmed that they had the these envelopes they confirmed they were manila envelopes with a bubble wrap interior they had the device in it they had a computer printed address labels export ever posted stamps that were on the outside and um\n[noise] one bomb was packed the shards of glass that's we do know that that was confirmed\nThen the packages were all intercepted you know one went to the homeless Clinton in New York she wasn't home at the time the former press was but that doesn't get to them until it's screen somebody else get that you know whatever but there definitely\nWere people that I'm more on the left that were the intended target so that's again the thing all the targets are are usually the ones that you hear repeatedly criticized um CNN and\nYou were the ones that you hear repeatedly criticized\n... daddy I think a Humvee is coming down\nThat is that it's just crazy and I saw a picture of it to a picture of this giant plane's cargo open like a movie like Indiana Jones getting in a fist fight with someone who is someone or maybe a Mission Impossible as Tom Cruise gonna fly off the bat does he have a parachute and instead it is\nA Humvee that comes flying out of the back of it but like I said nobody was hurt they had a drag it out you can bet they were not thrilled to have to report that uh yeah we got a problem here is or it has to do with the Humvee it went\nIn the opposite direction of where it was supposed to go\nTo the scores are pretty easy but not so easy for the Dodgers the red Sox even with two outs they're driving in runs there ahead to dip in the world series over the Dodgers they won on Wednesday again for two was the final score\nIt was a big win for David Price because he was beleaguered a guy who always gets accused of not being able to get it done in the post season\nBut the less the got it done uh\nHe pitch six innings he did give up two runs off of three hits\nBut he also struck out five and um the good news is not a loss pinned on Boston and instead it's it's a good win for the red Sox who would like to be able to bring back the\nWorld Series trophy to beam town but they're going to go to LA and we'll see what happens when they switch gears in the world series and ended up going to\nEnd up going to a Los Angeles 'cause that's what obviously you do go to LA for a few them back to Boston maybe depending on if it's necessary who knows what if it was a sweep by the way millennia Trump today did a good job she was seen with President\nShe was at one point even addressed the media and you know she was there she was um she was there for the signing of the opioid bills and the legislation is\nMeant to curb the opioid epidemic\nAnd it's interesting he was reminded to sign it by the first lady Milan ... there was a viral video from the signing of events\nOf the East Room with the White House and you could see making his way out of the room before signing it she'd been directed him to return to the bill and there was some laughter and then he signed it and she at one point addressed the media to talking about\nAre calling for um peace as far as some of the rhetoric and what happened with the whole because it was in light of what happened with the um [noise]\nWith a pipe bombs that were being reported because it just boom fell out there are all of a sudden it you know in the afternoon was when the news broke and that became\nBig news and and obviously conversation as to the what the reaction from the White House and reaction from people on the hill Congress to folks and senators\nA as well I the caravan the migrants care a van arriving at this point in uh southern Mexican town so in the pre dawn hours of Wednesday the um\nThey were inching their way up there ... along the highway\nAnd the migrants and their supporters have said they'd been forced to abandon their homeland countries like Guatemala\nBecause of corrupt governments extreme poverty and horrific violence\nFrom gangs and other criminals where lawlessness rules the amount of people in the caravan may have fallen to about thirty six hundred because some people are dropping out or are seeking asylum in Mexico or they're even going home\nJust depending so the numbers seem to have dropped most of them are from Honduras Nicaragua or Guatemala like I said El Salvador\nCaravan though is pushing on or what the numbers are like the numbers I just said\nOr or the numbers increased decreased whatever that is still happening so it has not been called off and dispersed in any way\nDid me make the move 'cause you know the Disney theme parks attract noodles and people from all over the place for weddings birthdays engagements that kind of always say what the happiest place on earth\nI Can't imagine the happiest place on earth is one there's ten million people pressing against you to get on line for a ride this can take an hour and a half to get on but that's why they have a fast path that's where they have off times but what are the off times for Disney World and Disneyland\nThat's what they have oft times but what are the off times\nFor Disney World and Disneyland anyway custodians at Disneyland Anaheim and at Walt Disney world in Orlando claim the parks are prefer place for guests to scatter their loved ones ashes to\nDid you know that yeah so people sneak in their families\nMembers ashes and plastic bags of ill bottle a or they're hitting a person's or backpacks when they're inside they spread them throughout the landscape and the park and flower beds and water ride including pirates of the Caribbean\nOther popular areas the haunted mansion\nIn fact they're saying that the hunted mansion probably is so much humid ashes that it's not even funny wow um\nThere was a a woman who was quoted the other day at forty one year old Missouri native is saying that she later father to rest near Disney World gates earlier in the air to memorize there's to memorialize rather their summer trips together I don't know that there's something nice about that right\nBut how about this the Anaheim police department did confirm\nThey've answered calls regarding ashes before Disneyland\nYeah you're not really supposed to do that\nBut he said that people sneak they don't better to just do it and not ask for permission right\nI guess that's what the theory is just do it and that's it who's going to know that they're not going to know over and just do what we think is the ... is what they would want or what we want it or you know whatever it might be\nI don't know I think there's a there's something I'm\nIt's hard when you lose somebody right so I think there's something about spreading the ashes where you have the memory or what they wanted their wishes\nOr is there something about having a site where you can go to the site and visit and lay flowers and I mean it used to be that\nThere is no way you wouldn't have a headstone that you wouldn't go in and be able to honor them and lay flowers on the grave sites and they even called them blankets related over the whole site so pretty ... pretty interesting how that's changed I think a little bit more cremation\nHow 'bout Nintendo the video game makers teaming up with a nonprofit Institute of play to bring their do it yourself ... cardboard gaming kids to a hundred elementary schools around the country very cool they want to teach two thousand students between eight and eleven during the year this upcoming year\nThe kits which have gotten some positive reviews are this whole skill system and what they can do they can uh bend unfold in these toy con\nProjects like a miniature piano fishing rod robot that whole kind of thing and they get to intend to switch system than variety kids at no cost\nThey normally list for like I guess three hundred or something like that and then they have these packs and the robot kits and up up up up up I mean listen like everything's computerized for kids everything's going to be about living on the mobile phone so anything they do in that direction it has to be as a classroom experience\nThere has to be something to that worthwhile coming out of that because it's the principles of science and technology engineering and mathematics and that's the goal so that's the goal I say thumbs up to that\nGood luck to the students to get to do it and the teachers at the beach
