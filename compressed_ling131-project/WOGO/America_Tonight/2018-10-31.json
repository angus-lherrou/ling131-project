I don't care what religion you are how you worship going into churches going and synagogues going into any in any house of worship I'm for that matter killing any innocent people but let's stick with that first that kind of is just despicable beyond belief\nJust typical reprehensible I mean I can use all kinds of words it doesn't bring the victims back it doesn't ... the the hate I think moving forward is the question of what do you do I talked about this in another hour show\nI had a conversation with one of my buddies in Los Angeles and I think of Los Angeles and we talk about gun debate and all that and which is not the place for this but he said that in his church they have people that have concealed carry 'em and that they agreed that during every service\nSomebody two to three people would be there who are certified and and um practice with their weapon et cetera and they would be in the church in case the worst happened though in case the worse happened sad that we even have to think that way\nBut moving forward there may be more people that think that way where they either get security or they have to lock the doors\nA which is equally as sad and you know here's the bottom line of people in Pittsburgh we wrap our arms around you there's vigil being held for them there's money being raised their comfort that's being served up because that's the kind of people we are\nOn an outrageous sub rangers rangers thing to happen and the people in Pittsburgh are reacting um\nYou know hatred and can't we can go to the field that were the time that you're all out of the Pittsburgh game the Pittsburgh Steelers winning their game but the focus so much of the focus on thinking of the poor\nPeople the victim that that ... that were were slaughtered and of course people are coming together to\nRally around the folks are that's the kind of world we live and that's the kind of people we are in the United states and I hope that that's not forgotten and all of the I'm the couple and sanity and hateful sick twist in a man's mind that you know is\nNow accused of this and charged with\nThe terrible things that nobody was expecting to happen and I say things ending the life of people who live long lives and we're not expecting you know to get the phone calls about their grandparents people weren't expecting that were in their fifties the two brothers I mean\nYeah just awful\nHow I feel like you know we need to and people are choked up people can barely talk a SWAT Team ... ah the um\nThe Pittsburgh Pentagon gunman told plot that he wanted to kill all due to die wanted them to die and it showed up so many and we had three hate filled kind of crime three hate filled sucked back that\nCaused havoc to other people there was the grocery store I haven't even mentioned that and I'm One of my favorite states can talking Jefferson town Kentucky just outside of Louisville and it you know it's um\nThink about it there was a guy who banged on the door First Baptist church and tried to pull it up and couldn't pull it up and couldn't get inside so then he went to a Kroger store he shot to people both African American the first was sixteen I sixty nine year old Maurice ... who was with a twelve\nYear old grandson the grand some terrible here and buying a poster board I don't think about this for a school project really\nThe second was a fifty seven year old woman who was killed in the parking lot and the guy fled uh the mayor there that I'm sick and heartbroken an angry I Would feel that way about any act of violence and cruelty\nAnd this guy had a history of mental illness made racist threats repeatedly called his ex wife the N. word all kinds of\nUm things are coming out about that because of course you look into the history and want to know what could possibly what could possibly make that happen and what would drive somebody could do that to Gregory\nBush fifty one years old I'm fifty one year old white men would try to do that what what does it what what what pushes in that direction\nAnd then we had the whole bombing thing and the fifty six year old Florida Man to say that our society ac and he mailed fourteen and I thought it was Thirteen now they're saying fourteen a pipe bomb they didn't detonate but they were real\nUm his hatred obviously was there and then the one we've been talking about the gunman\nAnd into the synagogue is a really really rough week a\nA day Israeli for that stuff that\nRough week a couple\nOf days really for that stuff that stuff that we don't want to happen here in the United states disagreements not caring for the way\nI'm from the rhetoric goes all that fine but to have this happen you know I mean terrible absolutely\nA indescribable that's it I describe it will move on to something else to talk about something else it's likely mean you know Halloween coming up in a few days isn't that the Halloween is going to turn us around but we need something to bounce back on right what what are the\nPositive stories out there that are happening in the positive is what so many of you are doing reaching out in helping other people and um then we see that everyday examples of that in pulling people up and neighborhoods and\nAnd I choose to believe really I Do that we really are a nation of people that are givers and care about other people on stronger is you know stronger than hate is something we are stronger than that the steel city is stronger than that were stronger than that you know\nAbsolute absolutely I mean absolutely I'm going to I'm going to go in that direction with a with everybody else I look look at a couple of other things\nYou know I talked about the Powerball thing and somebody asked me all geez if you want in power which is\nStill do the show absolutely ten years on this show you think you're getting ready to me that easy of course now of course I'll hang around I did not win the Powerball or not usually a lottery player but\nUm I did I did play the lottery and just a little a little amount nothing big I see people that are pulling out big bill to play and I'm thinking\nMaybe they know something I I don't know but I but I'm not sure it's gotta be something different you write something different than than um than what I Know that's all I'm saying I just move on to something else that that caught my attention and this is this\nIs one of those stories where luckily I saw him in concert but bravo families Trump career\nMichael boot blue play blue ... easy for me the same way\nHe has been talking about some cancer and you think of cancer and would cancer does I was watching one of the ball games over the weekend and they stand up to cancer and everybody of course has assigned almost everybody touched by cancer any room you go in\nSome survivors but some that have family that didn't like my family my mother who I adored\nDying of colon cancer five years ago when a grandmother I lost when I was a kid from breast cancer so anyway uh Michael ... play did an appearance on\nStand up to cancer episode of care uh carpal karaoke on Saturday and he\nTalked to James coordinate about a five year old Noah who was diagnosed with liver\nCancer at age three and he said you know it's hard to acknowledge because it's so painful to talk about we got the diagnosis and that wasn't in my whole life ended he's married to an Argentinean actress and they have three kids together um\nTwo sons and a daughter he said his extended family relocated to LA to be closer to to his son\nNoah while he underwent treatment and\nUm they\nTake it day by day and he said we're all moved by what's happening and we had the best doctors and you know they're just focusing on their time with him he said he wasn't going to tour anymore do any of that um\nHe you know they're focusing on him they're focusing on anything they can do with him and she you know ... again you just don't think of a three year old\nBut then of course we know that that happens and that doesn't matter money um influence except for cancer cuts across\nAll cuts across all areas of life and\nIncome levels and there's just another example of of that but I'm\nCertainly they don't want for anything but it's they want for their time to get better in the bottom line I don't know about all of you and I'm going to end this segment on this but what is the one of the topics of conversation constantly house back to the Internet\nTo Eighteen he is saying that they have completed the world's first five gee connections yet first they're claiming that they

what's happened\nYes I Know somebody that had gone there a doctor by my doctor actually kept gone there when she was doing a residency and knew all these people wow everybody who was killed it was awful\nThat it was awful so the reaction in Washington because there's been a lot of conversation about uh not politicizing this and then Trump saying things et cetera what's the latest there\nWell the president tweeted out today or I actually yesterday very great anger in our country caused by inaccurate and even in our reporting the news the fake news media the true enemy of the people must stop\nThe open and obvious hostility and report them as accurately and fairly\nThat will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage and we won't be able to bring all sides together in peace peace and harmony\nToday Sarah Huckabee Sanders\nFavorite briefing our first one in a week and basically said a word that respond to the fake media why she said they knew they know who they are\n... but then once they hear that is and and now I'm paying what it is and and as you said briefing first briefing we've seen in a while from Sarah Huckabee Sanders and I guess there's a word that the president in the first lady are going to go to Pittsburgh right on Tuesday\nRight while the as the rabbi at the guy that he's welcome other rabbis a city that he's not but obviously it's the

hours and the effect that might have in the mid term elections you've you've been in Washington a long time what do you think\nWell I have been in Washington a long time but I don't really know how it trickles lectures are going to be affected\nWhat we do know for instance that everybody said Hillary Clinton was going to win and it was going to be a landslide et cetera and they didn't know and I and uh I once had a picture that set the only real hope is that election day and so we really don't know\nWhat effect is going to be a while I\nAnd so we really don't know what effect is going to be a well obviously have some effect and in terms of who will do what they vote for but other than that I cannot tally\nLet me ask you this question um you grow up in a family especially with your brothers who you talk about current events everybody was active in what was going on in your community so I think that fueled the fire for you to do what you're doing it did for me\nDo you think that younger people are more apathetic or do you think more will get out and vote and this again speculating\nWell it depends I think that millennials have the lowest voting record of any group ever\nI don't tend to vote however Generation Z which is just now coming of age and they'll probably vote in the next presidential election we're probably won't be voting much in this election if any Generation Z\nFigure out what's your next move you know what what am I going to do and I've had long discussions with so many people on the show about that as you know and will do more of that\nAnd I've had them off the air the last couple of days about what our houses ... any kind of house of worship what are they doing and it seems that if they don't have some kind of a guard some\nOpted to have people who have a concealed carry permits for them that they are there in the crowd like they would normally be there are a member of the congregation\nBut they're armed their arm somehow you know they've they've they've got a weapon that if that were to happen day could a man or they could fire they would be there so\nThat becomes the question it's like the teacher question in Israel we notice the teachers are what their arms and why are they armed their arms because it's too dangerous for them not to be because it's just the soft target\nAnd that's what places of worship are there are a soft target because that's what we're talking about here on America Tonight\nWith me Kate to lenient I always say there's about what's going on in your backyard of mine and there's lots of conversation about that as there would be in and should be because there's massive concern over you know what I'm what next what do we do how do we defend ourselves\nTo we want to live in the world paranoid no but do we really need to be aware of our surroundings and the answer to that question is you do need to be around aware of your surroundings but if I'm In Pittsburgh and I'm In a suburb but I'm going to an early morning service were a few different things are going on in the synagogue\nI'm not thinking that\nThis is right for um us being a target today that you know somebody's going to come in and they're gonna they're gonna start shooting and\nUntil somebody called nine one one or the SWAT Team gets here and the police get here we're basically sitting ducks and we have to figure out what we're going to do if we're if we're away from where it's taking place there were just walking the door running away or what are we what are we doing\nUm sadly that's where we are so if that's where we are then what is the action going forward what is it that is the the thing that you have to do or think about doing are having conversations\nIn these congregations anyway about doing just like they are in schools sadly we know and just like they are in other places that should be places that are safe including your own\nPlace of employment how often do we see sadly that where somebody's disgruntled somebody from the past comes in whatever the story is and\nIn an incident like that everything changes and we've had that conversation with people who have been\nTargeted we've had three different high profile cases where people in the ten years have come on with us to talk about the um horrific\nFeeling it is when you were trapped and you know you're trying to figure out okay what's the next move in fact\nIf you remember one of the last people we talked to poll just about\nBeing at that D.C Navy Yard when the former navy reservist killed twelve people in a bad day\nAnd then was killed by the police that was back in twenty Thirteen\nAnd the the person we talked to we just talked to about a year ago who was in that situation and everybody was ducking recover and running and trying to figure out where ... you know where they were going to go and how they were going to tape it and they were just absolutely done at a navy\nShip yard at a Navy Yard wow and so whether it's where you work whether it's where you worship or whether it's where you send your kids to school it is sadly what you do\nIt's where you worship or whether it's where you send your kids to school it is sadly what you do have to contemplate\nAnd doesn't mean be paranoid looking over your shoulder think the world is coming to an end\nNo it is sad times it's sad that that's what we have to contend with because as a kid I certainly didn't have to deal with that many of you listening to me you certainly weren't thinking that and I was in that in between air to where we weren't it wasn't Cold War so there wasn't any the duck and cover drills\nOr so we ... I didn't have that childhood where you were concerned about that you know you're concerned about the fire drills we get fire drills that's it\nThere wasn't any metal detectors there wasn't that concerned about somebody coming in with a gun kidnapping and somebody doing something else like that it was never a concern now it's not about is it a concern let's move the ball forward what do you want to do\nCongregations need to have those conversations that they have and with their\nFlock their parishioners to people who go there and worship um the the folks in the synagogues whatever whatever kind of worship it is\nAnd make that kind of decisions too we say as we are and just be more alert do we have some kind of protocol to we have a guard duty have concealed carry\nThroughout the services where there was one or two people who are who are already have the permits for that and feel secure doing it we just don't tell people who it is because why would you do that just let it roll\n'em and that I think is what's happening but I think that's happening more than one would suspect I mean so you got to catch up with\nA sadly the reality of domestic terrorism\nAnd that and how it has altered our lives but to alter it permanently boy we sure don't want that that's for sure\nAnd the Pittsburgh mayor and uh the former rabbi at the synagogues thought that the\nPresident should wait till he's coming in on um Tuesday the Pittsburgh suspect says he prefers the term invaders to describe immigrants because he was listening to the talking points on TV apparently great\nAnd Robert Bauer is his name is complained about the invaders six days before the shooting is what he was saying\nAnd uh he he wrote on social media his social media gab that is that I've noticed a change in people thing illegal not that now I say invaders I liked is\nUm you know whatever it is he has forever changed the lives of lots and lots of families and\nYou know he minutes before eleven eleven days before he was writing all kinds of ah stuff about the caravan except for on on the social media site and then on October twenty seventh he goes into the tree of life synagogue\nAnd he wrote that post about invaders and said I'm going in and like in his\nAnti immigrant attitudes to his attack on the synagogue\nSo where yeah and apparently a the Hebrew immigrant aid society which helps refugees was one of the things that he was rambling about so\nUm that's what he said when he when he went in and and I mean just wow I'm I'm believable I mean just on believable as to what has happened here but\nAgain\nWe're placing the hatred with love and replacing the idea of okay we don't want that to happen again and not\nDoing something more proactive I think it at this point that has to be that has to be something that's talked about in churches synagogues any place of worship whatever it is that half the half that has to be\nHas to be talked about because if you could be anywhere in this country that certainly was an area where you would not have expected that to happen was put it that way [noise]\nBut anything that the soft target is a wide open\nAnd go to the mail bag next here on the ATM\nOn room [noise]\nRead somewhere malware viruses oh my ... and anti virus just start good enough to stop those things anymore\nYou know it's really not the ... the human factor human factor is the weakest link to computer on the Internet security everyone needs a coach my computer security is no different uh DC is certainly where your IT coaches were the coaches that help you overcome the weakest link human factor\nA D.C ... we can help your chain become a human\nFirewall against computer and Internet Security for us\nTo give us a call ... feet seven seven three to seven six three feet five\nOr visit us online test DCFS normally start call to make your coverage weakest link in the security changed its strongest\nDCSS network it could actually offers trading products to help you consistently weird and the fight against today's threats calls a day or does it do you see a link to his piece the definitely stuck to\nBut imagine you it happens instantaneously but it wasn't ten minutes rampage and I know you described it as the first responders feeling just stick to their stomach and describing the scene is one of the worst that they've ever seen and of course is that way\nBecause you have exploding bullets that are hitting these people on what condition or the body then and there are dead and you've got eleven people that died and then you have other people that were seriously wounded as well\nAs to move on to 'em some more emails\nThat are just spanned the variety of a couple of different things including\nThis one this one is from algae says ... I Hope you are well in your world sister we need your voice the voice of\nReason in a non reasonable world the pipe bomb or I heard that the the guy from Florida had more bombs\nThat he was ready to send to more people is that true will they intercepted thanks for that they intercepted sports teams packages and this is our ... um\nBut they say that he had planned I guess from his rambling what he had written when he was working on that he had a list of about a hundred people he wanted to send packages to when he was going through the list\nSo this was just a handful of the people on the list and we certainly have named them well known Democrats and\nHe told investigators after he was arrested in plantation Florida that the pipe bombs wouldn't have hurt anyone that you want to hurt anyone but they were real I mean they check them out and they were not fake bombs they were real bombs and they would have been a danger to somebody if they had gone off\nThey think he made the pipe bombs in the van\nAnd they're saying because they found the equipment to stamp the envelope the paper the printer everything the powder all that that he needed to do that and hours before he was arrested is so strange he was playing doing the D.

for that matter killing any innocent people that\nLook pick without first that kind of is just despicable beyond belief just sick of all reprehensible I mean I can use all kinds of wars doesn't bring the victims back again to quell the hate I think moving forward at the question of what do you do I talked about this than another hour and the show\nI had a conversation with one of my buddies in Los Angeles just think of Los Angeles and we talk about gun debate and all that and which is not the place for that but he said that in his church have people that have concealed carry\n'em and that they agreed to during every service somebody\nTwo to three people would be there who are certified\nUm practice with their weapon they cetera and they would be in church in case the worst happened in case the worse happened sad that we even have to think that\nWay but moving forward there may be more people that think that way where they either get security or they have\nTo lock the doors a which is equally as that and you know here's the bottom line of people\nUh which is equally as that and you know here's the bottom line of people have Pittsburgh we wrap our arms around you there's vigil being held for them there's money being raised\nJust again\nI'm On an outrageous\nSub rage of a range of things to happen and the people in Pittsburgh are reacting um\nYou know hatred can't we ... the city is field that were the signs that you're all out of the Pittsburgh game that Pittsburgh Steelers winning their game but the focus so much of the focus on thinking of the poor people the victim that that ... that were more slaughtered and\nOf course people are coming together to\nRally around the folks are that's the kind of world we live and that kind of people we are in the United states and I hope that that's not forgotten and all of that on the table and sanity and hateful sick twist in a man's\nMind that you know is now accused of this and charged with the terrible things that nobody was expecting\nTo happen right they thing with ending the life of people who live long lives and we're not expecting you know to get the phone calls about their grandparents people weren't expecting that were in their fifties the two brothers I mean yeah it's just awful so I feel like\nYou know we need to and people are choked up people can barely talk or the clock team that for me I'm\nIn the Pittsburgh synagogue gunman told\nCo-op that he wanted to kill all Jews to die wanted them to die and its choked up so so many and we had three hate filled kind of crime three hate filled up back\nCaused havoc to other people there was the grocery store I haven't even mentioned that and I'm One of my favorite states can cocky Jefferson town Kentucky just outside of Louisville\nAnd it's you know it's um\nThink about it there was a guy who banged on indoor first\nChurch and tried to pull it up and couldn't pull it up and couldn't get inside because then\nHe went to a Kroger store he shot to people both African American the first with sixty nine fifty nine year old Maurice Ballard who was with a twelve year old grandson the grandson was terrible he buying a poster board I don't think about this for a school project really the second or\nA fifty seven year old woman who was killed in a parking lot at the guy fled uh the mayor there that I'm sick and heartbroken an angry I Would feel that way about any act of violence and cruelty\nAnd this guy had a history of mental illness made racist threats repeatedly called his ex wife the N. word all kinds of\nUm things are coming out about that because of course you look into the history and want to know what could possibly ... possible that happen what would drive somebody could do that to\nGregory Bush fifty one years old I'm fifty one year old white men would try to do that what what does it look what what pushes in that direction\nAnd then we had the whole bombing thing and the fifty\nSix year old Florida Man than they are so I act and he mailed fourteen I thought it was Thirteen now they're saying fourteen a pipe bomb they didn't detonate but they were real\nUm his hatred obviously was there and then the woman even talking about the gunman and into the synagogue is really really rough week\nA couple of days really for that stuff that stuff that we don't want to happen here in the United states disagreements not caring for the\nWay I'm from the rhetoric goes all that fine but to have this happens you know I mean terrible absolutely\nA under Scrabble sets it describes will move on to something else to talk about something else it's like the names you know Halloween coming up in a few days after Halloween is going to turn it around but we need something to bounce back on right what\nWhat are the positive stories out there that are happening in the positive is what so many of you are doing reaching out in helping other people and then um then we see that everyday examples of that and then pulling people out the neighborhoods and\nAnd I choose to believe really I Do that we really are a nation of people that are givers and care about other people and stronger is [noise] you know stronger than hate is something we are stronger than that the steel city is stronger than that were stronger than that you know\nAbsolutely absolutely I mean absolutely I'm gonna I'm gonna go in that direction with ah with everybody else I look look at a couple of other things\nYou know I talked about the Powerball thing and somebody asked me all these if you want to power of all we should still do the show absolutely ten years on this show you think you're getting ready to me that easy of course now of course I'll hang around\nThere is on his show you think you're getting ready to me that easy of course no of course I'll hang around when the Powerball or not usually a lottery player but\nUm I did I did play the lottery it just a little a little amount nothing big I see people that are pulling out big bill to play and I'm thinking maybe they know something I I don't know but I but I'm not sure it's gotta be something different you write something different than than\nUm than what I Know this all I'm saying just move on to\nSomething else that that caught my attention and this\nIs this is one of those stories where luckily I saw him in concert but bravo family Trump career Michael\nBoot Blu ray blue ... easy for me the same way\nHe has been talking about some character and you think of cancer and would cancer does those watching one of the ball games over the weekend and the ads stand up to cancer and everybody of course has assigned almost everybody touched by cancer any room me going\nFrom the survivors but some that have family that didn't like in my family my mother who I adored dying of colon cancer five years ago when a grandmother I lost my kid from breast cancer so anyway\nAh Michael do play did an appearance on stand up to a cancer at the care of carpal karaoke on Saturday and he\nTalked to a game quarter about a five year old Noah who was diagnosed with liver\nCancer at age ... and he said you know it's hard to knowledge because it's so painful to talk about we got the diagnosis and that wasn't in my whole life ended he's\nMarried to an Argentinean actress and they have three kids together um\nTwo sons and a daughter he said his extended family relocated to LA to be closer to his son Noah while he underwent treatment\nUm they\nTake it day by day and he said we're all moved by what's happening and we have the best doctors and you know they're focusing on their time with him he said he wasn't going to tour anymore do any of that um\nHe you know they're focusing on him they're focusing on anything they can do with him and I should you know again you just don't think of a three year old\nBut then of course we know that that to happen and that doesn't matter money\nUm word except for a cancer cuts across fall\nCuts across all areas of life and\nIncome levels and there's just another\nExample of of that but I'm\nCertainly they don't want for anything but\nIf they want for their son to get better and the bottom line I don't know about all
