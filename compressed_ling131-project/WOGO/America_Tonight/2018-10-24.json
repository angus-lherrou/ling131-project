voting those I voted stickers oh they're everywhere not just graffiti [laughter]\nNot just extras no I'm Serious they're everywhere I've seen early voting in my own hood\nKind of off the chain meaning longer lines and I've ever seen before that was the whole idea of the early voting oh nobody's vote in the mid term elections presidential election not in the middle is but a ... there's definitely those\nWho are voting early and they're waiting in line to vote Republicans say they think the midterms benefit them Democrats say oh no it benefits us in the end who knows [laughter] you know what are the takeaways what are the exit polls\nShow it's a mixed bag I think depending on where we are talking about what state what's up for grabs that kind of deal you know uh one thing that the well a lot of races it's a bit or roar ... and the Ted Cruz Senate race in\nTexas is one that garnered\nNational interest in the polls that changes as to um it is a better work is catching up or not\nAnd

suppression\nFive I'm always fascinated by the people that can wait you know what I mean like you read the stories and of course I've had them you know I've done them on the air\nWe're talking about some guy oh yeah he was watching\nThis old coat it was taken to the cleaners and he found a one of those tickets he had from seven months ago and then he pulled it out and really the oh my gosh it's worth millions [laughter]\nThat I mean at least check at some point right at you got to check if you're going to play the game you have to check it I don't understand no check in you know you know you're not even curious like eventually I'm I I get not checking the second is announced if you're not yeah I got to know what it is right now\nI'm so funny but the mega millions tickets might not

oh it was just fun because everybody is buzzing about it and everybody got the PDF she said she got a PDF that was Seventeen pages Seventeen pages of numbers who is the official checker and who is the backup checker who who is it\nThat story no matter how you feel about the politics of it all and we've seen the switch now on the Supreme Court was timely that CNN did a story on Saturday a hotter 'cause the former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor the first woman to ever serve on the high court\nThey did announce that she's in the early stages of what is likely all climbers and is retiring from public life\nO'Connor is eighty eight he was President Reagan's first Supreme Court nominee she served from\nNineteen eighty one to two thousand and six\nShe was a key swing vote for the most part\nAnd six she was a key swing vote for the most part uh her retirement she was still in good health at\nSeventy five pretty rare for Supreme Court justices but she did it to care for her husband who had advanced Alzheimer's disease at the time he died in two thousand and nine and she was active raising awareness about the conditions\nAnd what she said in a letter addressed to friends and other Americans she said some time ago doctors diagnosed me with the beginning stages of dementia probably old timers as this condition has progressed I'm no longer to participate in public life since many people have asked about my current status and activities I Want to be open\nAbout these changes while I'm Still able to share some personal thoughts wow that is so sad right and she said the final chapter of my life with\nYou mentioned may be trying nothing has diminished my gratitude and deeper appreciation for the countless blessings in my life\nShe said how fortunate I feel to be an American and have been presented with the remarkable opportunities available to the citizens of our country as a young cow girl from the Arizona desert I never could have imagined that one day I Would become the first woman justice on the Supreme Court\nDuring most of her time on the court she she was that vote that I said a a big swing vote\nAnd uh wow I I mean really it is fortunate for her she's right I said that before when we were talking about spring forward justices whatever we're talking about it because I've been doing the show for ten years so if you've been\nGone through the process and and been appointed to the life long journey of being on the bench\nAnd she you forget about that that she got she retired from public life and\nYou know she's still an inspiration and the condition or her illness can't take that away but wow what a woman who used to remind me to think of or any person I I've seen this I've seen what it's like the old timers little climbers does to people and I'm like wow\nI'm it's good that that was prepared she was ready for that number two thousand nine she got the presidential medal of freedom which is the highest civilian honor\nAnd she\nDid give a few speeches here and there but she wasn't she wasn't um maybe the very beginning but she wasn't bouncing around all over the place and she was even in the beginning she was the chancellor of the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg and then she got the medal of freedom and\nYou know all that sort of thing so it's um it's sad for somebody who uses like I said that for anyone but sad for anyone who uses their mind that way to uh to have to deal with that and smart\nTo tie it all up have the statement and deal with whatever goes her way as far as treating the old timers and whatever they can\nDo whatever they can do for her to make it better I guess that's that's the way to uh to put it\nI don't know about you but it's a it's so fascinating to me the construction of the Titanic\nToo did you know they were doing that there's a Titanic to it's going to make its two week ... maiden voyage and twenty twenty two it's a construction that's happening now of the replica\nThey had a little bit of a financial hiccup\nBut it was kind of held up but now it's not it's going to have the same cabin lay out as the original it's gonna sail from to buy to South Hampton England that on to New York tracing or there's just something about that tracing the north Atlantic root of the doomed namesake\nWhich sunk in Nineteen twelve less than three hours after side swipe being an iceberg so same amount of passengers twenty four hundred nine hundred crew\nA modern navigation thank goodness safety technology plenty of lifeboats was getting to know right\nBut um it's going to go on a few different places it was being built in China or rather than in Belfast but it still will go on the original journey\nCircumventing the globe they say it will inspire and chat people while attracting a lot of attention of course because how mysterious ... because it's going to look exactly like the old Titanic\nSo they're thinking that they're probably going to see some self ... of the king of the world post [laughter] oh I don't know there's just something about that that is\nUm\nI I don't know it's kind of creepy would you want to\nI mean would you want to get to go on that boat into that voyage I don't know maybe it's not because it's it's it's filled your imagination with the stories even as a kid of course in school I heard about the Titanic I knew what the Titanic was I knew what happened and they still talk about the Titanic\nAnd of course the movie made it even that much bigger\nAnd with the new features it's a whole different ball game I'll give you that but it just seems eerie to to trace it maybe I'm\nMore superstitious I guess that I thought I'd if you just popped up on and you're saying what are those are the lottery numbers I'm going to give

Obama had what he described as ... when he lost the lower chamber there um but we certainly couldn't be surprised when I was the message is changing we now see Republicans\nI'm adopting new measures going into this trying to make this about cabinet are trying to make just about immigration I'm trying to make this middle class tax cuts which was something like that the president has put forward\nUm lately but you know all of his rhetoric is coming up against the reality which is that if they lose the house\nThis is going to make their political ambitions a lot harder and that's something that Larry Kudlow pretty much acknowledged today on the\nUm you know from started the White House outside of the worst way he's he basically said that this was his major concern right now or this notion that Democrats could come in and a code roll back some of the you know economic measures are probably going to go forward including the tax cuts\nHave offices that would chip in my friend any he said uh they had\nThree hundred chances to win the lottery so will somebody be crowned the billionaire solo will a group of people walk away with millions after taxes we don't know\nI mean will we get a chance if it's one person we ever even meet that billionaire\nFour states give the winter's the option of remaining anonymous and there are some other measures winners take in states to conceal their identity because you can imagine how everybody would hit you up it's human nature\nIf you won the lottery we don't know at this a point the mega millions jackpot has been growing since July group of California office workers one a lot of money in fact they won\nFive hundred and forty three million dollars but if no ticket matches the numbers\nThe jackpot will grow to two billion on friday forty four states as well as Washington DC in the U.S Virgin Islands are\nIn the mega million\nJackpot area of course if you don't live in one of those areas you just go to a neighboring state and get it or yeah one of her friends to pick up the ticket do you trust that they would switch the tickets on if you weren't going to see them till later in the week there have been lottery foibles\nWhere there's arguments there's been lawsuits yes yes yes yes yes indeed so pretty wild one point six billion is a whole lot of something something isn't it\n\nAs the jackpot grows more people are interested in it and there's more pools to boost the odd but what's interesting is\nThe people who are odds makers say that doesn't really work\nThat just because a groups get together and you have two thousand people in the group and they pay ten bucks each buy tickets and then you go when that you've got this big thick armed below and\nYou you know have to go through all the numbers and go through all the kids then\nYou know how are you going to defy that and you know taxes taken out of the winnings the final prizes up up up above the law but statistician say nothing to sneeze at but the chances are still the same chances if there's a one and three hundred and two point six million chance of winning\nSo whether you've purchased ten thousand tickets or won the winning percentage for making millions of still like nothing burger is still low\n... as far as games of cancer concerted absolutely is the lowest of love with you know what the what we know that\nIsn't it about hey maybe you'll somebody's gotta when someone who's going to win their tickets going to come up where's that ticket going to be so I think lottery fever and the discussion over it will continue and then there's the question of will we know\nIt will continue and then there's the question of will we know a you know when we know somebody has it will know where that ticket came from and that makes it more interesting because then people try to figure it out\nI had the other day to me well you know a lot of places in fact in most places you would have cameras so if\nThey came to my establishments and they said okay well they you got the ticket here so you would get money for that well couldn't we just go back and look at the feed and you couldn't you kind of prime stamp it and figure out who that possibly could be [laughter]\nI guess I don't know by the way hurricane willow while some people worried about the lottery hurricane Willis mashed into Mexico's west central coast hundred and twenty mile an hour with two cats three\nIt briefly reached cats for five rather and it happened at about nine o'clock near I'd love to do those are internal about fifty miles south east of this popular resort city of Moffett blond hair\nAnd so not good because they're talking about six to twelve inches of rain in the rain can be the flooding and we've already seen some flooding I've seen some of the a\nPhotograph from ...

what up with that or they unstable or are they having problems\n[noise] um\nYou know it's a good question because I was watching the stocks go down a little bit but not very much\nAnd I guess the the debt isn't a surprise to some who monitor stocks like this one because that's what Netflix does they usually have a negative cash flow that's their model\nBecause they burn cash so they have to raise capital to fund their content spending is almost like they're eating their own there are a victim of their own truth successes\nBecause the original content streamed on demand is so popular it's attracting copycat so they've got to spend a lot of money to keep up with Amazon CBS all access HBO Hulu\n\nAnd they have to replenish what they're losing from the studios like Disney\nAnd Warner Brothers because they're going to have their own services that can directly compete with Netflix so if Netflix wants to stream certain things they won't have the option to do that on\nNetflix any of

first woman to ever serve on the high court\nThey did announce that she's in the early stages of what is likely all climbers at is retiring from public life\nO'Connor is eighty eight he was President Reagan's first Supreme Court nominee she served from Nineteen eighty one to two thousand and six she was a key swing vote for the most part\nUh her retirement she was still in good health at Seventy five pretty rare for Supreme Court justices but she did it to care for her husband who had advanced Alzheimer's disease at the time he died in two thousand and nine and she was active raising awareness about the conditions\nAnd what she said in a letter addressed to friends and other Americans she said some time ago doctors diagnosed me with a beginning stages of dementia probably all climbers as this condition has progressed them no longer to participate in public life\nSince many people have asked about my current status activities I Want to be open about these changes while I'm Still\nTo share some personal thoughts wow that is so sad right\nAnd she said the final chapter of my life with you mentioned may be trying nothing has diminished my gratitude in deep appreciation for the countless blessings in my life\nShe said how fortunate I feel to be an American and have been presented with the remarkable opportunities available to the citizens of our country as a young ... girl from the Arizona desert I never could have imagined that one day I Would become the first woman justice on the Supreme Court\nDuring most of her time on the court she she was that vote that I had a a big swing vote and uh wow I I mean really it is fortunate for her she's right I said that before when we were talking\nI I mean really it is fortunate for her she's right I said that before when we were talking about spring forward justices whenever we're talking about it because I've been doing the show for ten years so if you've been\nGone through the process and and been appointed to the life long journey of being on that bench\nAnd she you forget about that that she got she retired from public life and\nYou know she still is an inspiration and the condition or her illness can't take that away but wow what a woman who used to remind me to think of or any person I I've seen this has seen what it's like the old timers but all climbers does to people and I'm like wow\nI'm it's good that that was prepared she was ready for that number two thousand nine she got the presidential medal of freedom which is the highest civilian honor\nAnd she\nDid give it a few speeches here and there but she wasn't\nShe wasn't um maybe the very beginning but she wasn't bouncing around all over the place and she was even in the beginning she was the chancellor of the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg and then she got the medal of freedom and you know all that sort of thing\nSo it's um it's sad for somebody who uses like I said that for anyone but sad for anyone who uses their mind that way to uh to have to deal with that and smart to tie it all up\nHave the statements and deal with whatever goes her way as far as treating the old timers and whatever they can you know whatever they can do for her to make is better I guess that's that's the way to ah to put it\nI don't know about you but it's a it's so fascinating to me this construction of the Titanic\nToo did you know they
