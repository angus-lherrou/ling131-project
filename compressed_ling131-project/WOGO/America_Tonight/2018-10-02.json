I Seventy five interchange in Cobb County some of the animals were trapped in the truck but dozens of others spilled onto the interstate so\nUm they started what do you do or cow and your phrase start to talk of course so you would see these pictures of cows in the street it was the easiest\nThing and and of course traffic is pretty it's pretty bad um so and we're talking about in the morning lame lanes were shut down and they started to reopen um maybe by six thirty or so all the lanes for clear but the ramp wasn't one of the major ramps wasn't open to one thirty\nOr the good news is the drivers taking a hospital and they think he's going to be okay but\nI've been I've been\nOn a highway were something spilled out onto the highway and it was Adel hand it back to everything up and\nI had no idea what it was and everybody was you know all of a sudden he started you see you see an animal making its way towards your card at the is it is it's just the craziest\nThing but of course it happens whatever they're hauling and if you flip then whatever happens to be and gets us build out this is a crazy story and one that I\nWonder when pins get stuck in bowling alleys I hadn't been bowling forever until my nephew came to visit me and we took 'em bowling and that was month a month ago\nBut we had problems resetting the um\nThe machine so the owner of a Southern California bowling alley died after getting stuck in a pen setting machines they say this is the place about a hundred miles south west of Denver they say he responded to call\nThey responded to a call and they found sixty five year old an actor Rodriguez stuck in the machine at Fremont lanes he was unconscious not breathing so somehow\nThat happened who knew the state's not foul play but\nThe machine must have killed him and I don't I don't think of that it seems like it's coming out you know slowly grabbing depends but whatever happened it\nUm\nIt happened and what crazy sad stories that I'm not surprised by this you know we do that thing with Kate chemicals which by the way that through this great Mahler love that and it's healthy 'cause that's where you start to learn more about dogs I think well didn't they\nOh I Love that and it's healthy 'cause that's where you start to learn more about dogs I think well didn't they just just to eat whatever\nBut the more I talked to these veterinarian no um so that's why I got healthier food and capes chemical is great you go to Cape ... dot com and check it out if you've got a dog 'cause I seriously jumped on this because of that so trust me I order my dog food um\nThere's a new study came out that showed that dogs might be\nCome more anxious and possibly suffer from depression when their owners overuse their smartphones\nThe United kingdom based study\nFocused on how welcoming a pet specifically a dog could help people suffering from\nA mental health issues they learned that dogs can suffer from the depression when they're human hampers ignored them and\nA Philly veterinarian of course Dr ... said he saw the effects of smartphone users on pets dogs are good at reading are subtle cues they read the body language that makes sense they read the facial expressions if you're on the phone you're just interested they want attention and they're not getting attention because you're focused on the phone\nAnd I've seen that actually with a hollow who gets frustrated because he doesn't get his attention he's not he he he likes attention but I think the whole phone thing gets on his nerves and and actually\nAnd of course you know phone the phone as a work tool and I'm you know fifty fifty about it but I was um\nJust recently I had the phone and maybe a couple of weeks ago I had a phone I was texting I think my nephew and somebody else and he wanted attention he came up and he knocked the phone out of my hand so if it's a smart dog maybe it'll do that too\n[noise] one thing that would never happen with my my hallowed is he would not be on an airplane the FAA rules on airplanes the\nSeats size they're saying because remember there was this big hubbub about these seats in the side but they're saying that it might not create more leg room or any of that for the flyers and say they're crab there's a bill is going to regulate minimum seats side on passenger planes\nAnd they took it up on Monday it's yeah because this reauthorization bill\nThe essay a reauthorization bill funds the agency for five years and that other travel measures so they say current rules say airlines must be able to evacuate passengers within Ninety seconds of an emergency but they don't set specific requirements or on the size of the space\nBetween other seats if passed would require minimum standard based on a safety review ...\nIsn't that interesting so you wonder they say frontier airlines is the tightest twenty eight inches the average for our economy seats thirty one inches and I'm\nCurrently the pitch the distance from one seat back to the next seat on low cost carriers is that is what I said at the tightest but um\nIt's I don't know it's it seems type to me no matter where you are right depends on it depends on how much stuff the people around you have it depends on what kind of a a lot of different factors I think but I I guess the actual pitch like I said between the seeds that's one thing I'll tell you a funny story one\nTime and this was years and years ago I was on a plane it was packed it was a holiday plane going back to ah Philadelphia from Dallas and stopping in\nChicago o'hare and getting to a hair because that's going to be crazy scene there and then it was picking up people and jamming on it it's a myth flight until the guy the guy next to me is talking to me a little bit and I'm the guy in front of me\nLeather seats go back and see just flew back I mean it was just that he was like practically in my lap and the guy\nThe guy sitting next to me didn't like it and he said excuse me I think you need to put your stand up and he said no I'm just like you do you put your seat back and he took the hardcover book had like a hardcover book it took the book out of my hands and he hit the guy on the head and I thought\nAfter nine eleven you don't do that stuff right because they're going to land the plane and none of us are going to get back there's going to be no Christmas let alone a white Christmas if you do that\nAnd it was it was pretty freaky but luckily we got it under control and they did not do that because I was really really thought that's what we were going to say that that was going to happen that we were going to end up landing this plane somewhere so I don't know if there is something about space we like our space\nAnd we don't get that much space on the plane that is very very true music means I got to ditch outta here get off the dance floor [noise]\nAnd will dance over to the other side effects ragged with us here on America
