O. G. O. dot com [noise]\nOn the Michael ... show what do we do about the fact\nThat Americans seemed to be so isolated out there I I'm In past writing have written about the uh the notion that a lot of people live and sort of suburban Fort Apache where they're prepared to defend their home turf against hostility\nBut they don't really have a lot of alliances even right next door and that's one of the themes in them why we hate each other and how to heal it's the new book by Senator Ben Sasse the senator from Nebraska many many of our listeners\nWere extremely grateful senators asked for your common sense and perspective during the Kavanaugh hearings\n'em ... before we we get back to that and where we go after the Kavanaugh hearings you were talking before about teenagers and how isolated teenagers are by age and they have in today's world very often are not serious relationships with people who are older or\nEven people who are younger and a ... one of the cures to that it always seems to me is provided right in that religious context you're talking about which is the Sabbath the idea of one day a week where a lot of these other demands a take precedence I was dreaming about President Theodore Roosevelt\nAnd he tormented his six children and they were all required to go to church with him on Sunday and then they would have a Sunday dinner and that was required for the kids and a lot of them resented it of course as adults they were grateful for it\nUh what about that as a means to heal as you talk about in your book\nUh yesterday man uh so I mean the ... and it does maybe be recovered and you do see places in both Judaism and Christianity now where people are recovering it um the\nThe intergenerational stuff you were talking about a minute ago kids are less happy if they spend their whole life has a Fifteen year old or an Fifteen year old 'cause they're not a lot of wisdom there there's constant immediately\nTheir whole life as a Fifteen year old around Fifteen year olds 'cause it's not a lot of wisdom there\nThere's constant immediacy and there's value in knowing not just forty five year old Seventy five year olds and so Andy crouch is a guy who's written a pretty interesting book called the capitalize family or in an old guy and he he talks about\nOne hour a day one day a week one week a year they lock up all their technology and there are people in that\nTradition and have no clothes and now they're jokingly say they're trying to be almost almost Amish\nOut with their approach to acknowledge what they mean is all the technology you can use in your work environments but being really self conscious about the ways that technology can crowd out real satisfying human relationships and your family and in your social life there's a bunch of data now in the happiness literature\nWhich shows if you go from two hundred five hundred social media friends are from five hundred to a thousand social media friends you don't get any happier I covered that send them um why we hate each other and out of jail\nUm but if you know the person who lives two doors away from you in your neighborhood your statistically much more likely to be happy\nAnd it is that if you invite people over for Sunday lunch or or Saturday ... or if you have people over for dinner and of course of the week um you get happier you you get into a service posture we realize your whole life isn't about your own consumption and you start to build ...\nRelationships in a neighborhood that aren't transactional and they end up making you happier and so I Try to spend a lot of the book on that constructive kind of topic\nAnd then Senator Ben Sasse senator from Nebraska his new book of them why we hate each other and how he'll\nLet let's talk for just a moment about the aftermath of the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation fight and thank goodness you were very key part of winning that fight for a justice Kavanaugh and I'm sure he's going to be a big credit to the Supreme Court and do a terrific job\nBut what about this idea I Know your colleagues Senator Graham and some others have talked about not letting it go going after the Lakers and the people who set up the ugliness that America saw going after Dianne Feinstein for instance I'd do you think that's productive\nUh I I don't know the right path from here in the Judiciary Committee that is is broken as the committee on which when the and I said that there are loving loving Republicans and Democrats\nEdited a terribly broke and circus right now um it didn't serve anybody who are kids or the cabinet and family are the Ford family or a search for facts in truth it didn't ... anybody well because the Senate and the Judiciary Committee in particular\nDecided they wanted to be swallowed by cable news television instant instant certainty on everything\nWe did a really really bad job as the United States Senate but\nSenator Feinstein's team did some really horrible despicable fangs and so I Do think we need to sort out\nHow did we get to a place where these allegations were always treated in the circus like atmosphere as the first bite at the apple when I sat on the Judiciary Committee now for two years we'd get lots of allegations all over the map about stuff that ends up being real some it ends up being great sum it ends up being clearly made up\nPolitical hits and there's a way to deal with this with the FBI and then in the Senate confidential process that doesn't start with everything as cable\nReality t._v. screaming and there were people in our Judiciary Committee who decided that's what they wanted to start at the top of that back to the theme of our half an hour to gather here I really do think there is a desperation\nFor some of our political addicts and Washington to try to act like blood sport politics\nOr forever more is what they want what they don't really love their neighbor they don't really care about your listeners kids and grandkids because they're not trying to solve long term problems they're trying to make politics the center of gladiatorial fight and that's not going to work in a republic\nYeah I mean somehow World Wrestling entertainment is not what you want for uplift of of your kids or for the American future I'm speaking speaking of which is one of the things that last night I I I gave a talk or to a neighborhood group bleed and had a couple of hundred people there it was great\nBut there's this general sense that our politics is broken and I found myself ... when does to you today on talking a little bit of a would I be wrong to say that the Nebraska Legislature which is non partisan and you and a camera on there is only one house in the legislature\nThat things work a little bit better in your state than they do and many others\nThey do a ... there's less sense of preening constantly for the cameras and even though my state is you know one of the four or five most conservative states in the union and that's one of the reasons I as one of the most conservative a senator of the United states elected from here\nEven though we're a very conservative place probably two to one Republican and the legislature people do not officially pockets that aren't really parties in our unit camera all our one one house a state legislature\nAnd so what people are mostly doing is wrestling with ... or term pragmatic question how do you get a good infrastructure and highway and bridges bill that's cost effective\nUh there's less certainty that you're going to find the line between good and evil or for people who might have slightly different priorities of which bridge in which highway to find it's a much healthier thing to do bridges and roads by politics\nInstead of trying to do a good and evil heaven and hell by politics if if federal politics do what they should an American constitutional system which has maintained a framework for ordered liberty of ... in the idea that people are created with dignity the image of God and they have rights by nature and government is our shirt project to secure those rights\nGovernment is the author of sorts of rights than government could do a small number of big things\nOr we need to build the fiber of strategy for the digital age et cetera but then most of what's meaningful can happen back and communities where people actually live next door to their neighbors\nWhat ... what a concept change from the bottom up not the top down that's part of the theme of them why we hate each other and how to heal it's the new bestseller by Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska\nAll I can say is keep it up senator we need you here in Washington and across the country\nOn the book is posted up at our website if Michael med dot

to be under attack under attack increasingly in our society and the ATF the alliance defending freedom is standing up for your ability to find your own path and to live your own conscience\nYou can call the ATF right now you have a tax deductible contribution whatever it is whether it's a hundred dollars or a thousand dollars if you can give a thousand dollars then that means that there is a nother thousand dollars on top of that that will come in and you will in effect be giving two thousand dollars when you get one thousand and you get the tax deduction\nAt alliance defending freedom or go click to I'm Michael ... dot com and go to the very top of the home page and you'll see a banner for alliance defending freedom you can find out all about this great organization\nAnd its fight for religious liberty in this country we're making good progress\nBut it's a day by day and\nEvery single contribution counts to keep this organization on the ground when more victories for the American people or go to Michael ... dot com look for the ATF batteries and call them toll free\nAt eight six six nine five four three three eight eight that's eight six six nine five four three three eight eight\nUm let's just go back for a moment to this deep question about the out of wedlock birth and why it is a problem for any\nChild and and I'm not now suggesting that people will be punished for having children out of wedlock I'm not suggesting is preferable that a baby who was conceived out of wedlock be aborted\nOr dispensed with what I Am suggesting is that we get back to the idea that in this society there\nAre norms norms are worth preserving and one of the norms would be\nThat it is worthwhile for people to come together to form a durable relationship and to raise a child in that context it\nThe truth as a matter isn't you've heard this a lot on this radio show but it's always worth repeating\nThe truth as a matter isn't you've heard this a lot on this radio show but it's always worth repeating it is a common lie is a misconception it's not just a misconception is a total distortion\nThat most marriages or even half of marriages don't last anyway so you could get married before a baby and well then the baby no no it's true not all marriages last but the majority do\nAnd particularly for four people today today people are getting married a much older age is an average American Woman\nNow has her first child woman who's going to have a child at age twenty seven that's still pretty young that's up from twenty to win Nineteen Seventy\nAnd one of the things that they're blaming for the out of wedlock birth rate is the fact that people spend longer in school but the ... the idea that you're getting married at age thirty or age thirty one or age thirty five rage forty\nThat that doesn't mean that it's not valuable\nFor your future children to be in a committed long term\nAnd chances are permanent relationship\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six the traditional progression of western life has been reversed says John ...\nWho teaches at Columbia University he says cohabiting partners are having children before getting married that's a long term trend across developing nations\nOkay the idea that they get married later find good glad to see that but what about all those couples and and we know this is couples who are cohabiting\nAre much less likely to last long term than couples that are actually married and there's a wealth of data that makes that clear let's go to um Bob in Cleveland, Ohio Bob you're on the Michael ...\nI think instead of trying to go back to the crash into society we should uh adapt to these new trends in um find new ways of helping these kids succeed then I just want to say it is you know back and you know maybe a hundred years ago\nUh you know the modality rich for show high that often a parent would die in the child would or maybe you have to live with their grandma parents or relatives or other relatives show\nI think this can be done successfully as long as we are open minded in in the capture these tranche\nBut what does that mean I Know it sounds good and adapting to trends are it sounds very open minded and terrific but what does it mean\nI wouldn't say that we need government programs horse that would help\nThat would uh specifically be tailored to kids living in a single parents situation\nOkay what kind of ... thinking of you want the government to send babysitters you want to establish government day care centers\nI think the ... would be one way I think manners where you do you pay people who are professionals to go in and spend time with these ... these children and help them out\nOkay do I let me just mention something to you Bob I I understand that sounds very generous and very nice\nBut you know what there are some times families who are married to each other who are raising children sometimes multiple children\nAnd their financially press is it fair that people like that who are having a tough time financially with their own kids at home should have a bigger chunk taken out of their income to provide for other people who may be struggling with only one parent\nOr you know you're going to hate the fish but ah I I I'm going to say this we should cut defense spending because it's just it's just not necessary and we should also raised taxes on the rich\nOK well of course when you say I'm going to hate this on my shelves you down but the idea that cutting defense spending is going to be an answer right now we are spending more on interest on the national debt\nThan we are on defense and in my opinion I think the independent most Americans the defense spending that we spend is the best investment we could possibly make\nAnd some of the very ambitious social programs in the worst one of the things that has happened in this country and has been shown by a wealth of books and information a\nThere is uh Charles Murray wrote the first book that the blue the lid off the welfare system in the way the welfare system hasn't been designed particularly by Lyndon Johnson the great society actually encouraged out of wedlock birth\nAnd there are Democrats who have written about that Daniel Patrick Moynihan who was a moderate Democrats rose about the problems with family structure in the United states and he predicted exactly where we are that if government rewards out of wedlock birth of course they're going to get more of it\nWe'll be right back uh with when does a a public figure go over the line and

I understand that Michael connected one more point go\nOkay so my point is that where this is coming from where the misled or in my opinion a a black people who are very hatred of their have full of of wide where it's coming from ... is a kind of a revolution are fighting back\nAbout what happened to them as a people over time\nWhereas the other direction when it was the Nazis or whomever it would attacking people not because they did anything to them they made off and fear the theories and made off that these people were doing stuff against them ... it really\nOkay I look I I understand but if you're talking about this goes into the for instance hatred of Turks against Armenians and the Turkish genocide against Armenians one of the justifications for that genocide which was real and it happened and and also being knowledge or direct and so the Armenian people\nWork rules the Turks and they were undermining\nIt doesn't matter if you were going to express irresponsible hatred toward any group based upon ethnicity or religious faith\nI there ought to be sanctioned and that doesn't mean that you want to be shut down by the government but it means that respectable people
