have made a big\nDifference but no it does not happen there were a costly one let's put it that way\nIn the meantime how about this uh cowboys receiver was suspended for use in the rye for the cowboys nothing nothing controversial about the cowboy time so the cowboys Jerry Jones from time to take a flyer on\nControversial players but in this case it was parents Williams the Senate for three games for substance abuse violation\nDid the cowboys were set to be without Williams for some time he was put them into your reserve we can go with that problem is having but he was still to send it to the

line they weren't buying it the Centers for the game and the cowboys are with out him wow\nSo how 'bout that did he already was Adam because the injury but that's not that's not good that's the that's for sure this is another interesting development the people who are following the world of of port\nThe NBA easily just an offer a hundred and twenty five thousand two\nFor the NBA easily could\nCan offer a hundred and thirty five thousand to what they're calling in the prospects there's been some conversation about players leaving college and what's right and all that the NBA he really does

into place in the summer of twenty nine teams in the NBA Nineteen year old age limit is unlikely to change until the twenty when you can wrap\nIf you're that young and then\nA hundred and twenty five just hop highschool prospects don't go to college\nYou know you wonder how many won't go to college and then get the love scenes that way\nI Know it's interesting it makes for certainly the conversation I Would say over that\nYou know apple who move rate there'd be conversation about first second and talking about sports fantasy football I play fantasy football I hear the news right now\nI got ... fantasy football and um [noise] boy if it's crazy keeping up with the players the injury what the ... were in two weeks seven I'm your player plays phenomena where you get all the

move for them I think and and and I think it'll proved to be\nOne that pays dividends for them in the meantime the giants are trying to figure out because it's terrible lie what are they going to do you like man and getting on\nCourse operating in your word it to our his skill Don and what ... are going to do with him and\nThat was held back on June here I'm In the middle of complaining about
