just civil to stop\nThe endless hostility constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stores\nAs long as you get in the media right in the middle of this I suppose because CNN got one of the pipe bomb pay everybody Kate to Laney America Tonight that's where we're at we're talking about pipe bomb to eight of them that went in several different directions the eight packages that American mail bomb or they're looking\nFor that person as they go through a at Quantico\nEvery single piece of the bombs and try to place fingerprints or find fingerprints defined pieces of evidence totally makes sense so they were intercepted before they reached the target\nObama's former attorney general Eric Holder former CIA director John Brennan a prominent Democratic Party donor George Soros two packages were sent to California congresswoman Maxine Waters the VP Joe\nBiden uh-huh\nObama former press former secretary of State Hillary Clinton all on the list CNN as I mentioned the FBI says this is terrorism ... of course investigating acts of\nTerrorism so what you heard there as you heard the president he was at a political rally in Wisconsin saying that there's going to be an aggressive

to come together and peace and harmony and you heard bill de Blasio before that the mayor of\nNew York talking about you know the media that there is no place for for that for sending bombs which I Would agree you can't disagree with media you can have people on TV on radio on whatever think they're lame think they're making things up or love them or whatever\nBut of course bombing they're going to catch you you're going away for life was it worth it I'm going to say that it's not worth it so\nThey confirmed that they had the the exam va lobes they confirmed they were manila envelopes with a

that's we do know that that was confirmed\nIn the packages were all intercepted one went to the home of Clinton's in New York she wasn't home at the time the former press was but that doesn't get to them until it's screen somebody else gets that you know whatever\nBut there definitely were people that I'm more on the left that her the intended target so that's again the thing all the targets\nAre are usually the ones that you hear repeatedly criticized\nThey're investigating it officially ... daddy I think a Humvee has come in and\nThat is that it's just crazy and I saw a picture of it it's a picture of this giant plane cargo open like a movie like Indiana Jones getting in a fist fight with someone who is someone or maybe a Mission Impossible as Tom Cruise gonna fly off the bat does he have a parachute\nAnd instead it is a Humvee that comes flying out of the back of it but ... like I said nobody was hurt they had a drag it out\nYou can bet they were not thrilled to have to report that uh yeah we got a problem here is or\nIt has to do with the Humvee it\nWent in the opposite direction of where it was supposed to go\nTo the scores are pretty easy but not so easy for the Dodgers the red Sox even with two outs they're driving in runs there ahead to zip and the world series over the Dodgers they won on Wednesday again for to the final score\nIt was a big win for David Price because he was beleaguered a guy who always gets accused of not being able to get it done in the post season\nBut the less the got it done\nHe pitch six innings he did give up two runs off of three hits but he also struck out five\nUm the good news is not a loss pinned on Boston and instead it's it's a good win for the red Sox who would like to be able to bring back the world series trophy\nTo being town but they're going to go to LA and we'll see what happens when they switch gears in the world series and ended up going to\nEnd up going to a Los Angeles 'cause that's what obviously you do go to LA for a few them back to Boston maybe depending on if it's necessary who knows what if it was this week by the way millennia Trump today did a good job she was seen with President she was\nAt one point even addressed the media and you know she was there she was um she was there for the signing of the opioid bill and the legislation is meant to curb the opioid epidemic and\nIt's interesting he was reminded to sign it by the first lady Milan ... there was a viral video from the signing of events\nOf the East Room at the White House\nAnd you could see making them to his way out of the room before signing it she'd been directed him to return to the bill and there was some laughter and then he signed it and she at one point address the media to\nTalking about are calling for um peace as far as some of the rhetoric and what happened with the whole because it was in light of what happened with the um [noise]\nWith a pipe bombs that were being reported because it just boom fell out there all of a sudden it you know in the afternoon was when the news broke and that became\nBig news and and obviously conversation as to the what the reaction from the White House\nAnd reaction from people on the hill Congress folks and senators a as well I the caravan the migrants care a van of arriving at this point in the U.S southern Mexican town\nSo in the pre dawn hours of when\nTown so in the pre dawn hours of Wednesday\nThe um they were inching their way up there ... along the highway\nThe migrants and their supporters have said they've been forced to abandon their homeland countries like Guatemala\nBecause of corrupt governments extreme poverty and horrific violence\nFrom gangs and other criminals where lawlessness rules the amount of people in the caravan may have fallen to about thirty six hundred because some people are dropping out or are seeking asylum in Mexico or they're\nReading going home just depending so the numbers seem to have\nDropped most of them are from Honduras Nicaragua er or Guatemala El Salvador and that caravan though is pushing on that or what the numbers are like the numbers I just said\nOr or the numbers increased decreased whatever that is still happening so it has not been called off and dispersed in any way\nDid me make the move 'cause you know the Disney theme parks attract oodles of people from all over the place for weddings birthdays engagements that kind of always say what the happiest place on earth\nI Can't imagine the happiest place on earth is when there's ten million people pressing against you to get on line for a ride this can take an hour and a half to get on\nBut that's why they have a fast path that's all they have off times but what are the off times for Disney World and Disneyland anyway custodians at Disneyland in Anaheim and at Walt Disney worlds in Orlando claimed the parks are prefer place forgets to scatter their loved ones ashes to\nDid you know that yeah so people sneak in their families\nMembers ashes and plastic bags of pill bottle or or they're hidden in purses or backpacks when they're inside they spread them throughout the landscape and the park and flower beds and water ride including pirates of the Caribbean\nUm other popular areas the haunted mansions\nIn fact they're saying that the hunted mansion probably is so much human ashes that it's not even funny wow um there was a a woman\nWho was quoted the other day and forty one year old Missouri native is saying that she later father to rest near Disney World gates earlier in the air to memorize there's to memorialize rather their summer trips together I don't know that there's something nice about that right\nBut how about this the Anaheim police department did confirm they've answered calls regarding ashes before Disneyland\nLike yeah you're not really supposed to do that but he sees the people sneak they don't better to just do it not ask for permission right\nI guess that's what the theory is just do it and and that's it who's going to know that they're not going to know who are just do what we think is the ... is what they would want or what we want it or you know whatever might be\nI don't know I think there's a there's something I'm\nIt's hard when you lose somebody right so I think there's something about spreading the ashes where you have the memory or what they wanted their wishes\nOr is there something about having a site where you can go to the site and visit and lay flowers and I mean it used to be that\nThere is no way you wouldn't have a headstone it you wouldn't go in and be able to honor them and lay flowers on the grave sites and they even called them blankets related over the whole site so pretty ... pretty interesting how that's changed I think a little bit more cremation\nAbout Nintendo the video game makers teaming up with a nonprofit Institute of play to bring their do it yourself ...\nCardboard gaming kids to a hundred elementary schools around the

with fish oil in it and then I had another cookie made with safflower oil and we looked at blood parameters of immune function in those aids patients that were taking both cook he said it was a randomized study and we were able to see the positive changes\nEven in patients that were quite sick with their disease we could offer a boost of their immune function simply by doing that so there's one example of the power of nutrition and there were hundreds\nI was just one of many researchers at Harvard or doing research on nutrition and a diseases\nWhile they had to be fascinating to to be
