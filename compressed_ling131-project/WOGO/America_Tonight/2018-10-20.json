converted two thousand and one Ford Excursion\nThat's what it was for the modifications was that part of the problem was there some other factors that contributed to what to this tragedy\nYou know what is it proceeds limousine chauffeur services what it was and they're doing a detailed internal investigation to determine the cause of the accident but\nI think that you got to look at limousines manner we look at regulations and weather really they're good enough\nWould you want to get into a limousine right now realizing what it's been converted from and yes I mean just because somebody has an accident that the most horrible accident we've seen him in a very long time do you panic I think it makes you\n\nTake a closer look at what you're getting into his you're trusting with your life and doing a little\nSleeve things even before the accident some of the people in the limousine we're taxing that they didn't feel safe\nOr it was kind of like a foreshadowing moment so this needs to be I think a wakeup call to the one\nWho is thinking of renting a limo just be very careful with these converted limos because a lot of them are converted they're smaller and then they make them big or just a big thing because of the way they jacked him up the way they look\nThey look cool but how are they link sending them how are they raising them how are they making the after market adjustments that they make how are they modifying it that's gotta be a very very big concern to anybody who's thinking about this anyway\nI went off in a tangent but a couple of you sent me notes about this I got this one\n\nFrom Alford who says Kate I've driven limousine I've taken limousines in my life and I think what's really to blame is the fact that somebody gets a limousine and they do all kinds of adjustments to it and then they take too many people in it\nAnd that's the problem it's human error I mean the driver was even certified for goodness sake of someone who's driven limousine I Know just how risky that can be then I got this one from pat who says boy I'll tell you what\nA I've written and all kinds of situations have been picked up from parties gone down town from further away and big cities I live in a rural area and often I'd take the whole over lift deal but I don't\nWorry so much about that there's people that I've come to trust to know when I looked at the record but that's different than his limousine where they were ... stuffing them in like they were stuffing all of them and obviously there were a lot of problems you feel really sad when you read the story of the crash\nAnd um what happened in and how so many of those were family members and no matter what the NTSB says Kate it can't bring back the lives of the people that were lost and they were young there was even from newly wed yeah there is a newly wed that\nI'm more in the limousine is supposed to be a big funds party and\nI think it was I said this what was that was listening to the first responder\nReally start to cry get choked up staying there people were alive when he was pulling them out and of course none of them live so I Hope that other people take a close look at it I mean look the funded riding a limousine of you written in the limousine\nBut there's different kinds of limousine so I guess it's good to to really dig into the background um sometimes we get fooled into that\nSecurity that that sense of security\nAnd we don't poke around enough and I hope this makes people laugh\nSome more questions that's all I Hope so how about this one this from Anthony on hurricane Michael okay looking at uh Pensacola gears bejesus out of me I have family members there I heard you talk about Florida State\nAnd the fact that I'm Florida State is basically shutting down\nAnd telling people to go home and that's a smart decision because thousands of people would be there on campus and it's right in the eye of what looks to be a horrific\nStorm and who knows what the water is going to be a wall of water\nAnd trying to escape that would be ridiculous so I Hope people are paying attention to people in their local news et cetera and they are boarding up and getting out and they're gone by the time you possibly read my email\n\nAnd things or read the big giant chunk of ... that just scream get out of there and that's what it looks like to me I mean it's you know nasty nasty stuff\nI mean it's you know nasty nasty a duff and then there's this one from Craig ...\nAnd Anthony wiener who screwed up a lot of life is being released from prison early I think it was one of the dumbest movies with Hillary Clinton to stick with\nHis wife whom I deem when Anthony wiener was so toxic but anyway he's supposed to get out of prison three months earlier than originally was scheduled to what kids with that\nYeah he remembered this since twenty Seventeen he pled guilty to one in charge of transferring the material to a minor in a federal court\nAnd there was a Fifteen year old girl and the social media site for a couple of months so um\nThey're saying that there for good behavior for what not\nThey he gets those um months I guess shaved off he was sentenced to Twenty one months altogether in a federal prison so his prison term would have ended in August to twenty Nineteen his new release date I guess is is may and it is because of\nGood conduct time earned that kind of thing and uh that's typical of what could happen which is why you know that that's why they're saying that so I'm wow he you know\nHe really did he can do a lot of people I mean ... I think he tank even more a tank Hillary Clinton's because members of whole emails saying the FBI investigation surfacing you know the email server on his laptop and uh the former FBI Director James Comey announcing that\n\nAction day and yeah he he he definitely has some serious egg on the safe for not just that but a couple of different things he gets the past the first\nTime around then ... then it happened again something happened and then he has the latest thing that happened um what's a Fifteen year old girl in twenty six team that was just like I said to talk to everyone around him [noise]\nI haven't heard that name a longtime Anthony wiener\nHang with us we jump over the other side and we're going to demand have poured here on America's tonight [noise]\nHi this is Dave states like I've been with WW IBM W O jewel radio since Nineteen eighty seven in these sales and advertising department man what do I enjoy\nUh I really enjoy the aspect of\nThe sales and marketing because it gives me\nDifferent opportunities to be mobile we go from the station to knock on doors consult with business people perspective advertisers even after Thirty years when a advertisers beginning advertising in our station and they get results from our loyal audience that's a fantastic\nFeeling and again just working together with people that\nIn one accord with one purpose and that is to for the kingdom of God I mean that's there's nothing better\nJoined Dave and sharing the ministry at W.
