woman that you know to build lighted and this and that but\nUm for the most part I've gotten a lot of good feedback on the book and\nSurprisingly enough I've gotten good feedback from men and they've read it and they said that you know they looked at the whole scope of\nEverything that I bring out in the book and it makes sense and that they see things through different eyes and that is exactly what I Want to happen I Want tradition to be broke and I don't want people looking at you know okay this is how it's always been this is how we always treat such and such\nI Want them to break that

when we first started talking what was it that made you write this book what did you learn about yourself after you got through this process\n[noise] that's a good question Kate I um when I first started writing the book I was very unsure of the direction that I wanted to go because of that very thing because when I started writing it I didn't have that\nSelf confidence of myself because obviously you know I'm growing up you know I'm One of eight and you know I was the oldest girl and so it's like certain\nTagline certain things are required of you and so I was kind of like I was confident but not old I was you know not assertive I was kinda like\nKinda mouse fee I guess [laughter] and I started coming into my own the more I wrote the more I started to believe and the more I started seeing you know that it's not just a word that there is actual foundation to believe in yourself based on\nGod's word and the more I I the more I research the more I looked at things the more confident I became and I started telling myself yesterday and you can be what\nEver you want to be and as long as you allow that to lead your footsteps than your act can give you what your purpose is

do a specific thing because God it\nLooking at your and he laughed at her and he basically told her no he wasn't going to do it and if you read the story it goes on to to tell how Deborah and another woman actually brought down the general of the opposing army and\nIt was a woman that did it so the ... the general of the army could have been the Victor here but it turned out to be Deborah and her

America Tonight close your eyes and imagine right now your house disappears before your eyes what does that feel like\nPretty much Michael left Mexico beach in shreds completely shredded some of the photos and the video from there are I Would say shocking but we've seen this before\nIt's very different and very personal though when it happened to you good news is so many people came together including a hospital there where they got the most serious people out in other words there was a man who was waiting for a heart transplant there was a woman who's about to give birth\nAnd they were able to chapter chopper them out of the area thank goodness but it was a real\nKick in the stomach catastrophic damage six people at least I think there could be more killed by hurricane Michael one of the four most powerful hurricane ever\nTo hit the United states so this was in ... I looked pretty bad boys some of those trees were been at this was bad when we say ... for\nOne of the four worst hurricanes of all time you know we're not fooling on this one and the descriptions of it looks like a bomb we've heard that before when there's been catastrophic damage after tornadoes and other types of wind storms but boy nothing like this and you see the aerial views a thousand people I mean\nJust impacted plus with\nTrees cheered off tangles of power lines in the streets boats piled up like they were baby boats in a bath tub thrown upside down just things you don't normally see frankly and\nThe administrator of the FEMA\nSo it it was like William long\nHe saw he saw that you know what this isn't going to be put back together overnight it's time to be put back together next week the week after that the week after that this is the long haul that's what it is\nAnd then the storm moves up toward the north to there's power outages in Virginia and North Carolina that a hundred and forty five thousand Virginians didn't have power according to the department of emergency management\nAnd when we see something like this you know it it makes me think of when people would make fun of me\nI'm In the ten years I've done it\nThink of when people would make fun of me I'm In the ten years I've done the show you know we'd be talking about emergency go bags and things you had to do\nSell it on the show and people will say oh come on really do I really think unless you have to have emergency kids are you really doing that and the answer is yes\nBecause imagine this is going to hit landfall what are you got packed up what about your documents 'cause wanted shredded like tooth picks you're not finding those bills you're not finding the stuff that you need to find to to get through a what you have to get through\n... and you're not finding it and hopefully you've got it written down somewhere and that's basically what it looks like it looks like people are just trying to piece things together I mean people lose all their belongings like that too if you're just stuck\nI think are not even part of the equation all of this terrible what happened to ...\nI Know you cannot bring back a life in some of these cases of twisted sick\nDespicable and human acts so I think it's warranted of course if someone shouldn't receive the death penalty and it has been investigated to within an inch of any possible evidence that it would be the best case scenario since Thursday\nThe Washington and people are listening to us from Washington Washington Supreme Court declared its death penalty unconstitutional\nAnd um it's the twenty states to band or says spend any way capital punishment\nThe state's highest court didn't rule the death penalty illegal in of itself but rather the way it's been carried out so saying that it's an it's arbitrary and racially biased\nA lot of people who are legal scholars say that this is the latest step\nToward the continued abolition of the death penalty that this move\nAnd instead you know having these life in prison sentences it's going to become more of the rule than the exception you know we've seen other legislatures turned things over court six hundred New Jersey New York\nAnd there was a nationwide moratorium on the death penalty that was lifted in the mid seventies so executions actually peaked at Ninety eight Ninety nine but they've declined since then twenty three and twenty Seventeen Eighteen so far this year\nAnd it's the dilemma it's the moral dilemma it's the ethical dilemma it's the legal dilemma it's the wrestling with that it's people who disputed it's see because I'm open minded and look at all sides of it and I get that\nIf you want it to look at all my ideologies he said well they don't match up and I don't care because that's why I say I don't care if you're left of left or right of writers somewhere between or you say I don't need a label I Am who I Am and I vote for the person that I look at the issue\nAnd so for me diving deeper was the norm in my family and humid up your own mind whether people agree with you or not in your own family or outside of your own\nFamily I think the good thing is in the places where it slowed down\nWhen people were deciding the death penalty and the harshest punishment they could decide they really took things into account let's say\nThey really taken into account now one of the big arguments that I'll get is well it's supposed to be a deterrent but isn't really a deterrent health of deterring heinous crimes because we're still things terrible things happen\nAnd I guess it depends yeah and it also depends on your philosophy sometimes religious belief\nCome into play are you an eye for an eye person do you really feel that way I just know from myself personally at crime at a very young age and seeing some on believable a brutal things happened to completely innocent people destroying their families\nMaking\nSo many weep uncontrollably and bringing them to their knees like I've never seen before in my life and knowing that definitely they had nailed the case shut that this was the way to go and does it bring relief does it bring\nUp a a rapid\nLose than to tie up for the family now because once somebody is taken away you can never get them back\nAnd it doesn't necessarily have that feeling maybe some would say that but I think most it's the opposite they they say they thought they would feel\nThey would feel relief but they don't necessarily feel relief so where this goes is going to be pretty telling him pretty interesting I think I'm politically speaking\nPretty telling him pretty interesting I think\nI'm politically speaking ties to the past that kind of thing but the fact that the impact of the jury's decision to impose the death sentence if there is a racist taint to it to the practice\nOf it than no a African Americans make up about Thirteen percent of the U.S population they account for thirty four point three percent of the defendants who were executed those are clearly statistics from\nDeath penalty in Information Center I'm Seventy six percent of the victims in that case\nAnd the cases that resulted in execution were white so this is where some of this discussion also goes to attitudes in numbers and all of that and regions and what the\nWhat previously\nWas acceptable not being acceptable now I think it's always worth the debate and to have a discussion and look closer at it\nBut I think we're going to see that fall it's interesting because in ten years I think we're going to have legalized marijuana and every single state Texas may be the last to do it I don't know but\nI Do think that's going to happen because of the money that's being made what it's doing for the states there are some really crazy things you have to deal with when you're talking about marijuana and legalizing it but I Do believe\nBased on what we're seeing with cannabis companies in the ...\n\nWithin ten years I think it's legalized in ten years and I think there's so many other issues that we dance around or we talk about that it won't be any closer\nTo any sort of a solution or maybe even not even a compromise and the death penalty will be one of those there's still be unless it's a Supreme Court ruling there will be hold outs and there will be other states that will say no thank you\nAnd there's pressure to do that too because of mistakes that have been made and I get it\nAbsolutely\nIn the meantime you might not get what's happening with the market and I've got a bunch
