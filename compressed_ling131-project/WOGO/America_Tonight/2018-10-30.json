you learn how at Feeding America dot org ... by Feeding America and the ad council [noise]\nEverybody welcome to this version of America can night sad to say America needs to heal itself\nAnd we love not hate fortunately this anti Semitic grant of this crazy deranged man killing a loving people and injuring ... others in a synagogue is just so over the top and it's taking people a few days even wrap\nTheir minds around what's happened and the outpouring\nOf support naturally not a surprise for the people from the tree of life synagogue and the people of Pittsburgh has been phenomenal uh Pittsburgh rabbi talks about the massacre on America in the attack and that\nSure you know the synagogue\nA rabbi Jeffrey Maier said while American citizens can't freely and safely worship in their house of worship and celebrate the Sabbath it concerns me because it challenges the safety and security of all Americans in any house of worship and yes it's very\nTroubling so it is very troubling and it is the conversation that needs to be had\nWhen we're talking about how do we protect the people who go to worship in any form of worship Myers by the way was starting services Saturday morning when the gunman burst in\nAnd this Robert\nBowers is the gunmen are when he burst into the Pittsburgh capitals shooting the people and screaming anti Semitic statements and just picked off the people that were ... soft targets so three women eight men from the age of fifty for two Ninety seven were killed including two\nThree women eight men from the age of fifty for two Ninety seven were killed including two brothers he's being held this rabbi as sort of a hero definitely hero for saving a lot of his congregants\nBut he said you know they'll call me a hero and he said he's coping badly with the trauma and he regrets he couldn't save more people and of course that's how he would feel I mean you know he also said he's not sure if the shooter can be forgiven cause the wounds are to open to answer that kind of question when he's been asked that and can you really for give everybody\nA for all evil you know that's one of the big questions that you try to answer a when it comes to religion and theology obviously as religion but ah in trying to answer that question so I think\nSynagogues or on high alert churches are higher on high alert we've seen churches where people have been killed as well and a lot of times the policy that moving forward is adopted as we have to have somebody arms we have to have guards we have to protect\nThe the flock and we don't wish we didn't have to do this but we do and this is the way we we live now so we'll have to accept that that's what we do moving forward I don't know that everybody will embrace that I think it's the discussion that's being\nHad in happening right now across America or next week is another week of services across the land\nAnd will there be more churches synagogues other places of worship where you'll find that some people are armed in the meantime there was another hate crime or hate crime being considered any way and this happened in the a Kroger and this was in the south\nYou get to the content there or you go to the G than website and you can also get it there too as well but um that's terrific and the other thing is my I haven't talked a lot about it but my\nMy book is coming out because people asked about the story was the story but the story with lessons because he wants to just hear about me and what about what it related how can relate to you so my book is called deal your own destiny it's by Forbes\nAt Ford's book produced it published it increase your odds when dig and become extraordinary it's on Amazon pre sale right now but it uh it drops on\nThe nights so under the ... the book\nDeal your own destiny drops and I'm excited about that and I'll tell you more about that as you know we move along here on the show I'd so let's talk about the big headlines the big headlines really are focusing on the midterm elections because we're getting closer to that\nThat is that is right around the corner there are some hot races there are a\nLot of people it seems doing the early voting but I think it depends on where you live and a lot of times we think that but then we see the numbers and they're not necessarily high much higher in a presidential year\nAnd you know we're grief stricken ever Pittsburgh you stories about that the funerals than\nThe first lady and the president are going to be there on Tuesday and of course there is concern about security but I think when you're the leader of the free world you need to be there I think it's smart to go so then the conversation is about the trauma afterwards and the lives lost that tree of life\nAnd struggling with hate speech tied to that and\nWhat is it all mean and uh know frankly and the Jewish community this kind of divide over Donald Trump lots of support for him and then not support but that's pretty much how it is in this country where a polarized nation across the board when it comes to politics\nI think the big takeaway from\nSquirrel hill which is the suburb where this synagogue was\nIs that\nLove is stronger than hate but when you go into a place of worship viewer vulnerable you're a soft target and the conversation has to go toward\nThe need to guard do you need somebody armed how do you deal with that potential threat which may never happen and hopefully never ever happen but\nCan we now say we know what could happen next and the answer is you just never know\nThe other question is are we going to see any kind of a clash at the border eventually ah the deployment of fifty two hundred additional troops to the Mexican border with that caravan from Central America making its way through Mexico toward the United states\nWe're still away away from that\nWhile that happens there is also um and the scramble for votes going on with the mid term elections there is the scramble over what's going on with the stock market\nAnd tech stocks are dragging down I think a lot of other stocks so Monday battered again the Dow Jones was down a swung more than nine hundred points from three fifty\nThe Dow Jones was down a swung more than nine hundred points from three fifty up to five hundred negatively wiped out games that whole thing\nThe Dow closed down about two hundred and fifty points it's kind of bouncing all around and you look at the the issues China Russia\nEmerging markets uncertainty of policy in when it comes to that a terrorist news tech stocks being off all of that higher interest rate you know even apple you think of people lining up to get the latest greatest apple\nPhone every year it's it's like a must have for people So Apple shares are down eight points fifty four percent from their massive high\nYou know you just think of apple winter or just massive I should have got an apple when I had two dollars in my pocket but no now it's down and Google was down almost twenty percent from its high so a lot of um tech stocks also taking a beating\nAnd part of that is because there were reports that England plants tax Facebook and Google revenue two percent in that country they hadn't done that before so then that sends the market toppling\nI said it before all said again and keeps you never heard the show listen you're at the crap stable when it comes to the markets when it comes to investment we all know that\nUm it doesn't take a genius to realize that or you know it's like\nIt's like anything that you invest in you get these assurances you think you do your homework you look at it but then something can wipe it out so the key idea is to keep your eye on it and not walk away from it I think that's what happens\nSomething balloons you get excited and then you kind of move away from it because you're on to do in life and other things and you're not checking closely on it check it every day look and see where that stocks going\nAnd what you need to do I'm not a stockbroker advising you I'm just giving you my two cents on the right way to ride that kind of thing instead of waiting until who for what kind do of course\nWhen you're talking about a four O. one K. which is awesome if you have a four one K. you pick a basket of stocks in the beginning of the year when the entry point is and then usually you can't maneuver that too much or if you're retired you can you got to pay attention to what it is you have\nChecked for stocks with dividends would be my only advice if you have a nice healthy to have it in that certainly helps this is a sad story eighty a hundred and eighty nine people on a brand new Boeing jets\nThat was operated by lying aircraft and they're pulling unfortunately mangled body parts out of the the ... to\nUm no explanation for what happened it happened shortly after take off this guy was clear and\nThe Boeing seven thirty seven had been in service for a couple of months had flown eight hundred hours the pilots asked to return to the airport after they took off\nRequests was cleared but the plane then lost contact and launched into this the oh my gosh so who knows uh they're finding ID card hangs you know all kinds of things that you can imagine and they're trying to identify people very rough for anybody who knew somebody on that\nFlight a Fifteen ships are looking for the main section and the victims\nYou know the um three hundred rescuers have been deployed from search and rescue\nThirty divers in the water trying to get the future will launch\nThe black box is always a big concern there looking with robots and sonar technology and Indonesia is actually one of the fastest growing aviation markets especially in that air area 'cause air travel is a necessity to go to the other areas near it but\nIt's kind of mixed when it comes to safety you know member um planes were banned from flying to the United states in two thousand and seven 'cause they were deficient in a couple of different areas like technical expertise\nPeace rather trains people trained personnel record keeping inspection procedures but that makes you feel safe right wanting to get on one of those planes not really and lie in the air is the largest budget airlines fifty percent of the market they\nControl so there's plenty of people that would jump on that plane that's what they taken flying to different Iowans different different areas of you know Indonesia where they're going where they were going and going to Kuala Lumpur or any of those other bonds and\nJust getting that phone call and\nYou know realizing who's on that the flight and all that kind of thing I mean I that's why they're scurrying\nTo identify people as fast as they can hurt you wanna hang with us don't forget about the nail the score Wednesday and Thursday our last segment of that first hour you want to be a part of it you might be a winner winter winter speech on the flip side [noise]\n\nJeffrey believes finding an honest car dealer like dynamite autos is important work with her dealer before Bush budget totally beard opportunity to get a good deal dynamite autos auctions what'd you been on the corner of your dreams at the price you think is fair I think we've got a better deal or\nBetter deal is the auction ditch truth Jeffrey as loving his new role I logged on to shine among autos dot com today or lose out on your best opportunity to save money on your next car\nYou're not that busy just take the kids to school I for that night and soccer practice and band were poor or buy groceries to take the dog to the vet put Japanese car grab dry cleaning and go to the dentist but you're not busy\nHonoring the Carney tires you could do the job tomorrow right\nWhen you need tires but not another thing to do call PSI mobile tire the tire shop to come to you our truck or if you leave home office wherever you may be called PSI mobile tire [noise]\nWell first of all just look at things objectively effective every one of us is going to die so there's some basic questions we have to ask why do we die why are we here what\nIs my purpose in life so if you go back and look at some does philosophical questions and then look at the information that's available then you will come to the right conclusion of simple way to approach it is and say God if you real please show me are real and he'll do it just out of the sincerity of your heart\nReally just a simple ... complicated but it really is\nRight to say whatever is to show the belief and I think you're absolutely hundred percent right on that no question and talking about breaking it down like we're people are and we're the world had what's your biggest fear is people down in great\nWhat you're talking about the principles in invertebrate American spiritual and I wonder if you don't embrace\nOne way or the right to not embrace it but what you believe doesn't necessarily mean is factual what you believe\nThe truth is the truth because it is the truth it spans a test of time is going to be true regardless of whether you believe it or not for example the law of gravity you might not believing gravity but you step off the roof of a house you're going to get pulled to the earth gravity exist\nSo boy a nutrient spends on it all Jews that you should know the truth and the truth show set you free and Sarah invertebrate America examines a lot of facts objectively so that people can come to the right conclusion is a witness to\nOh I Love that that's a perfect sentiment there's no question about that what's been the reaction Dr Haley your book with the people you know and now they're even more word is getting out about it what's been the reaction you've got to be ...\nWell a lot of people say oh man this stuff it stimulates should thinking it's true it's controversial [laughter] are all kind of you handled the controversial questions that popular leaders try to avoid\nEverything that's controversial homosexuality same sex marriage women pastors\nAll these type of thing the Bible addresses that so I didn't write the Bible God wrote it he created us he knows all about it and he put these things in place for we to function juice I came that you might have life that you might have it more abundantly\nWe do things go way there'll be less stress you're going to have trials because the righteous suffer through many trials but he did there with us to take us through the trials and we're supposed to be make the other people who are not Christian jealous because they're going to see something different about us\nSo that's how it works we live holy without going to be perfect use all the one that was perfect and he wasn't kill other people in the Senate he was killed for who he was\nHe was a king of the Jews you go out and it's like Emmanuel oil guy with us so that's just a fact people got to deal with it one way or another people go have to deal with that issue who is Jesus you got to deal with that before you\nLeave the service is only two destination heaven or hell\nI'd like to believe it or not that exists yeah I've done let me let me try to people don't notice actually died\nBack in Ninety four Ninety five at a major heart attack\nAnd when they were operating on me I came out of my body among the operating room looking these doctors work on my body and they wanted a dog so we lost and we lost and I'm like no I'm right here I'm trying to get their attention but they didn't see me I'm like no I'm right here I'm right here\nSo that the separation of body soul and spirit separation it's not and now ... some religions teach separation your your your spirit and so go back to its creator\nAnd your body goes to the great and so I'm trying to get their attention and what a doctor said let's try one more thing 'cause I have flat line and when he tried to one more thing I was put back into my body and woke up in the recovery room\nAllow that is that that is powerful and that is a perfect place to end the doctor Haley thank you so much pick up the book certainly we've gone through reasons why and what is the question and and everyone will guide says what is your purpose there's so much to the thank you Dr Hailey\nThanks for having everyone please go live far publishing and just type in invertebrate America and then my book will come up I I Believe is

know some people who knew some people connected to it luckily they weren't in the ... uh but they feel justice badly for what's happened\nYes I Know somebody that had gone there a doctor by my doctor actually kept gone there when she was doing a residency I knew all these people wow everybody who was killed it was awful\nYeah it was awful so the reaction in Washington because there's been a lot of conversation about uh not politicizing this and then Trump saying things except for what's the latest there\nWell the president tweeted out today or I actually yesterday there is a great and anger in our country caused by inaccurate and even in our reporting the news the fake news media the true enemy of the people must stop\nThe open and obvious hostility and report them as accurately and fairly that will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage and then be able to bring all sides together and the peace peace and harmony today Sarah Huckabee Sanders\nGave a briefing our first one in a week and basically said a word that respond to the fake media why she said they knew they know who they are\n... but they won't say who that is and and now the value of it is\nAnd and as you said briefing first briefing we've seen in a while from Sarah Huckabee Sanders and I guess there's a word that the president and the first lady are going to go to Pittsburgh right on Tuesday\nRight while the as the rabbi at the guy that he's welcome other rabbis the city has said he's not but obviously it's the synagogues rabbi that the important ones\nYeah I'm In the meantime people are talking about what's happened with the three hate crimes are what we think are to be hate crimes in the you know the Seventy two hours and the effect that might have in the mid term elections you've you've been in Washington a long time what do you think\nWell I have been in Washington a long time but I don't necessarily know how turtles lectures are going to be affected\nWhat we do know for instance is that everybody said Hillary Clinton was going to win and it was going to be a landslide et cetera and they didn't know and I and uh I work at a picture that set the only real poll is on election day that we really don't know what effect is going to be a well obviously have\nWe really don't know what effect is going to be a well obviously have some effect in terms of who will do what they vote for but other than that I cannot tell you\nYeah let me ask you this question um you grow up in a family especially with your brothers\nWho you talked about current events everybody was active in what was going on in your community so I think that fueled the fire for you to do what you're doing it did for me do you think that younger people are more apathetic or do you think more will get out and vote and this is again speculating\nWell it depends I think that millennials have the lowest voting record of any group ever I don't tend to vote however Generation Z which is just now coming of age and they'll probably vote in the next presidential election\nKnow what's what am I going to do I've had long discussions with so many people on the show about that as you know and will do more of\nThat and I've had them off the air the last couple of days about what our houses ... any kind of house of worship what are they doing and it seems that if they don't have some kind of a guard\nSome have opted to have people who have a concealed carry permits for them but they are there in the crowd like they would normally be there are a member of the congregation\nBut they're armed their arm somehow you know they've they've they've got a weapon that if that were to happen they could uh you know they could fire they would be there so\nThat becomes the question it's it's like the teacher question in Israel we know that is the teachers are what their armed and why are they armed their arms because it's too dangerous for them not to be because it's just the soft target\nAnd that's what places of worship are there a soft target to that's what we're talking about here on America Tonight\nWith me Kate to lady and I always say there's about what's going on in your backyard in mind and there's lots of conversation about that as there would be in and should be because there's massive concern over you know what um what's next what do we do how do we defend ourselves\nDo we want to live in the world paranoid no but do we really need to be aware of our surroundings and the answer to that question is you do need to be around where of your surroundings but if I'm In Pittsburgh and I'm In a suburb but I'm going to an early morning service were a few different things are going on in the synagogue I'm not thinking that\nThis is right for um us being a target today that you know somebody's going to come in and they're gonna they're gonna start shooting and\nUntil somebody called nine one one or the SWAT Team gets here and the police get here we're basically sitting ducks and we have to figure out what we're going to do if we're if we're away from where it's taking place or we're just walking in the door running away or what are we what are we doing\nUm sadly that's where we are so if that's where we are then ... what is the action going forward what is it that is the the thing that you have to do or think about doing are having conversations\nIn these congregations anyway about doing just like they are in school sadly we know and just like they are in other places that should be places that are safe including your own\nPlace of employment how often do we see sadly that where somebody's disgruntled somebody from the past comes in whatever the story is and\nIn an instant like that everything changes and we've had that conversation with people who have been\nTargeted we've had three different high profile cases where people in the ten years have come on with us to talk about the um horrific\nFeeling it is when you were trapped and you know you're trying to figure out okay what's the next move in fact\nI Do remember one of the last people we talked to poll just about\nBeing at that D.C Navy Yard when the former navy reservist killed twelve people in a mass shooting\nAnd then was killed by the police that was back in twenty Thirteen\nAnd the the person we talked to we just talked to about a year ago who was in that situation and everybody was ducking for cover and running and trying to figure out where ... you know where they were going to go and how they were going to skate that and they were just absolutely done at a navy\nShip yard at a Navy Yard wow and so whether it's where you work whether it's where you worship or whether it's where you send your kids to school it is sadly what you do have two comments\nOr whether it's where you send your kids to school it is sadly what you do have to contemplate\nAnd does it mean to be paranoid looking over your shoulder think the world is coming to an end no it is sad times it's sad that that's what we have to contend with\nBecause as a kid I certainly didn't have to deal with that many of you listening to me you certainly weren't thinking that and I was in that in between air to where we weren't it wasn't Cold War so there wasn't any of the duck and cover drills\nOr so we ... I didn't have that childhood where you were concerned about that you know you're concerned about the fire drills we had fire drills that's it\nThere wasn't any metal detectors there wasn't a concerned about somebody coming in with a gun kidnapping somebody doing something else like that it was never a concern now it's not about is it a concern let's move the ball forward what do you want to do\nCongregations need to have those conversations if they have in with their\nFlock their parishioners to people who go there and worship um the the folks in the synagogues whatever whatever kind of worship it is\nMake that kind of decisions too we stay as we are and just be more alert do we have some kind of protocol to we have a guard duty have concealed carry\nThroughout the services where there's one or two people who are who are already have the permits for that and feel secure doing it we just don't tell people who it is because why would you do that just let it roll\n'em and that I think is what's happening but I think that's happening more than one would suspect I mean so you got to catch up with\nA sadly the reality of domestic terrorism\nAnd that and how it has altered our lives but to alter it permanently boy we sure don't want that that's for sure\nAnd the Pittsburgh mayor and uh the former rabbi at the synagogues thought that the president should wait till he's coming in on a Tuesday the Pittsburgh suspect says he prefers the term invaders to describe immigrants because he\nWas listening to the talking points on TV apparently great and Robert Bowers his name is complained about the invaders six days before the shooting is what he was saying\nAnd uh he he wrote on social media his social media gab it is that I've noticed a change and people saying illegal not that now I say invaders I liked is\nUm you know whatever it is he has forever changed the lives of lots and lots of families and\nYou know he minutes before eleven eleven days before he was writing all kinds of ah stuff about the caravan except for on on the social media site and then on October twenty seventh he goes into the tree of life synagogue\nAnd he wrote that post about invaders and said I'm going in and like in his\nAnti immigrant attitudes to his attack on the synagogue\nSo where are you ... and apparently a the Hebrew immigrant aid society which helps refugees was one of the things that he was rambling about\nSo um that's what he said when he when he went in and and I mean just wow\nI'm I'm believable I mean just on believable as to what has happened here but\nAgain\nWe're placing the hatred with love and replacing the idea of okay we don't want this to happen again and not\nDoing something more proactive I think it at this point that has to be that has to be something that's talked about in churches synagogues any place of worship whatever it is that has to have to have to be\nHas to be talked about 'cause if you could be anywhere in this country that certainly was an area where you would not have expected that to happen was just put it that way [noise]\nBut anything that the soft target\nIs a wide open [noise]\nGo to the mail bag next here on the ATM\nHis own room though you know\n\nNot completed high school and more of a social thing that wasn't even all these years had passed I still have that longing to have my mom at age ... courage\nAnd if you're if you're even considering getting and I put them online you can do it no one gets on my own if you were thinking of your high school diploma\nOn educating near you finish our diploma dot org and finish market plummets dot org ... by the dollar general energy foundation and the ad council\nCollege here and just like your car your\nFurniture sees routine maintenance [laughter] it's a perfect time to call your local running a dealer you thoroughly go through your heating system to make sure it's operating safely and effectively got only will they be on time and professional they'll make sure that when our Wisconsin winter his you'll be ready for it\nBrian whatever it takes\nIn the ship was alley contacts tally heating and electric heating and electric dot com boy that they try and dot com\nBut imagine you it happen instantaneously but it was a ten minute rampage and I know you described it as the first responders feeling just stick to their stomach and describing the scene is one of the worst that they've ever seen and of course it's that way\nBecause you have exploding bullets that are hitting these people in what condition or the body then and there are dead and you've got eleven people that died and then you have other people that were seriously wounded as well\nAs to move on to 'em some more emails\nThat are just spanned the variety of a couple of different things including this one this one is from ... who says\n... I Hope you are well in your world sister we need your voice the voice of reason in a non reasonable world as a pipe bomb or I heard that the the guy from Florida had more bombs\nThat he was ready to send to more people is that true well they intercepted thanks for that they intercepted four team packages and ... are ... um\nBut they say that he had planned I guess from his rambling what he had written what he was working on that he had a list of about a hundred people he wanted to send packages to when he was going through the list\nSo this was just a handful of the people on the list and we certainly have named them well known Democrats and\nHe told him as\nGators after he was arrested in plantation Florida that the pipe bombs wouldn't have hurt anyone that he want to hurt anyone but they were real I mean they check them out and they were not fake bombs they were real bombs and they would have been a danger to somebody if they had gone off\nThey think he made the pipe bombs in the van\nAnd they're saying because they found the equipment to stamp the envelopes the paper or the printer everything the powder all that that he needed to do that an hours before he was arrested is so strange he was playing doing the D. J. thing is playing music at Florida strip club where he worked for two months\nHe went before that he was a male dancer or who the pizza delivery guy he had done a bunch of different jobs and two thousand and two he was arrested after Miami cops say he threatened to bomb or a power company saying it would be worse than September eleventh\nAnd he's been arrested for a couple of other things as well so I mean now this is it because you figure what the charges he has to go through the due process\nBut looking at the charges and who he targeted he will\nCertainly if convicted go away for probably the rest of his life he's fifty six so there would be forty five forty eight plus years involved in that so yes he had a list of a hundred people\nThat are that he was looking at art this one is from ... and ... says Kate\nI heard you tell the story about the um [noise]\nI heard chemistry about all the people who were taking these selfies at your sanity\nAnd they were dying because of what they you know where they were going and the kinds of shots they were trying to get ... and how they were falling to their deaths I just cannot believe that\nPeople are so dumb to do that they I guess the national park has to have signs up about taking selfies yeah you know it was really sad there was an Eighteen year old he was a hiker and he was trying to get that and he was in it he was a kid that was visiting and he fell hundreds of feet to his death\nHe was at the top of that comic waterfall that you always see\nAt and how awful just trying to get a shot\nI mean this is the this is the kind of where we live in right I Want to get the perfect and I get it like I get trying to get the you want to get the perfect photograph listen we had cameras were trying to get perfect photographs right I mean I had a mother who's constantly and went behind you in clamp down your hair and it didn't look right and change things but we weren't standing on the top of waterfalls now because\nOf this one in one way tremendous opportunity to capture what's around you\nAre the there's the sort of risk thing or that not thinking and taking that extra step back\nWow be careful out there if you're out at some of those monuments and you're looking at these great views just enjoy the view to take a picture of the view without making it a selfie how 'bout that some of your thought Kate Delaney radio dot com invading the man cave next to an ATM [noise]\nMost of you know get heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S what if I told you for just fifty four Ninety five a month you could fight against heart disease naturally at heart and body extract we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart don't just take my word for word check out all of the success stories at\nH.

injuring ... others in a synagogue is just so over the top it has taken people a few days to even wrap their minds around what's happened and the outpouring\nOf support naturally not a surprise for the people from the tree of life synagogue and the people of Pittsburgh has been phenomenal uh Pittsburgh rabbi talks about the massacre on America in the tack and that\nSure you know the synagogue\nA rabbi Jeffrey Maier said while American citizens can't freely and safely worship in their house of worship and celebrate the Sabbath it concerns me because it challenges the safety and security of all Americans in any house of worship and yes it's very\nTroubling so it is very troubling edited the conversation that needs to be had\nWhen we're talking about how do we protect the people who go to worship in any form of worship Myers by the way we're starting services Saturday morning when the gunman burst in\nAnd this Robert\n... ours is the gunmen are when he burst into the Pittsburgh capitals shooting the people and screaming anti Semitic statements and just picked off the people they were ... soft targets so\nThree women eight men from the age of fifty for two Ninety seven were killed including two brothers he's being held the rabbi a sort of a hero definitely hero for saving a lot of his congregants\nBut he said you know don't call me a hero and he said he's coping badly with the trauma and he regrets he couldn't say more people of course that's how we would feel I mean you know he also said he's not sure if the shooter can be forgiven because the woman's or to open to answer that kind of question when he's been asked that\nAnd can you really for give everybody a for all evil you know that's one of the big question that you try to answer a when it comes to religion and theology obviously is religion but ah in trying to answer that question so I think\nSynagogues or on high alert churches are higher on high alert we've seen churches where people have been killed as well and a lot of times the policy that moving forward is adopted as we have to have somebody armed we have to have guards we have to protect\nThe the flock and we don't wish we didn't have to do this but we do in this is the way we we live now so we'll have to accept that that's what we do moving forward I don't know that everybody will embrace that I think it's a discussion that's being\nHat and happening right now across America or next week is another week of services across the land and will there be more churches synagogues other places of worship where you'll find that some people are armed in the meantime there was another hate crime or hate crime\nPeople are armed in the meantime there was another hate crime or hate crime being considered anyway and this happened in the a Kroger and this was in the south at a Kentucky grocery store fifty one year old\nYou get to the content there or you go to the G than website and you can also get it there too as well but um that's terrific and the other thing is my I haven't talked a lot about it but my\nMy book is coming out because people asked about the story was little story but the story with lessons because he wants to just hear about me and what about what it relate how can relate to you so my book is called deal your own destiny it's by Forbes\nFor his book produced it published it increase your odds when big and become extraordinary it's on Amazon pre cell right now but it uh it drops on\nThe knight's still on November ninth book\nDeal your own destiny drops\nAnd I'm excited about that and I'll tell you more about that as you know we move along here on the show so let's talk about the big headlines big headlines really are focusing on the mid term elections because we're getting closer to that\nThat is that is right around the corner there are some hot races are are um\nA lot of people it seems doing the early voting but I think it depends on where you live and a lot of times we think that but then we see the numbers and they're not necessarily high much higher in a presidential year\nAnd you know we're grief stricken ever Pittsburgh stories about that the funerals and\nThe first lady and the president are going to be there on Tuesday and of course there is concern about security but I think when you're the leader of the free world you need to be there I think it's smart to go so then the conversation is about the trauma afterwards and the lives lost that tree of life\nAnd struggling with hate speech tied to that and\nWhat is it all means and uh know frankly in the Jewish community this kind of divide over Donald Trump lots of support for him and then not support but that's pretty much how it is in this country we're polarized nation across the board when it comes to politics I\nThink the big takeaway from squirrels hills which is the suburb where the synagogue was is that\nLove is stronger than hate but when you go into a place of worship view are vulnerable you're a soft target and the conversation has to go toward\nDo you need to guard do you need somebody armed how do you deal with that potential threat which may never happened and hopefully never ever happens but\nKen we now say we know what could happen next and the answer is you just never know\nThe other question is are we going to see any kind of a clash at the border eventually ah the deployment of fifty two hundred additional troops to the Mexican border with that caravan from Central America making its way through Mexico toward the United states\nWe're still away away from that\nWhile that happens there is also um and the scramble for votes going on with the mid term elections there is the scramble over what's going on with the stock market\nAnd tech stocks are dragging down I think a lot of other stocks so Monday battered again the Dow Jones was down a slung more than nine hundred points from three fifty up to five hundred negatively wiped out gains that whole thing\nThe Dow closed down about two hundred and fifty points has kind of bouncing all around and you look at the the issues China Russia\nEmerging markets uncertainty of policy in and when it comes to that ah terrorists news yeah tech stocks being off all of that higher interest rate you know even apple you think of people lining up to get the latest greatest an apple\nPhone every year it's like a must have for people So Apple shares are down eight point fifty four percent from their massive high\nYou know you just think of apple winter or just massive I should have got an apple when I had two dollars in my pocket but no now it's down and Google was down almost twenty percent from its high so a lot of um tech stocks also taking a beating\nAnd part of that is because there were reports that England plants tax Facebook and Google revenue two percent in that country they hadn't done that before so the nuts and the market toppling\nInstead of before I'll say it again and keeps you never heard the show listen you're at the crap stable when it comes to the markets when it comes to investment we all know that\nUm it doesn't take a genius to realize that or you know it's like it's like anything that you invest in\nGenius to realize that or you know it's like it's like anything that you invest in you get these insurance is you think you do your homework you look at it but then something can wipe it out so the key idea is to keep your eye on it and not walk away from it I think that's what happens\nSomething balloons you get excited and then you've kind of move away from it because you're on to do in life and other things and you're not checking closely on it check it every day look and see where that stocks going\nAnd what you need to do I'm not a stockbroker advising you I'm just giving you my two cents on the right way to ride that kind of thing instead of waiting until who for what kind of course\nWhen you're talking about a four O. one K. which is awesome if you have a four one K. you pick a basket of stocks in the beginning of the year when that entry point is and then usually can't maneuver that too much or if you're retired you can you got to pay attention to what it is you have\nTo check first talked with David and it would be my only advice you have a nice healthy dividend that certainly helps this is a sad story eighty a hundred and eighty nine people on a brand new Boeing jet\nThat was operated by lying aircraft and they're pulling unfortunately mangled body parts out of the the ... to\nUm no explanation for what happened it happened shortly after take off this guy was clear and\nThe Boeing seven thirty seven had been in service for a couple of months had flown eight hundred hours the pilots asked to return to the airport after they took off\nRequests was cleared but the plane then lost contact and launched into the the oh my gosh so who knows uh they're finding ID card and you know all kinds of things that you can imagine

know member um planes were banned from flying to the United states in two thousand and seven 'cause they were deficient in a couple of different areas like technical expertise\nPeace rather trains people trained personnel record keeping inspection procedures but that makes you feel safe right wanting to get on one of those planes not really an lie in the air is the largest budget airlines fifty percent of the market they\nControl so there's plenty of people that would jump on that plane that's what they taken flying to different ... different different areas of you know Indonesia where they're going where they were going and going to Kuala Lumpur or any of those other spots and\nJust getting that phone call and you know realizing who's on that the flight and all that kind of thing I
