Nikki Haley says I'm Out she's not going to be the\nAmbassador to the un any longer at the beginning of the year but it was all positive as the president gave his blessing hey hey everybody Kate Delaney America Tonight let's rock into this thing\nAnd talk first about the Nikki Haley\nAnd the surprise because it was kind of a surprise although if you watch Haley and you are a political operative you would realize if I'm her campaign person and she only had some close advisors\nShe doesn't run a leaky ship shockingly so much else leaks out of Washington\nAnd a circles that our political but it doesn't with her so far\nSo that apart and UN ambassador has really built her own brand up especially politically speaking whether you like Kelly or not from a female perspective for the Republicans she is a strong candidate\nTo run for president eventually but she says she's not going to do it and challenge the president and twenty Twenty one about afterwards in her mid forties she looks like she could be that person perhaps because she's a rising star in the political or in the Republican Party\nAnd this is why she would step away because being the ambassador doesn't do much for her in that sense and certainly from the financial point of view and flat out building up\nYour money your your base uh you don't do that you're not doing that when you're the ambassador but you still\nIt's a you don't do that you're not doing that when you're the ambassador but you still are making news and serving the nation it's just a different kind of\nThing so I think that's what she's doing she leaving on her own terms and everything still intact the president signs off on that says what a great job she did it's all good on all sides of this thing for her\nWho comes in next who knows but I think watch her and see where she goes it's and I think this was pretty the timing of this was\nPretty um spot on especially before the twenty Eighteen mid term elections because this way you know forget it don't worry about I bowling what's happening there and keep the focus on it's chaotic you might be chaotic\nBut we're not going to see any political fallout from that because I've already said whatever happens it's about me just resigning from the\nPosition as the ambassador said not any of the other nonsense going on she's not tied to that she's not tied to whatever the politics and tactics of the White House or whether she agrees with some of them are doesn't agree with\nSome of them she had high praise for Yvonne ... and the president but she certainly was already a rising star when the president began his run when Trump began his run for president twenty six team\nAnd I think there's more to come for her what it is I don't know but I guarantee this is not it [laughter]\nAnd then they don't presidential election cycles there's more people that go out and vote period across the board so for midterms you'd be surprised the drop off could it be any lower because we don't even have fifty percent or even lower wonder if this is going to be a little bit\nDifferent this time around and we're going to see more people that go out and vote I think people look I don't care how you vote I care that you vote and you're involved I think that's why I say that because your vote is your vote and\nWe and other places other countries that scene is where you really can't vote freely we get to vote freely even if we don't agree on what\nOur fellow Americans are voting on and who are voting for\nVery scary Hurricane Florence\nThink about it September fourteenth it made landfall in North Carolina do you know what's happened since then this is the thing people don't talk about the aftermath it's spawn thousands of what they call mega mosquitoes across the state they're giant\nAnd ah have zebra sort of strike legs there two to three times as big as a normal mosquito that you get in the summer and when you see it you're going to notice that it's bigger than a penny\nAnd they carry 'em\nAnd they say it's most likely not going to make it even sick but they can carry heart worm they don't usually carry you know a dog ... wherever they don't usually carry human diseases I guess that's the good news but uh if you react badly the mosquitoes is not good and it's frankly I saw a picture um it's not\nIt's not too uh it's not it's a pretty big mosquito I I Would notice it you know ... it's a big mosquito so there are close to four thousand species of mosquitoes in the world at least sixty one species in North Carolina loan that is frightening\nA governor Roy Cooper order for a million to fund mosquito control efforts he says it's important because after initial wave of trying to eat as a second wave of others come and that's not good they can carry West Nile they ... they carry things that can kill ya\nSee even when you're cleaning up it's never over\nIts the aftermath I say that all the time people forget it's the aftermath what other damage what other surprises what other curve balls get thrown the way of the people who\nHad to pick up the pieces from a hurricane of tornado or whatever it might have been this was such a sad story to me Dylan Thomas\nThe Georgia high school football player who died after a game last month they say succumb to cardiac arrest stemming from the head injury just sixteen years old no autopsy the injuries were documented at the hospital the athletes parents are fine with the decision not to do an autopsy\nBut um he fell in the third quarter\nOf a game ... between his school\nAnd another school and he needed assistance but with alert and responses trainers told he told trainers he lost feelings in his legs who's helped off the field examined all that kinda stuff but then his condition condition got worse you know after he came off the field\nAnd before you knew it they took him to a hospital in Atlanta and he died at the hospital a couple of days later they did well after surgery they did forty\nThe little a couple of days later they did well after surgery they did forty hours of surgery medical testing lifesaving everything they said he was in great physical shape and there were ... know preexisting medical conditions none of that they don't know they say it was just an anomaly thing it was the\nPerfect amount of pressure\nOn the perfect spot at the perfect angle oh how sad is that\nI mean you know than ever just people jammed the funeral services but\nWho the perfect storm in a very sad sad a way to unexplainable on the sidelines not\nSeemingly feeling okay then all of a sudden taking a turn for the worst that's why the concussion protocol they'd take now especially in the pros but in college or whatever so vital is somebody

largest exporter of cut flowers in the world I Know that\nI was just reading a story about that so eight hundred million in twenty Seventeen that things could be higher because they're having less problems China it's a different thing because of the terrorists and also the distance\n\nSo because of that they're starting to pick up the runoff\nThere's been a twenty five percent ... yearly increase in demand for flowers from Kenya\nAnd they imported two point five\nMillion flowers from Kenya so when China is lacking too they turn to Kenya but then to the export challenges where how do you get the flowers in and where do you take the flowers and how do you get them\nAnd that's the biggest hurdle they have to face every single time you think about that cuts like I said cut flowers\n\nAnd getting them to wherever it is there going\nHoping they're okay and doing everything you can to get him to the point that they make it to the destination hit but who knew eight hundred

had it in my mind that the picture that she would go would go with it when I sent it to the publisher I sent the page and then the description of what\nThe picture that should go with that that part of the page so that's that's the way we I and I had a hard time being happy with the final result I can tell you [laughter]\nAnd that means your typical awkward because nobody's ever satisfied but what was it like when you when you finally got the book there's nothing like that feeling I think what was it like for you\nOh it was so exciting when I they delivered those books to me and I opened it up and there was a book that I had written with my name and with pictures of us it was the most exciting thing I've ever on no I but it was very exciting [laughter]\nOh I Love it what was the

took me that long to write the book [laughter] right by the rights of art\nLike be decided to write a book and that's a good question to ask you I mean we know you like to do 'em read and we talked about kids and and all that which oh your connection is fabulous and being a teacher but what was the whole writing process life for you to actually put it on paper\nWell you know what I have a story that I'm that I'm bribing or our process I I carry it in my mind for quite a while\nIt just and different parts of it you know we'll we'll manifested itself and and before I ever start to write and then when I start dry\nAnd I just it just kind of close because it's been in my mind so long and then after I finished the first draft then I go back and read it aloud I have to read it aloud because I have to hear if it blows\nYou know if that sounds good and I I bet I read it aloud about in times before I'm through with it\nYeah I mean it's such a smart thing to do I'm so excited for unity and

on Wednesday forecast calls for heavy rain\nTerrible pain and suffering that he says they endured after his confirmation Supreme Court Hooper Kavanaugh he just moves on right and just takes the high road is that what you would advise him to do and not to bomb making comments about ...\n... if you raise a great question because in my opinion you and I talked about this\nUh one of the downsides was his demeanor of just attacking back now you you know especially when he turned to the Senate or the one senator and said have you ever had a blackout drunk yeah\nAnd that to me raised a whole different set of questions also he had friends of his who supported him but he had a different version of that night\nA different version of how he he drank years ago et cetera so\nThere were some ... miles and everything I think for him\nLook out if you live in Pensacola look out if you're just south of Tallahassee it could be one of the worst hurricanes to strike that sort of big Ben and Florida Panhandle region is what they call it\nI mean I'm Sorry you were trying to stay in a hundred and some mile an hour when you're not going to win that battle so they have a hurricane warning in effect\nFor that Alabama and there's some of you are listening to us there and in Florida for that Alabama Florida border up to the ah swam the river\nSo so really take this to heart and also on that border to Mississippi Alabama border right there right in that the the beast and it means storm surge heavy rainfall hurricane force when all the things that that\nEntailed and most of the people there no I mean listen you know not to fool around with us so there's thirty five counties that have been declared\nAn emergency state of emergency\nBecause that means the funding Florida State their clothes their clothes from Tuesday through friday this week that's how serious they're taking it no way to take a chance to make sure all of the students and any of the faculty is nowhere near there because this is right where it could smash\nInto even Alabama governor Kay Ivey said the same thing state of emergency because power outages wind damage to a party and the debris is what all that can be so deadly you know when we had to last hurricane that came through\nTree fall down smashes into a trailer house whatever or you've got power that's out people trying to come back in\nIt's a nightmare so\nI think when you look at the two I think people are heating nest for the most part especially after they watched what has happened\nEarlier in this hurricane season even Florence with the flood 'cause it's always the flood thing afterwards that you're worried about but this Michael past boy oh boy I mean it really is coming up through the panhandle\nAnd it could intensify so that's the thing maybe it's the cat three but could me a shift to oh for let's hope not because then you're talking\nA little jump up and the wind miles per hour you know a hundred and thirty a hundred and fifty something\nYou've got five hundred Florida National Guard members who are activated of course because you've got to plan the logistics of it all where are you responding where is everyone being deployed basically when it happens and then five thousand more that are there so\nI mean this is happening fast\nSo fast so that means you know that's why they're clearing the decks\nIn 'em at Florida State because they know that this thing is bearing down quickly and it'll strike that panhandle\nTuesday Wednesday really Wednesday it's probably who you're talking about a storm surge of about twelve feet for some of the Florida coastline and twelve feet and some of those low lying areas I mean that that deadly is what that is\nSo hurricane season it is I'm telling you it is\nUnpredictable at times predictable least that we have a ... and you can look at the different maps thank goodness much different from those of you listening you get a tornado versus hurricane which is worse I mean it's almost a ridiculous question him since I have been in both\nNot the worst of the worst with a tornado the aftermath of a tornado yes\nThe worst of the worst in the middle of a hurricane yeah right in the middle of a hurricane I experienced what that was like\nWhere you're basically trapped you're in locked down\nSo I Love that the cars and I was a kid so I Love that the evacuation really happen and people he them where we didn't used to do that wasn't quite the same thing it doesn't mean that nobody clear it out but not the way they do it now it's much much different\nNobody clear it out but not the way they do it now it's much much different I Would have said from the hurricane\nInto this New York limo crash I mean\nThe status ever and I it is one of the deadliest road accident in us history so anywhere you're listening to me were saying the deadliest you know why twenty people were killed it was over the weekend\nAnd I was watching one of the college football games and I thought it was a mistake I thought\nOh no they must mean that people were injured and a couple of people were killed now we're saying to stretch limousine killed Eighteen people in the limo to people\nWho were walking and it and that's twenty so ah I mean that's terrible and what happened was that the limo went through a stop sign and boom\nI you know unfortunately just collided and killed the people that were in the limousine and it was um I mean obviously awful\nTerrible and when you when you start to look a deadly crashes and you see where that ranked I mean just the worst up victims texted that dilemma was in terrible condition minutes before the crash\nSo you had a stereo surrounding that one of the victims\nThat killed everyone on board the terrible conditions limo and this was twenty minutes before that whole tragic thing happen or even the New York governor Andrew Cuomo said on Monday that the limousine\nDidn't have that this is what's scary didn't have the necessary federal certification to operate they held a state inspection last month how do you know that right you see the limousine company you look at it on Yelp or wherever are you asking about that or you digging into that now\nSo they're investigating it was a winding\nRoad about a hundred and sixty miles north of New York city and this was a birthday party at the uh Cooperstown brewery so two people were killed you had um\nThe people that were in this limousine you you had um husbands and wives you you had family members and their friends that were that were there and um\nThere was a tech the text message I just mentioned\nComplaining about the limo is because there was a last minute replacement after a bus hired to shuttled or group broke down so that's the first thing that happened\nI mean what are you kidding me and then look at it I mean just absolutely a horrific because you know in their twenties and thirties\nUm yeah really just really really\nOne of the biggest losses of life and and this is what the first responders are saying that they've seen a long time and in just in an incident like that it slammed into to give you the further details on the story it's a dilemma ran a stop sign slammed into a park SUV and then the two people\nOr you know that halted uh before the crash that were standing there boom they were hit so it's a\nIt's just awful and it does make you kind of think\nAnd I don't know why because I got to say what are you doing if you order a limousine you're asking people have you know limo company hey are they good uh-huh hey I'm One of the people say about the motor on time they get you know are they do they know if they have a federal certificate\n... probably not are you looking for that kind of gives you pause to think okay if I'm putting a bunch of people\nIn the limousine you know maybe I got to ask a few more questions or find something else out about that\nCompany because those people were thinking that they're just thinking I got to be kidding me this first we had this break down then we get in\nThe limousine and this happens and then the worst thing possible\nI mean just absolutely possible\nHappen All right we've just scratched

Kavanaugh\nAnd there are people that are they've already built up the coffers for money to run against her and whatnot and I saw both of them on sixty minutes and I you know look I give him credit 'cause\nHeres what they both said in different ways that they they voted the way they thought they should vote and they weren't ... they weren't ... they weren't weighing the politics of it all is what they is what they said and Susan Collins\nSaid that that that she talked to Kavanaugh and the thing that you liked about Kavanaugh she felt that he was about the letter of the launch she felt like he would go by that because she's pro choice and meaning that weighing the law and the precedent and all that kinda stuff um\nAnd she said they're just ... there was no evidence there she said there was not um there wasn't any evidence of of that so she couldn't go in that direction but she certainly\nBearing the brunt of a lot of of anger\nI'm having to have guards and her people having

innocent and that confirmation battle hey everybody hates Laney America send night\nDivide is we saw\nThey say so the midterm elections are going to be interesting I think it's interesting to see what happens in the wake of the Supreme Court confirmation wow a crazy crazy wild few weeks there is no doubt about it\nAnd you've got all the justices sitting in the front row the White House and the East Room on Monday and the president saying he thought his second nominee to the court deserve better than the terrible\nPain and suffering and he was forced to endure\nHe said uh for his part Kavanaugh said he would assume the role with gratitude and no bitterness that was a really great response because it has been nothing but bitterness over the Senate confirmation process which was emotional contentious outrageous\nAnd a rip the country apart and this is far from over I think\nWe're going to see many more protests are going to see some fallout from this or or not one of them is going to be Senator Susan Collins she certainly is on the hot seat the president mentioned Susan Collins as somebody who\nWas um\nSpot on basically in the words that she used when she addressed the Senate because she resolutely defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh both on his judicial philosophies and again that's sexual assault allegation\nAnd what happens now in fact she said because there there were donations that are well up over three million dollars I think now that were put out there saying that if she votes yes on Kavanaugh\nThe all those credit cards would be process to there was an active campaign against her\nAnd she said it was a classic quid pro quo in a violation of federal bribery law she said I think of our politics come to the point where people are trying to buy votes and by positions and we're in a very sad played she was on sixty minutes when she made those\nComments so a group of liberal activists began to campaign last month to pressure her\nShe because they knew the key swing vote in Kavanaugh's nomination process and if she voted no like I said the donations wouldn't would be I Would not be taken for the donors the F the pledges word process\nSo now\nWhoever the main Democrat is in two years they'll get that money that's being raised and it's interesting because calling\nOn friday heading into the weekend announced he would support Kavanaugh's nomination amid all these old allegations of sexual assault she said and concerns about threats to roe v Wade with predominantly conservative justices on the Supreme Court\nSo after um it was all said and done now it's you know over the three million dollar mark like I said and it's still two years away that you know the bottom line is still two years away for that\nSo too early to tell if it will have that kind of an effect on\nAnd so too early to tell if it will\nHave that kind of an effect on a senator Collins\nRed spot intensifying I look at that one hundred and ten mile an hour winds and I think now I live there and I'm along that Florida Panhandle I Am gone color me on\nCars a hundred and eleven miles an hour forget it so making landfall Wednesday afternoon or evening between Pensacola really in the far western panhandle it's looking like just south of Tallahassee the warning is does severe and so worrisome\nThat the Florida State they've cleared the deck Tuesday through friday boom school is closed the university's not open\nBecause it's right where that can come Alabama Florida twenty river on there is what we're really looking at even parts of the Mississippi Alabama a border so it could produce some really\nTerrible debris storm surge maybe up to twelve feet in some parts of the Florida coast and\nIts course and his wife they been declared a state of emergency to get out don't get caught off guard but that wouldn't sit on the edge I that's what I Do these people boarding it up they're smart I mean look you lose a couple of days you come back and that's the worst thing that can happen to you the\nThe you know if you're gone you're gone that you can't replace wife and then coming back and horrific conditions no\nThere's nothing there there's no power you can't get back in that would be awful I Hope it veers I Hope it\nDissipates but boy does not look like at a keep checking that map and it's not is that's not happening disc this looks to be very very serious very very serious and then sadly what they're talking about as some of the places that were hit by Florence\nAnd they're being cleaned up and that was horrible they're talking about maybe some more flooding depending on the track of the storm it's not that they're not gonna get the hurricane force but they might get that crazy flooding that was so crushing and the first place in parts of the Carolinas\nSo that's a possibility\nIn New York they're not talking about hurricanes are talking about the state of limousine crash who the bad beat all the way around and when I say that it was because not the the limo driver didn't have the right license dilemma wasn't supposed to be on the road they fail to state inspection and as a result twenty people ended up\nDead on Saturday including two pedestrians in an area and I started to look at the map and I've been in this area because it's right by Cooperstown it's outside of\nUm Albany New York and his dad these it's a beautiful area and there's these winding roads and they they're investigating it but the limos slammed into a park S. U. V.\nSo the people inside just killed four sisters died they just ... the limit blew through stop\nSigns slammed into the parked SUV everybody inside was killed and then the two bystanders died as well and this was a birthday celebration so you had you know these young families young married that in their twenties early thirties\nUm I Can't imagine what they're going to have can they shut down this company this this company had um\nYou know it's crazy and looking at their background and they keep investigating nest is the owner of this company\nHas apparently has a back story that includes\nUm a few stint as an undercover informant for the FBI wow and you know what the governors saying and he's right is they had no business having missed on the roadway it's failed inspection they didn't have a driver who was fit to drive wasn't license to drive\nThey didn't have the proper insurance they didn't have all the things you're supposed to have\nAnd for the families it's about the loss of these young people's lives I mean wow there was a couple that just were married like four months ago ...\nIt's just an unexplainable thing and I like I said I Know that area I Know that area well up by um Cooperstown and that's what the deal was they were they were taking a trip to Cooperstown\nSo that's what the road was on the way to Cooperstown awful one of the worst stories from uh this past weekend you want an uplifting story how 'bout that adorable Barbara Bush I think one of the best pictures I've seen\nIs the former President George Bush and his daughter on his arm and they had a somehow they pulled it off they had a secret wedding or it was just the families in I'm In Maine so a Barbara Bush walks down the aisle\nWith her father GW\nBush walks down the aisle with her father GW and our wedding or what to Craig coins who is a screenwriter someone she met I think a year and a half ago or something like that and they did pull that off over the weekend\nAnd released a few pictures you know it was on a social media and whatnot cute pictures of her sisters little girls in all of that\nI'm looking at a happy as can be but um\nNo ... no big announcements no giant\nWedding none of that just the um\nPrivate ... so\nGood for them good for them that they pulled it off and it shows yeah time flies she's thirty six years old or husband I guess is thirty seven and she cofounded a public health non profit called global health corps\nSo her sister genna Bush of course they are like I said with her daughter's um\nThat that was just tomatoes the cool mom and it was a cool moment because it wasn't ostentatious it was like how does that that whole sort of understand that things were not telling the media were not getting we're going to try to stay out of the eye of pop rock the and then we can just have some pictures come out\nAnd they managed to do it which is\nWow shocking because it's so hard to keep can you keep anything a secret anymore\nNo you can't you can't keep it secret I'm mean you can't you can't keep it to people can't keep secrets that just gets out there like poof someone somehow here's something and then before you know it it's um it's out in the cat is out of the bag and that's it but um\nI I'm you know we're talking about these\nTariffs on China and we're going to talk about that more\nDuring the week here on America Tonight but somebody said to me every week and well what are some of the people that are getting hit by this besides there's some auto parts and you know what not and I guess one of them is because think of the things that are made in China dollar trade you're going to dollar tree with this ten percent tariffs on the two hundred billion dollars worth of Chinese imports\nThere's a place where they're getting hit because they're jacking up the prices what do you think for the dollar tree sorry because of the ... it's the five dollar tree now\nFive dollar tree you're still getting a bargain trust me but me they've had to um pull things off shelves because of the higher costs\nThey've had to re rack a bunch of stuff that is about ten percent of their merchant dies which will be thousands of things household health food hardware electronics all that they cause they'd have\nTo push push it onto the computer or the consumers and if you have things that are between one and they cost ... one dollar and it costs three or less that doesn't fit with the the door\nSo you can't can't have them on the shelves\nAnd like I said five dollar tree is sorry Confucius say right now while there's a terror if
