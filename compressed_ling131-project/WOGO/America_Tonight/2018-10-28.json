Republicans who want to create jobs\nAnd Democrats who've been creating mobs listen\nRats don't like being called an angry mob but really that's what they become\nThey've gone so far left they can't even believe that there are over there they don't know what's going on when you listen to Eric Holder talking about kicking may go low we or Hillary Clinton saying what you said which was so\nHorrible you cannot be civil they just don't see it Maxine Waters constantly day in and day out ranting and raving [noise]\nThey're losing it and they shouldn't be we should be a unified country it'll happen some day\nOkay um how's it going to happen I I I Do think that right now at this moment with\nAll of the campaign ads that are out there some of them so very hateful\nIt's unlikely at two weeks before a very very tight election and that all of a sudden people are going to come together maybe after the election\nParticularly particularly if Republicans can actually hold on and maintain a slender mine majority in the house of representatives because Republicans going to lose some seats in the house they're forty Republicans who retired this year and some of those seats are going to be lost\nBut honestly it looks more and more like if you go out and vote wherever you happen to live\nIt's so important because it just a handful of votes can make a difference in each congressional district let's go to your calls in a two Keith in San Francisco keys you're on the Michael Mann that show\nHey Michael great star to your show I've been struck by people commenting why is Beto O'Rourke ... willing to move so far left in a state like Texas and drug supposing that fact with his\nPhenomenal fundraising haul the thirty two or thirty six million dollars in small thirty alienation yeah largely\nSo what I think is happening as he watches Cory Booker a fall out of the race rather\nQuickly and I in my view was Warren\nUm effectively disqualified herself last week probably in terms of the public relations all I think he's going to run for president he's going to lose the race and the Senate and he will be running for president and will probably be a pretty strong a candidate given his I don't\nAgree with his views but I think he could be very charismatic and you could extend that magic to the country in the early primaries\nOkay there are two reasons I think you might be wrong I I watched a bay toe performing and that is a performance is sort of a performance art as they say\nWhen he was doing a town hall in or near El Paso which is where he's from and you know very friendly crowd and very friendly moderator Dana Bash from CNN [noise]\nAnd uh she she asked him very directly about running for president and he said no if he gets elected senator he'll serve all six years of senator now of course he can throw that away but he said it's so definitively\nThat it leads me to believe that\nNo he he didn't rule out running ever but he I think he rules out\nPretty well running in two thousand and twenty said that if he loses the race he's going to want to spend some more time with his family of course they all say that um [noise] and some and then it might even be true okay the the other reason that I think he wouldn't be so solid for the race\nWas he was pushed and pushed\nOn the fact that he had said before the race even began that as a member of the house of representatives he thought there was enough evidence of obstruction of justice inclusion that he could vote to impeach Trump now and he was asked about that as a U.S senator and he didn't back away from it\nHe is for impeachment he he believes even before the smaller investigation has wrapped up even before it's reported anything\nAnd yes they've indicted some people and they've uncovered some stuff and I I I think the Mueller investigation needs to finish and maybe it'll take some time to finish but needs to finish but ... doesn't think so he agrees with a lot of those people on the far right the ... just forget about the investigation let's impeach him anyway\nAnd I don't think that's a popular position and I don't think it sets them up well for a future presidential run or anything of the ... hey I appreciate your call\nUm I I'm a I Will get back\nTo this and to David Leonhardt piece what if the Republicans when everything will we now know President Trump has made a couple of statements and I think one of them at least to sort of flummoxed some of his age or there's talk about another tax cut\nThat may be announced before November first that soon

given the fact that we've had so far this year\nI think we've had about twenty times the number of illegal entries into the country this year the illegal entries are way up because the economy is very hot right now people are getting across\nAnd ah this I'd only constitutes an invasion I think it is a challenge to our whole immigration system is basically an attempt to raise the border and say that uh we have to let in anyone who wants to come in and most Americans don't believe that in the lawyer who say that so [noise]\nBut when you say ... and a planned invasion what do you have in mind\nUh I think it's just a part of the the war or the battle between conservatives and left us that are trying to take down America and this is the latest strategy\n\nExcept if you look at those people and I've seen ... and of course they play a lot of very close compassionate a video showing some of these poor people who I think are hungry or scared\nI'm hopeful ah they\nThey do not appear to be actors or manipulated their just desperate people from\nPlaces in the world that are deeply deeply dysfunctional look I I think that President Trump is doing the right thing to basically make a stand and just say no we simply cannot just open the doors to anyone in this country that's not going to be our immigration policy\nBut I think he makes a very big mistake when he threatened to cut off foreign aid and I'll tell you why the best way to prevent other incidents like this and so this doesn't happen every week or every month\nIs not to cut off foreign aid to Honduras hits to coordinate more foreign aid to Honduras to take these people the seven thousand people I think that's how many they think there are right now [noise]\nAnd to bring them back home where you can work with them to try

way to make things a lot better because I'm able to be more more attentive spray\nYou you haven't you haven't replaced the marijuana was some other um a stimulant or ... or\nI wouldn't I wouldn't say that I had a little I had a period after I quit a weed where I uh I was I was playing a lot of poker um\nUh-huh and stuff that is also addicted it yeah\nAnd I felt a little bank roll and then I lost the bank roll then I then I was playing for free and some and I I had to back off of that because that that kind of became all consuming as well I mean I had to fly in twenty Seventeen because my mother died very suddenly\nThan I watched it happened and it was very traumatic and so the following nine months were just a yeah I dealt with a group or did a lot of drugs and they're like I did a lot of gambling and it just was not good and so\nYeah I was once it sort of move the poker ended the background and I I'd say that I've replaced it with um you know just a a filled up with books and movies and music and\nJust a a filled up with books and movies and music and um you know other sort of as as they say in in the twelfth that probably the outer circle activities things that that are are fun and healthy that don't have to do with your addiction\nRight and you have a is your son the lines are you still fourteen\nHe's he's almost sixteen\nAnd he's on the sixteenth okay 'cause I mean you've got a freshman up your website do one thing about your website\nIt says it the er toward a the very end it says public loves cheese marijuana Boston terriers Los Angeles Dodgers classic cinema

you doing that my dad used to say it's a pork ... what branch tool but I uh have been ... with a lot of friends are different tragedy ... alcohol sex or whatever the case laws that\nBasic than what they told us some as an ally non there's just a person that you have a personality disorder where you need something to make yourself strong one and in retrospect you're a strong all along and you didn't need to do that so I don't think it just to marijuana as a personality or Neal\nYeah I mean that's well that's the thing about addiction right it's like it it emerges as a response to some sort of drama uh which create\nCharacter flaws and then you try to fill the gaps with whatever the addictive substances and he mentioned do a whole list of them you know alcohol drugs gambling sex eating shopping list goes on and on so\nYeah I mean that's an absolutely accurate a statement and I I don't think anyone who's ever um suffer from addiction would would disagree with that\nLet's go to Steve in Louisville, Kentucky Steve you're on the show was Neal Pollack\nYeah Michael thanks for having me on so new and just listening to talk it seems like we live a very weird life just just in different

seemed like you were a little conflicted [noise] has to know did it help your wife or in your life for me or you know I didn't have to avoid that I was trying to fill\nFill a marijuana we just kind of stumbled across each other but certainly the creative aspect that may be a little bit more I'm artistic side of the visuals side\nBut I feel that it's it's certainly a struggle and and my main question was what ... for the show was what finally made you quit\nYeah but that's a good question and to address the thing you were saying it's like it's just marijuana is kind of creeps up on you right it's not like I'm\nYou know heroin where your job if you get addicted very fast I'm so ... you can use it for a number of years it's sort of a low level is gradually increases as for me that my moment of clarity can act ironically enough\nNow that the Dodgers are back in the world series that actually can't half the world series I ... I went to Los Angeles because I'd always dreamed of going to a World Series game even though I didn't really have the resources to do it and I bought a ticket off about some fraudulent third party Web site before I did that\nI managed to get as high as I possibly could\nUm even though you know there's no reason why you need to get hired and go to the world series but I needed to get high to do everything and that was a special occasion so I got really high\nUm smoking the huge joined that has all this crystallized th ... all over and then I was smoking weed with a stranger and it has an echo park I went to the stadium\nBombed out on my mind and the ticket didn't scan it was it was like I said it was fraudulent 'em and rather than deal with the situation rationally I started screaming at people and I was on I almost got arrested that got it scored it out of the stadium\nOr by security guards I was in the parking lot sobbing and I just kind of took a look at myself in the ... side view mirror of a car and I just saw this you know old man with red rimmed eyes\nCrying over a baseball game and I just I I thought to myself this isn't good I Can't go on and so I didn't quit that day but three weeks later I I kinda sunk in and I just I took my last puff and\nKen Daniel more around them and can can you be around other people who were getting high or use ... would you go into the other room\n[noise] no I Can't I was at a music festival a little I live in Austin, Texas and I was at the Austin city limits ... a couple of weeks ago and I was hanging out with friends who are smoking joints and puffing up ... than I have a sign of poker that I was going to where everyone would pass joined around the table that was the only one there wasn't stoned I said last\nMinute [laughter] well I I Wish you better luck with poker you've obviously had better luck with your life that's Neil Patel like we've posted is information on our website when we come back marijuana and rhyming\nOr will deal with it coming up on the main event show\nWestern Wisconsin hot talk station is six eighty W O O G o\nPositions designed relief factor as an essential way to support the body's natural fight against aches and pains it's made from wild caught fish oil and botanical like turmeric and it's a healthy way to get back into pain free life there is no side effects\nThere's no chemicals there is no preservatives there is nothing addictive and that's why you can be very confident that when you take relief factor you have nothing to lose but your pain\nAnd the whole world to gain maybe can't wear your favorite shoes anymore because the pain in your feet relief factor can help with all of that Nineteen Ninety five comes to Ninety five cents a day that's less than a cup of coffee a day\nFor pain relief\nGo to release factor dot com read all the testimonials find out about it for yourself and order that quick start just Nineteen Ninety five or Ninety five cents a day for three weeks or you can pull them it's toll free they can answer all your questions one eight hundred five hundred three eight for that soul free one eight hundred five hundred three eight for relief factor dot com\nWhen it comes to your identity and the personal information on your devices there's no soundtrack to let you know you're in danger [noise]\nToday's digital world is so connected it just takes one weak link for criminal given [noise]\nGood thing new life lock now at the power of Norton Security lifelike uses proprietary technology to detect threats like your personal info for sale in the dark Web in Norton Security helps protect up to\nFive devices from ransomware and other online threat plus if you have a problem are agents will work to fix it no one can prevent all identity theft or cyber crime or monitor all transactions would all businesses but with life look we can help alert you [noise]\nTo danger joined now and get ten percent off your first year plus of twenty five dollar Amazon gift card with annual enrollment just going to life locked dot com and enter promo code smart terms apply new life lock with north [noise]\nMore detection more protection\nHi this is Dave stay sick I've been with WW id and W.

data suggest enthusiasm among early GOP voters that could put a dent in democratic hopes for a blue wave in the midterms\nIs the blue wave turning purple Republican affiliated voters have out pays democratic affiliated voters in early voting in seven closely watched states according to data provided by target smart and independently analyzed by the NBC News data analytics lab\nGOP affiliated voters have surpassed democratic affiliated ones in early voting in Arizona the Senate race Florida\nKeys Senate race and governor's race Georgia key governor's race Indiana key Senate race Montana key Senate race Tennessee in Texas the data showed only\nIn Nevada have democratic affiliated voters exceeded Republican affiliated voters so far in early voting according to the data this is um [noise] this is pretty dramatic now look every one of those states except for Nevada\n... is a Republican say there's the state to the Trump carry some of them may carry built by a lot however he didn't necessarily do it was early voting but when you're talking about Arizona Florida Georgia Indiana Montana Tennessee in Texas [noise] those are all states that Trump\nCarried and uh however\nHe these candidates in those states don't do do do better than Trump they just need to do as well\nAnd uh\nThis would be very encouraging and it also brings up the point that when you read the generic polls nationally when they say well\nThe Democrats are have this big advantage in the generic poll\nThe reasons that doesn't matter as much as you might think it would it's the same reason it didn't matter ultimately that Hillary won the popular vote by more than three well three million votes but you know what that was all in California\nAnd that's the point one of the reasons I think\nThat Democrats may be doing well on the generic ballot there are thirty six seats where there is no Republican candidate\nReally where it's just so like I I don't think Maxine Waters has a Republican candidate against are there other seeds that are so dominated by the Democratic machine no Republican runs you know how many seats there are no democratic candidates only three\nSo when you take that
