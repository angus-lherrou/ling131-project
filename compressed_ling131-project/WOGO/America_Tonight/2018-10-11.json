I'm sure millions of dollars tens of thousands of places were hit I shouldn't say tens of thousands and thousands of places were hit by this especially the damage Bruce it was a cat for\nAnd it's going to hit it it it definitely spread to several states but the Army Corps of engineers knows that the main damage started with\nThat Mexico beach area where you look out\nFrom a coastal view and higher concrete kind of um condo where some of those were spared and you look out and all you could see was debris it looked like tooth picks kind of like what you see when there's a tornado\nIt's devastating I mean you know Hurricane Florence just slammed the Carolinas last month\n\nSo what happens is you get these blue tarp roof patches and that's all over the Carolinas now they're going to see that in parts of Florida in the panhandle to and some of those towns FEMA\nAnd the local government of course they're going to call on the uh you know the the corps of engineers to help with the downed trees from the roads and the debris the damage homes and the buildings I mentioned\nThe destruction shows that you've got trash of about one million cubic yards is what they're saying so recovery is going to be tough but the first thing you gotta do is clear the rose to the crews can get it\nPretty tough but anyway he and his wife have that rule he talks about it with me coming up next in talking about some of the things that he's been in that and even a little sports cars the Dodgers they continue to roll through the playoffs his big Dodger fan of course living\nIn LA and growing up in the Los Angeles but he was on say by the bell for ever that show when you're on a television show that's on the air for five six seven years that's pretty\nThat's pretty big and I think say by the bell man it's pretty much\nIt was on through the um mid nineties so how about that and he's a big uh fitness dude and et cetera but anyway he joins us on the show and he talks about that whole thing about no electronics at the table\nAnd then we have a conversation with Kathy picket who says there was um\nA wrestler name the ultimate warrior who says that it was the ultimate warrior that really changed her life but what does that mean she talks about intuition you know the whole thing where people say trust your God listen to your good\nThen people say that all the time listen to your gut and then you'll see a puzzled look in someone's face were like well what does that mean [laughter] 'cause they're not in touch with their guts and what it's telling them it's your instincts what are your instinct saying what is your intuition telling you and I'll tell you what\nI Believe in intuition because every time I go against my intuition that's usually when I go down the wrong path there's a fork in the road whoops intuitions tell me one thing or the guts\nAnd then I'm thinking of something else and I go on the complete Lee wrong direction and so I Know some of the you know exactly I Know all of you know exactly what I mean\nAnd we're talking about that to to [noise] I mentioned the I'm\nIn talking about what was happening of course in DC\nSo much as centering around me now but Kavanaugh that the Kavanaugh stories I don't think it's over but he's the justice and he's in the thick of it now with with some the rest of the justices is they're going to be any kind of fallout from that well who knows the is the mid term\nElections that a referendum on what happened there let's see what happens with voting I mean there's a big push to get the vote out but there's a big push by the Democrats and the Republicans to do that [noise] um so that we keep seeing the same thing it's not it hasn't swung in one direction or the other\nUntil we know I mean until until we see what the results are of that and of course hurricane Michael like I mentioned that's the big thing pummeling Florida pushing north\nThat's what most of the conversation is about and the Dow dropping eight hundred points because here is arising on what the interest rates are when the interest rates shoot up you get used to it's not that well what does that mean and then some fear\nStarts to spread by the way um the UN post now that\nNikki Haley is out at the end of the year but there were any kind of discord between her the president in fact they had a press conference the other day so there is no issue with that but it looks like Dina Powell could be the person that gets tapped for that\nBut it looks like Dina Powell could be the person that gets tapped for that and who is Dina Powell you've\nSeen her face around you might recognize her that um\nThat the\nShe's a former White House aide she was a deputy national security advisor now she's in the senior execs at Goldman Sachs she's very close with a volunteer Trump\nAnd son in law Jared Kushner who of course our senior White house aides she had a friendly relationship when she left the White House there wasn't a problem with uh with that at all and she is definitely one of the candidates to replace Nikki Haley\nAnd there I'm sure some others that would make the list to because of course you got to get the approval to make that happen and she has the resume I suppose for that and that's what that's about the any kind of a position especially position at\nThe un in that role that's what that would absolutely but you know require for that but that's not until the end of the year\nSo she leaves knew somebody new comes in maybe it's her see what that process ultimately is I'm\nLike and then there is the story of the marriage or you wanna hear about the merger I'm going to tell you about the merger cause I walked by these bloody pharmacies all the time I in fact I go in them if I'm if I was\nGoing to get medication is probably where I Would end up in the times I've had to it is actually mostly where I end up CBS CBS the sixty nine billion dollar merger was at now is approved in a deal that would probably\nProbably can transform health care is it good for us or bad for us\nWell you figure there's five million customers a day\nThat means the brick and mortar locations would turn into frontline clinics for basic medical services and patient monitoring so what does that means it means that um\n\nMedications regimens being out of hospitals may be the basic services provided the right people are in there could be helpful there'd be flu shots minor illnesses would be treated if you look at CBS they've got Ninety eight hundred retail stores and they've got eleven hundred minute clinics\nBut um I think that could have with the whole at and the thing that could explode\nI don't know how they ... obviously they think that they can merge it properly and that it won't just be the whole scripts thing you could get it all in one I mean there's certainly pressures\n... and there's opportunity with what's going on in health care so this may be a merger that helps us if you and may I may you know we'll see close by the end of the year I Need to know more about it I dug around a little bit today the key thing is look\nYou and I all all of us now this I've talked about this before you go to the doctor what do you want from the doctor he want to know somebody who knows you and you want to feel confident in what you're being treated for and do you feel confident\nDo get the business about who you're going to see because they're not on the list and that's not an aid for or are you getting sub par treatment because your fabulous doctor said ... enough of this nonsense\nWith this with the the healthcare system being upside down I'm Out of this business I've seen that happen a ton\nAnd you know frankly our faith in the medical profession\nIt gets rocked because of that\nUnless you had somebody who stuck around like I have a doctor like that who does whatever you can to treat the people because\nHe is that the point in his career I guess er and his wife were annoys him what's happened and he figures out a way to treat people even if they don't have the right kind of insurance which bravo for him\nThat he can balance that out\nBy the way a quick reminder because I Do get a couple of emails from people who we are going down to Florida for business or family or whatever you better check the airlines because they have canceled hundreds of flights\nSo you'll get I'm sure you get a free waiver and to travel some other way or to travel and other time but they canceled a law ... flights even for the next day I mean that'll that'll open up quickly\nBut think of like Destin Fort Walton Beach they've got airports there he just got to be sure\nAbout that and then you have Myrtle Beach in Savannah and Columbia South Carolina and all those other airlines where people fly into and um it's the worst thing in the world if you don't check you just\nAssume you know you go and then\nFor the same thing with Amtrak too because they've got Amtrak that will be affected by that [noise]\nHappy ticket talking about [noise]\nIntuition years coming up next an ATM\nYou're not that busy just take the kids to school I for that night and soccer practice law and band or poor or buy groceries to take the dog to the vet put gas in the car grab dry cleaning go to the dentist\nBut you're not busy honey Carney desires you could take the job tomorrow right when you need tires but

that's how that's how it is for everybody no matter what you're doing in life that doesn't have to be\nA psychic work or anything so um\nI think that's that's what we need to do and we feel like everything in our life it's high time time pac which it is a lot of people with that but I think you know if you slow down a little bit\nAnd just give yourself that time you know things will will manifest for ... um so that's how it is you know for everybody and I think we need to remember that [laughter]\nI mean all that is really really great advice what has happened in your life when you\nHaven't listened to your intuition\nOh gosh um when you go I\nIgnore things for so long and um I think we just\nWe tend to do that because we just have this mindset like I'm going to do this I'm going to do it my way I'm going to do it like this and bad and for me\nUm I Would have a physical sensation like and this probably very calm with a lot of people where we we have that may be down in our gut\nAnd um but it's not the fund feeling like you know people say butterflies or before you do something fun you know like how I was excited for it today though it's like that that feeling like that's telling you don't do this or maybe you can do this just not right now\nUm and oh I had that a lot with other things and I you know it didn't listen to it and you know everybody says your body doesn't lie and I read that so many high but it could be different for different people\nUm you might not have a a sensation there\nBut you know you might have just something else that's just more of a knowing like I think this was going to go well I'm going to do it any way they talk yourself you know through my yeah mine was like in my guy and [noise]\nYou know I don't want to say that I regret [laughter] certain things because I Try to look at them like no they are learning experience but and then you know for the next time I'm you know how to improve on that on you know because we have to live with regrets so maybe\nYou might just regret that how you know but maybe not but what so yeah\nFor me that we're a young guy and it still will do that but now I Know about you know to listen and like I said for different people so when you have things you know even write 'em down I was told that forever write stuff down because then you'll remember\nAnd I think that helps a lot better than just hey wait a minute you know then this happened before and um you know but we are were quick to jump the gun I Know I still am I'm but I'm learning you know and I think they're how it is that's why we're here yeah\nIf I were here you know I'm looking [laughter] down absolutely no at closing and there's so much meat in this what do you hope people take\nYour book uh you know I just want them to you know what I'm gonna I'm going to quote or you're on the um [noise]\nYou know because I just think it's so powerful yet so many great beaches\nOn inspire don't instruct I just walk back today um because I just think you know we there's so much we want to share a but just to believe in your own power even if you're not I be\nYou know spiritual in that way uh we all have that in us no matter how you believe that and no matter what you believe and um you know what you're sending out there I'm just to to trust and to just um\nYou know believe in yourself that's the the biggest key of all

past or you know things that you get it in your life and mind you know if there is humor there's humor in life and I think again as adults we overlook that\nUm you know to just\nLook for those little things that just to you know being fired that way because that'll lead to bigger things and I I Hope that people can connect and relates in that way just knowing that\nUh you know we can all be

one\nShe said\nShe\n\n\nGym but\nKnown as a way for me\nEverything is on the front of me for me\nIt's all about a hurricane name Michael J. so many talking about watching some of these television\nGet banged around by ah some of the places that they were broadcasting from a very strange I have\nTo say any American tonight who better then kick us off than Elon Rattner from talk media news Ellen I'm sure you saw some of that coverage a boy that a hurricane is something unbelievable what happened now\nIt turns to stay in the category for now Hurricane Katrina even though the Internet was a category five\nAnd the difference between a category four and a category five is only about five miles per hour and in terms of it looks like bad hurricane Michael was somewhere between one hundred and fifty and a hundred and fifty five miles an hour one fifty even\nWant to ... or a category five\nSo I mean it's just awful\nAnd it looks like a lot of these homes are totally and completely underwater now I Do know this from\nCovering Hurricane Katrina which I didn't have to build a community center down there a lot of people have insurance they think they have flood insurance and they do but they don't have mould insurance and the mold can go right up the wall and that is what two story house 'cause\nYeah I and I remember that because I think the first time I imagine you invited me down to Mississippi\nAnd remember that and that was um and that was all about what happened after BP and I was stunned to learn what had happened in the lock the and it was great what what you did to help the people there\nAnd and the fact that uh they they told people look we're going to put an ax if you're not going to leave are going to put an act on your door because the door might not even be there but we know that at least we might find someone behind it saying it was ... yeah absolutely absolutely crazy\nSo hey you saw that there were people reporting from it from all the networks I just thought this was interesting as a longtime broadcaster or I Am and you are what what did you make of\nThe decision of whether to cover it break in or whatever you know ABC was all over with this but the ... well I you know that we're\nRight on ... and and you saw this guy get hit while\nHe was on the ground I I wouldn't do it if I was\nA manager and I think that they they say that they're going to have better pictures by tomorrow morning because they are going to kind of planes and satellites and things like oh that's what they should be doing they shouldn't be having somebody there and I agree in harm's way\nMhm but I hear you yeah I thought I thought it was strange to I I you're right if I was reading the news from I Would have to cover this somehow a little bit\nBut I thought it was strange to I you're right if I was reading the news from I don't have to cover this somehow a little bit differently for sure so while that's happening there's conversation about another Michael Bloomberg are going to run for president\nWell of course you know I always say that if you become senator you look in the mirror and you see the next president United States but Michael Bloomberg the billionaire he\nCame you know he didn't make his money came up with this machine et cetera\nAnd he did serve as a mayor and I think that he himself is an expert in the United states I really do it's too bad I don't think he's going to win but he thinks he's going to win and I guess if you have a billion dollars and you have nothing else to do with your time why not\nTakes that warning and does it

and even believe it or not with hurricane sometimes they spawn tornadoes so there was even a tornado watch in effect\nAnd that's in effect until two o'clock in the morning eastern on a Thursday a

is happening I saw a picture of a bank\nIs that um it was in Panama City and it it looked like all the glass windows had just blown out you could see right through the bank that might have been the craziest example and it was maybe five floors this bank\nShopping centers piles of rubble buildings stripped walls and roofs all that kind of thing just down down down Panama City got slammed big time too\nAnd some people try to ride it out and it was pretty scary and they may be survived but yet gigantic trees that are lying through stores and I mean I could go on with my description because I saw a lot of this\nBut it's that a Florida Panhandle area south eastern Alabama southern Georgia some of you\nAre from there live there you know ... what I mean I mean it is a nasty storm canals cleanup time again you know when something like that happens it's all about that is picking everything up and it's going to be it's gonna be a lot of pickup\nBecause you had a lot of homes\nThat are in various states of disarray I mean it's it's pretty nasty\nAnd that's going to certainly take some of the female action it's going to certainly take all of that emergency assistance in Florida and Alabama and some of those other spots as as well ah 'cause it really just battered just battered\nParts of Florida it's so interesting when you look at a map of Florida\nHello welcome to the sunshine state [laughter] and we look at it and where you're either get an east you're getting it on the tip it's Key West or else it's going right up the backside and it's all the way up through the Gulf Coast missing Tampa and some of those other areas\nAnd you just never know you just watch the path of it but the fact that it hit the way it hit with the key thing because there was no\nThat it hit the way it hit was the key thing\nBecause there was no this was this storm let's put it this way this storm had no back down move that was it there was it did not back off\nIt's just a mess it's just about clean up and it's interesting because Florida has been dealing with sadly red tide so now you got hurricane Michael pushing it a shores what some of them are saying that OK Now you're going to have that\nYou get that red tide that has been killing fish and releases all those toxins there's people that are having trouble with breathing their respiratory system because it's acts sort of like a tear gas for ... for some people\nAnd the red tide has been that toxic algae has been something that they've been dealing with all over the date now with this this storm the storm pushed the algae deeper into the water or does it push it up near the surface\nAnd how quickly just fresh water from rainfall flow back toward the coach killing the algae so it just depends on the storm the particulars of the storm not crazy just another thing\nTo worry about it it's just like what happened with Florence there was all those fish all over the place and they had to clean them up dead fish everywhere because of what had washed in and they were concerned about\nContamination they were concerned about what people were doing it concerned about water so you know there's a whole checklist of ... we got through this and our roof didn't blow off the neighbors did that we're going to help them but now here's all the other things that we have to worry about here's all the other things that we have to worry about\nAnd there's like a huge list I some wild that's going on during the day there was something else that was happening that we haven't talked about in a very long time on the show because it's\nReally gone through would have been an amazing time as far as the market is concerned I mean the market has been up up up occasionally abound here and there but the market just fill with a solid\nI mean you could hear that fund big time\nIt just collapsed I'm going to collapse not collapse like two thousand and eight but really really really took a dive and that's something that we're not used to seeing right why did the stock market tank so much\nAnd what is it that drove it in that direction so like I said a crazy day while all these emergencies or going off in Florida but it was dumb on Wall street\nThere was a little bit of a panic because\nIt's been such a hot market and out of nowhere seemingly eight hundred and thirty two point drop the Dow Jones just a week after there was a record high it's a roller coaster ride to what was it\nWas it the ten year treasury note whose rate impacts the pricing on things from fixed rate mortgages houses to stocks to virtually every other financial acted on the planet that you can think of\nClimbing to three point twenty five percent for the first time since two thousand and loving the spring of two thousand eleven is that what's happening with the U.S trade war with China\nIs that some of this I think it's the interest rates rising is a big reason why they're rising because economic data has been positive\nSo of these historically low interest rates and slow economic growth now we're picking up to speed with the economy growing it four point two percent of the second quarter as fast as we've seen him for years the job market is flush\nThe unemployment rate is three point seven percent the lowest in fifty years that's what's happening\nSo higher interest rates fluids sat around and flip the equation around and that the deal and text from stocks drop to a bunch of those drop the gun is at the beginning of a correction that's what everybody's talking about [noise]\nComing up we're hitting the mail bag to get your thoughts here on America Tonight was ...

are not free turkey before Thanksgiving get these and many more special now through October Tom ...\nYou know houses underwater and knowing what happens afterwards but hopefully the people inside were gone and now when they come back\nIt is about to get out rebuilding whatever it takes but when you look at the category scaled and you're talking about cats for one's thirty to one fifty six\nI mean really cat five\nYeah and I was looking at hurricanes and cat four and five Andrew was definitely a thought and it was awful\n[noise] Michael for but just by a couple of miles\nPer hour you've had um remember we've had gosh\nJust thinking this the other day I was trying to someone was asked me names and did everything was\nIrma last year Harvey I mentioned Harvey\nAnd of course Camille was one of the most deadly and that was right there off the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and that's the way back in the late sixties I saw some old footage of that somebody was playing the old footage and it was\nBoy it look nasty and Camille with devastating Andrew was devastating I mean all of these are you know her hurricane season you know that that's the ... the possibility and all the things that goes with it like I said okay let's jump to another one this one is from Charlie\nKate I'm listening to you in Sarasota it's like we feel so badly for the people who are just north of us and we'll race to help them and we know exactly what that's like as we've gone through that crazy watch of\nHow bad is it going to be what kind of devastation is going to leave behind\nAnd we dodged at the time but we dodged it all along knowing where Michael was tracking there was no way of a massive curve there and it was very sad to see what other people are dealing with\nIf you live and the coast you know that this is a risk that you take when you go through hurricane season you just have to be reading and prepared much like I'm sure the people in California I think about earthquakes or others think about tornadoes yeah except for at least with the hurricanes whether they\nVeer off or they the wind speed dies down which was always a good thing\nYou have no warning when the earthquake and you have very little with the tornado there they've gotten better but you can't predict those things exactly oh you live near a fault line and the other big ones come in every Californian says that we know we know we live with\nThe big ones come and so I think it's a little bit different with the hurricane at least there's a little\n[noise] there's a little bit of time to to clear and this one was the quick one I mean there's there wasn't a ton of time here is just all of a sudden it was bad you know he had like a couple of days yes we're tracking this boom all of a sudden it comes in\nNow I've got this one from Joe who says walked in the day probably was that house majority leader Kevin McCarthy is going to introduce legislation that's kind of fun President Trump's proposed\nWall on the U.S Mexican border with that twenty three point four billion dollar price tag Kate do you think it will go through well it's in that I think it's in drafting but it's supposed to come out your right and the next couple of days they call it pro forma\nThe houses in recess until mid November So after the midterm elections the they wouldn't consider the legislation for another month or so I you know I don't know what would have a difficult passage they could because\nThere's not you can't control the numbers completely\nAnd um you know ... went to the U.S Mexico border for a tour or going for a tour and a briefing by the department of homeland security but um he's you know there are a couple of\nThere are a couple of Republicans who are\nInterested in seeing it passed but it's a numbers game so money for the border wall has been a very contentious battle in any of the negotiating between the Democrats and Republicans the entire time the president has been in office\nSo the legislation being written it okay but what does it mean well any of this be paid for by Mexican remember we kept hearing well Mexico is going to pay for part of the wall Mexico is going to let him say part Mexico's paying for the wall\nSo I think it may have a tough time if it passes the house you still need sixty votes to clear the Senate that's a pretty big threshold\nComing up next [noise]\nIt's time to nail

I'm sure millions of dollars tens of thousands of places were hit I shouldn't say tens of thousands and thousands of places were hit by this especially the damage Bruce it was a cat for\nAnd it it's going to hit it it definitely spread to several states but the Army Corps of engineers knows that the main damage started with\nThat Mexico beach area where you look out\nFrom a coastal view and not hire concrete kind of um condo where some of those were spared and you look out now you could see was debris it looked like tooth picks kind of like what you see when there's a tornado\nIt's devastating and you know Hurricane Florence Jeff slammed the Carolinas last month\nSo what happens is you get these blue tarp roof patches and that's all over the Carolinas they're going to see that in parts of Florida in the panhandle to in some of the towns FEMA\nAnd the local government of course they're going to call on that uh you know the the corps of engineers to help with the downed trees from the roads and the debris the damage homes in the building that I mentioned\nThe destruction shows that you've got trash of about one million cubic yards is what they're saying so recovery is going to be tough but\nPretty tough but anyway he and his wife have that rule he talks about it with me coming up next in talking about some of the things that he's been in that and even a little sports cars the Dodgers as they continue to roll through the playoffs his big\nDodger fan of course living in LA and growing up in the Los Angeles but he was on the by the bell for ever that show when you're on a television show that's on the air for five six seven years that's pretty\nThat's pretty big and I think say by the bell man it's pretty much it was on through the um mid nineties so how about that\nAnd he's a big uh fitness dude and et cetera but anyway he joins us on the show and he talks about that whole thing about no electronics at the table and then we have a conversation with Kathy picket who says there was um\nA wrestler name the ultimate warrior who says that it was the ultimate warrior that really changed her life so what does that mean she talks about intuition you know the whole thing where people say trust you're not listen to your guard\nDumb people say that all the time listen to your gut and then you'll see a puzzled look in someone's face sort of like well what does that mean [laughter] 'cause they're not in touch with their guts and what it's telling them it's your instincts what are your instinct saying what is your intuition telling you and I'll tell you what\nI Believe in intuition 'cause every time I go against my intuition that's usually when I go down the wrong path there's a fork in the road whoops intuitions tell me one thing or the guts and then I'm thinking something else and I go on the complete leave wrong direction and so I Know somebody you know exactly I Know all of you know exactly what I mean\nAnd we're talking about that to to\n[noise] I mentioned the I'm\nIn talking about what was happening of course in D. C.\nSo much is centering around me now but Kavanaugh back the Kavanaugh stories I don't think it's over but he's the justice in he's in the thick of it now with with some the rest of the justices is they're going to be any kind of a fallout from that well who knows the is the mid term\nElections at a referendum on what happened there let's see what happens with voting I mean there's a big push to get the vote at but there's a big push by the Democrats and Republicans to do that [noise] um so that's so we keep seeing the same thing it's not it hasn't swung in one direction or the other\nUntil we know I mean until until we see what the results are of that and of course hurricane Michael like I mentioned that's the big thing pummeling Florida pushing north\nThat's what most of the conversation is about and the Dow dropping eight hundred points cause fear is arising on what the interest rates are when the interest rates shoot up do you get used to it's not that well what does that mean and then some fear\nStarts to spread by the way um the UN post now that Nikki Haley is out at the end of the year but there wasn't any kind of discord between her the president in fact they had\nA press conference the other day so there is no issue with that but it looks like Dina Powell could be the person that gets tapped for that and who is Dina Powell you've seen her face around you might recognize her that um that\nThe she's a former White House aide she was a deputy national security advisor now she's in the senior execs at golden stacks she's very close with a volunteer Trump\nAnd son in law Jared Kushner who of course our senior White house aides she had a friendly relationship when she left the White House there wasn't a problem with the with that at all and she is definitely one of the candidates to replace Nikki Haley\nAnd there I'm sure some others that would make the list to because of course you got to get the approval to make that happen and\nShe has the resume I suppose for that and that's what that's about the any kind of a position especially position at the un in that role that's what that would absolutely\n... ... you know require\nFor that but that's not until the end of the year\nSo she leaves knew somebody new comes in maybe it's her\nSee what that process ultimately is I'm like and then there is the story of the marriage or you wanna hear about the merger I'm going to tell you about the merger cause I walked by these bloody pharmacies all the time I in fact I go in them if I'm if I was\nGoing to get medication is probably where I Would end up in the times I've had to it is actually mostly where I end up\nWhere I Would end up in the times I've had to it is actually mostly where I end up CBS CBS to sixty nine billion dollar merger was at now is approved in a deal that would probably probably can transform health care is it good for us or bad for us\nWell you figure there's five million customers a day\nThat means the brick and mortar locations would turn into frontline clinics for basic medical services and patient monitoring so what does that mean it means that um\nMedications regimens being out of hospitals may be the basic services provided the right people are in there could be helpful there'll be flu shots minor illnesses would be treated if you look at CBS at Ninety eight hundred retail stores and they've got eleven hundred minute clinics\nBut um I think that could have with the whole ... thing that could explode\nI don't know how they ... obviously they think that they can merge it properly and that it won't just the the whole script thing you could get it all in one I mean there's certainly pressures\n... and there's opportunity with what's going on in health care so this may be a merger that helps us if you it may I may you know we'll see close by the end of the year I Need to know more about it I dug around a little bit today the key thing is look\nUnited all all of us know that I've talked about this before you\nGo to the doctor what do you want from the doctor he want to know somebody who knows you and you want to feel confident in what you're being treated for and do you feel confident\nDo you get the business about who you're going to see because they're not on the list and that's our aid for or are you getting sub par treatment because your fabulous doctor said enough of this nonsense\nWith the with the uh the healthcare system being upside down I'm Out of this business I've seen that happen a ton\nAnd you know frankly our faith in the medical profession it gets rocked because of that\nUnless you had somebody who stuck around like I have a doctor like that who does whatever he can to treat the people because\nHe is at the point in his career I guess er and his wife were annoys him what's happened and he figures out a way to treat people even if they don't have the right kind of insurance which bravo for him\nThat he can balance that out\nBy the way a quick reminder because I Do get a couple of emails from people who we are going down to Florida for business or family or whatever\nYou better check the airline because they have canceled hundreds of flights so you'll get I'm sure you get a free waiver and to travel some other way or to travel and other time but they canceled a la ... flight even for the next day I mean that'll that'll open up quickly\nBut\nThink of like Destin\nFort Walton Beach they've got airport there he just got to be sure about that and then you have Myrtle Beach in Savannah and Columbia South Carolina and all those other airlines where people fly into and um it's the worst thing in the world if you don't check you just assume\nYou know you go and then\nHand from the same thing with Amtrak to\nThey've got Amtrak

you'll notice little things that turn into bigger things and I think that that's how that's how it is for everybody no matter what you're doing in life that doesn't have to be\nA psychic or anything so um\nI think that's that's what we need to do and we feel like everything in our life is tied\nI think that's that's what we need to do and we feel like everything in our life is high time time pac which it is a lot of people with that but I think you know if you slow down a little bit\nAnd just give yourself that time you know things will will manifest Oreo um so that's how it is you know for everybody and I think we need to remember that [laughter]\nI mean all that is really really great it by what has happened in your life when you haven't listened to your intuition\nOh gosh um when you go I\nIgnore things for so long and um I think we just we tend to do that because we just have this mindset like I'm going to do this and they do it my way I'm going to do it like this and bad and for me um\nI Would have a physical sensation like and this probably very kind of like a lot of people where we we have that may be down in our gut\nAnd um but it's not the fun feeling like you know people say butterflies are before you do something fun you know like how I was excited for it today though it's like that that feeling\nLike that's telling you don't do this or maybe you can you that's just not right now um and oh I had that a lot with other things and I you know it didn't listen to it and you know everybody says your body doesn't lie and I read that so many high but it could be different for different people\nUm you might not have a a sensation there but you know you might have just something else that's just more of a knowing like it's going to go well let me do it any way they talk yourself you know so but my yeah mine was in my guy and [noise]\nYou know I don't want to say that I regret things cause I Try to look at them like no they're learning experience but then you know for the next time I'm you know how to improve on that on yeah because we have to live with regrets so maybe\nYou might just regret that how you know but maybe not the what so yeah\nFor me that we're a young guy and it will it be that but now I Know about you know to listen and like I said for different people so when you have things you know even write 'em down I was told that forever write stuff down because then you'll remember\nAnd I think that helps a lot better than just saying wait a minute you know then this happened before and\nUm you know but we are were quick to jump the gun I Know I um I Do I'm I'm\nBut I'm learning you know and I think that how it is that's why we're here yeah if I were here\nYou know I write it down absolutely no ... in clothing and there's not
