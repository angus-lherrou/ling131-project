C. but the country so here we are putting a I'm a foot\nIn the sand again on the cabinet sandbox debate\nAs to what happened and to me that's now which so intriguing\nAnd I said the last couple of days that I thought it was going to be you know sixty forty that he gets confirmed based on my conversations people I Know in Washington DC who are connected who are constantly on the hill who are and who are aids or who know aids or who are\nUm prepping senators and all that kind of stuff it's a really decent sources but even decent sources are not really sure\nBecause they see a step back a step

that\nIn this report it doesn't corroborate some of what was being said it's\nA forty six page report\nOn allegations of sexual assault by the Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh we know that right\nSo the FBI background investigation with like the compromise after the testimony from I'm Christine Ford and Kavanaugh about whether he attacked her during our high school years Nineteen eighty two at a

goes to the saw one minute it looks like OK boom and this is going to go\nAnd then the next minute it swings back into\nYou know the other direction and this is nothing new with what we see here in the United states because it's team and so with very polarized and of course politically the kings and then with midterms coming up\nAnd and here's the thing to me look get the best person on the bench period whoever the best person is look at that this person on the bench because that's a lifetime appointment and it is an incredible honor to be tapped the egg\nTo be picked for that it's something Oliver getting paid for it something that nobody listening to this show because I guarantee none of the Supreme just listening to America and I doubt it so I'm\nYou know what would that be like to be\nOn the bench and the highest court in Atlanta I mean that is an incredible honor to to to do that to be pegged as somebody who gets confirmed goes through and then\nHas the ultimate safe part of that process uh to me that something's really sacred and I hope it won't trample on all of that really honestly I Hope not\nSo the Republican has said that Republicans are of safeguarding the FBI report\nAnd one by one I guess people are filing in and they're going to read it and however long that takes a while to actually if you think about it what is really wild and really sad and more than wild very very\nSickening I think is what happened with these officers six officers were hurt one killed in the south Carolina shooting and you know I've heard this before because I have family members who are police officers that domestic violence that's where you can add up debt when you're a cop\nSo what happened was that was a two hour standoff in a nice residential neighborhood in Florence County South Carolina\nWas the man who had children hostage he fired on the cops from multiple agencies because they were from a couple of different ones the kids were unharmed that's a good thing it started about four o'clock eastern\nWhat happened was the shares the Orange County sheriff's office tried to serve a search warrant at home I'm In a subdivision not far from where the flooding\nOr came Florence\nReally the ripped up places and then the suspect started shooting they said all you can hear you know shops all over the place\nAnd the where he was positioned his view of fire was several hundred yards and he had an advantage they say and imagined again trying to serve this\nSo I'm the wounded officers were evacuated they were transported to a hospital and the the one that was killed was a a thirty year veteran of the police departments I mean really John Wilkes ... um\nYou know talked about it I'm just ... talked about it was a parents care away they say and I just gosh it just breaks your heart when you hear these stories I mean how difficult it off ... and a lot of people were tweeting out about it\nThese stories I mean how difficult it an awful lot and a lot of people were tweeting out about a Senator Lindsey Graham said heartbroken God Bless the people who to to protect us and their families a president tweeted out thoughts and prayers are the Orange County sheriff's office and the Florence police department tonight\nI in South Carolina were grateful for law enforcement officers\nAnd then here's\nThe reaction and just a little more detail about the officers being shot\n\n'em and more of that reaction is the um governor from South Carolina said this is simply devastating news from Florence to selfless acts of bravery for men and women and law enforcement is real and it's um\nYou know looking at a map and and it really was in the middle of all that devastation that happened with the heavy flooding because of the hurricane and it's a\nIt's a city that's like kind of in the northeast because I've spent some time now as you well know in South Carolina like in the northeast corner\nOf the ... of South Carolina and it's right where two major thoroughfare or interstates you intercept Ninety five and twenty it's a pretty decent size city and I'm here is that reaction more reaction\nLose offers more than\nDo random\n[noise] yes a random search warrant you're not looking for that to happen and this and this in in domestic violence\nCases as I've heard from family members this is where it's scary when they walk into a situation that they don't even know what they're walking into they have absolutely no idea Mm wow\n[noise] in the meantime with a little bit of this and that meaning things that we might miss out on the map or quickly I'll go to a couple of stories that I was looking at earlier in the um earlier in the day and\nOne of them was a this one and it it has to do with the fact that you've got um\nWhat I like I have no idea what's going on with these\nUh airline because we keep seeing that none of these things are happening and they're having to to land a plane and when I say that there's kind of a may there was a mayday call with this Australian flight to it you know the horror was\n... I mean what's going on because they just hear this mayday mayday just really creepy but they United\nA light ended up\nLanding thank goodness and ... it's a it landed safely in in Sydney after the hysteria over that it was Seventy seven Dreamliner from Los Angeles and they had low\nFuel low fuel oh my gosh really oh that's awful so what do you do when you have low fuel while you do a mayday because what's gonna happen if you can't get there\nIt's going to it's going to trigger responses to All right if you've got low fuel where can we possibly get you down and it was looking like\nThat's what was going to have to happen they were going to have to figure out a place where they could dump the flight and um they did it did land and then there was some kind of weird mechanical issue but they got to the gate the customers got off\nAnd uh you got a hundred and eighty passengers fourteen crew and it was the stuff you think that there's an international standard that requires when you get down to your fuel reserve you have to declare a fuel May Day you have to do that\nIn case you can't make down my God\nEven closer roads around the airport [noise] my on my\nForgotten in the mail

you as I say\nWhat I'm going on in my backyard and buzzing is probably bussing in yours to the bombshell report that came out on Donald Trump's\nTaxes on his release father Fred Trump they're saying now that his father funneled at least four hundred and Thirteen million basically the equivalent to his sons and they're saying including instances\nOf outright fraud so\nThe times found in their report in any way at least a hundred and forty million for sure like where it was tied\n'em there's the in the report they had a whole bunch of ways that this was being buried and now New York's department of taxation is vigorously pursuing this so when you look at this\nDo you think\nThat I'm just put the president's the in peril or do you think\nThat um it could be just a matter of who's going to pay a ton of money back\nWell I think if there's this fraud and the New York tax board goes after it and they can uncover the way it was being funneled then they could charge interest and all of that on top of it\nAnd I think um yeah it would be a money thing it couldn't be criminal thing because the statute of limitations I've said this on another show would be up on that but um it could be\nThat is the money thing that the they'd have to pay\nThe taxes whatever tobacco taxes were and if they go way back I think about the interest with that interest I guess look like would it look like\nI mean I think it would be a ton of money from what they're saying so\nSomebody said to me today we'll just give us a building right [laughter] he's still a building I have no idea what I Do

would be almost impossible to alert all sales girls to watch for a woman minister we understand that but what is the description center the children's department it was it didn't do any good though if a woman ... larger mouse it might be easier but to look at the sales that yourself more dollars shoes ... dollar dresses\nNothing to make a charge like that stand\nOut we make sure that there's an account in the name and then let her go don't use the chargers play system as we do but if a customer wants to charge an item and I was not the place we uh\nUsually just verify the account and let them signed the sales ... when I bought it and ... well normally we do as far as I say these sales are such small amounts of the woman comes in with the stores proud and\nThe girl just call the credit
