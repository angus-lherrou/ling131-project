think there is no difference between liberals and conservatives there's no difference between left and right in this country\nLook at the way that Brett Kavanaugh was treated\nVersus the way that Merrick Garland was was treated by the way they were not as harsh to Neil Gorsuch do you know why not\nAnd a lot of these like well you know it's really not the ... problem is Kevin O's probably no one has lost probably the reason they weren't that harsh to justice Gorsuch was because he was appointed to replace Anthony and Scalia\nWho is the leading constitutional is the leading conservative on the court in other words it wasn't what a shift the court at all and by the way Justice Kennedy was no liberal\nJustice Kennedy was a moderate on the Supreme Court he was appointed by President Reagan

a\nBasically they postponed I'm considering his appointment because of when it was announced and but there was no attempt to smear him in any way and nor do I know of any basis to smear him but go ahead\nIf nothing about the fact of the matter is actually accused sexual uh uh uh uh felt\nNo no there were not it was only I'm Sorry and this is very important that um\nThere was nothing injustice Kavanaugh's record nothing involving sexual harassment sexual assault sexual charges misbehavior there were no ex wives there wasn't enough thing a clean record until literally after\nHis hearing had
