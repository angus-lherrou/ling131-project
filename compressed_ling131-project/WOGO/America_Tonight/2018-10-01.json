Saturday on W O O G o sports\n[noise]\nIt is not my responsibility to determine whether Mr cabinet deserves to sit on the Supreme Court [noise] my responsibilities to tell you the truth [laughter]\nAll right so that was Dr Ford and of course explosive\nTestimony to day and hanging in the balance is whether or not Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed as our next Supreme Court justice what a crazy crazy day I Can't emphasize that enough\nAnd it really was about uh she said the responsibility to tell the truth\nAnd from his perspective here's what judge Kavanaugh had to say is we start here on America Tonight with me Kate dilemma here's Kavanaugh\n\nWill get back to cabinet where he talks about where he never sexually assaulted anyone\nAnd that was one of the key pieces of testimony where he said I didn't I when he was asked about that he said I never did that and\nHe came came out swinging and um he aligned himself with the president for sure and the president said he was um\n[noise] he said he gave a credible incredible performance as what he called it\nAnd a Trump was tweeting the president was treating during the hearing now here's that little slice of audio from earlier and the day on Thursday which by the way that hearing went for nine hours\nI drank beer with friends\nAlmost everyone did\nSometimes too many beers sometimes others did\nI liked fear\nI still like fear\nNot treat the or to the point of working out\nAnd not treat the or to the point of working out\nAnd I never sexually assaulted anyone\n[noise] All right so that's what he said that's what he emphasized when he was asked a couple of different times about that that um say what you want he didn't say say what you want but he but he talked about the fact that he didn't do that and he had other\nMoments where he talked about\nHis book when he was asked about the year book constantly and what was that in the year book and what the words mean and he had\nPlenty of the senators that lined up for him Lindsey Graham came to bat for him for sure Lindsey Graham that the spiral of ever seen him the senator from South Carolina lashed out of the Democrats saying that the allegations made against the judge or a sham\nAnd he said you know are you a gang rape is she screamed that out and Kavanaugh said no and uh he said if you wanted an FBI investigation should have come to us he said that looking at other senators what you want it to destroy this guy's life hold the seat open and hope you win and twenty twenty\nAnd those remarks came right after Senator Dick Durbin called for Kavanaugh to request an FBI investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations made against him\nAnd so Graham says you know I sympathize ... he's sympathizes with Kevin onto the Democrats had no intention of even protecting Dr Christine Blasey Ford the first woman who came forward publicly with the sexual assault allegations\nAnd I keep saying the same thing over but we don't know the fifty three year old judge if he is confirmed\nCould be on the bench for forty years and um you know it was high drama for sure and he did say you may defeat me in the final vote but you'll never get me to quit never that's what he told the Democrats pretty much\nAnd um he said it's destroyed his family's destroyed his good name the whole two week effort has been calculated and orchestrated a political hit field with um you know a parent pent up anger about President Trump and the twenty sixteen election he\nWas openly contemptuous of the Democrats and demanded\nYou know they answer questions that they asked of him and the Republicans who had mostly listen to forge testimony defended him and really it was more about going after the Democrats not so much Dr Ford\nThe um there's just counter charges and heated exchanges and it was very different from what happened in the afternoon with Kavanaugh then what happened with\nWith a doctor for it and that's not a surprise because she was the one who came forward didn't necessarily\nThat wasn't what was going to happen but then said she would come to Washington and there were questions about\nBecause she couldn't fly on a plane and then how could you go to these other places and there was a really with both of them in a couple of different areas of who hangs in the balance of votes\nArizona's Jeff Flake like I mentioned Alaska's Lisa Murkowski Maine Susan Collins they're not saying anything about their plans when they were asked us to the hearing\n'em they're not answering they weren't answering questions flake was asked if\nYou know whether he believes forward or not Murkowski said that she's going to go home and have some dinner and have a chance to think about all that's gone on so a Trump said the president judge Kavanaugh showed America why nominated him that's what he tweeted\nAfter the hearing his testimony was powerful honest riveting Democrats search and destroy strategies disgraceful this process has been a total sham an effort to delay obstructing resist that then it must vote and there are comparisons to what happened with Justice Clarence Thomas\nWhen his nomination was almost drowned when he was accused of sexual harassment back in Nineteen Ninety One Kavanaugh\nHad something to say like he ... he called it a circus and um that's what Thomas did he said it was a circus too and Kevin are called the proceedings the circus and said this confirmation process has become a national disgrace the constitution gives the Senate\nAnd important role in the confirmation process but you have\nReplaced advice and consent with search and destroy search and destroy\nSo I mentioned the three whose votes could heavily sway what happens and um\nYou know I have friends on the hill on both sides I've talked to people who are handicapping nuts and honestly there's just a lot of speculation\nThere's speculation at this point when the vote comes family be surprised I personally\nAm handicapping this I Do I think he gets ...\nI personally\nIf I'm handicapping this I Do I think he gets confirmed I think that's what's gonna happen let's get a grandma head of grim you have the floor\nYou earned the same boat as usual K yeah not surprised I think he's going to get\nA thank you yeah I\nFeel positive especially after they announced that are leak\nThat that yes it would more likely could from him yeah he was kind of a a big opposition there\nWhich kind of upset at me because [laughter] hey if you don't want to be part of the party get out yeah one of those type\nUh you mean you mean flag saying like yeah\nYeah I ... at the same token uh the real damage is really to the American public and the committee that said there I mean\nRegardless of Kavanaugh or Mrs for now I I Can't throw guilt either way I don't see I don't see\nThat you can go from that he did he get confirmed it she didn't you know what I'm saying [laughter] yeah\nWell that's the problem that evidence yeah we're evidence where what do you how do you do it yeah\nWell first off she got refuted by what would have come from her statements by three people that you know said well no I Can't come from that\nNow yes a border so far but then then you would have had a proof of ... what are your through third no proof you would have had some burden of proof there otherwise it you know there's reason to doubt on both sides so I can swing either way\nAnd the real damage is really more I think it's going to come out to be more for or against women and you know trying to come out but the real damage just come from those committee\nNow you want to lay up part calling the kettle black is what it is [laughter] yeah that's exactly what the old state it is it South Park calling the kettle black Republican Democrat the whole doggone committee that they're they're just as guilty\nYeah rely on a daily basis\n[laughter] [laughter] I don't I don't care who the conspiracies come from and that that's the real damage here's the real damage just you know our government and now this continues you know it could lead to the fall\nLiterally I mean there's a lot of the Roman empire when\nI'm just waiting for her you know what's his name is narrow get up on top of buildings start pointing to fiddle wild birds [laughter]\nThat's what it feels like right yeah it's crazy I don't mean\nWell most of America\nYou look at the vote we talk about this terrible time half of the country don't even vote yeah sadly\nNot even a third really vote ... is the third but that two thirds of the country they don't care [noise] yet haven't for years yeah so you know they're gonna just they're just going to keep on going and bill but you know they'll but D.C burn\nYeah ... is that the ... that's ridiculous part of it because\nOh oh\nOh no [laughter] no I agree I agree it's ridiculous it's ridiculous because you know what this is our country and so I always say this look if you vote then you\nCan complain and wine and talk about it if more people got involved maybe we'd get more people that we wanted to represent us that would represent us maybe more people that I think you'd do a great job would want to be um representatives but it's so reprehensible who wants to walk into the lion's den\nAnd like you said there's so much apathy which is so bloody sad when we have the right\nTo vote and we're not getting shot at when we go to the to uh to to put our votes yeah at these precinct so it's so depressing you know\nMaybe we can start taking the bars off the windows in the door\nThat's that's what I'm getting it maybe we can take the bars off the doors and windows all the ... this is the problem is all about two years it's just the attitude\nAnd when you get one person that wants to jump up you're faced with a stronger attitude and not you know\nTry and work or anything you get Bob\nI Know a serious problem you've got a serious problem there was a great phone call Graham thank you so much have a good one [noise]\nWe're going to die on to the other side and I'll meet you over their case all Amy America Tonight [noise]\n\nKnicks fan do you support by coming out to the game

list your talk all kinds of places to build your own credibility your email signature or anywhere you do your bio or on social media you\nCan say headache speaker on and then let your topic what you spoke on\nPut your lengthy radio and so all of a sudden it opens the doors and gains credibility unlike anything else but the cool thing is even if a only a small number of people watch your talk when\nPeople here you had a talk immediately they have to let them have to listen to this person so yeah it it's a huge game changer\nBoy that's a great tip right there we're speaking with a Cory Cory a in his book is called the book of public speaking learning to speak and so you said you've done this for sixteen years what the coolest thing you've ever gotten to do and I know that's a tough question\n... is a tough question and I'll I'll I'll leave out a three data talk because obviously that would be an easy answer if we just literally talking about it\nUm so I Would say you know those are obviously really big moment\nBut you know it isn't it weird because it doesn't really speaking at all but you know in the true answer comes me right away is actually got to be a volunteer fireman for a day\nBecause a a client the me while a person that um went to school same places me one of my talk and and told me that he was he worked for the fire fire ... fire man and woman person training cool\nAnd asked if I wanted to go through the process of what a volunteer fireman died and so he invited me ... process and I got to live that to me that was a pretty exciting moment and again it wasn't speaking at the same time but it came from speaking\nWow very very cool what do you hope people take away from your book\nI Hope people take away that two things one speaking of tired of them a lot of people think and you know I don't try to scare people out of it but I Want people to realize it's a little harder than people think and I don't mean just\nOn the stage I mean building a speaking business but secondly I Want people to realize that no matter where you start even if you're the person sweating on the stage that almost all off the stage ... they'll all be alert I watched probably more speakers that were terrified\nOn a stage and talk more speakers that were terrified when they started who become amazing speakers then people that were naturally born to do it so I Hope people can read to that and the book and realized that stuff can all be learned and\nI can learn it too so that that would be my whole or take away\nI Love that and see because you're on the different stages one thing that happened to you talked about being a volunteer fireman for a day and what an awesome experience that one\nBut you also have brushes with fame because when we travel in your different events a lot of times there are some celebrities that are on hand and I know you've interviewed a bunch of them do you have a favorite one\nThat I get that question a lot and it's a hard it's a hard one to say a favor let's say interviewer person but I can tell you a and this is still probably a favor because of this reason but\nI very memorable and in fact um there's two this band but one is a gentleman named Robin Sharma growth\nAmongst his oldest Ferrari and other international best selling book and I did the interview with him while I had to take and I didn't want to reveal that interview to Capitol and so\nHad to drink water to ease the Tuesday but the factor that uh you don't consider when you drink that much water is now I'm going to need to go to the bathroom [laughter]\nAnd so the whole interview if you listen to what you'd never know that was kind of a win but at the same time I was pretty distracted in my head the whole time during the interview so it made it very memorable\nAnd then Jack Canfield the chicken soup for the soul ... creator it took four months to get that interview and there's a whole backstory as to how you would have had to do to actually make that interview come to life and get hurt and so because of those reasons\nAnd both of those gentleman delivered and knocked out of the power because of those reasons those would be the most memorable and perhaps along the lines of among buy papers as well\nI absolutely love it that's cool very cool I Love the Tuesday thing that that had to be something sitting there with your your students\nRobbing I've only had [noise] luckily one of the Cory but it's a horrible and I don't know how you did they tried to get it out I can but [noise] the way it was about ... about that I

say this was in my opinion I'm a more incredible and in other ways a in a sense I'm not comparing to the patient to the absolute within a short period of time drama you know and everything you would look at a\nRight when you look at this who who could go in a different direction I mean everything's party line\nBut when you look at least the Murkowski for example senator Collins so Senator Murkowski senator Collins\nAnd Senator Jeff flake is another one that seems to be up in there I say seems to be up in the air we we don't know that for sure I Know from my own sources there's lots of conversations going on behind the scenes with aids et cetera trying to figure out what it is\nThe way the Senate math works ... than it is fifty one forty nine if Democrats unite against Kavanaugh which is good question too\nOf Republicans can lose one vote and still confirming by using a tie breaking vote by the VP my pets they cannot lose two votes those that tight so that's the question after the\nReally frankly long arduous process of seeing both of them out of the few senators figure out what they saw and the way they're going to vote that clearly what the breaks down to\nSo there may be another Republican waffles are I mean we don't know it seems it seems unlikely to me I mean Collins is up for reelection and twenty twenty Murkowski is up for reelection in twenty twenty two\nSo for them and you know if it's trying to keep moderates on board what are they willing and then\nFrankly wouldn't it be a novelist idea if you really just voted what you thought ... I'm not worried about when I'm running again and if we're all going to still be here on the hill I'm going to really way my options and go with what I think is the correct way to go\nSo there's going to be pressure that will ... on certain asides for example Democrats up for reelection in red states like\nMansion in West Virginia Joe Donnelly in Indiana\nAnd that's how the ball bounces this this this is what it's about so the clock is out there it's chicken and\nThe nation watched I think what happened those that could those they couldn't we're following it on Twitter they were listening to what other ways through streaming if it wasn't just flat on the tubes somewhere if they were working so there are plenty of opinions about what we saw what we heard what we think\nAnd where this is all headed\nDo you believe her account do you believe his account do you think there's holes in both of those stories and I think\n\nIt was out all involved here um how much what happened all of that\nIt's it's like um talk to anyone who's ever blacked out from alcohol and what did they remember something blacked out too many tequila shots too much bruised especially kids I mean ... it's a whole different thing\nSo we're not talking about feeling a little queasy a little I'm with a little bit burnt out\nFrom a no food too many drinks we are talking about\nProbably a maybe a blackout scenario maybe I'm the friend in that situation who did this mark judge that everybody's talking about he clearly wrote about alcohol and clearly is grappling with that\nThat is not available or has not been made available had\nMade a statement but it's not available for any of this and there are now others who are calling for\nMore to come for the FBI to get involved here\nBut I I don't see that happening I think the Senate panel is just going to is going to vote on Kavanaugh that's it at this photo is happening or we would have heard that called off I'd be very doesn't mean it can't happen to the last second but I'd be very very surprised if you want to weigh in you know you can always here eight five five\nTo six six fifty two eighty three eight five five to six six fifty two eighty three\nYou heard just a little slice there about the trauma and and uh\nSlice there about the trauma and and uh and and what that was like Lindsey Graham had his own take on what this must be like for Kavanaugh as he really exploded at one point during the hearing here's what he said\nDo you consider this a job interview the advice and consent of roles like a job was considered that you've been to a job interview\nI've done through a process so there's some concern of the constitution would you say you've been through hell\nThen for a while and then so this is not a job interview\nTo those remarks happened after Senator Dick Durbin called for cabinet to request an FBI investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations made against him Graham said he went on after what you just heard there to say he sympathizes with Kavanaugh and\nThe Democrats had no intention of protecting Christine Blasey Ford the first woman who came forward with a sexual assault allegations against\nKavanaugh so you know he ... he said listen let me tell you when it comes to this is what he said to judge Kavanaugh you're looking for a fair process you came to the wrong town at the wrong time my friends it was clearly he was frustrated\nAnd that's on this fiery comments came out from Lindsey Graham he says he believes Ford was betrayed by the person who really her letter\nWhich was sent to the Democratic senator that we've talked about Feinstein I'm\nOn the allegations that he said I think she just much victim his cabinet as because some of the trader trust and the people are portrayed her trust they owe her an apology and that\nThat goes to the okay what happened with the letter and then if they hadn't done when it's release and going back to it needed to be released sooner if you have that letter and you have that conversation is going to end up\nComing to this and and what can be said as she didn't want it to be revealed okay\nI'm didn't want it to be revealed and then it was what a waiting game to see if if he was going to be the nominee that wants to be the nominee so it was a really hairy\nI kind of a\nKind of a creepy day frankly to kind of a creepy Paul hanging over D.C that washed over the rest of us I think in the U.S and I was monitoring social media and let me tell you it pretty much that goes what I said where you've got\nDecides its its side business like watching a football game it's like deciding what side are you on ... do you believe after these Kavanaugh hearings what do you think is going to happen and he had the bulk of the afternoon\nSo on the Twittersphere the conversations were geared towards that cause they everybody had already heard her\nAnd um you know the the his emotion was brought up and some people liked it some people didn't like it the um senator lay he asked cabinet if he is bart cabin on mark judges book\nAnd he refused to answer then he said he said he didn't think mark judge you'd have to testify and it kind of was that back and forth wasn't kind of it was that back and forth\nYou know all the way around so which is it's who's right where do they go from here I think quite\nHonestly it's going to just be that vote\nAnd what happens and that voters what happens in that that vote\nAnd then that's it\nI mean ... hash tag it the Kavanaugh hearings is done and what comes out of that is\nIt simply who do you believe to believe him\nDo you think um [noise]\nHe should be the next Supreme Court justice I mean there's the other question that some people are asking including Steve Schmidt he was a long time Republican operative who worked on many Republican\nCampaign and he doesn't think\nHe should be a judge he doesn't have the decorum for any America Tonight [noise]\n...\nWhen you need them your local

there that was it it was only the fist objection of his career so he's not necessarily known for that it's been around for a long time but um\nYeah that was it against the Yankees organizations saved some money anyway if you want to look at it that way if you're a college football than it's interesting 'cause this is a big week in college football and they already have one in and out of Miami\nBeach you and the forty seven to ten forty seven and ...\nAnd then there was some conversation about the ... than a couple of days ago\nThe Clemson quarterback Kelly Bryant is transferring from plants that after losing the starting job\nHe doesn't want to be the motive that is what happens a lot you see a lot of quarterback move on to other opportunities\nHe started a lack of Eighteen games for the tigers but he was told on Monday that he was demoted in favor of the freshman Trevor Lauren and Lauren's coach taboos a Sweeney said it was emotional he gave Bryant the day off\nAbout any skipped practiced on Tuesday\nBut he said he was you know he wanted to he wanted to transfer and he did say he did say that he said I was like I'm not discouraging Trevor\nHe's doing everything asked them but my thought is that I feel like I haven't done anything not to be the starter I didn't hear what am I turn up to and everything you all have asked me to do which the well that's true\nBut this is how it goes in college football who everything better guy is that's here putting and the and\nThe you know the Sean ... than with a guy a couple of years ago who ends up being the the quarterback for the Houston Texans so Bryan started the first four games this season I constantly splits time with Lawrence\nThat they've got these red shirt rules this season Bryant a senior has an opportunity to transfer charter school one year of eligibility remaining because he played in only four games this season so that's why he had to do that\nSo that he can he can be the red shirt guy so he can go to another team and a Sweeney said that he was saddened and disappointed that prime made the decision to leave\nBut he said you know as far as the decision as a coach sometimes you have to make tough decisions that are in the best interests of the team and this is one of those decisions that I Would make it all over again because I Believe that's what\nIt's right for our team I feel like Kelly would've continue to help them play a lot but that's not what\nWe wanted to do I you know he said that's not what he wants to do I would have started him I could have started him but he would have had limited options so that's it\nAnd Lawrence has the bigger numbers he's got the concern of passing yards and nine touchdowns and so they made that switch and he's playing the rules as meaning he go someplace else and that's what happens\nBecause when you're a quarterback and especially if you think you have some kind of a chance to go to the pros you want people to the play you want to have big heroes game and have those big daddy games so that you'll get a more look\nIn the draft when you decide to come out if that's the case and then just in some cases just because you want to be the person you want to have all you don't want to be the backup or\nThe guy who got it he didn't win but now we're gonna\nDifferent direction [noise] yep\nI Wonder where he pops up next there's a couple

and hanging in the balance is whether or not Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed as our next Supreme Court justice what a crazy\nCrazy day I Can't emphasize\nThat enough and it really was about uh she said the responsibility to tell the truth\nAnd from his perspective here's what judge Kavanaugh had to say is we start here on America Tonight with me Kate Glen and here's Kevin uh\nUh we'll get back to Kavanaugh where he talks about where he never sexually assaulted anyone and that was one of the key pieces of testimony where he said I didn't die when he was asked about that he said I never did that and\nHe came came out swinging and um he aligned himself with the president for sure and the president said he was um\n[noise] he said he gave a credible incredible performance is what he called it\nAnd the Trump was tweeting the president was treating during the hearing now here is that little slice of audio from earlier in the day on Thursday which by the way that hearing went for nine hours\nI drank beer with friends\nAlmost everyone did\nSometimes I have too many beers\nSometimes others did\nAre still like fear\nNot treat the or to the point of working out\nAnd I never ... actually assaulted anyone\nAll right so that's what he said that's what he emphasized when he was asked a couple of different times about that that um say what you want you didn't say say what you want\nBut he's but he talked about the fact that he didn't do that and he had\nOther moments where he talked about\nHis book when he was asked about the year book constantly and what was that in the year book and what the word mean\nAnd he had\nPlenty of the senators that lined up for him Lindsey Graham came to bat for him for sure Lindsey Graham that's on fire ever seen him\nThe senator from South Carolina lashed out of the Democrats saying that the allegations made against the judge or a sham and he said you know are you a gang rape is he screamed that out and have and I said no and\nUh he said if you wanted an FBI investigation should've come to us he said that looking at other senators what you want it to destroy this guy's life hold the seat open and hope you win and twenty twenty\nAnd those remarks came right after Senator Dick Durbin was called for Kavanaugh to request an FBI investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations made against him\nAnd so Graham says you know I said before he sympathizes with Kevin onto the Democrats had no intention of even protecting Dr Christine Blasey Ford the first woman who came forward publicly with\nDr Christine Blasey Ford\nThe first woman who came forward publicly with the sexual assault allegations he was clear about that he said let me tell you when it comes to this you're looking for a fair process you came to the wrong town at the wrong time my friend and Graham declared he would vote for cabinet right then and there he said that and it was pretty\nCould be on the bench for forty years\nAnd um you know it was high drama for sure and he did that you may defeat me in the final vote but you'll never get me to quit never that's what he told the Democrats pretty much and um he said it's destroyed his family's story is good name\nThe whole two week effort has been calculated and orchestrated a political hit field with\nUm you know a parent pent up anger about President Trump and the twenty sixteen election he\nWas openly contemptuous of the Democrats and demanded you know they answer questions that they asked of him and the Republicans who had mostly listen to forge testimony defended him and really it was more about going after the Democrats not so much\nDr Ford the um there's just counter charges and heated exchanges and it was very different from what happened in the afternoon with Kavanaugh than what happened with\nWith a doctor for it and that's not a surprise because she was the one who came forward didn't necessarily that wasn't what was going to happen but then that she would come to Washington and there were questions about\nBecause she couldn't fly on a plane and then how could you go to these other places and there was hold it really with both of them in a couple of different areas of who hangs in the balance of votes\nArizona's Jeff Flake like I mentioned Alaska's Lisa Murkowski Maine's Susan Collins they're not saying anything about their plans when they were asked us to the hearing\n'em they're not answering they weren't answering questions flake was fast if\nYou know whether he believes forward or not Murkowski said that she's going to go home and have some dinner and have a chance to think about all that's gone on so a Trump said the president judge Kavanaugh showed America why nominated him that's what he tweeted\nAfter the hearing his testimony was powerful honest riveting Democrat search and destroy strategy is disgraceful this process has been a total sham an effort to delay obstructing resist the Senate ... votes and there were a comparison to what happened with Justice Clarence Thomas\nWhen his nomination was almost drowned when he was accused of sexual harassment back in Nineteen Ninety One Kavanaugh had something to say like he called the\nHe called it a circus and um that's what Thomas did he said it was a circus too and Kavanaugh called the proceedings the circus and said this confirmation process has become a national disgrace the constitution gives them and it's\nAn important role in the confirmation process but you have replaced advice and consent with search and destroy search and destroy\nSo I mentioned just three whose votes could heavily sway what happens and um\nYou know I\nHave friends on the hill on both sides I've talked to people who are handicapping nuts and honestly there's just a lot of speculation or speculation at this point when the vote comes down will we be surprised I personally\nIf I'm handicapping this I Do I think he gets confirmed I think that some guy happens let's go to Graham Graham you have the floor\nAnd the same boat as usual K yeah\nNot surprised I think he's going to get\nA second I feel positive especially after they announced that are leak\nThat yes they were more likely could for him yeah it was kind of a a big opposition there which kind of upset at me because hey it ought to be part of the party get out\nYeah one of those type\nUh you mean you mean flag saying like\nYeah yeah\n... and coke and\nUh the real damage is really to the American public and the committee there I mean\nRegardless for Kavanaugh or Mrs before\nNow I I Can't throw guilt either way I don't see I don't see\nThe kicker for her but he did he get confirmed it she did and you know what I'm saying [laughter] yeah\nWell that's the problem the evidence you know where your evidence where what do you how do you do it yeah\nWell\nFirst off she got refuted by water\nYeah well\nFirst off she got refuted by what would have come from her statement by three people that you know said well no I Can't come from that\nNow yes a border so far but then then you would have had a proof of ... through third no proof you would have had some burden of proof there\nOtherwise it you know there's reason to doubt on both sides so I can swing either way\nAnd the real damage is really more I think it's going to come out to be more for or against women\nAnd you know trying to come out but the real damage just kind of from those committee\nNow why would a lay up part calling the kettle black is what it is [laughter] yeah that's exactly what the old state it is it South Park calling the kettle black Republican Democrat the whole doggone committee that they're they're just as guilty\nYeah rely on a daily basis\nI don't I don't care who the conspiracies come from and that that's the real damage there is the real damage is you know our government\nAnd a half their skin ten years you know it could lead to add to the fall\nI mean isn't that the Roman empire when\nI'm just waiting for her you know\nWhat's his name is narrow get up on top of feeling start playing to fiddle wild birds [laughter]\n[laughter] that's what it feels like right yeah it's crazy oh I don't mean\nWell most of America\nYou look at the vote we talk about this several times half of the country don't even vote yeah sadly\nNot even a third really vote\nHe lost a third\nBut but that two thirds of the country I don't care [noise] yet haven't for years yeah so you know they're going to just they're just keep on going in there but you know they'll be see burned\n... is that through thick and was part of it because\nI don't know [laughter] no I agree I agree I think he'll is ridiculous because you know what this is our country and so I always say that look if you vote\nThen you can complain and wine and talk about it if more people got involved maybe we'd get more people that we wanted to represent us that would represent us maybe more people that I think you'd do a great job would want to be um representatives but it's so reprehensible who wants to walk into the lion's den\nAnd like you said there's so much apathy which is so bloody mad when we have the right to vote and we're not getting shot at when we go to the\nTo ah to to put our votes yeah at these precinct so it's so depressing well\nMaybe we can start taking the bars off the windows in the door\nThat's that's what I'm getting that maybe we can take the bars off the doors then go into\n... ... ... this is the problem is all about two years it's just the attitude and when you get one person that wants to jump up you're faced with a stronger\nAttitude and not you know\nTry and work or anything either Bob\nI Know they're serious problem you've got a serious problem that was a great song called grand

if you were\nA business owner I mean you can't talk about your business during your car but people do you ever really resonate with your talk\nYou can also\nBut people think they really resonate with

and let your topic what you spoke on put your link the radio and so\nAll of a sudden it opens the doors and gains credibility unlike anything else but the cool thing is even if it only a small number of people watch your talk when\nPeople hear you talk immediately they they have to let them have to listen to this person so yeah it it's a huge game change\nBoy that's a great tip right there we're speaking with Cory pour a in his book is called the book of public speaking learning to speak and they used to have you done this for the teen years what the coolest thing you've ever gotten to do and I ended up a tough question\nIs a tough question and I'll I'll I'll leave out a free ... talk because obviously that would be an easy answer if we just literally talking about it um so I Would say you know those are the really big moment\nBut you know it isn't it weird because it doesn't really speaking at all but you know is it true answer comes me right away is actually got to be a volunteer fireman for a day\nBecause a a client you meet a person that um went to school St places me one of my talk and and told me that he was he work for the fire fire ... fire man and woman person training cool\nAnd asked if I wanted to go through the process of what a volunteer fireman died and so he invited me ... process and I got to live that to me that was a pretty exciting moment and again it wasn't speaking at the same time but it came from speaking\nWow very very cool what do you hope people take away from your book\nPeople take away that two things one speaking it's harder than a lot of
