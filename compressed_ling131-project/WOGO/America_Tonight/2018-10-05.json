better to bring into the conversation and Bob Ney from TOP Media news Bob you and I\nHave been talking about this for years with the stuff that's been happening in DC and like I say the reaction that we all have I have to tell you and I've been doing America nights for ten years and really in the last five years and you've probably been on with me the bulk of the five years\nUm there's been more conversation people ask me because people do I do sports business and speak people ask me more about what's happening in D.C than anything else\nWhat's going on or what's going on with Kevin what do you what's known what happened what's going on\nYeah same here I'm getting calls messenger calls to my house from people all over the place than it used to be I'd get up I've been doing this for what eight years wouldn't yeah media news but I Would get up that are news and this even during the Obama era maybe one or two Obama stories today I just get up like Google Trump\n[laughter] it what happened on Capitol stories on overload and up you know it's something that I found interesting you know I have talked about there's so many times this from a nation but I find it interesting\nThe Democratic side comes out and they say well you know they didn't interview certain amount of people\nDon't actually come out and dispute\nThe port of Ford versus Kevin are you know what I'm saying\nThey yeah they they don't like it but they don't come out and say\nWell you know that report is completely inaccurate they're saying they it's an accurate because I didn't interview more people you know that they didn't put it together correctly cetera\nWow I mean just it's it's just wild like we said it's just wild about the report and it's and\nAnd a closer to now the Senate nodded teams it's comes down to the three Jeff Flake Murkowski it seems and Collins senators why although there could be somebody that jumps around on the Republican side who knows but\nIt's really the three that are being talked about I Can't see Jeff Flake not voting Aslam cabin I don't see it and I really don't see that from calling\nMurkowski will go cause but here's the thing and I and I just wheeling West Virginia radio today I'm a I'm putting mansion in the category look at my friends have gotten mad at me for this I've told them they're not going to beat you mentioned senator Manchin is going to win\nAnd right now he is up so far over his opponent it it's it's beyond belief because you've got to remember is you know a Trump screened West Virginia like we've never seen before so term Patrick Morsi is losing the mansion and I'm thinking why wouldn't mansions\nYou know I'm\nGo the other direction and give give more see some kind of life life\nTwo mark judge the friend of bread ... one point he was charging some serious money for it I guess now you can get it for free ... the the rambling novel that alluded to what happens when they were in high school ... and the things that you used to do that we're ... we you know\n... the windows and we threw toilet paper and the trees and the house ... you get arrested now but also it's out there so ever it's it's it's more recorded so you can see when they testified\nOr were they were brought before the hearing ... cabinet and doctor for and what was interesting is that it it made me think of that like\n... could you recall what happened in high school I notice veering off of\nThe bitter partisan divide but seriously if you are that age and you're listening to America it's nice ... think about what you're putting out there just make sure that if it comes back to you you can defend it or it's authentic that's the key that's it's authentic you and I'm\nI'll tell you this is the ... army on the FBI reports\nJeff Flake will definitely vote yes for cabinet there's no question he might be key swing vote ... ... I don't think ever was the key swing vote by the way but he\nHe looked at the FBI report and he said it there's no cooperation in what I've just seen here about doctor for delegation of sexual assault he said there's nothing in the supplementary background\nCheck that cooperated the claims which through the nomination into turmoil last month he said he agrees with\nFellow Republican Senator Susan Collins\nAnd I'm like the others in viewing the FBI report as there oh he said it's failed to back up the claim that Cavanaugh assaulted her poured at a house gathering in eighty two when they were both in high school\nSo I Can't imagine that he doesn't go that way I mean maybe Collins and Murkowski are still being billed as as undecided but I don't need ... undecided I see my sixty forty from pulling people I knew in DC and now\n...

is you know friday is it friday it means that okay so we move forward because there's going to be of a vote there's going to be a vote\nOn um on Kavanaugh and we\nKeep hearing about these swing senators and what does that mean ultimately it is the talk of not just do you see the country so here we are putting a I'm a foot\nIn the sand again on the Kavanaugh sandbox debate as to what happened and to me that now which so intriguing\nAnd I said the last couple of days that I thought it was going to be you know sixty forty that he gets confirmed based on my conversations people I Know in Washington DC who are connected who are constantly on the hill\nWho are and who are aids or who know ways are who are um prepping senators and all that kind of stuff that really decent sources but even decent sources are not really sure\nBecause they see a step back a step\nForward at this point I think it's the steps forward\nSo I'm I think it's Seventy five percent that he gets confirmed Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\nIs advancing the nomination the Supreme Court he did that by insisting that they're going to get the results of the FBI supplemental background investigation it's going to be finished then of course there was a secret secret room in the capital and the senators got to go and look at what was in that report\nAnd the um with not to be made public but but the\nDeal was expect some of it to leak in certain areas where there was an evidence for the call those who have seen it say there's\nNot enough there there's not enough to to say that in this\nReport it doesn't corroborate some of what was being said it's a forty six page report on allegations of sexual assault by the Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh we know that right\nSo the FBI background investigation was like to compromise\nThe testimony from I'm Christine forward and Kavanaugh about whether he attacked her during their high school years Nineteen eighty two at a party\nAnd in exchange for a vote to move Kavanaugh's confirmation to the full Senate Senator Jeff Flake was granted his request for an FBI investigation that the charges by four to one of Kavanaugh's classmates at Yale Deborah mirrors so Democrats and Republicans\nAlternated and going over the report and to our segment and it was the rotation they kept up all\nDay long on Thursday and um\nYou know there were ... there were senators whining about it that it's unusual circumstances and the process is unusual\nIf you are a brew crew fan the brewers\nWhen the national league division series first game they did it um\nAnd not the easy way though because it was the extra frames tenth inning and it was never the Colorado Rockies Mike moose stuck his his RBI single in the tens was what clipped it open

up and get it that way but um I I I picked him in the beginning of the year there there that team of not everybody's so famous on the team but they have that whole team attitude\nSo I think that's what it's about I think they've got that common goal and it really is about for the win for the wind's\nNot so much for the me the neither me neither I I think it's I think they really have found that group will they win the world series that they got to get through this and it's one game right so there's a lot left to come how about the Dodgers the Dodgers slug past the Braves\nAnd their National League\nUm division series they the Dodgers led the series one of the day leave that there is now one nothing they beat the Braves six nothing\nAnd um that a power display I mean that's what it was they were ... swinging away or whether it was you know a lead off home or whether it was I'm a solo shot in the sixth inning by and Ricky Hernandez whatever it was they did it so now game to\nNext and Clinton ... goes to the mountains\nSo he wanted to go he wanted to be ready for game one but he wasn't chosen for game one and of course he's had struggles in October he's been seven seven he's evidence to have an overall in October he's still an incredible\nPicture there's no doubt about it and he absolutely I'm sure it's going to try to pitch lights out in the\nNext game so ah they're off to their off to start there often role and and that's you know what happened um\n[noise] and if the best of five so you know in the best to five not a lot of room if get down in a hole and they all know is they want to be able to\nTo come back if they're in that they've lost that first one they want to come back to this is interesting mix tape and who is um fast rapidly going down in history as

it\nHe said I'm disappointed there weren't more students I think we're trying to address that I don't think they're entitled to anything\nUh I think needs ought to be first come first served they don't want to come to the game they don't want to come but I'm sure there's enough people around here that would like to go to the games and we'd like for them to come to they support the players how

'cause they've charged data and Adidas executive and the former Adidas consultant in college basketball runner conspired\nTo pay bow and family a hundred thousand exchanged for him to commit to play for Louisville so there's all kinds of nonsense their shocking isn't it you know that this kind of stuff happened is a good cause then what about everybody else right\nUm it's not good because this is where this is where you have to decide college college athletics\nWhat what are the kids getting an exchange they're getting scholarships they're getting to free riser getting whatever but they're also getting\nTwo a days and practice out of their eyeballs and everything else and the coaches and the school but especially the school not so much the coach and so you pay for good coaches and on a
