I mean that is not even the word disgusted outraged whatever you want to say he got um seven law enforcement officers that um\nYou know a police officers that seven law enforcement officers were heads a one other was shot in Florence they have a they have somebody in custody for this but I'm sure you know I read the story about the police officer just so sad\nAnd this was about serving a warrant\nIf they're serving a warrant and there was a twenty twenty year old guy inside the house and um\nWas alive they were able to take it they were able to take them into custody\nAnd it's a again just terribly started to hear these reports initially that three deputies into the city of Florence officers have been shot that happened around seven forty five eastern and there were\nIt was had been shot that happen around seven forty five eastern and there were a hostage just kids were hostage just so turned into a just an um an unbelievable nightmare as what it turned into it it was supposed to be\nA serving a warrant that's what it was supposed to be and the cop killings\nAnd have to stop I don't get it this is I mean it seems to be the territory you did not tread on pat is listening to us I think in Wisconsin and hey pat\nI Can't say I was just listening to talk about officers killed in warm to strikes me that I don't want to take those strong feeling animals compassion for them and their family a good job they're doing everything but [noise]\nWhy America the only time we hear about this killing of the time of the cop nationwide news grandma can get killed in Iraq and report for a little girl the girl under hundreds of people killed every day in the country and all kinds of crimes that are out of work shirt or a bar or a cop\nKilled is Spanish for what it was ... when we'd be better off to address\nThe crime and the ... the morality of not just for their officers still\nI think we should always address that I I agree with you shouldn't be just about something that's easier to highlight although\nI think it is terrific and I think that if there is a targeting thing that happens in this case I think it was one of those domestic violence calls and somebody going out and then that's what happens and then other people respond and it turns into a nightmare but you bring up pat of really good point\nUm shouldn't all of it the part of what we talk about shouldn't there be more conversation about morality how people are feeling what's going on out there that people are snapping the way they are and then you hear sometimes you hear well no they\nThat was that ... that that guy was really a good guy and I knew him for a while down the street it's not always oh they were crazed and they were wild\nSomething's wrong and we're missing connection and that's part of a pat thanks for thanks for bringing that up and thanks for calling\nAnd I think you hit on something that we've hit on before in America tonight other people have talked about it we've had psychologist on thing\nCan act technology\nUm what the the U.S against them mentality the isolation of people is it worse than it's been before is that there's more people is that a combination of all those things and it it is a combination of all of those things and it isn't just police officers but\nIt used to be that you wouldn't do that I I mean just wouldn't you know do that you you wouldn't shoot at officers because you call the officers in in certain situations and they would help you and it wouldn't be okay\nI'm I'm wild about what's happening here so they take us back in the ... the the kids weren't heard it was a two hour standoff in this upscale neighborhood just outside of Florence South Carolina and ah they had a bullet\nProof the equal basically they had to be used to rescue the wounded up because the man had the kids\nThey say what they were serving a warrant they didn't name him or the wounded officers or give the conditions 'cause I keep digging into this is still haven't found any of that we do know\nThe um officer who died parents Caraway fifty two Thirty years as a police officer and\nUh he died so he had a family terrible a terrible thing that's that's for sure and\nUh it's terrible really in the ... that violence\nThings are leading people and violent directions for what we don't know the details exactly of this story but there is no story you can say that will make you think oh well yeah that's that's how sadly that reaction happened no no\nUh there's no excuse for ending someone's life there's no reason of course now that's a you know where you just go after somebody whether they're a cop or whoever it might be kind of it that\nSubtle not even subtle were at that mapping point right and I hated to play into all of that but there he's right there are things that are unreported and if you knew everything that was reported boy you'd you'd walk already be hard pressed not to be depressed over some\nOf what you're hearing

left his camera at home and\n... when he got to the office they ask where's your camera and he said\nIt you know it it looked to the weather was terrible well it\nIt cleared up the sun came out and they persuaded him to drive all the way back home and get his camera was he was that close\nTo never uh taking these pictures that anyone out on to do the it was going to shoot from his office the was I'm buying the seventh floor the building overlooking daily plaza he he couldn't see very much from there so we walked down he found one place\nOn the but the one place where he could photograph the entire thing from beginning to end and um\nIt was always even even when he was speaking to me he was embarrassed by the fact that the this middle aged garment manufacture\nHad taken pictures of this momentous event whereas all of these world famous photographers who are covering the president went back and the press buff and didn't get a single frame oh\nWow and so you go through this process you

Trump is doing a press conference for it it turns toward cabin I for getting asked\nQuestions about that and really at first didn't want to talk about it then he starts to kind of you know kind of him and how about the the Kavanaugh thing and and Trump said look I'm fine with the FBI interviewing cabinet as a third accuser so he's saying do what they have to do he's he's basically\nPutting it back on um you know the Senate right\nSure one of the national media started to report that he told the FBI you could only talked to people and that's just it can't be accurate it is I Would have to tell the Senate will to show what the president told us\nThe FBI would have to tell the Senate\nWith is what the president told us he said it it can be comprehensive no\nPeople took the words where he said you know he also feels that it could be a fishing expedition where you could just go on for months with this thing or you know you could have the but not on this phone calls and do you you know investigate those types of things but I think in generally clearly said it\nIt can be comprehensive the FBI you'll do it they take about a week [noise] so do you have a vote by friday I think\nAnd we know Kavanaugh denied that the New York times reported Monday that in September of Nineteen eighty five Kavanaugh was involved in an altercation at a bar where he was accused during ice and another patron\nThe times I went to a police report\nOf that incident in New haven and said Kavanaugh was not arrested according to that report the victim in that case said that after Kavanaugh for all the ice a friend of his through a glass and hit the victim in the air causing him to believe the man was treated a hospital\nAnd Kavanaugh speaking officers didn't want to say if he threw the height of or\nI'm not because this is what's happening every possible rock is being a return former MBA player Chris Dudley said he regularly drank with Kavanaugh while with your classmates at Yale and said he never ever saw him the blackout drunk\nThe butter they drank a lot together so\nThis is going to go on probably at least for a couple more days and\nIt depends on that whole vote thing when one of the vote going to go down or not because of McConnell's thing one thing and he's saying the Senate's going to hold that vote\nThis week so if they hope to vote this week well does that mean you know the end of the week or what does that mean and I guess they wrap up that investigation\nHe says it's time for the enlisted Elaine obstruction has to come to a close he said judge Kavanaugh's nomination is out of committee were considering it here in the form will be voting this week he made the comments McConnell did\nWho is the Senate majority leader during the Senate floor speech and this comes as the FBI has to wrap this up though and you know listen they got to wrap this up by friday so I guess they could vote friday or go into the week the Republican senators and aides have been careful not to pin down a specific timeline on the nomination\nAnd that's smart because how do they know what if the FBI wraps it up\nBefore the friday deadline what if it they wrap it up Thursday whatever it is so\nIf McConnell file coach or be forced to hear something so McConnell waited until friday to file cloture on the nomination\nThat would set up an initial vote on ending debate as early Sunday if he filed closure before that he could bring up the vote as soon as the friday deadline pass or when the FBI wrapped it up so they're playing the waiting game that's what they have to\nDo so far what we do know it's senator Collins and Senator Murkowski or undecided\nAnd Jeff Flake\nSaid he he would support cabinet but he was key to getting that one week investigation into the allegations he said over the weekend he expects to support him unless the FBI find something in the investigation so\nIt really rats I guess on this investigation\nAnd um is it going to uncover something that's a definite definite something that they can now with that whole evidence thing\nBecause I I think that's where they're going to go with that so if you flip a coin and give it a little better odds I'd say you know what I'd say 'cause everybody's pressing me on this too I Would say sixty forty sixty ... confirmed\nForty not it's just\nYou know it's just too close to close to say what happens in the case of flake especially because he would be really want to call the swing vote he would be the swing vote if you look at the numbers\nAnd so therefore unless somebody else decides the ninth hour to go in a different direction but it's a very very unlikely\nI call this segment odds and ends because there's so much we don't get to talk to talk about rather on America Tonight and by the way you can always\nGym in on the conversation when ever you want eight five five to six six fifty two eighty three let me flip out that the digits against a five five to six six fifty two eighty three so I Love

mechanical issue but they got to the gate the customers got off\nAnd uh you got a hundred and eighty passengers for teen crew and it was a few things that there's an international standard that

probably buzzing in yours to the bombshell report that came out on Donald Trump's\nTaxes on his release father Fred Trump they're saying now that his father funneled at least four hundred and Thirteen million basically the equivalent to his son and they're saying including instances of outright fraud\nSo\nThe times found in their report in the way at least a hundred and forty million for sure like where it was tied 'em there's the in the report they had a whole bunch of ways that this was\nBeing buried and now New York's department of taxation is vigorously pursuing this so when you look at this\nDo you think\nThat um this puts the presidency in peril or do you think\nThat um it could be just a matter of he's going to pay a ton of money back\nWell I think if there's this fraud and the New York tax board goes after it and they can uncover the way that was being funneled then they could charge interest and all of that on top of it and I think um yeah it would be a money thing it couldn't be criminal thing\nBecause the statute of limitations I've said it's another show would be up on that but um\nCould be that is the money thing that the ... they'd have to pay\nThe taxes whatever tobacco taxes were and if they go way back I think about the interest on with that interest I guess look like would it look like\nI mean I think it would be a ton of money from what they're saying so\nSomebody said to me today we'll just give up a building right [laughter] do you sell a building I have no idea what I Do know that they will absolutely they will or the or tax board will absolutely go after anyone for whatever they owe back they will\nUncover whatever they have to uncover I mean really honestly\nI then I got this one from Tom who says I'm Kate did you know I Know

as the process move forward\nFor confirmation or not to confirm I think it's really a very long weekend\nBecause Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader set the key Kavanaugh vote for friday and that's where we are friends tape delay any America Tonight it's not just about Washington there's other bugs in the backyard seven cops were shot in South Carolina well for just serving a

everywhere are starting to say yeah this is something something got to give but as much as we say that what are the solution to that\nThat should have been a process that did not end up dirt probably in a that\nHorrific way in the end where\nYou have a fifty two year olds thirty year veteran of the force dead as a result and will be in the ground in a couple of days and um how horrible for his family\nAnd for all the people around him and for the people that frankly he knew in a community for a very very very\nLong time\nSee her Kamala Harris had to say and uh one of the things that the president has said is look the U.S is with Kavanaugh all the way he said on Wednesday that his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nIs is is what people want that there were such enthusiasm and energy for the judge\nAnd look at the polls than the polls show that something big happening he's a fine man of great in the countries with him all the way recent polls have indicated that nationwide opposition to Kevin uh increase in the days following his hearing before the Senate Judiciary committee on Thursday\nKavanaugh and Dr for the first woman to publicly accused him of sexual assault testified as we all know last week regarding the allegations\nAnd then there was a the fallout from that and the poll depending on the poll it it it goes in different directions just like everything else of it it depends on if it's a more unbiased poll or it means to the writer it means to the left\nAnd his recollections of what happened the reaction to it and that kind of stuff then you don't wanna miss that in to the ball's coming up round the bend here next on the ATM and then a conversation with\nA darn near all new conversation about\nWhat do you do when you go out and you're trying to just he'd better right we don't have to just eat constant crap I mean listen don't want to live a life where you're not eating pizza here and they're not need and I don't know a slice of chocolate cake we're diving into the jury does whatever your your food is not great for you\nAnd especially when the new study comes out that shows\nOne in three adults eat fast food everyday now that is not great great I mean how many times you eat in fast food a day\nBut I get it to grab and go right grabbing go the food but because of that whole idea of putting calories on the menu now when you go to eat have you noticed is you go out to eat\nAnd I mean even if you're doing good you look at whatever do I I don't know there's something about seeing those calories it's freaky isn't it like it's like thinks she think aren't that many calories or wow like your whole allotments for the day that we have a great conversation on Forbes books at bedtime with\nA John Deere which we have a couple of conversations with her a month and in this case we talked about okay well what some good option and she hit on one that is my absolute favorite meal we'll see if you can pick it up it's like my favorite and she said it and I knew it\nBut it um it's interesting and I thought about it today because I'll just say I had a salad for lunch salad\nSo imagine one in three adults fast food on any given day federal study to look at how often that happens the Centers for Disease Control and prevention released the numbers based on a survey of ten thousand adults over four years\nAnd they didn't find the difference between men and women didn't higher income families a fast food more often than lower income families and I'm black people they say African Americans ate it more than other um ethnic groups and they broke that town of course the high calorie fast food\nLeads to the things we know that aren't great for us um obviously and could be the ultimate\nA deal for us heart disease with clogged arteries but like I said\nEasy to um easy to say that it's not a big deal easy to say but you know you can you can get a around that but then you get stuck now being stuck oh\nI've been stuck is not even the word disgusted outraged whenever you want to say he got um seven law enforcement officers that um\nYou know a police officers dead Devin law enforcement officers were heads a one other was shot in Florence they have a they have somebody in custody for this but I'm sure you know I read the story about the police officer just so sad\nAnd this was about serving a warrant\nIf they're serving a warrant and there was a twenty twenty year old guy inside the house and um\nWas the last they were able to take it they were able to take them into custody\nAnd it's a again just terribly starting to hear these reports initially that three deputies into the city of Florence officers have been shot\nThat happen around seven forty five East Germans and there were ... kids were a hostage just so turned into a just and I'm an unbelievable nightmares what it turned into and it was supposed to be\nA serving a warrant that's what it was supposed to be and the cop killings\nIt has to stop I don't get it this is I mean it seems to be the territory you did not tread on\nPat is listening to us I think in Wisconsin hey pat\nI say I was just listening to talk about the officers killed in the warm to\nStrikes me in order to take those strong feeling on the most compassionate for them on her family's real job they're doing everything but [noise]\nAmerica the only time we hear about this killing the return of the cop a nationwide news grandma can get killed in Iraq and report for a little girl the girl under\nHundreds of people killed every day on the concrete and all kinds of crimes were sort of our border post killed is Spanish wind goes way better off to the crime and the short lived near morality and not just for their officers killed\nI think we should always addressed that I I agree with you it shouldn't be just about something that's easier to highlight although I think it is terrific and I think that there is a targeting thing that happens in this case I think it was one of those domestic violence calls than somebody going\nHappens in this case I think it was one of those domestic violence calls than somebody going out and then that's what happens and then other people responded turns into a nightmare but you bring up pat a really good point\nUm shouldn't all of that the part of what we talk about shouldn't there be more conversation about morality how people are feeling what's going on out there that people are snapping the way they are and then you hear sometimes you hear will know they've\nThat was that ... that that guy was really a good guy and I knew him for a while down the street it's not always oh they were crazed and they were wild\nSomething's wrong and we're missing connection and that's part of the pat thanks for thanks for bringing that up and thanks for calling\nAnd I think you hit on something that we've hit on before in America tonight other people have talked about it we've had psychologist on things\nConnect technology um\n... the the ... against them mentality the isolation of people is it worse than it's been before is that that there's more people is it a combination of all those things and it it is a combination of all of those things and it isn't just police officers\nBut it used to be that you wouldn't do that I mean it just wouldn't you know do that you you wouldn't shoot it officers because you call the officers in in certain situations and they would help you and they wouldn't be\nOkay I'm I'm wild about what's happening here so they take a suspect in the ... the the kids weren't heard it was a two hour standoff in the upscale neighborhood just outside of Florence South Carolina and they had a bullet proof\nVehicle basically that had to be used to rescue the wounded officers because demand had the kids inside for two hours they wouldn't say why they were serving a warrant they didn't name him or the wounded officers or give the conditions 'cause I keep digging into the still haven't found any of that we do know\nThe um officer who died parents Caraway fifty two Thirty years as a police officer and uh he died so he had a family terrible a terrible thing that that's for sure and\nUh it's terrible really in the ... that violence\nThings are leading people and violent directions for what we don't know the details exactly of this story but there is no story you can say that will make you think oh well yeah that's that's how sadly that reaction happened no no uh there is no excuse for ending someone's life there's no reason of course now\nThat's a you know where you just go after somebody whether they're a cop or whoever it might be kind of at that subtle not even subtle were at that mapping point right and I hate to just\nPlay into all of that but there he's right there are things that are unreported and if you knew everything that was reported boy you'd you'd walk right it'd be hard pressed not to be depressed over some\nOf what you're hearing that's
