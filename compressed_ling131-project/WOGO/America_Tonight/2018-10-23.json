Mexico now a hundred and forty five mile an hour at for storm will dive into that and that caravan that the president mentions\nThe caravan that as a supposedly swelling with more people jumping in from Central America making its way\nTo the border and one point six billion what would you do if you won one point six billion which of course you know Uncle Sam is going to take\nHis chunk so won't be quite one point six billion that will be a ridiculous amount of money and that's at mega millions just continuing to rise to the next jackpot\nIs going to be at least that and jumps past the twenty sixteen Powerball record which was the largest prize in us\nHistory so people are running out taking a couple of chances here and there\nAre you what the harm right plus down to the dollar or two you know whatever imagine the cash ... imagine what it would be like me and I'll tell you what would be like you would disappear in the middle of the night because everybody would want to know who you are

golden ticket so if it is just one person it could end up being a group of people it could end up being you know workmates where everybody chips in and they take a chance that the lottery because then the thought as you could get more quick picks more numbers\nAnd maybe have a better chance of that and we know that groups have won before or it could be a couple of different\nPeople from a couple of different states anyway it is pretty interesting to see how that has a swollen the amount of people that are interested the amount for the prize\nAnd the long lines at the last second All right speaking of a line immigration immigration immigration you know right before an election it always gets heated and there's always some things\nThat seems to happen right\nAnd this is it it's the caravan\nAnd the caravan could be halted if the president followed through with cutting off aid to the countries who the majority of people are from\nAnd that's what the president said he's ... he said that could happen and he also said he would send as many troops is necessary to the border to block that caravan of Central American migrants and said that the trick was really an assault on the country\nAnd ah he did an interview with USA Today aboard air force one and he just emphasize that look there are people from the middle East that are in the middle of this\nIn June just this past summer they launched his pellets ... digital app so for under twenty months with no bigger quip meant you've got all kinds of at home workouts boot camp strength you know training that kind of thing\nSo the c._e._o. Jon Foley thinks the remote classes have this big appeal\nAnd he's very ambitious about it right you know it's funny because\nJeff basis said at one point that he wanted to make it ridiculously hard for people not to want to have an Amazon Prime membership in fact I found the story about palate time which I knew about Palestine but the numbers I found in the recent edition of time magazine\nAnd the head of this telephone company said we're going to make an irresponsible not to have a pellets on membership\nBecause how cheap would that be if it's twenty a month that's less than a gym would cost you and a lot of people that are listening to right now you may work for a company where they are even giving you the cost of a gym so then you would get the cost of a\nOf the digital you know the ap but here's my question would you use the app right would you use it\nI I'll tell you this because so many people have asked me to say it again\nAnd and there's like five ways where you can get a hold of America Tonight one of them is Kate till any radio dot com you want to send us an email you want to tell me if you're doing the ... thing or you can belong to a gym or you just walk around in circles and you're out whatever it is you can do that by going there\nClicking on contact in sending me are\nYour thoughts but another way is\nThat I Believe in the sap stuff because you can download tune in ap\nBoom click in America tonight and everything you missed on America Tonight from the day before when you were a vacation or whatever you can download the shows right there I think it is so cool so for people who are fitness freak I can see how that\nWould be intoxicating let's put it that way I have a student loans Americans oh one point five trillion in student loans are shocked\nAre you shocked by that so common bond is trying to find a way to keep the cost down there using technology in facts of the refinancing rates substantially lower than what you're getting from most banks\nUm that you're borrowing from right they're saying they're saving an estimated twenty four thousand over the lifespan of alone and they're doing this one on one social mission for every loan they fun they pay a year of education for a child and developing nation wow\nThat's pretty interesting isn't it how about this\nGot a lot of numbers for this time around every dug around some of these numbers\nParking\nParking pain in the black where you are and you know what you can live in a small town and parking can be hard or you great at parallel parking I've a friend that claim she was like the world's best a parallel parking I guess where she's from Minneapolis not too far from where our studio is the mother ship GM\nBut she says she's had a park all over the place well anyway there it's it's interesting the way to find parking spaces is this thing called spot hero\nAnd it allows you to find and prepay for an office ... parking area and it's discount that a lot of times\nAnd in fact it's so popular spot hero that they've\nUh-huh and in fact it's so popular spot hero that they acquired another parking\nApp that came up parking panda and they've got like I guess access to five thousand garages and lots in the U.S [noise] so how do they stop other people from parking there\nI guess maybe they have certain lots where you can only it's got to be where you can only park using that\nBecause if I reserve a spot and you just happened to drive in there are we getting into a clash because every reserve the spot hold up a theme ridiculous so there has to be a way to close that often I Know when I was in Florida they had something similar to that\nAnd I thought that it was pretty I have to say I thought it was pretty interesting that you could you know you can reserve the spot that way and it seems to work\nBut it would still be something that you would have to get used to and how can we talk about numbers and not mentioned this again one point six billion I Know are you sick of hearing about the lottery every attorney would you do if he wasn't one point six billion\nWould you pay your friends mortgages would you\nBuy three houses around the U.S would you go to whitefish Montana and fly fish for the rest of your life I mean whatever so um it is one point six billion it is the largest prize in us lottery history\nAnd there are a lot of people who are lining up to plunked down a couple of bucks\nThinking maybe they could win\nYou know I'll tell you this I got a ticket for fun and I did get my two dollars back because I had the mega ball [laughter] but that is that right that's it nothing beyond that [laughter] so I don't think it's that easy to win\nThe conversation is um interesting let's put it that way\nI'm up to ... do you watch it do you like it you know are you an entrepreneur do you have an eye yeah for a product and you watch shark thing you think ooh what would that be like well I was just reading the story about um this tribute to a firefighter father that ended up\nPulling in one million in sales so um there were these three\nYoung I'm gonna say young inventors that it's really their fathers and mentioned but three of them were on shark tank\nAnd they said they were going to pitch it on shark tank because it was their fathers dream his invention it was a cup board pro it shopping board with the detach bull bull for easy clean up but he passed away before he did he had that chance to pitch it to the sharks or get on the show or any of that kinda stuff\nBut the company that produces shark tank Sony Pictures said Monday that with an Eighteen hours of the three kids as a firefighter it's really sad\nUm that twenty six thousand ... board pros had been sold worth one million in sales wow\nAnd they did show their father and a video demonstration of a product he was in New York City firefighter he was one of the guys who helped in the cleanup at ground zero after September eleventh\nAnd he died three months before the shark tank taping last may from cancer related to what they say was the nine eleven cleanup effort\nAnd the cup or pro has the insignia of all the firefighters who died on nine eleven you could see that the sharks were struggling\nTo keep a dry that mean they were show up so how 'bout that people were really affected by that and they got the um\nPrototypes and\nUm you know they talked about I mean you know they talked about their father dying and then they talked about their mother who also was diagnosed with breast cancer and um\nYou know that then she she died in twenty twelve and oh my gosh and they're just these yet in their twenties early twenties these ah three kids of theirs and it was an incredible story right so all five sharks\nCame together to help they offered a hundred thousand for twenty percent stake in the business they promise to donate to charity that help firefighters affected uh nine eleven and then poof\nLike magic one million dollars wow 'cause so many people were just pulled into that sad stories so I guess there's the there's the the happy ending up put it that way and then wrapping things up for we can count\nFor one dollar any size spry for one dollar where can you get that there's always some deal right Wendy's they say if you get a small medium or large order fries for just dollar [noise]\nAnd that goes for\nWrapping up with other things like their burgers [laughter] how many people are going to go to want to give me a fries for a book [noise]\nI stay with us [noise]\nHello I'm Mike ... the inventor my jaw and like

I spent a week with the border patrol and I saw what was happening with the people it was sad was happening for the innocent people and it was sickening the other things that were going on like these crazy rate trees\nBecause of the predators and how they went after\nUm some of the people they were supposedly aiding and getting across the border so anyway here's where we are now the Washington Post CNN the Associated Press another outlets covering this journey um\nAre saying that you know now\nYou know there there was a smaller care caravan before reach the U.S border earlier in the year and it just kind of fell apart so there were people that crossed the Guatemalan border into southern Mexico this weekend\nAnd they say 'cause there's reporters there in the middle of this that maybe they're estimating but maybe it's you know five thousand people or so and they say a lot of the people are fleeing poverty organized violence in their home countries all of that and they're traveling to gather\nAs they cross some of these areas because of the drug cartels and the gangs and they want asylum at the border or they're trying to cross into the United states illegally and it's this mass my migration especially pouring out of Central America so\nIs it five thousand seven thousand I mean whatever the numbers are this is something I think we're probably going to see happen more and more and here's what the president cautioned against when you talk about ah this caravan and the characters that could be mixed in [noise]\nAll right so of course he's getting on a helicopter but MS Thirteen\nIs he saying you're gonna find everything are defined MS Thirteen et cetera in the middle of this and now what it's become is whack\nA mole and they're trying to identify who could be in the middle of this is there's somebody trying to come through that could carry some bomb or do something at the border or just assimilate and get into the to the country 'cause we've heard those stories before it of course we know that it's um\nThat it certainly has happened and speaking of weaponry this is certainly a huge story\nWhen we talk about the um the Russians and the nukes and treaties of the past and\nExpectations of where they're headed and why they're not working and this is interesting because it was such a big piece of so many presidents\n\nSome things that I'm as a kid this is something that I Know that I had in social studies or whatever history where we would talk about reduction of nukes and what was happening on the other side and all that kind of stuff that we will jump into that but we're still in the middle\nAnd what the thoughts are on the caravan and is it an evil to push the people out how do we streamline this what are we did\n\nIn dancing around all the same issues let's go to John in Seattle Hi John\nHow you do it [noise] yeah I think this country has been pretty ... look ... years\nBelow mhm\nI hear you I Gotcha\nOkay okay I'm good I'm Out to be a point where\nYou know we were just taken more and more people should mean something you know a lot of people in this country are given a lot to uh [noise]\nYou know they've been kind of stuff that's gone all over the world and make life better for a lot of people devoted to places and I think there's a point we're\nA country as a\n\nWho they are what they are like I said I Do think we've been very jurors through the years\nLike I said I Do think we've been very jurors all through the years but you\nKnow what I was born there was thirty three billion people on the planet now there's one billion people on the planet [laughter]\nThis is just there's a lot of rising expectations all over the pilot and it still are cool you know there's just so many resources and so many ways to develop from the quality of life but you know\nI mean it's tough times yeah they've got a quick comment was you know pretty bad conditions I mean there's a point or citizenship [noise] us to be important as much as trying to leave the people suffering so what do you say\nJohn I think it's a good point thank you for the call it what I think is you're right we've come to that critical point again and why are we here John where here because of the reasons I said we have laws on the books they were completely\n\nSo GW tried to do that and there was massive up\n[noise] and and this was a guy spoke fluent Spanish Shen had certainly a decent relationship\n\nAnd it never we could never get this right we never could get it right\nAgain I think is because people would be infuriated than awful things started to happen and as you say then we would see that there it wasn't talked about a lot but\nDrained so the taxes will go up in parts of Southern California than we would find drug runners and tunnels you know the other evil side of it the gangs the the um\nHorrible side of the loose border I caught the loose border because I was with the border patrol\n... there was the easy part of getting people when they crossed\nInto El Paso from water as\nBut then there were this bars places\nThat were out in the middle of the desert where it was easier to get by but then so often they would find people that were murder that just would be dead bodies they couldn't even identify them\nAnd some horrific things have happened to innocent people on that side as well so\nWe'll we cut off the eight I mean this is what the president saying it's going to begin to cut off aid to countries that are in any way associated with the caravan so what does that mean that they stopped the people from going because right now there's so much corruption and places like Guatemala and El Salvador\nThey don't care or they were just people ... are sneaking out and whatever they're jumping on the trains doing whatever they can in this case it's a walk\nBut if they're not going to get money that I think they're going to do something about it but what does that look like what what form in other words does that take\n[laughter] and um I'll be curious to see honestly what what happens what kind of pressure is put to put on those governments and\nWhat they how they end up responding to to their people\nI don't want to make sure he squeezes and because I talked about you know talk about things getting in\nThings we used to worry so much about nukes that was all about you reduce yours will reduce SARS you take a few way we'll take a few like can they reach us can they not reach us I mean how many times was that discussion going on so the president is withdrawing from the intermediate\nRange nuclear forces treaty I talked about this\nOn our show the other day and just to continue the conversation I had a conversation with somebody they they thought it was good to push the issue because\nThey said listen is much different than we are talking about you know and applauding President Reagan and what he did with Gorbachev\nAnd that I N F treaty in eighty seven different times and they're doing things behind our backs meaning the food and regimes is continuing to farm up there not ramping down so\nHe's got to be put down with a whole new layer arsenal meeting this treaty is a no go ahead no go my friend bag next on ATM now\n\n[noise] ... I'm Talking with day George ... Lincoln rice lake ... like a job now dating this may be difficult for some people to believe but when it comes to ... not all ITT companies are good\nAt security that's exactly right correct a D.C ... we develop partnerships that are quite they depend on us to protect and grow their business as\nWe know that the threats to computers networks and Internet are growing faster and more dangerous every day\nThe bad guys simply are getting better faster than the good guys are getting good of those businesses need a team leader with character first passionately focus on keeping them safe within their id UCF newly 'cause your team partner cause he's seven seven\nThree to seven six three eight five or visit us online at\nBeautiful but are nothing like that now however at some point we have to stop the nonsense the insanity we just cannot support this we just cannot support the amount of people and we certainly can't\nUm stop everyone at the border because of the size that it's growing too whether it's five thousand seven thousand or whatever it is it's a mess that's for sure I think the president saying was holding money will make a big difference hopefully the innocence won't get caught up in the middle of this although\nI think they unfortunately well well yeah we were just talking about that and it you think of Honduras and etcetera and there are some horrible I mean I Can't even describe the conditions that I've been told that that are happening in some of these\nAnd some of these countries who remember we took the show to Ecuador and when I was there I had to have 'em guard with me the whole time and my brother was scared to death I he's like this manly man and he never worries about anything that I remember him saying to me proof of life and they'll think of you and they'll look at you as a talk show host and\nData them and I actually 'cause I was in some poor depressed areas and we brought that back to you how sad it was but in these cases I mean\nIt's true it's gotten that much worse so we are at that point because nothing was done before now we're at that critical mass point of\nOkay so I'm really what are the sizes but how do you make sure you don't have the worst of the worst in the crowd how do you ... the years\nUm is it an exaggerated amount of people that are storming the border is it bigger than what's being said I mean we're going back into the numbers game again and I can remember\nGosh at the beginning of America Tonight when that was the conversation how many people were in the country illegally how many how many how I Would just became like this almost like an episode of our we can count\nHow many and there's you know it's not a turnstile and that's the idea because we have no idea what the count is we don't we have no idea\nAnd the Democrats are struggling to try to figure out what to do about this\nUm because there's health care there's a myriad of issues that you and I care about and what do we always say you got to feed your family it's what's in your wallet it's what's going on with the economy is what's happening with your families\nAnd then the pressure that surrounds us with Mary out of this other\nOther horrible um things that are crippling us in many many ways that could have been taken care of but weren't I moved to another one this one is from Thomas and Thomas says\nHi Kate Delaney I just started listening to the show oh gosh probably about three weeks ago I Love the oh gosh probably about three weeks ago I Will say I download it from tune in to appreciate that because a lot of times I'm not a plate sometimes I Am up late sometimes I listen to it\nLive did you see the story about the air force spending three hundred thousand on coffee cups\nAnd the last couple of years I did see that I did see that they were talking about that the cups break pretty easily\nAnd that it's irresponsible\nAnd that they're spending that much on the coffee cups so somebody's needs to make coffee cup that doesn't break or is that the handles and break as easily so we don't have to spend thousands of dollars to\nReplace it [laughter] I guess um and this and seriously this is a true story\nBuying replacing special mugs because they can re heat liquids aboard these air fueling tankers and flight and then that's what the whole thing is so they\nThey have to figure it out and replace them so they purchase a bunch of the those cups that can do that\nBecause of how much it's costing frankly in the broken her hand I mean who knew right [laughter] even Chuck Grassley went nuts or to the about the air force buying a ten thousand dollar toilet seat lid for cargo planes\nAnd apart which the service um ... has\nSince done three the printing\nSo not happy with that either [noise]\nIt's a line items

about a hurricane yes there's a hurricane off of Mexico now a hundred and forty five mile an hour at for storm will dive into that and that caravan that the president mentions\nThe caravan that has a supposedly swelling with more people jumping in from Central America making its way\nTo the border and one point six billion what would you do if you won one point six billion which of course you know a goal Sam is going to take\nHis chunk so won't be quite one point six billion that it'll be a ridiculous amount of money and that's had mega millions just continuing to rise to the next jackpot\nIs going to be at least that and jumps pass the twenty sixteen Powerball record which was the largest prize in us history so people are running out taking a couple of chances here and there\nI mean what's the harm right plunked down to a dollar or two you know whatever imagine the cash opposition imagine what it would be like me and I'll tell you what would be like you would disappear in the middle of the night because\nEverybody would want to know who you are who doesn't want to know who it is like really want to go watch that movie it's like you have the golden ticket so if it is just one person it could end up being\nA group of people it could end up being is you know workmates where everybody chips in and\nThey take a chance at the lottery because then the thought as she could get more quick picks more numbers\nAnd maybe have a better chance that we know that groups have won before or it could be a couple of different\nPeople from a couple of different states anyway it is pretty interesting to see how that has\nA swollen the amount of people that are interested the amount for the prize and the long lines at the last second All right speaking of lines immigration immigration immigration you know right before an election it always gets heated and there's always some things\nThat seems to happen right\nAnd this is it it's the caravan\nAnd the caravan could be halted if the president follow through with cutting off aid to the countries who the majority of people are from\nAnd that's what the president said he's going and he said that could happen and he also said he would send as many troops is necessary to the border to block that caravan of Central American migrants and said that the trick was really the salt on the country\nAnd ah he did an interview with USA Today aboard air force one and he just to emphasize that look there are people from the middle East that are in the middle of this\nIn June just this past summer they launched his pellets ... digital at so for under twenty months with no big equipment you've got all kinds of at home workouts boot camp strength you know training that kind of thing\nSo the c._e._o. Jon Foley thinks the remote classes have this big appeal\nAnd he's very ambitious about it right you know it's funny because\n... pesos said at one point that he wanted to make it ridiculously hard for people not to want to have an Amazon Prime membership in fact I found the story about palate time which I knew about Palestine but the numbers I found in the recent edition of time magazine\nAnd the head of this telephone company said we're going to make an irresponsible not to have a pellets on membership\nBecause how cheap would that be if it's twenty a month that's less than a gym would cost you and a lot of people that are listening to right now you may work for a company where they are even giving you the cost of a gym so then you would get the cost of a\nOf the digital you know the ap but here's my question would you use the app right would you use it\nI I'll tell you this because so many people have asked me to say it again\nAnd and there's like five ways where you can get a hold of America Tonight one of them is ... radio dot com you want to send us an email you want to tell me if you're doing the ... thing are you even belong to a gym or you just walk around in circles and you're out whatever it is you can do that by going there\nClicking on contact in sending me are\nYour thoughts but another way\nIs that I Believe in the sap stuff because you can download tune in ap boom click in America tonight and everything you missed on America Tonight\nFrom the day before when you were a vacation or whatever you can download the shows right there I think it is so cool so for people who are fitness freaks I can see how that\nWould be intoxicating let's put it that way All right how about the student loans Americans oh one point five trillion in student loans are you shocked\nAre you shocked by that so common bond is trying to find a way to keep the cost down there using technology and sacks of the refinancing rates substantially lower than what you're getting from most banks\nBomb that you're borrowing from right they're saying they're saving an estimated twenty four thousand over the lifespan of alone and they're doing this one on one social mission for every loan they sons they pay a year of education for a child in the developing nation wow\nThat's pretty interesting isn't it\nHow about this\nGotta lotta numbers for this time around it really dug around some of these numbers\nParking is parking a pain in the black where you are and you know what you can live in a small town and parking can be hard are great at parallel parking I've a friend that claimed she was like the world's best parallel parking and guess where she's from Minneapolis not too far from where our studio is the mother ship GM\nBut she says she's had a park all over the place will anyway there it's it's interesting this way to find parking spaces is this thing called spot hero\nAnd it allows you to find and prepay for an off the street parking area and it's discount that a lot of times\nAnd in fact it's so popular spot hero that they acquired another parking\nApp that came up parking panda and they've got like I guess the access to five thousand garages and lots in the U. S. so I don't know how do they stop other people from parking there\nI guess maybe they have certain lots where you can only it's got to be where you can only park using not\n'cause if I reserve a spot and you just happen to drive in there are we getting into a clash because I've earned reserve the spot what about the same ridiculous so there has to be a way to close that often I Know when I was in Florida they had something similar to that\nAnd I thought that it was pretty have to say I thought it was pretty interesting that you could you know you could reserve the spot that way and it seems to work\nBut it would still be something that you would have to get used to and how can we talk about the numbers are not mentioned this again one point six billion I Know where he's sick of hearing about the lottery every ... what would you do if you won one point six million would you pay your friends mortgages would you\nBuy three houses around the U.S would you go to whitefish Montana and fly fish for the rest of your life I mean whatever [noise] so um it is one point six billion it is the largest prize in us lottery history\nAnd there are a lot of people who are lining up to plump down a couple of bucks\nThinking maybe they could win\nYou know I'll tell you this I got a ticket for fun and I did get my two dollars back 'cause I had the mega ball [laughter] but that's it right that that nothing beyond\nThe mega ball [laughter] but that's it right that is that nothing beyond that [laughter] so I don't think it's that easy to win\nI think the conversation is um interesting let's put it that way\nHow about this shark attack do you watch it do you like it you know are you an entrepreneur do you have an I. D. S. for a product and you watch shark thing you think ooh what would that be like well I was just reading the story about um this tribute to a firefighter father that ended up\nPulling in one million in sales so um there were these three\nYoung I'm gonna say young inventors that it's really their fathers invention but three of them were on shark tank\nAnd they said they were going to pitch it on shark tank because it was their fathers dream his invention it was a cup board pro at shopping board with the detach bull bull for easy clean up\nBut he passed away before it he had that chance to pitch it to the sharks or get on the show or any of that kind of stuff\nBut the company that produces shark tank Sony Pictures said Monday that with an Eighteen hours of the three kids at the firefighter it's really sad\nUm that twenty six thousand ... board pros had been sold worth one million in sales wow\nAnd they did show their father and a video demonstration of a product he was in New York City firefighter he was one of the guys who helped in the cleanup at ground zero after September eleventh\nAnd he died three months before the shark tank taping last may from cancer related to what they say was the nine eleven cleanup effort\nAnd the ... pro has the insignia of all the firefighters who died on nine eleven you could see that the sharks were struggling\nTo keep a dry that mean they were show up so how 'bout that people were really affected by that and they got the um\nPrototypes and\nUm you know they talked about I mean you know they talked about their father dying and then they talked about their mother who also was diagnosed with breast cancer and um\nYou know that then she she died in twenty twelve and oh my gosh and they're just these yet in their twenties early twenties these ah three kids of theirs and it was an incredible story right so all five sharks\nCame together to help they offered a hundred thousand for twenty percent stake in the business they promise to donate to charity that helped firefighters back to the nine eleven and then poof\nLike magic one million dollars wow 'cause so many people were just pulled into that sad stories so I guess there's the there's the the happy ending up put it that way and then wrapping things up for we can count\nFor one dollar any side spry for one dollar where can you get that there's always some deal right Wendy's they say if you\nGet a small medium or large order fries for just dollar [noise]\nAnd that goes for\nWrapping up with other things like their burgers [laughter] how many people are going to want to give me a prize for a book [noise]\nI stay with us they would\nWant to know what I like best about high school sports and I love watching my son ran in the field\nI Love seeing and smile and he finds his teammates [noise] I Love seeing his eyes light up when his team scores a goal\nI Love the fact that since he's been playing high school in the morning he's making better decisions [noise] and I love knowing that high schools Lawrence never been safer [noise] why\nBecause coaches had more information than they've ever had training techniques are more sophisticated and equipment it's never been more than ... high school sports isn't just saying it's still the best way to give your teenager healthy head start in life and that's something I really mountain\nThis message about the value of high school sports as presented by the Wisconsin inter scholastic athletic association and the Wisconsin athletic directors association\nPrivilege we don't post these letters on Facebook or any other social media you'll never see a sharing the private details or the letter between you and an artist and that's between the two of you we do however watch\nThose letters because can you imagine though was sponsored guilty of opening the world and such a delicate population\nSo we do have to watch letters to make sure that everyone is safe but there's nothing that would cause concern on either side so I had the privilege of seeing the letters and to watch you and then means communicate on such a wall\nIntimate safe level it's it it really it it it's you know leaves me without words these letters that of exchange hands they're they're really really beautiful\nAnd gives me hope this is one of the things ... the first time you told me this just literally left me speechless which doesn't happen very often by the way we're talking with Theresa Carrington she's the founder and CEO of ten by three it's ten by three dot org that's number tend\nTo eat by B.
