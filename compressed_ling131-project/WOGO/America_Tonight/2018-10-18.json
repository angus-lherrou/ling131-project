G.\nWith the mid term elections just around the corner political ads are everywhere but who spends the most money usa Radio's Tim Burke has the answer\nThe two thousand Eighteen midterm elections are less than thirty days away now there seems to be a lot of discussion as far as who's spending more money but Democrats or Republicans Josh homes as the former chief of staff for Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell he says by far and away it's a Democrat to spend more money no I wouldn't\nLet the great fallacy in American politics as if somehow the Republican Party as the party of big money I mean if you look at this election alone from the candidate level to the super back to the party committees or talking about a gigantic democratic advantage and in some of these races you saw like Texas for example of Baitullah roared here is almost\nForty million dollars that is completely unheard of for us a radio news I'm Tim ...\nIt was a celebration in the East Room President Trump presented the medal of honor to sergeant major John Kelly for his heroic actions during the Tet Offensive in Nineteen sixty eight the president said well serving as a governor resurgent Kelly brought us many enemy attacks\nEarly in the battle John's commanding officer was seriously wounded command then fell to John who quickly organizes men and lead them through the fight\nThe president said many

to discover the forest dot org brought to you by the U.S Forest Service in the ad council\n[noise]\nNow and the president said Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh was proven innocent confirmation battle hey everybody cage lady America send nights [noise]\nDivide is we saw\nThey say so the midterm elections are gonna be interesting I think it's going to be interesting to see what happens in the wake of the Supreme Court confirmation wow a crazy crazy wild few weeks there is no doubt about it\nAnd you've got all the justices sitting in the front row the White House in the East Room on Monday and the president saying he thought his second nominee to the court deserve better than the terrible pain and suffering and he was forced to endure\nHe said uh for his part Kavanaugh said he would assume the role with gratitude and no bitterness that was a really great response because it has been nothing but bitterness over the Senate confirmation process which was emotional contentious outrageous\nAnd a rip the country apart and this is far from over I think we're going to see many more protests are going to see some fallout from this or or not one of them is going to be Senator Susan Collins she certainly is on the hot seat the president mentioned Susan Collins\nAs somebody who was um\nSpot on basically in the words that she used when she addressed the Senate because she resolutely defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh both on his judicial philosophies and against sexual assault allegation\nAnd what happens now in fact she said because there there were donating terms that are well up over three million dollars I think now that were put out there saying that if she votes yes\nOthers I think now that were put out there saying that if she votes yes on Kavanaugh\nThe all those credit cards would be process so there was an active campaign against her\nAnd she said it was a classic quid pro quo in a violation of federal bribery law she said I think of our politics come to the point where people are trying to buy votes and by positions and we're in a very sad place she was on sixty minutes when she made those\nComments so a group of liberal activists began the campaign last month to pressure her she because they knew she was the key swing vote in Kavanaugh's nomination process and if she voted no like I said the donations wouldn't would be\nI Would not be taken for the donors the asked the pledges were processed\nSo now\nWhoever the main Democrat is in two years they'll get that money that's being raised and it's interesting because Collins'\nOn friday heading into as we can announce she would support Kavanaugh's nomination amid all these old allegations of sexual assault she said and concerns about threats roe v Wade with predominantly conservative justices on the Supreme Court\nSo after um it was all said and done now it's you know over the three million dollar mark like I said and this is still two years away that you know the bottom line is still two years away for that\nSo too early to tell if it will have that kind of an effect\nBut I look at what Michael's doing and I see that\nRed spot intensifying I look at that one hundred and ten mile an hour winds and I think man I Lived there\nAnd I'm Alone that Florida Panhandle I Am gone colored meat on\nCars a hundred and eleven miles an hour forget it says making landfall Wednesday afternoon or evening between Pensacola really in the far western panhandle it's looking like just south of Tallahassee the warning is so's severe and so worrisome\nThat the Florida State they've cleared the deck Tuesday through friday boom school is closed that the university's not as often\nBecause it's right where that can come Alabama Florida twenty river on there is what we're really looking at even parts of the Mississippi Alabama a border so it could produce some really\nTerrible debris storm surge maybe up to twelve feet some parts of the Florida coast and\nIts course and his wife they been declared a state of emergency to get out don't get caught off guard I mean I wouldn't sit on the edge I that's what I Do these people boarding it up they're smart I mean look you lose a couple of days you come back and that's the worst thing that can happen to the\nThe ... you know if you're gone you're gone at you can't replace life and then coming back and horrific conditions no\nThere's nothing there there's no power you can't get back in that would be awful I Hope it veers I Hope it dissipates but boy does not look like at a keep checking that map\nAnd it's not is that's not happening this this looks to be very very serious very very serious and then sadly what they're talking about as some of the places that were hit by Florence\nAnd they're being cleaned up and that was horrible they're talking about maybe some more flooding depending on the track of the storm it's not that they're not gonna get the hurricane force but they might get that crazy flooding that was a crushing and the first place in parts of the Carolinas\nSo that's a possibility\nIn New York they're not talking about hurricanes are talking about the state of limousine crash who the bad beat all the way around and when I say that it was because not the the limo driver didn't have the right license dilemma wasn't supposed to be on the road they failed to state inspection and as a result twenty people ended up\nDead on Saturday including too pedestrian in an area and I started to look at the map and I've been in this area because it's right by Cooperstown it's outside of\nUm Albany New York in they have these it's a beautiful area and there's these winding roads and they they're investigating it but the limos slammed into a park S. U. V.\nSo the people inside just killed four sisters died they just put the limit blew through stop signs slammed into the parked SUV everybody inside was killed and then the two bystanders\nDied as well and this was a birthday celebration so you had you know these young families young married that in their twenties in early thirties\nUm I I Can't imagine what they're going to have can they shut down this company this this company had um\nYou know it's crazy and looking at their background and they keep investigating this is the owner of this company has\nUm and they keep investigating this is the owner of this company\nHas apparently has a back story that includes\nUm a few tens as an undercover informant for the FBI wow and you know what the governor is saying and he's right is they had no business having missed on the roadway it's failed inspection they didn't have a driver who was fit to drive wasn't license to drive\nThey didn't have the proper insurance they didn't have all the things you're supposed to have\nAnd for the families it's about the loss of these young people's lives I mean wow there was a couple that gesture were married like four months to go ... [noise]\nIt's just an unexplainable thing and I like I said I Know that area I Know that area well up by um Cooperstown and that's what the deal was they were they were taking a trip to Cooperstown\nSo that's with the road was on the way to Cooperstown awful one of the worst stories from uh this past weekend you want an uplifting story how 'bout that adorable Barbara Bush I think one of the best pictures I've seen is the former President George Bush and\nHis daughter on his arm and they had a somehow they pulled it off they had a secret wedding where it was just the families\nIn I'm In Maine so\nA Barbara Bush walks down the aisle\nWith her father GW and our wedding which to Craig coins who is a screenwriter someone she met I think a year and a half ago or something like that and they did pull that off over the weekend\nAnd released a few pictures you know it was on a social media and what not cute pictures of her sisters little girls in all of that I'm looking at a happy as can be but um\nNo ... no big announcement snowed giant\nWedding none of that just the um private ... oh\nGood for them good for them that they pulled it off and it shows yeah time flies she's thirty six years old her husband I guess is thirty seven and she cofounded a public health non profit called global health corps\nSo her sister genna Bush of course they are like I said with her daughter's um\nThat that's just to me that was a cool mom and it was a cool moment because it wasn't ostentatious it was like how that was at that whole sort of under state of things we're not telling the media were not getting we're going to try to stay out of the eye of pop rock the and then we can have some pictures come out\nAnd they managed to do it which is\nWow shocking because it's so hard to keep keep anything is secret anymore\nNo you can't you can't keep a secret\nUm you can't you can't keep it to people can't keep secrets that just gets out there like poof someone somehow here's something and then before you know it it's um it's out it's the cat is out of the bag it that's it I'm I I'm\nYou know we're talking about these tariffs on China and we're to talk about that more during the week here on America Tonight\nBut somebody said to me every week and well what are some of the people that are getting hit by this besides there's some auto parts and you know what not and I guess one of them is because think of the things that are made in China dollar trade you're going to dollar tree with this ten percent tariffs on the two hundred billion dollars worth of Chinese imports\nThere's a place where they're getting hit because they're jacking up the prices what do you think for the dollar tree sorry because of the ... is the five dollar tree now five dollar tree you're still getting a bargain trust me but me\nThey've had to um pull things off shelves because of the higher costs they've had to\nRe rack a bunch of stuff that is about ten percent of their merchant dies which will be thousands of things household hell for food hardware electronics all that\nThey cause they'd have to push push it onto the computer or the consumers and if you have things that are between one and they cause one dollar and it costs three or less that doesn't fit with the the door\nSo you can't can't have them on the shelves\nAnd like I said five dollar tree is soccer he Confucius day right now while there's a terror if he's going to cost you more when you walk in these doors [laughter] we're renaming this tour temporarily don't\nBlame us [laughter] how's that don't blame us [noise]\nAll right do she did too really cool people you don't want to miss it that's coming up on the flip side\nWith me any here on average than I\n\nSometimes they'll live you need to upgrade from back clunker you drove in high school\nFavorite teacher from callers oh man upgrading is a good thing so if your house it'd be better to have one called rock and paid exterior sprinkler

history you and your lunch break\nFor [noise] sort of post the scope of the groups the mentioned [noise] to do much before the guards going\nMake that shit how do we get to the point where we're not constantly in the hunger war\nWell first of all just look at things object to the fact is every one of us is going to die so there's some basic questions we have to ask why do we die or are we here what is my purpose in life\nSo if you go back and look at some does philosophical questions and then look at the information that's available then you will come to the right conclusion of simple way to approach it as a psychotic you real please show me a real\nAnd he will do it just out of the sincerity of your heart\nReally just a simple ... complicated but it really is\nRight to say whatever is to show the belief and\nI think you're at a hundred percent right on that no question and talking about breaking it down but we're people are and we're the world had what's your biggest fear is people down in great what you're talking about the principles in inverted brain American spiritual and I wonder if they don't embrace that\nOne way or the right to not embrace it but once you believe doesn't necessarily mean\nFactual what you believe the truth is the truth because it is the truth it stands the test of time is going to be true regardless of whether you believe it or not for example the law of gravity you might not believing gravity but you step off the roof of a house you're going to get pulled to the earth gravity exist\nSo boy nutrients stands on it all Jews that you should know the truth and the truth show set you free and so in burner but America examines\nA lot of facts objectively so that people can come to the right conclusion is a witness to\nOh I Love that there is a perfect sentiment there's no question about what's been the reaction Dr Haley your book with the people you know and now they're even more word is getting out about it what's been the reaction kind of ease patents ... may\nWell a lot of people say oh man this stuff it stimulates should thinking it's true it's controversial [laughter] are all kind of you handled the controversial questions\nThat popular leaders try to avoid everything that's controversial homosexuality same sex marriage women pastors all these type of thing the Bible addresses that so I didn't write the Bible God wrote it\nHe created us he knows all about it and he put these things in place\nWe to function juice I came that you might have a life\nThat you might have it more abundantly we do things that go way there'll be less stress you're going to have trials because the righteous just suffer through many trials but he's there with us take us through the trials and we're supposed to make the other people who are not Christian jealous\nBecause they're going to see something different about us so that's how it works we live whole each without going to be perfect use all the one that was perfect and he wasn't kill other people in the Senate he was killed for who he was\nHe was a king and the Jews you God and it's like Emmanuel ... so that's just the fact that people got to deal with it one way or another people go out to deal with that issue who is Jesus you got to deal with that before you\nOr you leave the service is only two destination heaven or hell\nI Believe it or not that exists yeah I've done I mean let me show people do know that actually die\nBack in Ninety four Ninety five\nAt a major heart attack and when they were operating on me I came out of my body among the operating room looking these doctors work on my body and they wanted a dog so we lost and we lost and I'm no I'm right here I'm trying to get their attention but they didn't see me I'm like no I'm right here I'm right here\nSo that the separation of body soul and spirit is separation is not an elation that some religions teach a separation your your your spirit and so go back to its creator\nAnd your body goes to the great

it's virtually after they watched what has happened\nEarlier in this hurricane season even Florence with the floods because it's always the flood thing afterwards that you're worried about but this Michael past boy oh boy I mean it really is coming up through that panhandle\nAnd it could intensify so that's the thing maybe it's the cat three but couldn't ... shift to oh for let's hope not and then you're talking\nA little jump up and the wind\nMiles per hour you know a hundred and thirty a hundred and fifty something you got five hundred Florida National Guard members who are activated of course 'cause he got a plan the logistics of it all where you're responding words everyone being deployed basically when it happened and then five thousands more that are there so\nI mean is this happening fact\nSo fast so that means yeah that's why they're clearing the decks in 'em at Florida State because they know that this thing is bearing down quickly and it will strike that panhandle\nTuesday Wednesday really Wednesday it's probably who you're talking about a storm surge of about twelve feet for some of the Florida coastline and twelve feet and some of those low lying areas I mean that's that's deadly\nIs what that is so hurricane season it is I'm telling you it is unpredictable at times I mean predictable least that we have the watches and you can look at the different map thinks it's much different from those of you listening you get it tornado versus hurricane which is worse\nI mean it's almost a ridiculous question since I have been in both\nNot the worst of the worst with a tornado the aftermath of a tornado yes\nThe worst of the worst in the middle of a hurricane yeah right in the middle of a hurricane I experienced what that was like\nWhere you're basically trapped year in lock down\nSo I Love that too because then I was a kid so I looked at the evacuation really happen in people he them where we didn't used to do that wasn't quite the same thing it doesn't mean that nobody cleared out but not the way they do it now it's much much different\nSects from this hurricane\nInto this New York limo crash I mean the saddest ever and I ... it is one of the deadliest road accident in us history so anywhere you're listening to me were saying the deadliest you know why\nOh the accident in us history so anywhere you're listening to me were saying the deadliest you know why twenty people were killed it was over the weekend and I was watching one of the college football games and I thought it was a mistake I thought\nOh no they must means that people were injured and a couple of people were killed and now we're saying that stretch limousines killed Eighteen people in a limo to people\nWho were walking and it and that's twenty\n[noise] so uh I mean that's terrible and what happened was that the limo went through a stop sign and boom I you know unfortunately collided and killed the people that were\nIn the limousine and it was\nUm I mean obviously awful\nTerrible and when you when you start to look a deadly crashes and you see where that ranked I mean just the worst\nUp victims texted that dilemma we've been terrible condition minutes before the crash\nSo you had a serious surrounding that one of the victims\nThat killed everyone on board in terrible conditions limo and this was twenty minutes before that whole tragic thing happen or even the New York governor Andrew Cuomo said on Monday that the limousines\nDidn't have the this is what's scary didn't have the necessary federal certification to operate they held a state inspection last month how do you know that right his limousine company you look at it on Yelp or wherever are you asking about that are you taking into that now\nSo they're investigating it was a winding\nRoad about a hundred and sixty miles north of New York city and this was a birthday party at the uh Cooperstown brewery so two people were killed you had um\nThe people that were in this limousine you you had um husbands and wives you you had family members and their friends that were that were there and um\nThere was a tech the text message I just mentioned\nComplaining about the limo is because there was a last minute replacement after a buck tired to shut only group broke down because that's the first thing that happened I mean what\nAre you kidding me and then look at it I mean just absolutely a horrific because you know in their twenties in their thirties\nUm yeah really just really really\nOne of the biggest losses of life and and this is what the first responders thing that they've seen a long time and in just and then it says like that it's plans into to give it gives it further details on the story it's a dilemma ran a stop sign slammed into a park SUV and then the two people\nOf you know that halted uh before the crash that were standing there them they were hit so it's a\nIt's just awful and it does make you kind of think and I don't know why I got to say what are you doing if you order a limousine you're asking people have you know when oil company hey are they good uh-huh\nHey I'm One of the people say about them out there on time they get you know are they do they know if they they have a federal certificate\n... probably not are you looking for that kind of gives you pause to think okay if I'm putting a bunch of people\nIn his limousine [noise] you know maybe I got to ask a few more questions or find something else out about that\nCompany because those people were thinking that they're just thinking I gotta be kidding me this first we had this break down then we get in the limousine and this happens and then the worst thing hospitable I mean just absolutely possible happen All right we've just scratched the surface here in his first hour of America Tonight\nOther things that we're going to talk about include demand came to the baseball playoffs than uh football to talk about remember this week of course when I have another

calling to me would be the one\nSeat that it's right there in the middle east see what you had to say on sixty minutes I did I saw it she said and Heidi Heitkamp it's interesting because\nI Can't brisk is risk her seat as she is definitely she's a Democrat and I and a Republican area and she voted against Kavanaugh and Susan Collins who has a lot of voters who are independent and\nEspecially in Maine\n[laughter] she voted for Cabot off\nAnd there are people that are they've already built up the coffers for money to run against her and what not and I saw both of them on sixty minutes and I look I give him credit 'cause\nHeres what they both said in different ways that they they voted the way they thought they should vote and they weren't ... they weren't they weren't weighing the politics of it all is what they is what they said and Susan Collins\nSaid that that that she talked to Kavanaugh and the thing that she liked about Kavanaugh she felt that he was about the letter of the launch she felt like he would go by that because she's pro choice and meaning that weighing the law and the precedent and all that kinda stuff um\nAnd he said there ... there was no evidence there should there was not um there wasn't any evidence of of that so she couldn't go in that direction\nBut she certainly is bearing the brunt of a lot of of anger or having to have guards and her people having guards and her family being guarded\nBut at the same thing with Dr Ford I mean ridiculous like let's let it go especially in her case okay it's done it's over with his concerns and now they still can't go into their house I mean come on\nThis really I like I said we live in America we have different opinions give me a break right\nVery hard to um let's move on to something else because we could just go out this all night long or all show long anyway here's one from a Frank who's says\nKate it's so easy to talk about the whole cabinet thing but I Want to jump onto 'em something completely different horrible about that limo crash\nThe twenty people were killed and the fact is they failed their inspection and hey the driver wasn't even licensed\nWow I think there's questions we all need to act in the future when we rent the things that we don't find ourselves in a death mobiles\nUm yeah that's interesting because that's what I said I said I Would never I just wouldn't have thought\nOf asking I I wouldn't have thought cats as questions to be honest I hate to be naive I Would ask somebody about them out of their reputation I Know exactly what I Do but now I Know what I Would do if I was ever in that situation and by the way businesses right by Cooperstown where the baseball hall of fame is near Albany New York\nOutside of New York city I I mean I I guess a lot of rules were broken and it it it set up this tragedy so um they were writing and the two thousand and one Ford Expedition that have been converted into a limousine and\nWasn't expected and failed the inspections and wasn't supposed to be on the road to drive or needed a CDL a commercial driver's license with a passenger endorsement they didn't have\nThe limo company of course get nailed for this but it doesn't bring back all those people\n[laughter] I mean what are they going to say they in the company actually they voluntarily to their fleet off the road during the investigation\nAnd they're meeting with people et cetera and the NTSB is investigating if there weren't skid marks but there were rows conditions that were I guess kinda damp so they're saying that maybe that's a factor in

America send night\nHis ... we saw\nThey say so the midterm elections are going to be interesting I think it's ever gonna be interesting to see what happened in the wake of the Supreme Court confirmation wow a crazy crazy wild few weeks there is no doubt about it\nAnd you've got all the justices sitting in the front row the White House in the East Room on Monday and the president saying he thought his second nominee to the court deserve better than the terrible\nPain and suffering and he was forced to endure\nHe said ah for his part Kavanaugh said he would assume the role with gratitude and no bitterness that was a really great response because it has been nothing but bitterness over the Senate confirmation process which was emotional contentious outrageous\nAnd a rip the country apart and this is far from over I think we're going to see many more protests were going to see some fallout from this or or not one of them is going to be Senator Susan Collins she certainly is on the hot seat the president mentioned Susan Collins\nAs somebody who\nWas um\nSpot on basically in the words that she used when she addressed the Senate because she resolutely defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh both on his judicial philosophies and against sexual assault allegation\nAnd what happens now in fact she said because there there were donating ones that are well up over three million dollars I think now that were put out there saying that if she votes yes on Kavanaugh\n... all those credit cards would be process to there was an active campaign against her\nAnd she said it was a classic quid pro quo in a violation of federal bribery law she said I think of our politics has come to the point where people are trying to buy votes and by positions and we're in a very sad place she was on sixty minutes and she made those\nComments so a group of liberal activists began the campaign last month to pressure her she because they knew the key swing vote in Kavanaugh's nomination process and if she voted no like I said the donations would would be\nI Would not be taken for the donors the F the pledges were process\nSo now\nWhoever the main Democrat is in two years they'll get that money that's being raised an interesting calling\nOn friday heading into we can announced he would support Kavanaugh's nomination amid all these old allegations of sexual assault she said and concerns about threats to roe v Wade with predominantly conservative justices on the Supreme Court\nSo after um it was all said and done now it you know over this three million dollar mark like I said and it's still two years away that you know the bottom line is still two years away for that\nSo too early to tell if it will have that kind of an effect on\nSo too early to

school is closed that the university's not open\nBecause it's right where that can come Alabama Florida twenty river on there is what we're really looking at even parts of the Mississippi Alabama border so it could produce some really\nTerrible debris storm surge maybe up to twelve feet some parts of the Florida coast and\nIts course and his wife they've been declared a state of emergency to get out don't get caught off guard but that wouldn't sit on the edge I that's what I Do these people boarding it up they're smart I mean look you lose a couple of days you come back and that's the worst thing that can happen to you that's\nThe you know if you're gone you're gone that you can't replace wife and then coming back and horrific conditions no\nThere's nothing there there's no power you can't get back and that would be awful I Hope it veers I Hope it dissipates but boy does not look like at a keep checking that map\nAnd it's not is that's not happening to this looks to be very very serious very very serious and then sadly what they're talking about some of the places that were hit by Florence\nAnd they're being cleaned up and that was horrible they're talking about maybe some more flooding depending on the track of the storm is not good they're not going to get the hurricane force but they might get that crazy flooding that with a crushing and the first place in parts of the Carolinas\nSo that's a possibility in New York\nThey're not talking about hurricanes are talking about this data limousine crash who the bad beat all the way around and when I say that it was because not the the limo driver didn't have the right license limit wasn't supposed to be on the road they fail to state inspection and as a result twenty people ended up\nDead on Saturday including too pedestrian in an area and I started to look at the map and I've been in this area because it's right by Cooperstown it's outside of Albany New York and it's they have these it's a beautiful area and there's these winding roads\nAnd they they're investigating it but the limos slammed into a park S. U. V.\nSo the people inside just killed four sisters died they just bought the limit blew through a stop sign slams\nInto the parked SUV everybody inside was killed and then do two bystanders are died as well and this was a birthday celebration so you had you know the young families young married that in their twenties early thirties\nUm I I Can't imagine what they are going to to address how can they shut down this company this this company had um\nYou know it was crazy and looking at their background and they keep investigating this is the owner of this company\nHas apparently has a back story that includes\nUm if you didn't as an undercover informant for the FBI wow and you know what the governors thing and he's right is they had no business having missed on the roadway it failed inspection they didn't have a driver who was fit to drive wasn't license to drive\nThey didn't have the proper insurance they didn't have all the things you're supposed to have\nAnd for the families it's about the loss of these young people live I mean wow there was a couple that just were married like four months ago ...\nIt's just an unexplainable things now and I like I said I Know that area I Know that area well apply um Cooperstown and that's what the deal was they were they were taking a trip to Cooperstown\nThat's with the road was on the way to Cooperstown awful one of the worst stories from uh this past weekend you want an uplifting story how 'bout that adorable Barbara Bush I think one of the best pictures I've seen is the former President George Bush and\nHis daughter on his arm and they had a somehow they pulled it off they had a secret wedding where it was just the families in I'm In Maine so a Barbara Bush walk down the aisle\nWith her father T W and our wedding\nWalk down the aisle with her father T W and our wedding so we're to Craig coins who is a screen writer or someone she met I think a year and a half ago or something like that and they did pull that off over the weekend\nAnd released a few pictures you know it was on a social media and what not cute pictures of her sisters little girls in all of that I'm looking at a happy as can be but um\nNo ... no big announcement snowed giant\nWedding none of that just the um private ... oh good for them good for them that they pulled it off and it shows yeah time flies\nShe's thirty six years old her husband I guess is thirty seven and she cofounded a public health non profit called global health corps\nSo her sister genna Bush of course they're like I said with her daughter's um\nThat that was just to me that was a cool moment is a cool moment because it wasn't ostentatious it was like how that was at that whole sort of under state of things we're not telling the media were not getting we're going to try to stay out of the eye of pop rock the and then we can just have some pictures\nCome out and they managed to do it which is wow shocking 'cause\nIt's so hard to keep keep anything is secret anymore no you can't you can't keep a secret um you can't you can't keep it to people can't keep secrets that just gets out there like poof someone somehow here's something and then before you know it it's um\nIt's out it's the cat is out of the bag and that's it I'm All right um\nYou know we're talking about these tariffs on China and we're gonna talk about that more\nDuring the week here on America Tonight but somebody said to me every week and well what are some of the people that are getting hit by this decided there's some auto parts and you know what not and I guess one of them because think of the things that are made in China dollar trade you're going to dollar tree with this ten percent tariffs on the two hundred billion dollars worth of Chinese imports\nThere's a place where they're getting hit because they're jacking up the prices what do you think for the dollar tree sorry because of the ... a terrorist is the five dollar tree now\nFive dollar tree you're still getting a bargain trust me but me they've had to um pull things off shelves because of the higher costs\nThey've had to re Iraq a bunch of stuff that about ten percent of their merchandise which would be\nThousands of things household health food hardware electronics all that\nThey cause they'd have to push push it onto the computer or the consumers and if you have things that are between one and they cause one dollar Nichols three or less that doesn't fit with the the door so you can't can't have him on the shelves and like I said\nTo five dollar tree is Cory Confucius say right now while there's a terror if he's going to cost you more when you walk in these doors we're renaming this tour temporarily don't\nBlame us that don't blame us [noise]\nAlready been introduced you to to really cool people you don't want to miss is that coming up on the flip\nSide with me any here on average and\nYou're\nLike it if you only came to work a couple of times per month to get your kids wouldn't

built by today you'll find a friend and toys and Ford\nMake that shit how do we get to the point where we're not constantly in the hands of war\nWell first of all just look at things objectively effective every one of us is going to die so there's some basic questions we have to ask why do we die why are we here but this is my purpose in life so if you go back and look at those philosophical questions and then\nSatellite so if you go back and look at some does philosophical questions and then look at the information that's available then you will come to the right conclusion of ... to ... and say God if you're real please show me are real and you do it just out of the sincerity of your heart\nReally that's that's how we get complicated but\nIt really is right to say whatever is to show the belief and I think you're absolutely hundred percent right on that no question and talking about breaking it down now we're people are and we're the world is headed what's your biggest fear is people down in gray\nWhat you're talking to trace the polls in inverted rain American spiritual and I wonder if they don't even price\nThat right to not embrace it but once you believe that some necessarily mean\nAs factual what you believe the truth is the truth because it is the truth it spans a test of time is going to be true regardless of whether you believe it or not for example the law of gravity you might not believing gravity but you step off the roof of a house you're going to get pulled to the earth gravity exist\nSo boy bands on it all the Jews that you should know the truth and the truth show set you free and so and burn rubber America examines a lot of facts objectively so that people can come to the right conclusion is a witness to\nOh I Love that there is a perfect sense and that there's no question about that when the reaction Dr ... new book with the people you know and now they're even more word is getting out about it and the reaction kind of ... ... ...\n... a lot of people say oh man this stuff it stimulates should thinking it's true it's controversy oh [laughter] are all kind of you handled the controversial questions\nThat are true leaders try to avoid everything that's controversial homosexuality same sex marriage women pastors all these type of thing the Bible addresses that so I didn't write the Bible God wrote it\nHe created us he knows all about it and he put these things in place for we to function Jesus I came that you might have life that you might have it more a bond and like we do things that go way there'll be less stress you're going to have trials\nBecause the righteous suffer through many trials but he didn't know what is the take us through the trials and we're supposed to be make the other people who are not Christian jealous because they see something different about us\nSo that's how it works we live whole each without going to be perfect use all the one that was perfect and he wasn't kill 'cause he was
