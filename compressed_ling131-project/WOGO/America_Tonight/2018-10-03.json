E. or email signature or anywhere you do your bio or on social media you can say headache speaker on and then let your topic what you spoke on put your link the radio and so\nAll of a sudden it opens the doors and gains credibility unlike anything else but the cool thing is even if it only a small number of people wash your car\nWhen people hear you guys had a talk media today they have to let them have to listen to this person so yeah it it's a huge game change\nBoy that's a great tip right there we're speaking with a Korean pour a in his book is called the book of public speaking learning to speak and you said you've done this for sixteen years what's the coolest thing you've ever gotten to do and I know that's a tough question\n... is a tough question and I'll I'll I'll you know leave out a three Tatar talk because obviously that would be an easy answer if we just literally talking about it um so I Would say you know those are all the really big moment\nBut you know it isn't it weird because it doesn't really speaking at all but you know is is that true answer comes me right away is actually got to be a volunteer fireman for a day\nBecause a a client the meat while a person that um went to school same places me without one of my talk and then told me that he was that he worked for the fire fire ... fire man and woman to fire person training school\nAnd asked if I wanted to go through the process of what a volunteer fireman died and so he invited me ... process and I got to live that to me that was pretty exciting moment and again it wasn't speaking at the same time but it came from speaking\nWow very very cool what do you hope people take away from your book\nI Hope people take away that\nTwo things one speaking of tired of them a lot of people think and you know I I don't try to scare people out of it but I Want people to realize it's a little harder than people think and I don't mean just on the stage I mean building a speaking business but secondly I Want people to realize that no matter where you start even if you're the first and planning on the stage that almost falls off the stage ... they'll all be alert\nI've watched probably more speakers that were terrified\nOn a stage and talk more speakers that were terrified when they started who become amazing speakers than people that were naturally born to do it so I Hope people can read to that and the book and realized that stuff can all be learned and I can learn it too so that that would be my hope or take away\nI Love that and see because you're on these different stages one thing that happens you talked about being a volunteer fireman for a day and what an awesome experience that one but you also have brushes with fame because when we travel in near a different events a lot of times there are some celebrities\nThat are on hand and I know you've interviewed a bunch of them do you have a favorite one\nThat I get that question a lot and it's a hard it's a hard one to say a favor let's say interviewer person but I can tell you a and this is still probably a favor because of this reason but very memorable and in fact um there's two that stand out but one is a gentleman named Robin Sharma\nGrows amongst sold his Ferrari and pretend other international best selling book\nAnd I did the interview with him while I had to take and I didn't want to reveal that because I didn't want the interview to the capital and so I had to drink water to ease the Tuesday but the factor that uh you don't consider when you're drinking that much water is now going to need to go to the bathroom [laughter]\nAnd so the whole interview if you listen to what you'd never know that was kind of a win but at the same time I was pretty distracted in my head the whole time during the interview so it made it very memorable\nAnd then Jack Canfield the chicken soup for the soul creator it took four months to get that interview and there's a whole backstory as to how you would have had to do to actually make that interview come to life and get your work and so because of those reasons\nAnd both of those gentleman delivered and knocked out of the power because of those reasons those would be the most memorable and perhaps along the lines of among my favorite is well\nI absolutely love it that's cool very cool I Love the Tuesday thing that that had to be something sitting

conversation both sides of this conversation happening everywhere right\nThe latest greatest of their heads because like I said this that this is a song that we've been thing and now for a really over

this\nShouldn't be released and some people able to see this senior Republicans are pretty confident that the FBI investigation is just going to clear um exonerate cabin all the accusations of misconduct and they want to air that publicly when they push through for a final confirmation vote\nAnd certainly that makes sense normally they have to report would go into Kevin up back round file at the Senate Judiciary committee which is a treasure trove or pardon me a vault of information\nThat only senators and a select few of aids would have access to but growing number of senators from both parties say some version of the report or at least some remains to be made public considering its\nNewsworthy this Senator John Thune from South Dakota the number three Republicans said he expects that in these circumstances the report would be made public another Republican Tom killers\nFrom North Carolina who sits on the Judiciary Committee said he would have no issue with Lisa summary of it being made public so why don't we just explain what it means so people don't draw these conclusions they gather information is left up\nA task to draw the conclusion and so of course why not release it [laughter] I mean honestly why why not and we know the deal here we're talking about three people and I'll say it again because numbers are important we do a segment\nUsually a couple of times a week on numbers\nWe can cap so we know that we can count this there has to be a minimum fifty votes in the Senate to have Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court to swing votes our Senator Susan Collins from Maine Lisa Murkowski from Alaska both Republican Jeff Flake a Republican a force to Arizona\nAnd they're all reserving their final judgment on Capitol until the FBI finish the lean is that flake will lean in his direction and you know it's really about the other two saying one thing I don't know not really releasing their thoughts so it is a question of when they take the vote\nThe public will get access to this report I Believe it or the summary or whatever I Can't imagine\nIt won't be when the FBI investigative sexual harassment claims against now Justice Clarence Thomas by any of the hill the final report in lake\nBut NPR got a four page affidavit from hell in which the alleged years of harassment by Thomas and publishing the information and that forced the committee to hold a second round of hearings to address the accusations and then we know how it all ended up in the end\nSo Mitch McConnell\nThe Senate majority leader is signaling caution about all this saying that the senators will have access to it then reiterated and you heard it what he said that it will vote\nDianne Feinstein the committee's top them said that the report can't be released and said I don't know what's going to be in it and after that we'll find out\nSo they're going to be part of the senators want to be briefed by the FBI if they say at least twenty four hours before senators take a procedural vote to advance nominations there could be a weekend could be Saturday could be Sunday before we know you know uh again\nIt could be Sunday before we know you know uh again what what happened with this and then once he gets in I mean if he is approved and then you know the beat goes on but what if he is\nNot what if he is not confirmed and then what happens\nThen there is a list of course I mean there's always been a list as a list of people who are are being considered for that position\nAnd the list would be bumped up whoever the next name is on the list and there are certainly a slew of them we've talked about them in the path to who would that be\nAnd if you look since Nineteen eighty Supreme Court nominees were eventually confirmed waited an average about forty two days before hearing and Seventy days from nomination to confirmation\nSo the current justices on the bed so this great story and Washington Post about these numbers on an average forty eight days for hearing Seventy two overall though for Republicans keep the Senate in November they have two extra years to confirm nominees me\nUm [laughter] so oh a whopping\nHead of the Democrats represent a state that voted for Trump been twenty sixteen so if we're looking at the lean and where it goes and you look at the you look at the short list of potential nominees cabinet was the most conservative according\nTo some according to a specifically judicial comments based system because they do all this political science research and then they take into account these scores so they would put him up there as\nA more conservative and in the way it would you know he would lean\nBut what does it mean um if that doesn't happen\nAnd like I said to list is long and if you go by what judicial common base their system they put together Clarence Thomas would be the most conservative\nBrett Kavanaugh if he was in the Supreme Court justice would be second Sam Alito would be third to that and then you go on from there one of the um one of the nominees is Amy\nConey Barrett who also would be an incredibly\nConservative judge or there's Rainman Catholic who's on the list also would be super conservative the most leaning toward the middle would be Thomas Hardiman and they're all they were all on that short list of\nNominees and of course anything can happen in this\nFight over Kavanaugh's intensified there's confusion about the limits of the the FBI investigation and what were directed and um would he be confirmed if it showed he lied to the Senate and the yeah again it's a toss up\nI think it's a toss up at this point but I mentioned this the other night if I were crunching my own unofficial numbers I Would say\nYou know we've got thirty four days of thirty three days until election day we have Ninety One days until the new Congress and looking at this process\nJeff Flake to me I think votes for cabinet and perhaps Collins and Murkowski as well I say it's really sixty percent\nThat he gets confirmed forty that he doesn't so those are better off than some are giving or some are saying they think it's already a done deal but at least the process happened and I think that was the key thing\nThat has to happen here you have to have the process because then you can say you did the process we went to the FBI we did that the FBI investigated here's the they interviewed here's the conversations here's the witnesses\nAll of that\nSo then there's no gearing up and say what would you know we didn't do it we didn't we didn't do that due diligence on this thing to do diligence is\nTrying to be done now [noise]\nRight and is it long enough for the FBI investigation for you can't get that information out of the FBI and trust me I Try I Do have a friend of a friend this very type connection to the FBI and they're not saying much 'cause they don't want a leaky ship was put it that way we come back\nOn the flip side where you are thought as we go to

McDonald's killing and I was listening to the police officer testify on Tuesday in his murder trial for the shooting death of McDonald\nAnd he said he acted in self defense what do you think happened here well if I looked into my trial crystal ball I Would tell you it doesn't look good\nTo this happens it's time just flies it's happened in twenty four teams\nAnd McDonald's was Seventeen and the video is of course awful it I'm set off a huge conversation that was continuing about what's going on um\nYou know he what\nThen dyke said his his face had no expression and his eyes were just bugging out of it that you have these huge wide eyes staring right through me police were called to the south side\nThe night of the shooting on reports and suspected breaking into trucks and stealing radios that when they got there they saw McDonald with what they thought was\nA knife with a three inch blade\nThe police dashboard cam video of it showed 'em\nAnd he was that was forced by court order to may be made public\nShowed that McDonald it look like McDonald's holding the small knife was walking away from the officers toward a chain chain link fence when he was fired on the autopsy revealed that he had a um the teenager had did have a history of mental illness and had some PCP in his bloodstream\nThan take on the stand got emotional and tears were flowing had an hour long testimony and he said McDonnell raisins my from side to shoulder as he approached him and the and the other offers\nA ... you know something that police dash camera video doesn't show so that's the thing\nThe angles of video doesn't show any of that and the police officers saying it's the angle of it the thing that's what it is and um you know he opened fire within six seconds of getting out of his car\nI'm within one point six seconds because they have all the ballistics and timing of ethnic cetera he was on the ground and that was that he was gone you know he didn't never got up again so um and he fired at him\nContinuously sick teen shot\nSo what the ... the prosecutor is saying\nIs you he could have ended that the minute he hit the ground and he didn't and what he kept saying as he's called him continue to grasp the knife and he refused to let it go so um\nThat's what that was about and it's it's not looking good I'm for him it's not\nAnd it was a tragic event\nI'm terrible for the McDonald's family and it's really ignited a firestorm\nUm in in Chicago but elsewhere to about hey what's going on with this that's why we have this dash cam video and what do you think you see or what is happening and um the especially the sixteen shots but you know the point taken he hit the ground is on the ground\nAnd that's it but you keep on fire and firing firing so I Do think he's going to do jail time how much what happens I you know that I I'm not sure\nBecause of loves the what the rest of the evidence and they're using the prosecutors and\nYou know what you know what that I'm\n... tells us I guess\nAll right so here's another one this one is from ... new and Joe's says hey Kate um what did you think of Amazon and raising the minimum wage for their workers to sixteen

says others had follows suit easy for him to say when the money is just continuously blowing in um\nWell we're seeing that we're seeing in others other places depending on the date the worst thing that minimum wage number go up\nSo yeah I mean why do they\nDo that they need a ton of employees [noise] so that's part of the reason of raising that number keeps some of those employees\nThat they

as he was out and uh when he was out he made some comments about having I made some comments about Dr Ford\nAnd it's coming to maybe an end to this upcoming weekend whether or not judge Kavanaugh get confirmed as the next Supreme Court justice I everybody Kate Laney America Tonight so we're hanging out\nAnd we hang out you know I always say this left of left right of rights somewhere in between or you don't like to labor yourself anything you are always welcome to the party eight five five to six sixty to eighty three\nIf we were doing it on official pull of what I've heard from many of you on whether he gets confirmed or not using my numbers are accurate that there is a sixty percent chance that he gets confirmed I Would say I don't know we might be able to jump that up to the next couple of days\nI I feel like from what we're hearing for for what I'm hearing from people who I Know on the hill that flake is definitely leaning toward confirming and that Collins and Murkowski are playing it close to the vest but one of them\nMay as well confirm him and then that the numbers would add up no matter what happens with\nWhatever's going on um liberate them role of the going through their redacted ness of what in the FBI report or what can be released or what ... what would the public know and how do we debate the but it is up to the senator's that's it they take a vote wants to do goes\nThen that's what you got so I think\nI think that that vote does happen if we can and most people in Washington are saying the same thing barring I don't know something unforeseen\nBut it doesn't look like that doesn't look like doing anything unforeseen it's yadda yadda here's what you do we have this investigation we're only going to deep you know it was through so many people\nAnd then um that's it than we were then we move on from from there by the way speaking of moving on it's so interesting because the longest game in\nPost season for the cubs just wrapped up the national

was tied up in the eighth hobby biased with they run scoring double but in the end it doesn't matter because um\nIt doesn't look like it doesn't look like it so probably we have our next Supreme Court justice if not there's a short list and some others that would\nAnxiously love the jumped into the middle of this re well maybe not love would love to have a shot at being a Supreme Court justice that's for sure 'cause there's no higher on her I think when you get a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land and you've been a judge and this is your profession and you get tapped for that\nDecision that forever stand or can you know ultimately\nMoved the needle and all kinds of directions I mean it's the wow it's the mind blowing and you know we've got three branches of government and boom you'd be on the Supreme Court that's a huge huge honor go out to Graham Graham\n[noise] you\nKnow calling in about a a yeah I was calling in about your interview of Steve Forbes I Know it's

[laughter] you're right okay\nNow if we do go to Bob biblical term risk you'll find that even in the Bible it tells you that the tribes do better\nAnd ten percent that's based in math I think the thing you should say was the IRS all these ... and everything because most idiots have ten fingers and can't do math with their fingers\n[laughter] yeah that's true [laughter] can't do the right\nWhy not just make it a flat tax because the world from giving\nBack to the workers will come back and grow better and stronger and faster because hey face it it's just like with for if you create more workers you create boring ...\n\nThat's true you create more income that way either you literally\nThese economists and ...

that sounds cruel arena right ... yeah right through the town square yeah crazy [laughter]\nI just had to make light of it because all the stupidity here just makes me laugh stuff but it's serious though to assert the great so you got to\nTravel you know you're right you're you're right Meg very serious and very theories and it's an\n... in and you don't realize and here's the thing the the idea of the impeachment I don't see that happening at all I mean I there's I don't know that happening it's not going to happen it's just conversation is conversation that is just it can rattle around the box it's not it's not happening I'd be done that's not happening\nIt and let let me ask you up 'cause you're probably a little too young but in the seventies they had a lot of senators that we're getting caught at chicken ... you know what I'm Talking about\nYeah yes yes a lot I've seen lots of documentaries on you're either going to write about a lot of movies yeah yeah yeah absolutely they were not they were caught with ... and ...\nThat that was done to them there still are [laughter] yeah yeah they're doing all the pollen political skiing not yeah we're really punished for it they think they may have got a war on and hand slapped another the sick as a disease\nOf uh or or just you know the flat out saying that grab the these people it's crazy it's just like I Know for sure but I I Know\nI Know too much that's my problem [laughter] where\nAre you know you and I are like that when you know you're much it does it does really pain that differently you're right\nYeah yeah because sometimes you got to buy your town\nYou got to bite your tongue you used to let you just heard somebody go on when they have no idea when they they haven't been through they haven't studied that they haven't looked at it they don't pay attention yeah we have that are still ... show hand\nWell you know that but there's so many common or is it are so naive yeah you know I mean that's the problem I have a living here in this state is that I have a day of the people you\nKnow just because I knew somebody they knew somebody who knew somebody from the south here in the south don't make bag at the same and you know and that's the problem [noise]\nOh we had a whole bunch of Democrats that her Republican over not back in Seventy year writer Nixon's period yeah\nAnd and the families are still carry through that's why I have a hard time trying to speak about anybody\nOh now I Do want good politician and he was a Democrat but yet they were still they got rid of that was James Taylor\nAnd he never cry Adler there they were but they\nYeah they pretty much a stand on him doing anything [noise] but well I think he did do sit\nOn the uh [noise] I'm trying to take military committee is not a cat and he maintained angles and oh a lot as a Terry walking places that they want they want to shut down the hill\nAnd he was and he was a lot of he grammar running out of time but

ever done and so it is really a big deal because if you were a business owner I mean you can't talk about your business during your car but people think you have a really resonate with your talk at the same time you can also list or talk all kinds of places to build your own\nAt the same time you can also list or talked all kinds of places to build your own credibility by email signature or anywhere you do your bio or on social media you can say headache speaker on and then let your topic what you spoke on put your link to your radio and so\nAll of a sudden it open the doors against credibility I like anything else but the cool thing is even if I only a small number of people watch your talk when people hear you got to talk of media that they have to listen to listen to this person\nSo yeah it it's a huge game change\nBoy that's a great tip right there were speaking with a Corey pray and his book is called the book of public speaking learning to speak and so you said you've done this for sixteen years what the coolest thing you've ever gotten to do and I know that's a tough question\n... is a tough question and I'll I'll I'll you know leave out three data stock because obviously that would be an easy answer if we just literally talking about it um so I Would say you know those are the really big moment\nBut you know it isn't it weird because it doesn't relate to speaking at all but you know is it true answer comes me right away is actually got to be a volunteer fireman for a day\nBecause a a client the meat well a person that um went to school St places me without one of my talk and then told me that he was he worked for the fire fire ... fire man and woman person training school\nAnd asked if I wanted to go through the process of what a volunteer fireman died and so he invited me process and I got to live that to me that was a pretty exciting moment at again it wasn't speaking at the same time but it came from speaking\nWow very very

it but I Want people to realize it's a little harder than people think and I don't mean just on the stage I mean building in speaking but secondly I Want people to realize that no matter where you start even if you're the person sweating on the stage that almost all the stage\n... they'll all be alert I watched probably more speakers that were terrified\nOn a stage and talk more speakers that were terrified when they started to become an amazing speakers then people that were naturally born to do it so I Hope people can read to that and the book and realized his stuff can all be learned

know that was kind of a win but at the same time I was pretty distracted in my head the whole congregate are made it very memorable\nAnd then Jack Canfield the chicken soup for the soul creator it took four months to get that interview and there's a whole backstory as to how it would have had to do to actually make that interview come to life and get your heart and soul because of those reasons\nAnd both of those gentlemen delivered and knocked out of the power because of those reasons those would be the most memorable and perhaps along the lines of among my favorites is well\nI
