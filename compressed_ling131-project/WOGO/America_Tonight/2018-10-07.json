I used to call Donald during the cap and of course I called Mr President\nI I'd say you know I don't agree with you on that I think that there was a pretty good thing\nA ... so you you said that this isn't you know your your introduction was it looked like we have and improve NAFTA and I I think that's a good way of putting it you know uh [noise] you know NAFTA needed to be updated it modernized I think the president was right about that I disagree with them that this was the worst\nBe updated it modernized I think the president was right about that I disagree with him that this was the worst trade deal ever in fact I think it was good for all three countries but it it it'd be come out of date there were some abusive practices that were happening by the Mexicans in the community I mean you you are Donald Trump many times talk about the\nBorder to three hundred percent terrorists that American a dairy products\nOr he had a very funny line in this speech by the way of the rose garden you said at now those are those Canadians are going to buy or ice cream [laughter] you know which I think it was a good thing but I I was this is a good thing for the whole continent it's a better deal for American companies\nAnd ultimately what this does I think the bigger story yet is that you know this president who's six months ago or a year ago people\nWorried I was going to create some kind of global trade war you know is an interesting Michael but now he's first she got that failed deals with Mexico and now he's got the deal about what that looks like he's going to guess you'll do with the Europeans are\nIndeed a national out of town in Rio\nReacting to South Korea and Japan and it's like these dominoes falling and the irony here is this quote protection as president and I was worried about this with Donald Trump that he would pursue protectionist policies\nOr you know at the end of the day we may end up with freer trade than uh than more trade protections policies ... with the exception of the steel terrorists which I still think was a mistake\nOkay a lot of people are saying that part of what President Trump is doing is trying to settle these less important trade dispute\nThe ones that are all in the low hanging fruit that he that he can settle a so that he has more leverage to get tough with China do you buy into that thinking\nTotally yeah I think that's exactly what he's doing and you know it was very interesting his speech that people get a chance to if you didn't see it live it was beautiful day by the way and and and the rose garden that was a nobody five degrees and beautiful day Trump got up there he spoke for about an hour and a half he talked about when I talked about the trade deal he has some ah\nKnow back and forth with the process which was retrospect I'm just as an aside may say Michael that you know I've been to many press conferences over Thirty years um I I've never seen the kind of abusive treatments that the the meat you know these young punk kids they're twenty five or Thirty years old\nAnd the way they're so disrespectful the president I don't have a problem Michael or you know if someone from media asking the president of a tough question that's why we have to be asked the president tough question but it's not the tough questions the manners and they just rip\nWith contempt and he started out that press conference by saying okay wait a first question was what Kevin I said look\nI'll take Tylenol questions but we're here right now to talk of the\nYou know the trade deal so are there any questions about the trade deal and he said after work I'm Talking about the great deal then I'll take questions with Kevin next person resurrect what Kevin extra what about camera or you I was just outrageous and and uh\nAnd it just bothers me let's treat the price of the United states with respect and some dignity I mean he deserves it and I look I didn't always agree with with rock Obama in fact I disagree with most of the things he did but every time I saw him I was always sir and Mr ...\nAnd it just isn't happening that hate that\nAnd I and I think most Americans do and I'll I'll tell you another thing I I Do not think it's going to work for the Democrats this huge article and honestly it's like reading more in peace it goes on and on the New York times\nThe New York times at the our team thousand words I mean it's a lot of war is basically the theme is President Trump didn't make the money on his own he got all the money from daddy and secondly ah both Trump's both father and son cheated on their taxes why first of all why do you think they decided to spring this right now\nI don't know why they did it right now I was on CNN last night commenting on the show I I didn't I didn't make it through the ... fold 'em any more to say was Thirteen to ... thousand uh it\nWas it ... I read a lot of it I didn't make it through the whole thing I had a couple impressions I made this point on CNN last night and I'm ... and by the way they really beat me up out of the first point I

your tax burden and is there any American in the last fifty years has been it by the Iraq War than Donald Trump\nOkay but here's the question why won't he release his tax information he he's been very resistant to them I guess about this article is it's an attempt to try to force him\nTo make some disclosures about or his taxes and if if he doesn't that'll be a reason they're campaigning for Democrats the Democrats will force out the tax returns what do you think\nYeah once again you roll one hundred percent correct that's exactly what this is about and that's what you know the CNN uh Chris Cuomo asked me about last night as well why won't Trump\nOr release his tax reforms I advised Trump among many other people during the campaign do not do not release your tax for us because if you think this report with with thirteenth I they they did Thirteen thousand words they don't even have\nYou know a lot of the tax documents this man who has you know warehouses full of ... tax

the author of the new book what the hell do you have to lose Trump's war on civil rights\nAnd um we were speaking um before about basically okay a\nOne you question polls that show the president's approval\nRating I'm a strengthening and I'm I'm In improving particularly among African American people\nAre but if you were to advise the president about how he could bring the country together could improve his standing of and service to the black community will be the first thing you tell them\nWhere I think there are number one thing would be economic\nSo you know the president whenever there's a charge a racial in fact if you were just outright racism in terms of his language is tweeting or his policies\nHe says hey what are you talking about historic low black on employment but you know again\nHe doesn't say that in fact most of that took place under President Obama and then he doesn't mention that you have twice the level of unemployment among blacks if you have a white but what I Would say to him as let's look at the policies\nBecause as I was saying earlier Michael the number one achievement of the civil rights movement to me is the growth for the black middle class in this country\nAre you one thing that support continuing growth that black middle class you do not want to destroy\nPrograms intended to help black entrepreneur you don't want to destroy community development program or you don't want to go after people who are in middle management terms of limiting their ability get overtime pay you don't want to diminish efforts\nTo try to get people into better schools by saying oh we're opposed to all affirmative action even when we know that gosh\nThere's a tremendous history of people being\nHeld out of school you you got you can't do that and then expect people say oh yeah we like Mr President because your program every offensively directed at damaging their ability to get a foothold\nOkay just to just let me finish with\nI spoke to earlier about the growth of the black middle class are tremendous story\nBut they're still remain is not only twice the unemployment rate for the huge gap in terms of wealth between black and white for even black than moving up there still striving to achieve or to a crew that kind of wealth that exist in black and white America with your stocks bonds real estate savings and the rent\nExist in black and white America your stocks bonds real estate savings and the rest\nOkay but we eat you say rightly and and I think we can agree completely on this that there is a great on the whole story of black economic progress\nNot all of that is because of government programs in fact most of that and this is something the syringe terms of documented and I know you're aware of their work because you said it is a that Steven an avid Stearns drum of of of shown that a large part\nOf the black economic progress occurred before the civil rights revolution help to set it up and then it continued and and gathered steam and gathered momentum because of the civil rights bills but you're not you're not trying to say that a black progress\nCan only continue with a a government programs are you\nKnow I I don't I I'm certainly not saying that in fact I think what Abigail and Steven third from her shoulders and it was a different era because then you had\nThe black community you know much stronger in terms of everything from its own baseball leagues through its own newspaper's general who were segregated society but in terms of\nHow they could then black business prosper and grow a it was limited or air and curtailed I mean there was a it's a it was a segregated society and four and a government and backing 'cause that's bigger Beijing and obviously violence in places like ... where we're used to estimate that black\nEconomic growth and black or business\nBut what I Am saying is let's not be in their right to the idea that if you look at the white middle class in this country are so much of it was built behind things like the GI Bill behind things like giving aid to mortgages so that people could buy homes in this country and don't forget\nAgain GI Bill job training educational opportunity after World War two and that was often gone again August segregated basis\nSo I mean government has a role to play but that's not going to the it seems to me the be all and end all in terms of economic empowerment is Jeff that you don't punish people on fairly\nAre looking at and I I think I think every every all people of goodwill should certainly agree on that and speaking people good will you played a courageous role during the Clarence Thomas\nConfirmation fight in in defense of Justice Thomas and and I knew you were a supporter of his confirmation I'd do you think that history is repeating itself to some extent in terms of the\nThe kind of attacks that have been ... level the judge Kavanaugh\nWhere I think it's quite similar in terms of you know somebody leveling a charge against the nominee and the comics case it was a ... hill and\nYou know it was very slow to come out but then the committee the Senate Judiciary committee looked at it privately they missed that she wasn't ... put her name to it and then it got leaked and then it came out so it's very similar because look at professor forward she sent a letter to a congressman ... many makes its way through guy and Feinstein\nAre and then her name is Lee or she does the interview with the Washington Post ... ...\nDoesn't think similar to me is the level that charge I don't think that anybody that uh you're Clarence Thomas ... on a better\nYeah but as a one there's a difference of cuts and the other direction the charges against Clarence Thomas had to do when he was head of the equal Employment Opportunity commission he was a government official and he was already yellow graduate the charges the core charges against Brett Kavanaugh has to do with when he was Seventeen years old\nYou are but I think that the larger issue here is ... character for someone who's going to be on the highest court in the land\nAnd that's where I think he's open themselves to his critics and I wish you hadn't done it because you know the whole presentation of himself as a urging a choir boy he's going to a bookish be was and then ... all experience like this guy was a big grin and he loved to party is don't count\nOkay wait a minute if you were a U.S senator and who knows you may be some day I don't really\nMind it therefore will particularly if Washington D. C. becomes a fifty first date which probably won't happen but not even\nA one um would you vote for ... confirmation no not at this point\nAnd the main reason would be because of the way he presented himself as the hearing\nYeah I think especially last week when he went off even\nMaking all sorts of suggestions or got Clinton conspiracy theory again and the Democrats are I'm thinking wait a minute you're ... you're trying to be a judge on the Supreme Court you're displaying a tremendous lack with a permanent\nOr don't you think given given the amount of money that was spent by George Soros and other than it's well known and it's now come out to the\nThose two women who corner Jeff Flake in the elevator or actually operatives of this open society project which is a Soros project or sometimes they can can you well ... unfortunately I think we are\nOut of time of the book doesn't have anything to do is Brett Kavanaugh but of course\nAt the moment that is it an issue that seems\nTo touch almost everything the book is called what the hell do you have to lose its claws subtitle is Trump's more on civil rights Juan Williams of Fox News always appreciate talking to you and come back again soon we will be right back with your calls in comments coming up so Michael ... that show is the leader of the pack on W O O G o\nPeople get the quake start which covers for three whole weeks adjust Ninety five cents a day people who get that quick start eighty percent get he put logged on six eighty W O G O eight\nTiny one I Can't sleep do you mind if I put on who might not sure [noise]\nSo much matter [noise]\nIt's hard to be without your bike to do something easy and protected wood grass a motorcycle insurance and when you ride with us for ... years about an accident we won't catch your first one against you no matter how much it costs progressive dot comical today are going to catch the insurance company in a valley it's actually ...\nMariel to here in today's world violent crime can victimized anyone at any time what is your time will you be able to protect yourself and your loved ones for my personal\nProtection I attended a training at front site the world's premier firearms training facility located near Los Vegas and through our personal relationship with ... founder\nAnd director Dr Ignatius Piazza we've arranged for you and your family to train there to free of charge\nThat's right it's true it's free on your computer browser inter front site dot com slash wary to secure a two thousand dollar for day defensive\nAnd gun course absolutely free of charge with no hidden surprises for catches your front site dot com slash Larry and if you're first course that front side you're going to leave with skills that surpassed Ninety nine percent of the gun owning population guaranteed nobody does it better than ... but you must act before\nThese free courses or all taken secure your free for day course at ... dot com slash wary that front site dot com slash wary\nDoes your dog it scratched tinker shed like crazy come to die for our border\nAnd Ninety Days supply of dynamite dying to fight for life\nPick up to to the darker sides get the third to free government to treat lavender dog with such shampoo made with all natural ... aloe great for healthy skin and soft shiny counts but no itchy harsh chemicals ... rent the way try darker sides by to get one free at dynamite dot com\n[laughter]\nYour local volunteer fire department routinely answers the call whether it be a fire traffic accident forecast stuck in a tree but because of declines and memberships departments have become understaffed\nTo your local volunteer fire department is desperately need you and your direct traffic it's all a smoke alarm health at a fundraiser matter what skills you have you can make a difference you don't have to fight fire to be a volunteer and do you answer the call for more information on how you can help visits a volunteer firefighter alliance have support via fade out Oregon\nIs your office embarrassing\nOver their business interior specializes in ... old offices optimizing base you have\nAnd showing off your dissing style mall well staying within your budget and if your business is moving vacant ... or corporate campus over their business ... years well wow\nYou had your clients every dime that door open wishing the best of luck to fall or high school athletes Airbus as inferior to stop it or see their worst easy business interiors\nDot com aces advice with the how the hardware celebrate the grand opening of Jacobson the hardware on ... street in old boy are beautiful eight inch bombs three four twenty four dollars\nFeed the birds with a twenty pound bag of wild bird food just three Ninety nine for the yard ...
