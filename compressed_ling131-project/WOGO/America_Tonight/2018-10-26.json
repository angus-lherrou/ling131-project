the bat we're to the former congressman from Ohio from TOP Media news Bob Ney Bob what's the latest what's the FBI thing\nKate what they're saying is that there's a belief that the bombs were mailed from Florida for some reason they're focusing on that number two\nI think you could discuss this a little bit\nEarlier this week it seems that the same person or group which whoever's behind this has the snow we could have a copy cats that would come out this week that happens you know what type of Bush the\nCases but they're the ones so I think tend to be the same person or group\n\nAnd yeah and I I I think my feeling is with the kind of forensic that that the FBI has been the accidents they have they're going to find out who mailed the bombs do you think\nI'm with you on that I think they're going to find out you know it's like when the anthrax came to the capital was weaponized it was great cover to find out to this day who said that for example if it's a crude which these bombs are deemed crude\nTo evade than most likely somebody's more apt to make a mistake then you somebody that's got to high tech bomb and you know has a lot of this occasion to themselves to be able to hide

Asian ... years back they blocked border Sandy San Diego for poor people you come across and then um you know one or two that George Bush did to the president\nWe'll come across and then um you know one or two other George Bush did for the president right now I think is going to send about eight hundred and some troops to be federal the states can send the national guard but only when they decide they want to you know so the president have to\nUse for regular military and he's going to the executive order we don't completely know what's in it because he says he's not going to reveal his plans you know ahead of time [noise] kind of interesting\nYou know we have a a lack of immigration reform and laws\nSo the president's actually he has to make an executive order\nTo do this which is kind of interesting that he he's got to do that you know to protect the border he's going to be very aggressive on this\nAnd of course this is going to let's face it besides the human policy to this Kate
