on your Tuesdays hours with butter storms possible heavy rain again I around sixty three more heavy rain for Tuesday night and a low temp around fifty one\nWay of saying hey\n\nYou want to keep your car running better longer here's a few tips from Bob Adam's Adam's automotive center in Oakland where\nMost of the changes come with an inspection that will catch a lot of small detail things that should be taking care of immediately our job is to make sure the customers informed them any issues with their vehicles we always informed more we see at that point is always the customers decision\nDo in your view on your way with that and\nUm [noise]\nIt's over now and the president said Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh was proven innocent and that confirmation battle hey everybody hates Laney America send night\nDivided we saw\nThey say so the midterm elections are going to be interesting I think it's interesting to see what happens in the wake of the Supreme Court confirmation wow a crazy crazy wild few weeks there is no doubt about it\nAnd you've got all the justices sitting in the front row the White House in the East Room on Monday and the president saying he thought his second nominee to the court deserve better than a terrible\nPain and suffering and he was forced to endure\nHe said uh for his part Kavanaugh said he would assume the role with gratitude and no bitterness that was a really great response because it has been nothing but bitterness over the Senate confirmation process which was emotional contentious outrageous\nAnd a rip the country apart and this is far from over I think\nWe're going to see many more protests are going to see some fallout from this or or not one of them is going to be Senator Susan Collins she certainly is on the hot seat the president mentioned Susan Collins as somebody who\nWas um\nSpot on basically in the words that she used when she addressed the Senate because she resolutely defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh both on his judicial philosophies and against that sexual assault allegation\nAnd what happens now in fact he said because\nThere there were donating terms that are well up over three million dollars I think now that were put out\nFor ... million dollars I think now\nThat were put out there saying that if she votes yes on Kavanaugh\nThe all those credit cards would be process so there was an active campaign against her\nAnd she said it was a classic quid pro quo in a violation of federal bribery law she said I think of our politics come to the point where people are trying to buy vote them by positions and we're in a very sad place she was on sixty minutes when she made those\nComments so a group of liberal activists began the campaign last month to pressure her she because they knew she was a key swing vote in Kavanaugh's nomination process\nAnd if she voted no like I said the donations wouldn't would be I Would not be taken for the donors the F the pledges were processed\nSo now\nWhoever the main Democrat is in two years they'll get that money that's being raised and it's interesting because calling\nOn friday heading into the weekend announced he would support Kavanaugh's nomination amid all these old allegations of sexual assault she said and concerns about threats to roe v Wade with predominantly conservative justices on the Supreme Court\nSo after um it was all said and done now it's you know over the three million dollar mark like I said and this is still two years away that you know the bottom line is still two years away for that\nSo too early to tell if it will have that kind of an effect on a senator Collins\nBut I look at what Michael's doing and I see that\nRed spot intensifying I look at that one hundred and ten mile an hour winds and I think now I live there and I don't want that Florida Panhandle I Am gone color me on\nCars a hundred and eleven miles an hour forget it so making landfall Wednesday afternoon or evening between Pensacola really in the far western panhandle it's looking like just south of Tallahassee the warning is so severe and so worrisome\nThat the Florida State they've cleared the decks Tuesday through friday boom school is closed the university's not open\n'cause it's right where that can come Alabama Florida wanting river on there is what we're really looking at even parts of the Mississippi Alabama a border so it could produce some really\nTerrible debris storm surge maybe up to twelve feet in some parts of the Florida coast and it courses white they been declared a state of emergency to get out don't get\nOff guard that wouldn't fit on edge I that's what I Do these people boarding it up they're smart I mean look you lose a couple of days you come back and not the worst thing that can happen to you that the you know if you're gone you're gone that you can't replace life and then coming back and horrific conditions no\nThere's nothing there there's no power you can't get back and that would be awful I Hope it veers I Hope it dissipates but boy does not look like at a keep\nThat map and it's not that's not happening this this looks to be very very serious very very serious and\nThen sadly what they're talking about as some of the places that were hit by Florence\nAnd they're being cleaned up and that was horrible they're talking about maybe some more flooding depending on the track of the storm it's not that they're not gonna get the hurricane force but they might get that crazy flooding that was so crushing and the first place in parts of the Carolinas\nSo that's a possibility\nIn New York they're not talking about hurricanes are talking about the state of limousine crash it was a bad beat all the way around and when I say that it was because not the the limo driver didn't have the right license dilemma wasn't supposed to be on the road they failed to state inspection and as a result twenty people ended up\nDead on Saturday including too pedestrian in an area and I started to look at the map and I've been in this area because it's right by Cooperstown it's outside of\nUm Albany New York and they have these it's a beautiful area and there's these winding roads and they they're investigating it but the limo slammed into a park S. U. V.\nSo the people inside just killed four sisters died they just ... the limit blew through a stop sign slammed into the parked SUV everybody inside was killed and then the two bystanders\nDied as well and this was a birthday celebration so you had you know these young families young married that in their twenties early thirties\nUm I Can't imagine what they're going to have can they shut down this company this this company had um\nYou know it's crazy and looking at their background and they keep investigating this is the owner of this company\nLooking at their background and they keep investigating this is the owner of this company\nHas apparently has a back story that includes\nUm a few stint as an undercover informant for the FBI wow and you know what the governor is saying and he's right is they had no business having missed on the roadway it failed inspection they didn't have a driver who was fit to drive wasn't license to drive\nThey didn't have the proper insurance they didn't have all the things you're supposed to have\nAnd for the families it's about the loss of these young people's lives I mean wow there was a couple that just were married like four months ago ...\nIt's just an unexplainable thing and and I like I said I Know that area I Know that area well up by um Cooperstown and that's what the deal was they were they were taking a trip to Cooperstown\nSo that's what the road was on the way to Cooperstown awful one of the worst stories from uh this past weekend you want an uplifting story how 'bout that adorable Barbara Bush I think one of the best pictures I've seen is the former President George Bush and\nHis daughter on his arm and they had a somehow they pulled it off they had a secret wedding that was just the families\nIn I'm In Maine so\nA Barbara Bush walks down the aisle\nWith her father GW and our wedding was to Craig coin who is a screenwriter someone she met I think a year and a half ago or something like that and they did pull that off over the weekend\nAnd released a few pictures you know it was on a social media and whatnot cute pictures of her sisters little girls in all of that I'm looking at a happy as can be but um\nNo ... no big announcement snowed giant\nWedding none of that just the um private ... so good for them good for them that they pulled it off and it shows yeah time flies\nShe's thirty six years old her husband I guess is thirty seven and she cofounded a public health non profit called global health corps\nSo her sister genna Bush of course they're like I said with her daughter's\nUm that that was just to me that was a cool moment it was a cool moment because it wasn't ostentatious it was like how was that that whole sort of understated thing we're not telling the media were not getting we're going to try to stay out of the eye of pop rock the and then we can just have some pictures come out\nAnd they managed to do it which is\nWow shocking 'cause it's so hard to keep keep anything is secret anymore\nNo you can't you can't keep a secret um\nYou can't you can't keep it to people can't keep secrets that just gets out there like poof someone somehow here's something and then before you know it it's um it's out it's the cat is out of the bag and that's it but um I I'm\nYou know we're talking about these tariffs on China we're talking about that more during the week here on America Tonight\nBut somebody said to near as we can well what are some of the people that are getting hit by this besides there's some auto parts and you know what not and I guess one of them is because think of the things that are made in China dollar trade you're going to dollar tree with this ten percent tariffs on his two hundred billion dollars worth of Chinese imports\nThere's a place where they're getting hit because they're jacking up the prices what do you say for the dollar tree sorry because of the ... it's the five dollar tree now five dollar tree

merchandise which would be\nThousands of things household health food hardware electronics all that they cause they'd have to push push it onto the computer or the consumers and if you have things that are between one and they cause one dollar nickel three or less that doesn't fit with the this door\nSo you can't can't have them on the shelves and like I said five\nDollar tree is Cory Confucius

line as far as that confirmation you and I talked about this for months and ... we say you said right at the very beginning you couldn't imagine he wasn't going to be confirmed\nBut you saw the turmoil that resulted of uh protesting really I'll play both sides because now it's like sports teams the Democrats and the Republicans why did the Republicans prevail and what did the Democrats do wrong\nWell for one the Republicans I think made a couple of Jeff Flake from Arizona I Know everybody Republicans I was angry at anybody okay look let's take a look into this\nI think after that when they came back and we haven't seen the report of course but I think we know nothing changed\nAfter that it was more of a Haitian she said the startling Newt came out where for example judge or the one guy that Dr Ford was there\nHe obviously didn't change his ideas for what happened so as a result I think that you know that helped the degree of speech which he just you know\nWas on fire I think it gave a sort of a psychological momentum frankly for the Republican side\nAnd then just should look at a press ahead instead of you into any pressure I think frankly you know the fact that they just kept moving again at a report I think really helped what flick called for\nYeah and so now offer Kavanaugh who he moves daunting there's the swearing in ceremony on Monday the president I'm apologizing to Brett Kavanaugh as his family's sense for the terrible pain and suffering\nThat he says they endured after his confirmation Supreme Court for Kavanaugh he just moves on right and just take the high road is that what you would advise him to do and not to making comments about it\nOkay you raise a great question because in my opinion you and I talked about this\nUh one of the downsides was his demeanor just checking back now you know especially when it turned to show the one senator and said have you ever had a blackout drunk yeah and that to me race\nOne senator and said have you ever had a blackout drunk yeah and that to me raised a whole different set of questions also he had friends of his who supported him but he had a different version of that night a different version of how he he drank years ago et cetera so\nThere were some definite holes and everything I think for him\nAnd it's a very important he moves on because guess what this isn't done in the sense that he's going to hear the word impeachment\nKavanaugh or you know if the Democratic side takes control he's going to hear right out front they are going to to begin impeachment processes against him [noise] ah and that's going to be a monitor used by the Democratic side for this mid term election I Will tell you this I Would bet money\nMean I'm Sorry you were trying to with than a hundred and some mile an hour when you're not going to win that battle so they have a hurricane warning in effect\nFor that Alabama and there's some of you are listening to us there and in Florida for that Alabama Florida border up to the ah swam the river so so really take this to heart and also on that border to Mississippi Alabama border\nRight there right in that the the beach and it means storm surge heavy rainfall hurricane force when all the things that that entails and most of the people there no I mean listen you know not to fool around with us so there's thirty five counties that have been declared\nAn emergency state of emergency\nBecause that means the funding Florida State their clothes their closed from Tuesday through friday this week that's helped theory if they're taking it no way to take a chance to make sure all of the students and any of the faculty is nowhere near there because this is right where it could smash\nInto even Alabama governor Kay Ivey said the same thing state of emergency because power outages wind damage to a party and the debris is what also can be so deadly you know when we had to latch hurricane that came through\nTree fall down smashes into a trailer house whatever or you've got power that's out people trying to come back in\nIt's a nightmare so I think it when you look at this too I think people are heating this for the most part especially after they watched what has happened\nEarlier in this hurricane season even Florence with the flood 'cause it's always the flood thing afterwards that you're worried about but it's Michael past boy oh boy I mean it really is coming up through the panhandle\nAnd it could intensify so that's the thing maybe it's the cat three but could nia shift to oh for let's hope not because then you're talking a little jump up and the wind miles per hour you know a hundred and thirty a hundred and fifty something\nYou've got five hundred Florida National Guard members who are activated of course because you've got to plan the logistics of it all where are you responding where's everyone being deployed basically when it happens and then five thousand more that are there so\nI mean this is happening fast\nSo fast so that means you know that's why they're clearing the decks\nIn 'em at Florida State because they know that this thing is bearing down quickly and it will strike that panhandle Tuesday Wednesday really Wednesday it's probably who you're talking about a storm surge but\nFor some of the Florida coastline and twelve feet and some of those low lying areas I mean that's that's deadly is what that is\nSo hurricane season it is I'm telling you it is unpredictable at times I mean predictable least that we have the watches and you can look at the different maps thank goodness much different from those of you listening you get a tornado versus hurricane which is worse I mean it's almost a ridiculous question him since I have been in both\nNot the worst of the worst with a tornado the aftermath of a tornado yes\nThe worst of the worst in the middle of a hurricane yeah right in the middle of a hurricane I experienced what that was like\nWhere you're basically trapped you're in locked down\nSo I Love that too because then I was a kid so I Love that the evacuation really happened and people he them where we didn't used to do that wasn't quite the same thing it doesn't mean that nobody clear it out but not the way they do it now it's much much different\nI mean it's eggs from this hurricane\nInto this New York limo crash I mean the status ever and I it it is one of the deadliest road accidents in us history so anywhere you're listening to me were\nSaying the deadliest you know why ...\nIn in us history so anywhere you're listening to me were\nSaying the deadliest you know why twenty people were killed it was over the weekend and I was watching one of the college football games and I thought it was a mistake I thought\nOh no they must mean that people were injured and a couple of people were killed no no we're saying this stretch limousine killed Eighteen people in the limo to people who were walking and it and that twenty\nSo uh I mean that's terrible and what happened was that this limo went through a stop sign and boom I you know unfortunately just collided and kill the people that were\nIn the limousine and it was um I mean obviously awful\nTerrible and when you when you start to look a deadly crashes and you see where that ranked\nMean just the worst a victim texted that the limo was in terrible condition minutes before the crash\nSo you had hysteria surrounding that one of the victims\nThat killed everyone on board the terrible conditions limo and this was twenty minutes before that whole tragic thing happen or even the New York governor Andrew Cuomo said on Monday that the limousine\nDidn't have the this is what's scary didn't have the necessary federal certification to operate failed state inspection last month how do you know that right you need his limousine company you look at it on Yelp or wherever are you asking about that or you digging into that now\nSo they're investigating it was a winding\nRoad about a hundred and sixty miles north of New York city and this was a birthday party at the uh Cooperstown brewery so two people were killed you had um\nThe people that work in this limousine you you had um husbands and wives and you you had family members and their friends that were that were there and um\nThere was a tech the text message I just mentioned\nComplaining about the limo is because there was a last minute replacement after a buck hired to shuttled a group broke down so that the first thing that happened\nI mean what are you kidding me and then look at it I mean just absolutely a horrific 'cause you know in their twenties in their thirties\nUm yeah really just really really\nOne of the biggest losses of life and and this is what the first responders thing that they've seen a long time and in just in an instant like that it slammed into to give you the further details on the story it's a dilemma ran a stop sign slammed into a park SUV and then the two people\nOr you know that halted uh before the crash that were standing there boom they were hit so it's a\nIt's it's just awful and it does make you kind of think and I don't know why because I I gotta say what are you doing if you order a limousine you're asking people have you know ... company hey are they good uh-huh hey I'm One of the people say about them out there on time they get you\nKnow are they do they know if they have a federal certificate ... probably not are you looking for that kind of gives you pause to think okay if I'm putting a bunch of people\nIn this limousine [noise] you know maybe I got to ask a few more questions or find something else out about that\nCompany because those people were thinking that they're just thinking I gotta be kidding me this first we have this break down then we get in\nThe limousine and this happens and then the worst thing possible\nI mean just absolutely possible happen we've just scratched the surface here in this first hour of America Tonight other things that we're going to talk about include demand came and got baseball playoffs enough football to talk about remember this week of course would have another nail\nThe score but next what do you

be the one\nSeat that sits right there in the middle did you see what you had to say on sixty minutes I did I saw it she said and Heidi Heitkamp it's interesting because hike camp brisk is written her seat as she is definitely she's a Democrat and I and a Republican area and she\nVoted against Kavanaugh and Susan Collins who has a lot of voters\nWho are independents that specially in Maine she voted for Kavanaugh\nAnd there are people that are they've already built up the coffers\nFor money to run against her and whatnot and I saw both of them on sixty minutes and I you know look I give him credit 'cause\nHeres what they both said in different ways that they they voted the way they thought they should vote and they weren't ... they weren't ... they weren't weighing the politics of it all is what they is what they said and Susan Collins\nSaid that that that she talked to Kavanaugh and the thing that she liked about Kavanaugh she felt that he was about the letter of the launch she felt like he would go by that because she's pro choice and meaning that weighing the law and the precedent and all that kinda stuff um\nAnd she said they're just ... there was an evidence there she said there was not um there wasn't any evidence of of that so she couldn't go in that direction\nBut she certainly is bearing the brunt of a lot of of anger or having to have guards and her people having guards and her family being guarded\nBut this is the same thing with Dr Ford I mean ridiculous like let's let it go especially in her case okay it's done it's over with he's confirmed and now they still can't go into their house I mean come on\nThis really I like I said we live in America we have different opinions give me a break right can be very\nI'd so um let's move on to something else because we could just go not this all night long or all show long anyway here's one from a Frank who's says\nKate it's so easy to talk about the whole cabinet thing but I Want to jump onto 'em something completely different horrible about that limo crash\nThe twenty people were killed and the fact is they failed their inspection and hey the driver wasn't even licensed\nWow I think there's questions we all need to ask in the future when we rent these things so we don't find ourselves in a death mobiles [noise]\nUm yeah that's interesting because that's what I said I said I Would never I just wouldn't have thought\nOf asking I I wouldn't have thought to ask those questions to be honest I hate to be naive I Would ask somebody about them out of their reputation I ... I Know exactly what I Do but now I Know what I Would do if I was ever in that situation and by the way this is right by Cooperstown were the baseball hall of fame is near Albany New York\nOutside of New York city I I mean I I guess a lot of rules were broken and it it it set up this tragedy so um they were writing and the two thousand and one Ford Expedition that have been converted into a limousine\nAnd it wasn't expected and failed\nThe inspection and wasn't supposed to be on the road driver needed a CDL a commercial driver's license with a passenger endorsement\nThey didn't have\nThe limo company of course gets nailed for this but it doesn't bring back all those people\n[laughter] I mean what are they going to say they the company actually said they voluntarily took their fleet off the road during the investigation\nAnd they're meeting with people that are in the NTSB is investigating it there weren't skid marks but there were road conditions that were I guess kinda damp so they're saying that maybe that's a factor in it\nCould have been a whole bunch of different things one family\nLost four sisters they all died in that\nCrash wow I mean wow wow wow wow wow ...\nI if you understand me your thoughts you always can tape delay any radio dot com click on contact and bought a being your in [noise]\nGo to the van cave next on ATM\n[noise] [noise] when you use public why fine actors in identity you can see anything you do on line\n... photos you're with history even your passwords that's why I use private Internet access to grips my Internet connection for less than ten cents a day\nTo sign up now it private Internet access dot com and in just a few minutes you'll be browsing anonymously only sharing what you want\nInternet access dot com it's time to protect your online privacy [noise]\nHi I'm Dr Joel wallet the doctors don't lie guy firmly air force lieutenant colonel Air National guard and reserve is I'm looking for veterans active duty military personnel to joined the Ninety for life crusade to save America\nShe need your skills courage and more fully more than ever contact ... team dot com because of the financial healthcare collapsing veterans are currently struggling finding jobs grocery looking for a job\nChange your tactics joined in on you for the white crusade to save America during the health care business was ...

[noise]\nNow and the president said Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh was proven innocent confirmation battle hey everybody cage Laney America Tonight [noise]\nDivide is\nSaw they say so the midterm elections are gonna be interesting I think it's really interesting to see what happens in the wake of the Supreme Court confirmation wow a crazy crazy wild few weeks there is no doubt about it\nAnd you've got all the justices sitting in the front row the White House in the East Room on Monday and the president saying he thought his second nominee to the court deserve better than a terrible\nPain and suffering and he was forced to endure\nHe said uh for his part Kavanaugh said he would assume the role with gratitude and no bitterness that was a really great response because it has been nothing but bitterness over the Senate confirmation process which was emotional contentious outrageous\nAnd a rip the country apart and this is far from over I think\nWe're going to see many more protests are going to see some fallout from this or or not one of them is going to be Senator Susan Collins she certainly is on the hot seat the president mentioned Susan Collins as somebody who\nWas um\nSpot on basically in the words that she used when she addressed the Senate because she resolutely defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh both on his judicial philosophies and against sexual assault allegation\nAnd what happens now in fact she said because there there were donating ones that are well up over three million dollars I think now that were put out there saying that if she votes yes on Kavanaugh\nThe all those credit cards would be process so there was an active campaign against her\nAnd she said it was a classic quid pro quo in a violation of federal bribery law she said I think of our politics has come to the point where people are trying to buy votes and by positions and we're in a very sad place she was on sixty minutes when she made those\nComments so a group of liberal activists began the campaign last month to pressure her she because they knew she was the key swing vote in Kavanaugh's nomination process\nAnd if she voted no like I said the donations wouldn't would be a would not be taken for the donors the ... the pledges were process\nSo now\nWhoever the main Democrat is in two years they'll get that money that's being raised it's interesting because calling\nOn friday heading into the weekend announced he would support Kavanaugh's nomination amid all these old allegations of sexual assault she said and concerns about threats roe v Wade with predominantly conservative justices on the Supreme Court\nSo after um it was all said and done now it's you know over the three million dollar mark like I said and this is still two years away that you know the bottom line is still two years away for that\nSo too early to tell if it will have that kind of an effect on a senator\nEarly to tell if it will have that

where that can come Alabama Florida swam the river on there is what we're really looking at even parts of the Mississippi Alabama a border so it could produce some really\nTerrible debris storm surge maybe up to twelve feet in some parts of the Florida coast and\nIts course and his wife have been declared a state of emergency to get out don't get caught off guard when it wouldn't sit on the edge I that's what I Do these people boarding it up they're smart I mean look you lose a couple of days you come back and that's the worst thing that can happen to you this\nThe ... you know if you're gone you're gone that you can't replace wife and then coming back and horrific conditions no\nThere's nothing there there's no power you can't get back and that would be awful I Hope it veers I Hope it dissipates but boy does not look like at a keep checking that map\nAnd it's not is that's not happening to this looks to be very very serious very very serious and then sadly what they're talking about some of the places that were hit by Florence\nAnd they're being cleaned up and that was horrible they're talking about maybe some more flooding depending on the track of the storm it's not they're not going to get the hurricane force but they might get that crazy flooding that was so crushing and the first place in parts of the Carolinas\nSo that's a possibility\nIn New York they're not talking about hurricanes they're talking about the state of limousine crash who the bad beat all the way around and when I say that it was because not the the limo driver didn't have the right license dilemma wasn't supposed to be on the road they fail to state inspection and as a result twenty people ended up\nDead on Saturday including two pedestrians in an area and I started to look at the map and I've been in this area because it's right by Cooperstown it's outside of\nAlbany New York and they have these it's a beautiful area and there's these winding roads and they they're investigating it but the limos slammed into a park S. U. V.\nSo the people inside just killed four sisters died he just ... the limit blew through a stop sign slammed into the parked SUV everybody inside was killed and then the two bystanders\nA died as well and this was a birthday celebration so you had you know these young families young married that in their twenties early thirties\nUm I Can't imagine what they are going to that is how can they shut down this company this this company had um\nYou know it's crazy and looking at their background and they keep investigating this is the owner of this company\nHas apparently has a back story that includes\nUm a few stint as an undercover informant for the FBI wow and you know what the governors sang and he's right as they had no business having missed on the roadway it failed inspection they didn't have a driver who was fit to drive wasn't license to drive\nThey didn't have the proper insurance they didn't have all the things you're supposed to have\nAnd for the families it's about the loss of these young people's lives I mean wow there was a couple that just were married like four months ago ...\nIt's just an unexplainable thing and I like I said I Know that area I Know that area well up by um Cooperstown and that's what the deal was they were they were taking a trip to Cooperstown\nSo that's what the road was on the way to Cooperstown awful one of the worst stories from uh this past weekend you want an uplifting story how 'bout that adorable Barbara Bush I think one of the best pictures I've seen is the former President George Bush and\nHis daughter on his arm and they had a somehow they pulled it off they had a secret wedding or it was just the families in I'm In Maine so a\nBarbara Bush walk down the aisle with her father GW and our wedding\nBush walk down the aisle with her father GW and our wedding or what to Craig coins who is a screenwriter someone she met I think a year and a half ago or something like that and they did pull that off over the weekend and released a few pictures\nYou know it was on a social media and what not cute pictures of her sisters little girls in all of that I'm looking at a happy as can be but um\nNo ... no big announcement snowed giant wedding none of that just the um\nPrivate ... so\nGood for them good for them that they pulled it off and it shows yeah time flies she's thirty six years old her husband I guess is thirty seven and she cofounded a public health non profit called global health corps\nSo her sister genna Bush of course they're like I said with her daughter's um\nThat that was just to me that was a cool moment it was a cool moment because it wasn't ostentatious it was like how does that that whole sort of understand that things were not telling the media were not getting we're going to try to stay out of the eye of pop rock the and then we can have some pictures come out\nAnd they managed to do it which is\nWow shocking 'cause it's so hard to keep keep anything a secret anymore\nNo you can't you can't keep it secret\nUm you can't you can't keep people can't keep secrets that just gets out there like poof someone somehow here's something and then before you know it it's um it's out in the cat is out of the bag ... that's it but um I I'm\nYou know we're talking about these tariffs on China we're gonna talk about that more during the week\nHere on America Tonight but somebody said to me every week um uh what are some of the people that are getting hit by this besides there's some auto parts and you know what not and I guess one of them is because think of the things that are made in China dollar trade you're going to dollar tree with this ten percent tariffs on the two hundred billion dollars worth of Chinese imports\nThere's a place where they're getting hit because they're jacking up the prices what do you think for the dollar tree sorry because of the ... it's ... it's the five dollar tree now\nFive dollar tree you're still getting a bargain trust me but he they've had to um pull things off shelves because of the higher costs\nThey've had to re rack a bunch of stuff that about ten percent of their merchant dies which will be thousands of things household health food hardware electronics all that\nThey cause they'd have to push push it onto the computer or the consumers and if you have things that are between one and they cost one dollar and that costs three or less that doesn't fit with the the door so you can't\nCan't have him on the shelves and like I said five\nDollar tree [laughter] it's very Confucius say right now while there's a terrorist is going to

mayor's office no studies show when Randall broken windows repair bill break more windows when they see graffiti isn't removed from a building built at more graffiti when people are allowed and abandoned homes\nWell first of all just look at things objectively the fact is every one of us is going to die so there's some basic questions we have to ask why do we die why are we here what is my purpose in life so if you go back and look at some does philosophical questions and then\nSo if you go back and look at some does philosophical questions and then look at the information that's available then you will come to the right conclusion of simple way to approach it as I said God if you're real pleased show me are real and you do it just out of the sincerity of your heart\nReally just a simple complicated but it really is\nRight to say whatever it is to show the belief and I think you're at a hundred percent right on that no question and talking about breaking it down now where people are and we're the world is headed what's your biggest fear is people down in race\nWhat you're talking about the principles in invertebrate American spiritual and I wonder if he don't embrace\nWell they are that right to not embrace it but what you believe doesn't necessarily mean is factual what you believe\nTruth is the truth because it is the truth it stands the test of time is going to be true regardless of whether you believe it or not for example the law of gravity you might not believing gravity but you step off the roof of a house you're going to get pulled to the earth gravity exist\nSo boy ... stands on it all the Jews that you should know the truth and the truth show set you free and so in burn up America examines a lot of facts objectively so that people can come to the right conclusion it's a witness into\nOh I Love that that's a perfect sentiment there's no question about that what's been the reaction Dr Haley your book with the people you know and now they're even more word is getting out about it and the reaction kind of be ... ... ...\nWell a lot of people say oh man this stuff\nIt stimulates should thinking it's true it's controversial or all kind of you know the controversial questions that party leaders try to avoid everything that's controversial homosexuality same sex marriage women pastors\nAll these type of thing the Bible addresses that so I didn't write the Bible God wrote it he created us he knows all about it and he put these things in place for we to function Jesus I came that you might have a life that you might have it more a bond that\nWe do things go way there'll be less stress you're going to have trials because the righteous just suffer through many trials but he's there with us to take us through the trials and we're supposed to make the other people who are not Christian jealous because they're going to see something different about us\nSo that's how it works we live holy without going to be perfect you only one that was perfect and he wasn't kill 'cause he was a senator who was killed for who he was\nHe was a king of the Jews you go out and apply Emanuel will go with that so that's just a fact if you've got to deal with it one way or another people go have to deal with that issue who is Jesus you got to deal with that before you\nOr you leave the service is only two destination heaven or hell\nI Believe it or not that exists yeah I've done I mean let me try to people do know that actually died\nBack in Ninety four Ninety five at a major heart attack\nAnd when they were operating on me I came out of my body among the operating room looking these doctors work on my body and they wanted a dog so we lost and we lost and I'm like no I'm right here I'm trying to get their attention but they didn't see me I'm like no I'm right here I'm right here\nSo that the separation of body soul and spirit separation it's not and now ... some religions teach it separation your your your spirit and so go back to its creator\nAnd your body goes to the great and so I'm trying to get their attention and want a doctor said let's try one more thing 'cause I had flat line and when he tried to one more thing I was put back into my body and woke up in the recovery room\nAllow that is that that is powerful and that is a perfect place to end the doctor Haley thank you so much pick up the book certainly we've gone through reasons why and what is the question and and everyone will die because what is your purpose there's so much to the thank you Dr Hailey\nThanks for having everyone please
