I might have been too emotional at times I Know that my tone was sharp and I said a few things I should not have said I Hope everyone can understand that I was there was a son a husband and a dad I testified with five people for most in my mind my mom my dad and my wife and most of all my daughter's\nGoing forward you can count on me to be the same kind of judging person I've been to\nThe entire twenty eight year legal career hardworking\nEven killed open minded independent and dedicated to the constitution and the public good\nAs a judge I've always treated colleagues and lit against with the utmost respect I've been known for my courtesy on and off the bench I have not changed uh it was a terrific column by Kavanaugh I think it's\nIt it was both well timed and important to do this\nOr let's go to Steve\nIn North\nCarolina it's a ... wait and see if we go to Robin Massachusetts first online five ... welcome\nHi Laura I'm first off can I say that at the end of my day when I sit down to watch your show that is the capstone on my day I really love watching you and and she knew an action and it's an honor to just be the right down to what I wanted to say is that\nYou made a point on your angle the other night and I quite honestly don't think it's gotten enough attention\nAnd that's the idea that you said if I recall that Trump is teaching the Republican out a fight and I absolutely think that that was a brilliant insight I mean it I think we're seeing the results that all over the place right now\nI think Rob that came to me as I was watching Lindsey Graham\nDuring the confirmation battle when he he saw that Kavanaugh I think was getting a little too he was besieged and the questions and Kavanaugh was I think he was getting real hot okay\nAnd I think Lindsey Graham decided you know something to heck with this I'm I'm going to take the floor and I'm going to reset this debate about the cabin are confirmation he did that I think it was after the president's press conference\nWith the president came out an hour and a half and he was just fantastic and his support of Kavanaugh\nAnd with whether what the reporters how we dealt with reporters he was having a good time but he said yeah I'm not doing this anymore I'm not I'm not playing defense anymore\nAnd the Republicans have got to stop playing defense Trump won by being on the off and he's not in perpetual apology mode because he said he sent a sharp tweet about someone he kept moving forward he didn't look back\nHe's not going to do well over mistakes we all need to do that and he looked forward keep moving the ball down the field that's what Trump has taught us as Republicans and guess what a lot of Republicans are now seeing it he's transforming the political party and it was in a moment too soon\nI really appreciate your comments Rob we have a great team on the anger mango we're going to take a break Kellyanne Conway up next\n\n\nThis is Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving

injustice in fact finding a pressuring her to change her story which is a fancy word of saying asking her to lie\nWell it's also a crime yes I'll Try and\nDo a lot of that can be looked at after this who ... who leaked Ford's identity\nWill kind of emails were going back and forth why Dianne Feinstein recommended these a democratic activist\nLawyers to Ford why they never told her she can testify in private and keep her ... her face in her name out of the press as much as she could she could just do it in California they go to them that something is Senator Lindsey Graham told me right away he said she can do it by phone we can send somebody out there\nBut no no no they needed a clean slate and the cameras\nOn for them and I guess there next client base so it it's just been awful but America has been watching and I don't the after he's confirmed and\nHopefully he will be I won't get ahead of the way certain senators are grappling with their vote decided to vote Lara but um if judge Kavanaugh is confirmed as a justice of the United States Supreme court this will not end there they think it won't end because as Sylvia shouting at men they've never met for things these men have never done to them personally and individually\nBut other folks won't forget how people behaved\nHow they were her raining folks try drawing them out of restaurants publishing their their kids' names and their personal home addresses\nThat that's not that's not the first amendment that's just crazy that's completely crazy\nYou know do you think that in part I mean are are you argue this last week uh when the president came out of the press conference which I think was one of his best press conferences last week of incredible I mean you could have gone for three hours\nOr that he taught\nUp a really needed lost some much needed lesson to Republicans on how to fight\nFor what you believe in a fight for principle fight for a person instead of being back on your heels cowering in an elevator that the the reason Trump got elected as because he wasn't gonna take that any more he wasn't going to just keep getting pummeled and beyond perpetual a perpetual apology tour for either him sell for America and\nHe he's not they called him ... I think the bullies are the people who are swarming individuals in public or the Senate or restaurants and ... screaming at them within a centimeter of their skin but I think Trump's taught the Republicans a lot throughout this whole thing\nIn a large struck me just last night after I was on your TV show and thanks for having me or that the way everybody describes Donald Trump President Trump is exactly that they're behaving and when I don't see from him he's\nFuming he's throwing things at the TV he's angry he's a bully it's exactly who they've become he's not\nThat way how they're welcome yeah these unbelievable job numbers in and bringing peace across the world and bring it make us prosper it a ... at home if he's sitting there fuming all day they they own the acrimony they own different to produce vicious wave via way they've gone after people um according to one gender according to one's politics\nAnd you're so right he doesn't retreat and back down when he believes in a principal\nOr a principal in this case PAL Brett Kavanaugh and they didn't know each other before this they didn't know each other well at all but the President Saleh judge Kavanaugh somebody who sat\nSo is sitting on the DC circuit second highest court in the land over three hundred dishes judicial opinions that none of these Democrats even try to pick apart I respect them far more Lars they said you know we have a problem with the five following opinions that he wrote and these particular passages we think he went outside the contours of the constitution the law there's\nNo such are no doubt on about them that they're talking about a passage\nFrom your book you can sit in a post it note versus three hundred judicial opinions the answers to twelve hundred written questions over one million documents you need a Mack truck the hall around all this stuff he's produced and you need a post it\nTo talk about a passage in your book so this just strikes a lot of Americans even apolitical Americans Laura as illogical and beyond commonsense I respect them more if they said we're angry lost the election two years ago and that President Trump is reshaping the federal judiciary was constitutional less than all this nonsense\nWe're going to later on in the show can have a discussion about what these currents feminists are doing to poison the relationship between men and women and specifically the uh this idea that if you're if you're an accuser\nYou must be heard and you must be believed in if you're not believe then you're anti warmer or you're anti victim and justice Thomas's talked about this a lot you know the ... we all have to stop\nIdentifying herself as victims of this or victims of that because that's the that's not going to help you advance as a person as being a victim\nDoesn't and that every every man as a perpetrator every man has to shoulder the burden of the me too movement every man is a rape is every man is a sexual harassed or by virtue of their gender and then every woman is a victim\nUm even those who many who are that have been victims of\nSexual misconduct or worse don't necessarily consider themselves victims overall and that's being lost and the den here as well I mean if you if you asked if you do one of those are asking everybody who's out there with the masking tape on their mouths and those signs are holding up why are they there what this what is this about\nIt you're going to get answers that I really have nothing to do with his confirmation and really nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh that the Democrats used at Ford because they they breed shirt anonymity they revealed her identity to their while they sat on this for six weeks\nAnd then they set her up with attorneys who never even ... even the of telling her what her rights were what she could do and they're using Kavanaugh and\nHis shoulders should not be\nShould not be shouldering the entire me to live in by the way large ding ding ding happy anniversary one year anniversary of the me too movement but you know who started it not Brett Kavanaugh Harvey Weinstein ... year end today it was Harvey winds dean major democratic donor you're not going to find him in a picture that Brett Kavanaugh you're gonna find it in pictures with Hillary Clinton\nAnd a lot of a lot of a powerful now powerful female actresses in Hollywood who look to the other way long after they were just starting out long after they were very powerful and very wealthy but let's remember how who got this all started let's remember he's facing criminal charges he's facing criminal charges\nLet's remember how who got this all started let's remember he's facing criminal charges he's facing criminal charges and doesn't you know the women describe and kind of something thirty six years ... years ago in song corroborated\nThis was a a moment yesterday on MSNBC a network that I literally don't even watch it anymore because it's so it's not even interesting so predictable but this was Mika Brzezinski are reacting to uh your comment that Dr Ford\nLook she was not treated badly she was treated like a ... egg let's listen to make a\nWhy can't you be the egg\nKelly in the ... egg and tell your story because he say women should be heard you talk to both sides of your mouth\nYou say that women should be heard their stories are believable are credible and understanding and compelling well let's hear yours\nThat's very convenient to drop that but I Want to know your story I Want to know what happened you should have justice Rome shouldn't hold on I'm not at all I Know you're out you know okay you can't just throw that out as a political dagger to protect this reprehensible predator other president\nYour reaction to that\nWho I have that reaction to that not I think that many people generally has made my point for me that people are judged women are judged by of what their grief or their harm or their recourse\nOr their quote victimhood based on their politics and I think many people are making the point for me but I don't dignify many things out there\nBecause they're they're wholly irrelevant and I will tell you a lot of blowback yesterday a lot of pushback and a lot of low back on and I'll I'll have my say about that\nAt some other time but at the moment I think it's completely irrelevant given how how high the stakes are Laura or to get justice Kavanaugh confirmed in as an associate justice United States Supreme Court but it won't be bullied\nAnd won't be bullied either and I I won't be believed 'em and I I'll have my say I'm not going to say much else right now at that I find it to be\nOn basically are relevant and when I talked about the ... which by the way it is trending on social media I Love I

asking that question and Christian Walker was shouting questions and I said she's been treated like a ... the process sheet you you could do it privately in California it's her attorneys who didn't allow her that courtesy and decency you can do it\nI'm not on camera you can do it\nOn my list and you don't have to explain you work and you wonder ... and by the way and I wasn't\nYesterday I wasn't

them do it to you got yourself to blame 'em by my to my mind\nWhat's happened here in Port and only in part was directed personally at Kavanaugh my my take on it is that the overarching purpose of this\nIs the into roar um effect that it creates for conservatives and and maybe not just conservatives but anybody who doesn't\nA toll on the line of the new empowered progressive Democrats basically they are telling you\nThat if you try to crash or party this is the kind of thing we're going to do to you and I think the only way to combat that is to fight it aggressively and make sure the people who pulled that uh have to be held to account if you if we just getting a crouch\nAnd let them keep doing it to us there won't be any us left because no good people will want to get into politics\nAnd I I really mean this is not just someone from coming from someone who supported the president in a campaign but coming from a a lawyer and a longtime concerning like myself I really believe Trump sought the Republican\nHow to fight I mean it's not going to simple formulation but\nFor a long time Republicans were just taking it and they were afraid they were all just like they were also like\nIn an elevator on any longer I've never seen Mitch McConnell fight harder than he fought for this nomination it well I think\nHe's showing Trump is showing that this is what people have one at all along and look at this sometimes to the president I think goes way overboard and makes me cringe but if I go into my head if I have to pick\nI Want somebody who's going to fight than somebody who's not and if that means is going to be accessed from time to time then you know then there's going to be accessed from time to time\nBut I think he's showing that there's a hunger on our side to not just stand in a defensive crouch and keep taking this stuff with which we've been doing for years\nWell I think it's important that we have McConnell out their Lindsey Graham John Cornyn or even been fast talking about the mob mentality that we can't become a ... a country by mob rule where people are afraid to go to restaurants\nYep [noise] yeah and I and I think Laura that if you don't raise this stuff\nAnd turn it into an issue particularly when we're on the cusp of an election\nYou don't have a compelling way after the election to say that you know this was on the table for people to consider and you have a mandate now to stop it because people voted against it so I think this not only has to be fought but it has to be ... up\nA as an election issue and frankly it helps the Republicans to tear it up because\nI I've seen you say this was a you know on television and heard you on the radio said a million times\nOrdinary people commonsense people do not like the stuff I mean they see these these uh Lenski I direct action tactics and they say you know there are some parts of this\nAgenda that I may agree with but these tactics are not America and and I don't think that's the America anybody wants to sensible\nNow and again people like Feinstein who looks he's a liberal but she was fairly well respected until I think the last you know a\nCouple of years where she's been especially the last year where she's really been pushed left I mean she because of course their primary challenge\nAnd the and the California has become more and more left gone more or less and less left the country almost\nAnd yeah well ... now a new person\n... you probably know this better than I Do but didn't California instituted some system\nHold on we just have breaking news Lisa Murkowski is voting no\nThe Kavanaugh cloture vote so that means you know for the confirmation so that's one person or the Republicans have already lost\nA and Collins could be a yes but Murkowski is

going forward I'm ... and this is not over until it's over I mean I Know people\nThought that finally we had this buttoned up yesterday I this but there's been so many twists and turns to this and the other side is so rabbit about it this is not over until it's over\nAmy Coney Barrett Raymond royal has said you better get the private jet and childcare\nReady for her [laughter]\nFrame and keep

time childcare right she's like she's got my mom at six she's got even more than that I thing\nGot seven yup ... amazing by the way but you know then we'll we'll we'll be back in back on right now the I'm\nGoing to ask an unpleasant question what is this nomination goes down this weekend what would you advise the White House what should be the next step here a blitzkrieg very quick nomination if someone else or should they or someone suggested doubled down on ... and ride it all the way to the midterms\nI write I I I Would have to ask\nI'm Sorry to interrupt again I'm Sorry and you hold that thought Joe Manchin just voted yes for cloture then I think Joe mansion he thinks he's is Santa Cruz overlook the boats yes go ahead sorry go ahead any\nYou know I I Would just have to ask the smart political people is there someone that we can get done before the midterms and if there's not that I think you have to double down on cabin on say you\nKnow if if you vote Republican and we get we get a a a majority in the Senate or then we're going to nominate ... and all over again you know turn it into an election issue but I don't know the politics of it well enough\nTo let ... given you the big thumbs up when you said that the that you're thinking you're anti ... is a legal yeah that you know he's a legal eagle he's always law you know constitutional law\nBut you you know you can be a political a political consultant if you want you to actually be a good one handy because that's exactly it just like what they should have done with Obamacare Mitt Romney remember when he announced the Obamacare is a law passed\nIn twenty twelve Romney kind of just drop that after he did his soap box a thing on the at the hardware store like one of his art Psaki then he just drama shouldn't take it out all across the country and said it's going to destroy your health care\nAnd that would've been a great issue for him and end up this is a this is a great issue for the Republican\nYeah well I'm going to go from the who the Clint Eastwood and say a man's got to know is limitations um [laughter] but I'm the political guy earlier\nThat's all right so a mansion as he asked for cloture ending debate or so it was like\nThat's all right so a mansion as he asked for cloture ending debate or so it's like Murkowski isn't no it was just I don't know about in the ...\nThis is why the whole family dynasty of senators has got the ... the idea that just because your father or your husband or your brother was a ... that suddenly you're you should be in the Senate I never liked this whole dynastic approach to\nIt you know to the Senate and the house of representatives I I remember her father I mean and then she when she becomes a big liberal\nSo I don't get that at all I never I never understood that but now I probably the indigenous people in Alaska are therefore Murkowski because she does throws a lot of money there was so they're they're all there for this\nOr any McCarthy thank you so much for having on TV I'm very soon and you're one of our favorite favorite go to gas and thinkers on all these issues will take a break\nA five five forty Laura boy were biting our nails hair

I live in New Orleans and I was in New Orleans the other day and they had the TV on at a lunch spot I go to and this is not you know hardly a democratic or Republican spot it's a New Orleans but everybody's there and the conversation I overheard\nFor mothers aunts sisters about ... ... and many of them said look I I I don't I was against this guy's nomination but after watching the way he was treated\nI feel my gosh this could be my husband my son my my my nephew\nThey see they now it seems a dental fighting personalized the um attacks on on Capitol and the\nThe the immorality of empty attacks that are just pounded in with no evidence Jody Smith give me your reaction to this year the Indiana State director for the Susan B. Anthony less water using\nAll week I can just to absolutely agree with what everyone else is that we've knocked over four hundred thousand doors in Indiana and overwhelmingly we have support here for judge Kavanaugh I think what you said about people finally just getting sick to death we see a lot of people saying we were going to\nVote Democrat but we're changing our vote we can't believe these tactics\nI think that um the uh the adage thing innocent before proven\nUm that you have to prove you're innocent says what has sparked people to be just outraged and America we believe in the bill of rights and the constitution and that means that you are innocent until you're proven guilty and now the opposite way\nAnd that's what's really sparked people to be angry and feeling as though this man is an utterly destroyed without any proof and it's changed their mind you\nKnow you you see a lot of that and and I think um the\n... again I think the American people at their core our fear beyond ideology beyond anything else they are fair minded people\nAnd had these allegations panned out had a witness or corroborating evidence been produced they might have taken a very different view of this but the unrelenting salt on this guy\nIn the face of no evidence at all I think that his outrage and let me tell you learned this the other day and we are in complete agreement I think\nWe may not be seeing the year of the woman this midterm election this could be the year of the man or the backlash demand where men come flooding the the voting booth because they think my gosh this is going to be meet tomorrow we're going to be right back happy very quickly just want to ask you this\nThe polls are tightening up between ... and a cinema\nIn I'm In Arizona you were there a forty five ... forty seven cinema could this\nTo the polls for ...\nWell I I helped settle on it it's all of that turn out if you look in terms of that cabinet his support having ... you got to get out there and the turnout on that or I think with Sally can land so we all have to pull together\nOr we will leave with their latest please stay with us we're going to take a quick break them we'll get to all your calls eight five five forty ... the ... show continues Raymond ... sitting in for the great lady of course incremental tonight ten pm eastern on the Fox news ... said\n\nOh wait three hundred and twenty nine pounds I was a heart attack when that happened I got under four hundred it makes me not so hungry I started noticing more energy or noticed my belly we're starting to shrink courtesy we come off ... pounds I went for three thirty to forty five four fifty six year old guy to lose that much weight it took some the brother I\nFeel I feel like I was when I was thirty five years old\nThat was Reuben now listen to what Josh says about Andrew four hundred\nMillion rabbits that really works it was insane or for the commercials for a decade or they don't just go try it my parents were like falling off it really works about suits last year for my new job at they're falling off it's the same\nGuys if you lose belly fat gain energy strength and muscle and look and feel years younger trying in rural for hungry to see natural affordable way to boost your testosterone due to Andrew four hundred dot com or call eight eighty four hundred zero for three five eight eighty\nWell first and foremost I'm the mother of five children and three daughters and I certainly would be a lot more I'm also the mother of friends\nAnd I would the I'm very concerned about uh my daughter or sons I'm telling the truth and making certain that they have the right to express themselves we certainly know ill feelings towards um towards ...\nTowards a Christian ... could stay but for it but at the same time we've got to know that the truth matters and in Indiana votes have consequences you know we have a very tight Senate race here as well\nAnd when people choose\nTo initially say they're going to vote for somebody because they are qualified are not qualified and then every five minutes the parameters changes to what we're utilizing to determine our vote people remember that and one of the biggest things in Indiana that we're saying is\nMothers are concerned about their children that are going to be the next generation leaders ever being willing to run for anything I've talked to so many\nMillennials boys and girls are young men and young women that are saying I never want to put my family or myself\nIn that position you know how in the world is judge Kavanaugh holding up underneath all of this especially for his own family\nSo it's really it's a fascinating to me that these women are making it about race when everybody involved in this particular incident as white educated and an upper income so it's a doesn't make much sense to me that that's it's become about color it's become about\nUm women it really is as much about a judge Kavanaugh having the right to um have his innocence presumed to be full and they've proven guilty so that's\nAbout ... Indiana I think that's where a lot of voters and Americans come down they they they feel\n... that they didn't have a real strong feeling about bread come and on the same way the president's ... up until we can go to knew he was but watching this play out watching a dramatic testimony seeing the accusations and the lack of evidence I think they come down to what you just mentioned\nIt seems a presumption of guilt and something else\nPolitics politics\nIs overwhelming all of this this is ideological blood sport and a man's reputation whose family be damned we're going to take this nomination don't becomes marching orders no matter what adult calls\nAnd I think the American people now are about to have a referendum on that idea that you can take down the political opponents at any cost with no evidence and shame destroy use reputation for all time\nIn public and even force of all of a woman who's going through some sort of distrust into the open to be used as your political weapon that I think use use\nThe Americans look at that and go man this concerns me ginger I Want to ask\nYou um you you have the big governor's race a hotly contested one in Georgia between sushi Abramson and Brian Kemp he's up the Republican brand company two points do you believe female conservatives are going to rally there in that governors\nYes I did and I think this Kavanaugh hearing is going to really play into that because it's making when I was really upset that people are playing that the women against man card and I'm Stacey Abrams is a woman but Brian camp is a\nConservative man who stands for our conservative principles personal responsibility limited government and lower taxes all the things that we\nAre that's our party is all about so I really do think and I had seen just in the last week or so across the state people are more motivated than ever now to get out\nGet out and that and not only that but volunteer that I was at\nCamp campaign the other day people were coming into get yard signs and the topic of the conversation was exactly what we're talking about the Kavanaugh hearings and how we said this politics being played out and they'll they they are really playing dirty the leftist play and dirty and people don't want to see this they really are just storage\nYeah no I I you know as I look out and watch them as you'd you'd does have all the markings of the last presidential election where we saw a lot of drama for the cameras celebrities coming out now we've had walkouts in protests and signs and confrontations with senators and these dramatic moments\nAt the same time in coffee shops in factories yeah in the school\nOn to pick up the kids if you listen closely you're hearing something very different this same dynamic I think as we're propelled Trump into office and it was like kind of will he calls it the silent majority\nI'm my sense is just working Americans and Americans would not by nature political activists they don't get out in March the working there working the privately have their views about politics that they spread over the dinner table or to their families and occasionally to their friends\nBut it's not something you go to war over\nAnd ... today in Washington and I have to tell you\nI've seen friendship shattered people simply do don't talk to each other\nAnd it's all about politics it's because they they disagree politically and it's become an ugly violent thing where once was dialogue to try to convince the other person to your point of view today it's slash smashing destroy and I don't think\nAmericans particularly women really want that now their core group I think who do and we're seeing them in the street\nBut moms wives\nWorking women ... I I don't think it's where they live I'm going to give a quick round Robin we're going to go through everybody again a starting with military Potter of from the Virginia Republican Party in West Virginia are your thoughts on we're we might be headed here in these midterms\n[laughter] I think that uh due to the situation with this nomination of a\nA very very qualified a judge to the Supreme Court I think that the Republicans are energized to get out and vote a for Republicans conservative Republicans that will support President Trump's agenda\nAnd I think the Democrats were also get out and vote the right way to for people because West Virginia's counties there's fifty five of them\nAnd all fifty five went for Trump in the election so that meant and twenty sixteen so that means that we'd had Democrat votes as well\nAnd I believe that the Democrats also are a work or to get out and vote for Republicans this time so I think that the everything's looking good and we love our country and we want to protect our country so and I'm going to spend every last minute I can uh if it's my last breath trying to stand up for what's right for our country\nOkay well I don't want you to do that for military we now we need you in December so they may be my\nLast breath I'm so busy [laughter]\nWell you keep going great to talk to you know junior high our last word do you um you're you're the you're in Georgia or the Republican Party in Georgia\nOr given this enthusiasm we're seeing given the cabinet fight in the in the way it's being processed by voters what impact will end up in the ...\nI ... I think it is energizing the veterans more and I also think that people that were kind of neutral and on the fence that were energized about midterms because a lot of times people don't get excited about the midterms I think we're going to see where you've heard a lot about the blue wave I Believe the red way is going to comment and\nPeople are sick and tired of the in the late around and they're going to stand up for their freedom and we love our country we care about our country and those people are going to come out of the woodwork and I think it's going to be a ... it's not just going to be a way it's going to be\nIt kind of out of the woodwork and I think it's going to be a ... not just going to be a way it's going to be a ... and people are going to a shot shock and awe as what I like\n... a Jody Smith I'm I'm going to end with you you know Republicans are really bad at telling their story I always take them for this they they can't tell a story to save their life\nIn this instance the Democrats gave them a dramatic story that ended up breaking their way how will this play the drama the intimacy and the projection I think many voters are are are engaged in as they project themselves on to a cabin on his family and what they've been through\n[noise] well I agree with what the other gal says that in Indiana we love our country we were first on the board for Trump remember that Mike Pence says it's a law in Indiana and we are here to say that we support\nU.S Supreme court justice that supports the constitution of the United states a living breathing document and for that reason because we are so strong we also will support a senator\nThat well I'm actually beat the incumbent because he is an outsider because he is conservative and because he will stand for the values that believe in\nSo we believe that we're so we're going to see a red wave a red suit in our state of voters that come out that never happened before just as we saw during the Trump race where people voted for the very first time in their lives\nAnd we're looking for um these numbers to begin changing and that Donnelly will pay quite a price for his stand and saying he changed his mind remember that he was voted the most ineffective senator in the Senate he could still change his mind and turn around but at the votes against this\nSupreme Court nomination I think that he will see that that he gave us a gift in the state of Indiana because people are going to rally to the cause\nWell fifty one forty nine today the senators voted for cloture but as you're alluding to um I think", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Hallie", "day": "05"}
