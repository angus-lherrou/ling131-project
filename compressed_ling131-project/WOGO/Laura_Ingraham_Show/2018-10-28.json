correct yes and and that really gave me a chance to uh\nUh get around during the summers and meet the heads of the computer companies and meet their top engineers and their product fighters so\nI learned a tremendous amount about the companies and then when I came to start my own business um you know that with the big held a because they knew my name and teen my writings and analysis and therefore they were willing to pay attention to\nA proposal that I made up of to set up a sense of where the computers were and what the customers\nWho are using them wanted for future products and services\nAbsolutely ... and that was a job you've got while you're at MIT but you stayed with it when you graduated correct\nThat's right yeah when as an editor without talking to\nThe heads of the computer companies and helping them or you know told me that they had a need for this Fisher\nUm and when I asked are published the price he said that was too low I should charge more thought that'd be taken seriously I Love that business idea and that type of put out the proposal and wound up having a nine companies send me check for twenty five thousand dollars each perhaps payment so that\nIs actually all the capital that are used to get started so\nTo a anyone asked me about how to start a business I I just talked to people who can be customers find out through unfulfilled needs and proposed to fill those needs and in many cases they'll they'll sponsor you they'll buy a subscription to your proposed service and otherwise advance money to help you get it going so you don't need to raise a lot of money\nIf you are closely in touch with their customers they'll they'll be happy to support you well\nAbsolutely and and you know there's there's a real important in a lesson here while

sixty three\n... and ... was his job is to go all over the country as you said and gather information a world of computers were number this was back in the sixties he'd build up a tremendous knowledge\nAnd a resource of words that were all located now is it a lesson I wanted to go back to that that they would love to hear from you pat you brought this idea back for a brand new publication and you brought it back to the publisher what did they tell you\nWell they said oh that's a market research project that's not something we're interested in and you know you can do it on your own uh so I said fine I'll Try it and then that was what started the business and\nNow that we've had a number of cases like that um after doing the talking to 'em a lot of the managers of computer centers they said they needed them a weekly newspaper to help them get real information about what other people like them were experiencing with computers what were their problems and difficulties and we launched the weekly newspaper and everyone\nTold us that couldn't be done we are only putting fifty thousand dollars in the projects all the money we had available and they told us how it's going to cost you a million dollars to a friend a weekly newspaper\nAnd you'll be out of business in two months and you know we'll see if you did well will pick up the pieces and carried on ourselves or if you went to the one that was a bad market and we all have the money by showing us that you had a dead end project\nAnd fortunately we got very low advertising because we were new but we've got about Seventy thousand people who gave us a check for twelve dollars to subscribe to our publication so that was in fact a million dollars came out of the subscription\nAdvances we're getting from readers

think it's weakness but in many ways humility is the X factor of leadership Jim Collins said that the X factor of great leaders is not personality but\nHumility and humility as not thinking less of yourself it's thinking less about yourself\nAnd realize that you know people say gratitude is the mother of all virtues but really it's humility because if you don't have humility recognizing that there's a power greater than yourself that there's ideas also out there that are better than yours\nAnd that you have a lot to be grateful for\nIt's hard to even be grateful to allow some of those other virtues and traits and come into your life and so humility I've seen has been as El Al people make better decisions allowed them to be able to attract the right people allow them to be able to create sustainable companies around them\nAnd allow them to the contribution above applause\nHas caused them to want to seek the compass instead of seeking comparison and trying to get me to tech company and so it was a powerful powerful virtue I Believe in characteristics Ross Perot success\nI agree and because what is the old saying you know pride goes before the fall and\nI think that the humility is something that is\nAll too often forgotten about because we are so ambitious and ambition is driven by pride and\nHumility doesn't exist in that world you know what I mean it's like I'm going to get ahead you just watch you know in other words when somebody you know pushes you down and you you fight that much harder to get back up again but at the end of the day when I when I looked at the way I used to react when somebody said you can't do that you're never going to do that I was an Walsh show you\nYou know that's not the right attitude that even though it works yeah you listen you can throw all kinds of different fuels on a fire they will burn\nBut the reality is that is not the best fuel to run your life or your business by you know by anger and and contempt and I'll get even kind of an attitude and I've seen that before and it's and it's just not good I I Love the humility park\nYeah and here's an interesting thing also and I realize this after selling Randy and I started a company grew it to six hundred employees and sold it and after I saw that I heard advice from one of my coaches and mentors who gave me this and he said this isn't\nThe same motivation that got you out of Egypt will not take you to the promised land\n... and it was like ...\nSo there's a different level up because I think early on as an entrepreneur and even throughout her life it's kinda like I'm going to do it to show everyone else ... inside of me\nBut the real sustaining power comes from this place that says you know what I have a mission I have a goal I have something that I Want to accomplish deeply inside of me it's part of my mission in my calling\nAnd so I'm not going to make you go get in a way of that\nAnd so it's an interesting different motivation that then allows you to do bigger greater and more significant things\nWell I Can't agree any more on what you're saying that's how I felt in side of the growth some it is every time somebody got on stage including you\nI was like I could not agree any more than what they're saying they're they're they're spot on and that that one little gal that was like five foot tall I I was like it doesn't matter if it's not the size of the dog in the fight it's the size of the fight in the dog and she was yet another Arthur compared to a dog but I'm ...\nI'll get in the fight it's the size of the fight in the dog and she was yet another Arthur compared to a dog but I'm just gorgeous little thing but she's just a little tiny gallon which was just on fire I I Want to know or I Want to want to get her on the radio and I want her to tell her story to this audience because\nI Believe they went to a person taps into we'll call it the humility to hidden ingredient entrepreneurial success they become\nAn amazing power right let me take a break I have actually more to talk to you about among let\nYou go oh sorry we didn't talk about competition versus collaboration and we're going to do that on the other side we've got more to go with the wheel is gross dot com that's what it's about ... when her weekly back\nSubstantially him out more and over a lot of times for transformation in whatever form that is but that's what people are looking for is a form to be able to to be more significant and have a journey on an experience that has an outcome that is something they're they're really there are some foreign so pick conversations happening out\nThere man I'm telling you I'm Glad you said that because you know often I Wonder\nYou know this show is so important to me because I'm learning I Am a student you are the master and you're the teacher I Am a student in the audience listening\nI Know all of you folks must be thinking the same thing it's like yes this stuff makes sense so that's why I look to bring people of insight on this show because is it about business can't about business is it about life and is about your family\nYou know how many divorces do we want to have I have friends

will bring\nYou know a lamp under my feet 'cause I Walk in the dark daily like so many other people do looking for the like seeking for the light and for the answers\nAnyway let's talk about in the last couple of minutes competition versus collaboration 'cause we're collaborating right now\nI think it's a really big conversation right now especially if you look at crowd sourcing and all that's happening with the different apps and websites from over to you know all the different ones that are out there\nTo be able to collaborate with people instead of looking at the amateur competition and it really my business with Iran and I it transformed when we started collaborating we first started\nWe were offering training programs and coaching programs\nAnd we were trying to do all the marketing everything on our own kind of biding meeting ... Iraq and trying to do advertising\nAnd it worked but when it really went to the next level and we said you know what all these people are competing with us but they're all kind of going after a similar market but what we can do is we can bring them together and give them a unique process that we have\nAnd that's really Allen when we started having these conversations with you know the Stephen Covey isn't Charles jobs and a lot of the\nExperts are out there and we started collaborating together and saying hey let us provide this service for you we can provide this data back to you and it allowed us to intervene environment where our mindset and it might serve our employees with scarcity it became\nAn abundant wow the possibilities to collaborate some of these people out there are endless instead of trying to always finding a way to be able to beat them or to compete with them on the line for line item and so a lot of operation is a is a big\nPart I Love it I Love it I Love it and I think it's a hundred percent true [noise] uh this is a [noise]\nLaurie again or I Will survive and I think that if we all work together we will survive because at the end of the day [noise] um [noise]\nAll I Want to do is help people to have\nMore tools and their two boxers do their businesses to run their lives to seek for what is going to truly make them happy [noise] it isn't money people that is not money I got sick the other day and I thought to myself man I Would pay a thousand dollars to not feel the pain I'm feeling right now\nSo it's like it's interesting how money becomes worth nothing when you have pain [noise]\nNothing wisdom is really truly the [noise]\nThe one thing that we need to speak for to be able to not have that pain and our lives and in our businesses and that's what you guys offer and that's what we try to do here at all for newer growth dot com Ethan Willis thank you brother [noise]\nAllen I really enjoyed it so much for all your help you're doing a great work they don't care for unity thank you man I I Try and um I um [noise] I Know we're going to be doing more we're going to be collaborating 'cause we're not competition [laughter]\nHang on our side right brother take it for the interview that was that was awesome my pleasure growth dot com you guys grow dot com [noise] this is entrepreneur weekly [noise]\nTime we don't use it very widely duly we use it like a teenager spends money just a mix of obligations in arbitrarily decisions in a company called best self is here to say no stop that spend your time senator\nSimpson journalist designed to help people think their time to treat it like a ... budget deciding where to spend it where it matters the most\nPeople think their time to treat it like a real budget deciding\nWhere to spend it where it matters the most devoted a little time to checking out their journal and other times saving products and you can do that at our website best health dot the um [noise]\nHave you ever tried to plan a vacation at the hotel and airfare and pet sitter all add up to one big never mind\nWell it's time to embrace the adventure and Garvey it's dead Garvey dot coms your one stop shop for all things RV campy rouse the different types of our bees fly to ... or dealer near you and compared to ... to explore more than sixteen thousand RV parks you can't nationwide and even play in your menu for the trip\nFind out what you've been missing it Garvey dot com sets go are being dot com there're many words you could use\nTo describe the new kid stinger GT stunning stylish sporting the word breathtaking however\nIsn't just an adjective it's a warning because while the ability to zero to sixty four point seven seconds might take your breath away going sixty to zero with powerful rumble breaks will help you catch it again to twenty teens ...

Lhasa alright so certainly a large part of the market and we just talked about you know there are business travelers out there give us an idea of some of the amenities that you think are most pressing for the business traveler today and then you know argue providing them\nBusiness travelers are stressed that the way we think of a hotel and how we think about our platform is unpacking hotel experience on our platform we partner with the way we partner with growth hub we partner with we work we partner with a variety of\nPartner with growth hub we partner with when you work we partner\nWith a variety of services including you know the big bus tours and city on scripted so in advance of you even getting there you can order yourself the food you want when you want to be a garden fresh or the best tie from around the corner so that You're welcome to you your experience first our stock your fridge\nSeparately that's great for consultants that's great for somebody on assignment but equally great for a week stay a major city globally so that's fundamentally different equally if you need meeting space you can get it from we work if you got after a long week and you found five hours or four hours and you want to go around and essentially\nLearn to city on the big red both or whatever you can book done in advance and if you want a great walking tour around the

catering to you know generally they're catering to the you know under the masses that it's perfectly go to needed\nShowing share with us in the service department an extended stay locations registry global hospitality offers\nThey do enabled travelers individualized combinations to replicate your home but Steve wise the CEOs Mary on vacations worldwide elite in global vacation ownership company that offers a diverse portfolio across more than sixty five resorts well he had a different perspective on what travelers are seeking when they travel with their families for more than a week\nAnd we started off asking him initially his thoughts on the importance of vacation here's ...\nWell I think touched on it I mean part of it is you know in the twenty four seven or other frenetic life that we live today\nI think people kind of lose sight of some of the important things like maintaining those close personal contact with their friends and family and everything else and\nVacationing actually lead people on line now having said that I'm as guilty as many where you know even when I'm On vacation I still got my cell phone and all and I stay connected but I think it by forcing people to actually get away from their job\nGet out of their day to day home environment I think it's really healthy for kind of rejuvenating people and letting them get back to work with a whole different sense of purpose and the sense of kind of feeling about themselves\nYou know we couldn't agree more and although it is a challenge by Mary out vacations worldwide trees has its roots back to Nineteen eighty\nFour Steven today you have over sixty five locations around the globe I'd love to know the average length of stay but I'd also like you to talk about how a vacation at one of your properties which can parents who have vacation someone may try and coordinate on their own Arthur I travel agents\nAre average like this day I Can't give it to the precise number but it's going to be over six days um it originally started selling a week space products so you bought seven consecutive days back in two thousand and ten we shifted to a point space product with a lot of people to take a more frequent but shorter stays\nBut it's still going to be close to six days in terms of the average day one of the basic differences between staying at a time share resort like ours versus staying at our traditional hotel room is you've got a lot more square footage typically space one of our unit is a couple of bedrooms are living room dining room and kitchen\nIn a highly amount of dies resort versus a standard hotel room the size of the footprint of the product of staying in as over twice that of a hotel room\nAnd by virtue of having a kitchen and everything else for people that want to cook a meal or to along the way during their vacation they certainly have the ability to do so and one of the things that we hear consistently from our customers is\nThe added space coupled with the uh the variety of amenities is available at the resources are really enhances the quality of their big Asian experience\nWell I Know you know Robert we certainly like that and Steve did make some good\nPoints about what time share our resort ownership properties offer travelers dairy goat seeing seeing all the windows and the world's largest hotel business in terms of number of properties is more focused on ensuring travelers understand the specifics of what their various brands provide when you need a room at night somewhere or are more interested in hotels\nRather than a type of combination says Shon or Steve offer we asked Barry what he and his team are doing to differentiate their brands and provide identifiable experiences\nYeah it's a great question and and there is lots of friends out there for gas and consumers to choose from\nBut as we think about our brands they all do fit in somewhat of a nice value or economy as we see in mid scale extended stay and each one of those has an identity in terms of what represents\nI guess than draws them from one of the brand for example super eight\nWhich we've just done renovations to over Ninety five percent of our brand system what we see them as as an American road original someone who's really attracted to a product that's on the road where they view that product into that they resonate to how it fits to them as as a road warrior\nVersus a days and which is really something about happy and being sunshine and track someone in a way that feels very different which also then you know when we look at\nThe upper scale of our segment there's a very different products for someone who may be going on a destination or a resort visit so each one has somewhat of a identity that really is resonating with the gas and as they get that experience they feel very different when they say they're\nVery I had a question on the grill is for wind up in the ... of France where do you see the area for the largest let's see if you could kinda forecasts that over the next couple of years\nSo today we have about forty percent in economy and there's always opportunity to continue to grow in that space but with the acquisition of came to we really are very targeted in the mid scale to upper mid scale market and we see that as a real opportunity for us to get even further footprint and move more up stream from where we are in a\nCommentary on the other brands like out there in West on a trip a little bit I mean there are some others so when they're really doing stuff somebody brings all the hotel operator so we already have our producers Melissa Valerie working on segments between Nineteen and we're going to look to cover it is to help you try to understand what all these hotel rooms provide out there\nWe are and but as far as what we just heard from Sean scene in Barry there's certainly a lot of options for travelers to stay and I think it's you know it's pretty clear we can expect even more
