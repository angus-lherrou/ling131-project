this I've seen a lot of this and even ... will tell you know as you know people stop at the cell service gas stations\nAnd you watch them to get on the carpet fuel and paint the pumping go nobody ever

would never titled anyone before\nYesterday it was a demonstration had about five hundred miles on it when I got it\nOkay that could be a problem because if they had tagged at a title that in the dealerships name and use it as a demonstrator\nThe lemon law doesn't apply the lemon law only applies to the original owner um so you have to check and see if this thing of urban title before you got it but I Would go to our first off in your own is\nAnd we've been title before you got it but I Would go to our first off in your own as manual to be a a number for Ford customer service\nI Would get

thousand miles on twenty seven\nAnd I got twenty it's crowded and twenty thousand it's unacceptable and if you don't step up to the plate and fix my truck we'll go to arbitration but then you filing arbitration complaint after you have to deal with the help you and they'll do that though and ah you you have him go to the lemon law you can have them by back\nThen you get another truck okay but again\nYou gotta you gotta see got you got to see the car facts and are you know you didn't take the Vin code and go on car facts and see if it was ever titled\nIn someone's name before you got it because if it was titled intact than the lemon law only applies to the original owner unfortunately in the state of Georgia as far as I Know and I haven't been arbitration for a long time but I went through that starting Chevrolet helping I had an astro van that literally I had one for about an eighty six\nAnd I kept it through Nineteen Ninety two in the truck was flawless I'd never had an issue with it I put a lot of miles on it and beat it to death\nI bought a new one in Ninety two and twenty thousand miles then spent more time in the shop burned oil the windows fell out of it the air conditioner\nDidn't work I met him by back\nSo okay that's what I Would that's what I ...\nAnd you you know they'll probably put you through an oil consumption thing where they check it and they change it and they do this or make you go back and forth it's been convenient but you have to play that part of the game\nRight okay well thank you so much\nGood luck and call me back Lehman how do

regular spray on carburetor or do I need to buy something special for problem\nHere's the deal a lot of these ... bodies have coating on them and sometimes regular carburetor cleaner and just a little bit too harsh\nThey do make a swallow body and then take cleaner which is you know just ... it's it's basically the same kind of stuff leaves less residue has a few chemicals in it I Would recommend you do that now is this a got a cable taught or is a drive by wire\nThat drive by wire\nOkay so you know you never touched the products like 'cause you'll destroyed by directional DC motor strip on the side of it and then you need a problem we so what you can do is and what I like to do I like to spray the ... the intake cleaner on Iraq get it pretty saturated and going and just clean it rub it lightly don't push it\nClean around it then turn the key on have somebody sit in the car and put the ... the floor and the father played should open and then you get in there and spray around it don't put your fingers in there [laughter] if it closes it'll hurt you\nOkay All right\nAnd and do that that's a good idea of community I control or whatever you got there and uh make sure all the boot\nThat's a good idea to clean the I I Will have control or whatever you got there and uh make sure all the boots\nA tight Novak and weeks and you should be a pretty good shape\nAlready\nI felt so I have not I mean I did not going to have too much trouble putting his and I'm sure you you've done stuff like this before\nOh yeah yeah yeah um it's pretty straightforward I think yeah\nYeah what you normally have you're going to have and I haven't done one of these on the trail blazers but if it's like most GM's\nThe hub assembly with the barons and all that stuff the the\nCast housing is threatened the bolts come in from the back side to the dust plate and they they screw into that and that's where your your type ... tightened about Seventy four pounds I'm just can't feed on bend the backing plate that little sheep sheep meadow backing play\nAnd um\nThat's available at O'Reilly they have just the aerosol can of just to clean or if you want it so that should help you out and if anyone is doing this all about if you drive by why be real careful you get in and start pushing on that final plate and you've just destroyed a very expensive bottle body assembly\nAnd and if you're not changing itself it could be a good bit of labor so we want to be careful before the break I mentioned Simone shouldn't bone is a little area a little town right near where I live and um they're great folks have to have a volunteer fire department\nIt shouldn't bone um they do\nFirearms training for the for the public uh last week my lovely bride and went to a um\nA ... a safety class where they taught CPR\nThis is all free by the way and put on by the sheriff's department and the ... guys\nAnd um\nYou know they even did using a fire extinguisher which sounds pretty basic you know how to use the ... and he pulled venue hold a little thing is we use to deliver and what they actually had great little outside demonstrations where they had a fire pit\nAnd\nThey built the fire and then they had the fire for people that the firemen and they showed exactly how to position the nozzle oddest thing what distance from it and they showed the common mistakes people get right up on top of fires queens the trigger and makes it worse\nI'm actually if you get back a little ways and I wasn't there to give you the dimensions to how far back my wife said when you got to the right distance and put the fire up like that she did a great job so she was ... all I just stuffed\nShe'll take good care of me so I don't have to worry about it but anyway the happening I fall festival a with a little silent auction this is all to raise money to do the right things that they do they got a new brand new pop or truck and uh they're volunteer fire department and in a rural area like this you know\nThose are the guys have a your lifeline there's nothing like the first responders they'll come and risk their life to save you and that's a great way to go so anyway I'm\nAgain go to Sam drought radio show Facebook page you'll see the story about angel a black\nFemale puppy that we we rescued the gentleman that founder did a great job it took her to the shelter\nWith a shelter was fully couldn't take any more and more there are no kill shelter they do the best job they can have an rescued pickup animals and you know my wife and I have devoted a lot of our life to taking care of animals my wife fell in love with the dog so she's going to become a memorial or she's going to be part of the household\nAnd you know we haven't had a puppy in a long time we rescued a lot of senior dogs dogs so for energy and she will chew anything known to man I mean I found a chilling kryptonite this morning so anyway um 'cause I Do I Do take her out early in the morning\nAnd we go out in the woods together um now there's a couple of things um [noise] this is the time of the year you know like here in in Alabama and Georgia hunting season starts pretty soon\nEarly November and got the ... season and then the rifle season starts in Alabama this long season goes from sometime in the beginning in November to the end of January and this time of the year when livestock and moving around and deer accidents you know nobody wins when you hit a deer\n... besides these physical injury which was the most important thing not to get hurt\nYou destroy your car there's no two ways about it [noise] and the guys that are cars to have done some research on this according to the insurance information Institute\nDuring this season which generally runs from October through December\nIs a dramatic increase in the movement of the population cars ... says while the frequency of deer related accidents is decreasing the severity of these accidents is he's increasing because of Martin vehicles are filled with advanced technologies that\nRepairing so you cut the deer your damage the bumper the grill and that kind of stuff as long as you're not her to go to the collision sanity get fixed up and now you're talking about\nAbs sensors you're talking about friends hung the phone facing cameras lane departure stuff you know automatically stops or breaks it ... does all that stuff all of that stuff is going to have to be tested effects if you're airbags deploy yeah airbags the way they built into the dash today\nIt could easily be two or three thousand\nYeah airbags the way they built into the dash today it could easily be two or three thousand dollars you can have ten thousand dollars worth of components if you've had cards car for a few years that could be the difference between them repairing your car\nOr you have it totaled and if your cars total by the insurance company because they're only going to spend so much repairing it\nAnd um [noise]\nIf you hurt total that's a financial hardship for you there's no two ways about it [noise] All right I've done the punch suffocating it's a twenty four minutes after they let me go talk to a record Minnesota who has information on used parts hey Rick good morning\nHow are you doing\nYou know I'm doing great hope you are to what's going on\nWell from a a new one where this weekend\nWhere people are cutting the airbags out of the steering wheels on on the cars\n... you know they break into the car and that's all there after their bag because a Potter stuff going on and what not\nSure that they might be stealing the bad the airbags or they have no idea\nYou know what's going on by the way it very easy to to inadvertently deploying airbag that'll ... and it's and it's sort of like the bag of money you get out of the bank and blows up with a guy and you you go covered with this caller and you're looking at a cop and say it wasn't me he's laughing\nAt 'em\nAnd cops have a good sense of humor you know when the cop stopped me and he says you're drinking I said you're buying\nNow in their ... but anyway [laughter] um\nYeah I'll tell you that way and that was my question is how quick cutting things out of there to capture the rubber boots on the steering wheel and then they think they get like ten or twelve car than an hour\nWell let's see if they know how to do this is not new by the way this been going on for a while sex sometime I Hope cars are stolen recover the car the airbags are gone I'll tell you the other thing that they steal\nAnd this actually happened December dobie but it's happened to a lot of dealerships these guys will go in with these battery powered demolition saw it was like I saw it was all in the cattle that cutting everything off and getting the catalytic converters on him\nAnd then the catalytic ... you know the whole deal is this a problem with society when you think about it there wouldn't be a market for these ... these it's like you've seen this I'm sure in the news\nWhere churches and municipal buildings in civic centers have had all the recognition is stolen off the outside unit because of the carpet eliminating a brash and them well those teams would have no they wouldn't that would be work was if they couldn't if\nI mean if they go to a salvage yard is such a a metal salvage place and so I've got a couple of conditions I Want to sell the guy looks at 'em and they're fairly new they're not some old thirty year old piece of junk\nYou know they stole him if he didn't buy it from they wouldn't be stealing them it's the same thing with catalytic converters guy brings in catalytic murdered with two shots and of course the poor owner of the car down they can't use the car they usually cut the wars for the oath to sensors and they damage everything\nIt can cost you thousands of dollars to get back on the road when some pool is made fifty bucks on a catalytic converter and you know do whatever is going to do with the money so it's it's really sad it's really sad but yet they they they know how to do they know how to cut the wars and get something out without deployment\nAnd then they sell it to unscrupulous collision shops you know place does body work together I mean if they get the insurance company or allows but say Fifteen hundred bucks for an air bag and you can buy one on the black market for fifty bucks you making a lot of money\nYeah yeah and in all of it like that guy the guy buying a product doesn't know what you're there if it can\nBe recall anyway\nYou know what I mean exactly fell off you know you're not with\nThe app will let things for the phone call hopefully we'll get a lot of these unscrupulous people I got to go to a commercial break here it is the bottom of the hour twenty minutes after the Iowa wow you guys are
