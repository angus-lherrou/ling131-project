joined now by Pat Buchanan I have I Would never put Pat Buchanan offer anyone except the president and I know he understands that have\nBeen put off by presidents before [laughter]\nAlright an\nInterview I guess he's been talking to the king of Saudi Arabia\nHe I mean we have to get into this show the odd situation I again he walks into a a a its consulate in Turkey and he doesn't come out\nOkay so looks like something happen got chopped up or something I we we don't know what happened but of course he um he ... he wrote a column in Saudi on Arab newspaper that was canceled\nYou know the guys you know marriage was collapsing at one point and you know he now he's he's an Islamic even though in New York Times today said look the guys in Islam asked\nBut also had been a path royal service now doesn't mean you should she obviously should be killed but there are people out there seem to want us to go to war over a person you know like the person being killed or snuffed out in someone else's conflict I mean how is how does that make any sense pat\nWell really vicious vicious a classic case the question of morality versus state interests are ... years I mean from everything we know control you went in there they brought in a forensic expert from Saudi Arabia where the bone Shaw\nAnd he didn't come out in your head Fifteen guys going onto planes and come out the same day and the Turks have a lot of tapes in videos claim and we've got some information that\nThe prince of Saudi Arabia was trying to lure him back to Saudi Arabia for some but not for some purpose show but the key thing here today is you've got the prince of Saudi Arabia crown prince and the king put the credibility of Saudi Arabia on the line\nThat they did not do this and you've got to America is checking it out\nAt the same time as this looks like a real atrocity in a moral atrocity\nAt the same time they're very serious state interest in the U.S relations with Saudi Arabia so you've got to balance those things out you know I remember you know Richard Nixon and we're over there and try to toast and Mao tse dong at the same time they're going through the massacres of the great broader and cultural revolution\nBecause we needed to deal with the Chinese against the Russians and the Cold War it's a real conflict here between morality and state interest and it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out but it's undeniable that Donald Trump believes he is acting in the best interest cold national interests of the United states\nMarco Rubio a someone who\nYou know it's much more of a neo conservatives of verifying Russia a on occasion with other Republican vilify met just that you know I think acts like Russia's in sometimes\nBe a bigger threat than it is even though he's been fantastic actually lately on China Rubio has been great this is what he said about Saudi Arabia yesterday\nWe're already out for Magnitsky investigation which means individuals responsible for that decision would be sanctioned beyond that there are other options that we can take like I said that's something that needs to be thought through carefully but it needs to be very strong and meaning for it can't be symbolic it can't just be words\nYuri idolize that I Do agree with mark ... excuse me Senator Rubio to this extent\nOr you can't just brush this well if if the investigation for ties to the ground French and the crown prince\nI don't know how you make the future leader of Saudi Arabia for sort of not draw to impose sanctions on him personally say you can't come to the United states and she's his bank account or something like that she got a real conundrum here so I think what's going to happen\nIs the the Saudis are not working with the Turks and the Turks a lot of countries over there in the middle east to have a real vested interest and not having a breach between Saudi Arabia in the United states so down or you're going to see these\nInterests of ours against the sort of a moral position you gotta take which is this is an outrage or can't be allowed to happen and it's got to be punished by sanctions or at least against the individual someone suggested to the solution is going to be the inevitable wrote agents went and did something they weren't supposed to do\nAnd they wanted to give the crown prince deniability\nRight may mean dishes and wink wink are quick\n... exactly and over again you know when I was running against are considering running against George W.

[noise] do something about it so you lose the house you get nothing you can have nothing but it's going to have a a wholesale invasion of the United states going to keep going\nMore and more and more and then you have all these we the reports on MSNBC they don't do the Wi Fi reports on the victims of violent crime by illegal immigrants they don't do those stories but they do the Wi Fi stories south of the border of all these people are sitting on the concrete with their kids playing with you know a paper doll\nAnd you the people are supposed to have your heartstrings completely ah polled\nBy the emotional manipulation of the American media they're emotionally manipulating\nI Can't stand that ... kind of reporting it's the easiest kind of reporting to\nDo and it's the most dishonest let's go to Paul in Virginia very quickly Paul\nOr build the wall is going to go down as Trump's you keep your doctor is done nothing\nOn his border here he has failed miserably I don't care about Korea or trade deals or anything he lets this continue on this country is not we're never going to get anybody elected you're going to have the Elizabeth Warren\nAnd the brokers and everybody'd be elected in this country he is killing his country by not ... he's the put the military on the other side of the border and stop that\nWell I think a lot of people agree with you and you see these you see this massive invasion imagine if the people\nWho claimed to be reporters were actually reporting on this like really reporting on it not just talking to the the the Seventeen year old who has two or three kids use a poor person I get that they're desperate people I Do understand\nWe ... we feel for the people who are being manipulated and hurt into making this track\nBut we are Americans first we must must protect our border otherwise adios America\n\nIf you suffer from E. D. and you've seen your doctor about the little blue pill you know it can be expensive and seeing the doctor and waiting at the pharmacy can be a hassle\nWhat if I told you that a certain little blue pill just came up Paton December eleventh in that scene active ingredient that's in the little blue pills no available and generic form available to you just thirty dollars for a month supply that's a big discount no more getting ripped off of the big pharma companies with four hymns dot com you can bypass the doctor's office pharmacy visit and see huge money on your prescription ... just go to\nFor hymns dot com slash easy consult with a license position is following their confidential medical review you can have the proper prescription delivered directly to your door for a fraction of the price and today we'll supplies less you can get started with a trial and wants to just five bucks\nThat's right five dollars here's what you do just go to for him the dotcom F. O. R. H. I. M. S. dot com slash easy today and get started for just\nHe does have a slim lead and I'm hoping he will pull it out\nWell I think again this is about the future of America a we have Elizabeth Warren of course the great progressive savior\nAnd the Democrat Party are coming out today with this DNA test a where she claims that she does have [laughter] ancestry a of a Native American sort a initially\nReports were that she could be one thirty seconds Native American but now there's a\nThere's a there's now a Boston Globe\nQuestion about whether it's really like one one thousand given the math of how far removed her\nNative American ancestry could be yeah here goes the report includes the possibility that she's just one one thousand twenty four is Native American they just put that correction on the Boston Globe store\n[noise] yeah I mean I'll tell you one thing she is a hundred percent not qualified to be our president where she would take our country it's frightening\nA and it's interesting to see that she's running for Senate in Massachusetts this signals to the people of Massachusetts as clearly as possible she's running for president so\nShe's saying here give me another term as senator but I'm going to go run for president and walk away from the Senate seat as quickly as possible so um I Would love for the president to go up against Elizabeth why I Can't think of a better contrast bring it on\nThe road like ... by this token like if you if you say you\nYou know your part Austrian and goes back ten generations you get to claim nobility status in the Austrian author Hungarian empire I mean is this is this really what we're going to do now to get special privileges in colleges and universities I think this is what drives people crazy\nAnd it's offensive to Native Americans I mean it just is so ... and she doesn't apologize to them for you know capitalizing on their true heritage for her her benefit and and that's really the bottom line of this is that he's pushed that forward for benefit for her career\nFor her education and what she's one one thousand\nTo give me a break [laughter] I'm Sorry this is funny now Donald Trump was asked about this or on a on the south lawn of the White House before it took off for Florida let's listen to\n\n\nLetter really get\nA ... no no no he went on to say he hope she's running for president he hope she's running for president he went on and on about that that was the least interesting part of the uh the White House lawn but nevertheless he was he was like well I Hope she does Ron because this will be an easy way out for me\nYeah I Hope she ends up being the nominee I mean what Democrats are putting forward now the progressive left Democrats\nWill change our country and and we did a video actually recently talking about what socialism actually means and the cost of it\nBecause Democrats keeps saying free health care free that's free everything and they're not saying this will quadruple your taxes it will destroy our country go look at Venezuela get educated on this if you like the country that we live in today with a with economic opportunity with prosperity with wages coming up\nA Democrats are not that people you want to vote for\n'em and I have to ask you about what the house looks like I Know it's hard to predict every races is different but\nDid anyone predict at this point that the Republicans would be frankly making a comeback it looks like in this midterm election\nCycle was the Kavanaugh a win for Donald Trump and he turns around and I think he fights for for Kavanaugh unlike anyone else and now the people are like the ... he's the best clothes or we have this could actually help in the house races\nIt could it it is helping we're seeing that in our data obviously they are in the U.S put a huge ground game in place we've trained twenty five thousand field organizers that's five times more than we did in twenty sixteen to turn out our vote to educate voters to talk about the results\nI there's a lot of house races in the balance there's about thirty so the house is going to be neck and neck I think until election day I think you're gonna have recounts\nTo determine the majority and then the Senate is breaking our way in North Dakota and Missouri\nI was in Indiana this weekend with my run I mean the energy and the Senate sides great we could definitely pick up seats which is unprecedented in her mid term of a first term president so I feel good about where we are Kavanaugh has definitely energized our base and I'm seeing that in our mail I'm seeing in our fundraising all across the board it has\nPut a good choice in front of our voters do we really want with the Democrats are offering obstruct resist the smear campaign\nThe search and destroy it all costs or do we really want a party that's putting forward results that are helping average American families\nAre run on before we let you go the uh the word that in reporting that there is yet another care of on the Caribbean or two or three caravan\nOf migrants are coming from Guatemala and Honduras making their way through Mexico to the U.S southern border um my listeners are enraged by this they want to stop they want this Congress to make\nA make it clear that we can do a media turn back the new legislation at the border stopping the application of asylum at border entry points instead of doing it in your home country\nOf what what are you asking the Republican Party to do to stop this this madness I mean we don't have a wall and now we have more people just flooding into the country\nWhile the president has let on S. and you've you've heard signals from the Senate and the house that they're going to look at funding for the wall\nDuring a the race or during the time between this election in January they should I mean I think about what these kids are going through these poor children are being dragged across Mexico to our border they're being put in very dangerous situations oftentimes when they come into the United states there last\nWe have a ... human trafficking problem this is something that Democrats should be working with the president to solve they don't\nUm and it's going to take Republican leadership to step up and solve this immigration problem we have a serious problem at our borders and we have to resolve it\nKnow we have to resolve it and of course everyone's heart breaks for the children who are as you said put in danger by taking this long track\nA but the American children the American people homeless veterans inner city America they need the attention of our lawmakers first and foremost have to take care of our own people who opioids everything else that we've seen a developer last Twenty
