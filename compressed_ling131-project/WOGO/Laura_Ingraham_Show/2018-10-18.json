talking about being up on a roof and roofing that's more of a young person's job but you know what I'm Talking about the idea that America has to import uh foreign workers to do every American job is lunacy\nI when I grew up we didn't need that probably didn't have that problem when I when I was growing up Americans did all sorts of jobs from picking a tobacco which my brother did to picking fruit which I did\nWho I mean all of us did all of this work in yeah if you have to pay more to get Americans to do these jobs good you should pay more I told you when I was in Switzerland it was really interesting to talk to the Swiss about a Swiss jobs they don't do this big importation of laborers in Switzerland they don't do it\nThey didn't actually people who do everything from sweeping the

states that Jewish as far as the border but as a you know an American citizens here I I don't want to just think that this voting is going to help what more can we do\nWell the border the border has to be enforced the president's right if these other countries won't enforce their borders we need to put a we need to put some thought into how we're going to better do it here and he's got an ... if it's a national emergency the president has extraordinary powers and drugs guns\nOr criminal element of gangs we've already caught them trying to get into the country and we've already arrested people who are within the so called migrant population who are only coming into the United states to hook up again contacts we brought you story after story about that\nAnd this president understands that they this president gets this like no one else\nHow many have you saw the frightening frightening display last night on the ... it was called meet the chairman you remember that movie made the parents so it was called meet the chairman and I went through chapter and verse what would happen to various committees and the house of representatives\nOr if Republicans lose control of the house and let me tell you something forget the new Jamie Lee Curtis rendition of Halloween the movie the most frightening thing you can imagine is what's going to happen\nTo the financial services committee the house ways and Means Committee the Appropriations Committee the intel committee the energy committee\nIf the Democrats have their way eight five five forty Laura let's go to Eric in Michigan Eric go ahead\n[laughter] I Believe that the easiest to the quickest solution to the border problem would be to open the home studying act to all of the federal wham rounding border and as you can make a structure dwelling a part of\nUh being able to get into the home studying act you could just as easily make it that they need to put up a barricade a fencing or whatever\nAnd with the uh that's already covered priority on any old studying at the open up your could wind up with a lot of our up your own studying which would be helping all the American and at the same time\nCourt one hell of a wall down there\nA than other interesting idea well our our callers have more interesting ideas and most Republican or Democrat congressman or Democrats just want an open border open borders open markets don't go watch\n\n\nThe ... been a real life story from trinity management\nI had a lot of credit card debt and I couldn't pay my bills I was feeling so bad I got to a point where I needed some help so I reached out and contacted trinity\nIf you're in depth and you need help coal trinity of one eight hundred seven mine for over four three something to talk to a certified counsel when\nThey were able to take all of my different payments and put them altogether\nTrinity will consolidate your accounts to do one easy to manage monthly payment put a stop to lead season over limit charges reduce your interest and possibly improve your credit score you'll save the house\nAnd they were actually able to work with my creditors or being able to pay off close to Fifteen thousand dollars in the last Eighteen months\nBy now this is all a bridge too far\nIt is and I got to tell you I saw that Chris ... a prime time last night Steve Cortez as a warrior a ... for the president he really is you know he he's a Latino in his president or his parents\nCame here legally and he indoors so much defending the president's policies including his immigration policies on CNN it's just amazing to me you know I appear on CNN often as well but I look to see it as a model he I Know when I get off CNN after defending the president\nI get so many threats some of them death threats I'm certain gene gets the same kind of feedback from CNN viewers and yet he goes on every day swing and for the fences I'm so proud of him and you're right um but ah the ... the Democrat signed up for this and I think they're going to pay for it\nI think that again people who work hard for a living trying to take care of the kids just you know they don't have the money to send their kids to fancy private schools they're just out\nIn the country and they're working and they'd like to take a vacation every now and then and they see that the economy has improved so much on the president's leadership and then on the other side they see chaos identity politics constant cries of racism\nOr embracing the illegality and and now open borders which is you know it's been a case for some time but now it's literally they want to open borders its it's beyond clear\nAnd I think it I think this blows up in the Democrats faces morning noon and night if the Republicans do the right thing here and hold on to this issue and actually pass legislation to stop this this is an emergency what's happening to this country\nIt's emergency now with bacteria and coming towards the border and I think the president\nIs standing tall you know I I've been in politics since the Reagan Era and do you have to we first met in Washington back during the Reagan years and you know I worked for Jack Kemp and\nIt was people like Jack Kemp and Ronald Reagan stood up for this country and and have backbone and unfortunately over the years we really haven't had a president like Donald Trump and have backbone and would never have stood up to these caravans coming up against the border would never have stood up for justice Brett Kavanaugh\nYou saw what happened when the president just said simply no I'm not looking at another another nominee you're going to have to approve and confirmed Brett Kavanaugh we saw spines grow and senators we didn't even think Adam any re Lindsey Graham was the hero\nOf chairman Grassley a hero Susan Collins a hero in all emanates\nFrom the strength in the White House and the immigration issue you know he has not backed down you remember when he came down the stairway in Trump Tower and then his speech which shocked everyone he promised starts the word and they tried to conflate like you mentioned\nUh illegal immigration with immigration and they've tried to do that over and over and over again and they're still doing it today but it's not working because the average man and woman working\nEvery day in America you know taking their lunch buckets work you know dropping their kids off at school they understand the difference between somebody who jumps the border fence and somebody who comes here and stand in line and does it legally\nAh you're listening to your health a radio addiction eight five five forty Laura every poll that's been done in the last few years on immigration are shows that most people want legal immigration either to remain the same and that's a million people a year it's a lot\nOr or to be decreased so it was like thirty seven percent want it to remain the same that the Gallup poll from June I'm thirty seven percent want the level to remain the same I'm Talking legal immigration twenty\nNine percent want it decreased okay twenty eight percent wanted increased now that's legal immigration\nAnd that those are the convenience factor the inconvenient fact that people like Chris ... they don't want to deal with because when you live in a you know a doorman building in New York you don't have to worry about illegal immigration as it doesn't affecting your life\nYour kids go to the best schools your kids or you know probably driven to work a an androgynous school excuse me but you don't have to deal with illegal immigration and you don't have to call in with a a legal immigrant for for a job and find that wait a second they're doing the IT work I used to do for thirty percent less\nSo uh you know people don't want this\nYou're right I live out in western New York where it's a it's a very blue collar area and uh in recent year a year or so we've seen\nYou know truckloads of illegal or legal immigrants arrested or the seven eleven on their way back from a construction site where the or were they were working we've seen a chain of Mexican restaurants in and uh and west in Buffalo or wherever they pulled out of a whole load of workers where\nThe owner of the restaurant was housing them and paying them even cash on he just got a found guilty the other day\nOf this kind of crack down needs to continue because I'll tell ya in western New York in Buffalo where we used to be a strong steelworkers town\nWere not anymore we're we're starting to come back under the leadership of president Donald Trump but\nMen and women here me these jobs need these jobs and and the they know who's taken the job they know what illegal immigration is all about and the Democrats and the mainstream media spend their time trying to gas light them on this issue talking about how important\nAre ... immigration to the United states when they're really the issue that they're they're they're complaining as illegal immigration the president isn't against immigration\nIs against illegal immigration and I think the American people see through you know my wife is an immigrant we went through the whole citizenship process the first the immigration process\nAnd then the citizenship process it's difficult it takes time and if you got to hire a lawyer it's expensive but my wife will tell you\nIt takes time and if you got to hire a lawyer it's expensive but my wife will tell you it's really worth it you know and the problem she sees is if she's surrounded by people were all surrounded by people who are here illegally some of them are now over ... etc\nIt's ... it's infuriating [noise] and again I say this repeatedly you ... if you can't even blame you can't blame the people who are trying to get here because they've been given a green light probably from their own governments and in one way shape or form a and they've been told you can come and stay\nSo people who are just want to come here and work I don't even blame them but they it can't happen because because well without a border you're not a country Reagan said that he was completely right a border exist to help you maintain your sovereignty and to protect your own people an orderly process of immigration is what we need but\nLook the chaos at the at the border\nIs is not dissimilar a Michael to the chaos that we've seen in the streets and the ... and the aftermath of\nKavanaugh a and the Democrats\nPrefer that because if there's chaos you need more government government grows government gets bigger and the Democrats are never happier than when the government is growing and growing and growing that's what they want\nIt's true and if your listeners white what they saw during the month long confirmation process of justice Brett Kavanaugh\nThe screaming in the hearings the the people running down the are always base of the United states Capitol screaming at senators but the people trapping senators in an elevator illegally and screaming at them for the cameras\nThe mobs people outside the capital and after he was confirmed that people trying to literally rats with their fingernails through the metal doors of the United States Supreme court building\nIf they like that they're going to love twenty Nineteen if the Democrats take over the house of representatives and you know or if the election were held today we would lose the house the Republicans would lose the house\nBecause a lot of people who were not measured well by the polls and twenty sixteen they call is deplorable right that people who haven't voted in recent elections because of their frustration with issues like illegal immigration thinking that their vote didn't matter at all\nThey found a champion and Donald Trump someone they fought a non politician could make change for them\nAnd you know in in a midterm election\nThose kinds of folks to tend to think well I got my guy and\nI'm going to go ahead and sit this one out and they don't take their lunch break\nTo go vote they don't drop your kid off early at school so they can go vote on the way to work or they don't you know a skip the ... the birthday party after work to go vote on it and and that this time around they better do it because they think the part of the president's not on the ... ... is ...\n... that's an excellent point and Michael what's happening the twenty seventh congressional district in New York Congressman Chris Collins what's happening there\nWhat Collins as of some of your listeners might know or was charged with insider trading yup I'm a recently after it was too late to get them off the ballot um you know he declares is innocent and you know we believe the presumption of innocence but near twenty seven is an hour plus eleven district it was a safe seat\nAnd uh they have a pretty strong Democrat running against them kinda leans toward the Democratic socialist type of thing really hates Donald Trump has said he's open to impeachment\nAnd has changed his tune because there's different New York twenty seven is very pro Trump and now the Collins has been in some federal trouble he changed his tune and talk about how he wants to work with the president yesterday or are we we found out early this week that\nSo it gives you on your way than\nUm W O O G o Holly Chippewa falls open

[noise]\nEight five five forty Laura we're going to bring your attention to critical races across the country one of them as Pennsylvania seventh congressional district where Marty no Stein is running to replace the retiring never Trump or a Charlie Dent\nA thank God he's a being replaced and Marty is in a tight race against Democrat left the Susan Wild\nAnd this has been redistricted but I'm telling you something Marty as a person you all have to get out and vote for in Pennsylvania seven he joins us now and also is an avid cyclist who was in the two thousand\nUh Olympics as attract cyclists there's a lot of ah incredible stuff for his community and it's going to support the president's agenda on the economy immigration trade all the rest of Marty it's great to have you on tell us what you're finding out there what issues to the people care about most as you're approaching this all important midterm fight\nOr first of all thanks for having me yeah you know covering every corner this district which is now a new district ... district has everything from the urban core of Allentown ... from the eastern to the farming communities in the northern tier worked district what we call this late so\nIn eastern to the to the farming communities in the northern tier worked district what we call this late felt\nA region now or what we're seeing and what I'm hearing is that people are happy people are happy with this economy they were happy with what our president's been able to accomplish we're seeing there's a lot of jobs out there people are making more money and we have a you know other rather nice bugging me right here in this district and people want to see that continue\nThey don't want to see this come to to a screeching halt so I think right now\nA lot of voters are getting very very much engaged and they realize what does that steak if they flip the house on a ... in in Congress\nWhat what uh when when you see the redistricting that well obviously a it is is being done in many cases to add a urban voters to what a traditionally a blue collar or a more conservative district\nIt makes the Republicans jobs in in in a way more difficult to try to run for Congress for the first time or run for reelection\nBut on the issue of for instance immigration where we see a thousands of people now are being funded clearly to rush up to the border or even in rural districts where you know they do need some agricultural workers and so forth\nPeople don't like the chaos and lawlessness are you finding that as well given the news on this new crush at the border\nYou know I think that's really on a lot of people's minds is just the the radical a resistance we're seeing from the left\nA rash of people to the border again we we we we read this chapter before we've seen it happen\nUm most people I'm Talking to I Would say the majority of the people I'm Talking to understand that securing our borders a first step towards a workable immigration platform or we need to secure our southern border and there's no question about that and everyone I've been talking to us and supportive that I'm so immigration\nUp here in Lee high value in Pennsylvania seventh district although we're not a border state uh it is something that's it's a on people's minds\nA and Marty Susan Wild is they they ... they hope that she's part of the what they are going to call the year the woman or because the me too movement the woman's march and so forth are so ... what would they tried to pass or off as a moderate a Democrat in in your district\nSo that's what they're trying to do but that's not who she is a she ran in her primary or somebody on the ... are left now she's trying to move\nTo the center but a her results speak for themselves or you know she she's she's for radicalism she's from a welfare she's for no borders and sanctuary cities she's for bankruptcy in\nIraq or see no for an pitching the president teaching Kavanaugh but she won't say that in any commercial she won't say that any public forums but at the end of the day that's what she ran on in the primary and I'm sure that's what she's going to govern as if she's elected which we cannot let happen\nMarty when I see the uh the amazing economic growth that's been made possible by this president's focused uniquely on the American worker the American\nPeople it's hard to imagine that people would want to halt that or go backward\nI I've been watching some of your campaign commercials and events on line\nAnd the people in your district they're smart people they want to go forward they don't want to go back they don't they want they want happiness\nAnd calm they don't want chaos in the streets and people were in black masks and smashing car windows and in a in raising the flags of other countries in America they want America to be a safe prosperous nation where security\nIs paramount in our our virtue is freedom a is always you know upheld and raised high and I think it's jobs not mobs we want jobs we don't want mobs I think it's as simple as that\nI think it's as simple as that and you're right a lot of voters in my district agree with you a hundred percent now the other side it's got a small little motivated base of folks we've seen that the results we've seen in the primaries they're very vocal um you're right they show up and mobs uh we uh we announced a campaign uh our our\nBrand opening of arcane campaign headquarters the night before they threw rocks to our windows uh you know so this is the type of stuff we're seeing even locally here in ... seventh district which\nIn my opinion I was born and raised here my family's been here five generations I've always called at home I never saw it like this before in my life I'm a relatively young man I'm forty seven years old but what you're seeing right now the resistance from the other side is is is it's it's really quite alarming\nAnd hunted and funded Marty by socialist billionaires who don't like the fact that America standing strong for national national economic growth and so forth ... or ... I Can't wait to see you in Congress\nThe following is not an actor but a real life story from trinity dead management\nMy story began with that a lot of debt credit card debt and I heard a commercial

program and see how affordable and easy it has to pay off your debt\nTry to uh make the Hispanic vote jumped into the vote a boost and try to have both would have been so this is a very well organized by the media and I have no idea how they do it\nBut I have no doubt that everything is it the night you pay attention to the states they talk about it for three days how the Hispanic is working Fort Drum in a historical way and then all of a sudden\nWe have an ... you know a problem on the on the order and then we have to figure this out and Donald Trump's days we're not going to let that happen and I think Hispanic votes watery and Americans\nCan see through this because I trust that when you come to this nation and you believe in that and we understand that they'll put that you have you're not going to receive the by the\nUh the Biddy filthy works on the left and what they are trying to do every day or two American the American fabric\nA mark Christian um you're such a treasure we really appreciate your voice speaking up for truth and freedom and religious liberty and a common sense pragmatic foreign policy\nOr where we have to make alliances with people in or been in countries that now you know we don't agree with on a lot but for the better betterment of the American people sometimes we have to do that\nAnd don't keep your eye on the ball people because what marks that is exactly right this is calculated and and it's actually so transparent it's pathetic a doctor my Christian here on the lower income show will take a break get your calls do you agree that this is a calculated strategy\nGet Donald Trump out there on this immigration issue and think that because he talks about it Hispanic voters will start turning out on moss against him and the Republican Party
