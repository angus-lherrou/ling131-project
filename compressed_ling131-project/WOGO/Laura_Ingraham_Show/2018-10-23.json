facilitator the mob facilitator ... was arrested by message Mexican officials\nAre and he was the guy who they call them a human rights campaign or this is how lazy the media media are human rights campaigner and an ...\nThe guy puts peoples lives in danger he has no respect for US law no respect for us immigration law and apparently his goal is to do one thing\nFlood the United states with mostly indigent low skilled workers who cannot speak English and who just want to live here and not follow our laws\nBecause if they did they'd be filling out immigration paperwork like everyone else around the country no respect for Guatemala's migration for Mexican migration law and now us migration that's three countries laws they violated by doing this\nBusting passed police officials in some cases assaulting police officials it is a scandal\nAnd by the way other elements in this a migrant mob are present us border patrol officials have reported this\nAbove majority of these people are not criminals\nThere no terrorists and they're not even immigrants that refugees and apps our nation in the United states we have to choose what kind of mission we are and treat them that we had a pre Josh ... we're going to say all of them are are criminals all of them I represent that is not true so what do we have to do is to listen to them\nYou're the cases and they just sort of political asylum Ben run a\nPizza he's so uninformed he he refers to them as refugees a newsflash Jorge refugees under US law have to apply out of country they can apply in a port of entry so don't refer to them as refugees or not their economic migrants meaning they want to come here because it's a better place to live\nBetter place to live than Honduras well yeah a lot better places are I'm sure a lot of places are not as nice as the United states but that's that's just the way it is you don't respect our laws you do not deserve to be in this country period\nEnd of story respect our laws enough to apply legally and that is it\nWe cannot be mom out by these are by these emotional extortion is no way\nThey're emotional terrorists these people and and I and we know what they do they did it with the separation of families they don't give a rat's you know what about the victims of illegal immigrant crime in the United states they never and by the way when these midterms are over they won't even be covering the caravan\nKnown to be covering it because they think somehow this is going to help them\nHere you have the part of the United states demonizing thousands of migrants coming towards this war that effectively shut down the border to asylum seekers and refugees and so on a who many of these people were sexually qualify for that kind of status use going off on these migrants are describing them as MS Thirteen or no Middle Eastern\nI I don't need to hear about Bangladeshis joined the migrant caravan in Guatemala according to Univision correspondents yesterday\nA Spanish language reporter who spent weeks embedded with the migrant caravan said said that people from Bangladesh had joined the mass of people trying to cross from Guatemala into Mexico Francisco Santa Ana reporting from the bridge separate in Guatemala Mexico the British have been packed with thousands of migrants\nThe Bangladeshi said were detained and immigration facility though it's not clear what happened to them after the detention\nThey infiltrated themselves in his care of and they tried to cross with the crowd that would have benefited them greatly\nBut everybody everybody is here just to just to add\nTo our are already rich culture because everything's melting pot and now we're literally it's all a melting pot ask Western Europe\nHow mass migration into Western Europe has changed Western Europe\nHas changed Germany has changed Italy it's changing Sweden asked their pants\nHow uncontrolled migration has affected their crime their way of life period eight five five forty Lara we got a lot more to get you don't go away\nHappier much here there really\nIs a hundred and five pounds of shiny happy dog for life the shedding stuff itching and stuff\nSince two thousand and one we've held more than a quarter million dogs get over the nutritional deficiency misery and saved our customers Brazilians and vet bills\nEverything we tried sail except to come to a diner by drought and now you got to pay the ... the legacy that he I think failed\nTo digest that are cooked out of regular dog fight is Tricia dying to fight for life\nHas been in politics thirty six years that's about as long as I've been alive she's been in Washington for twelve long years she's become a party line liberal I mean whether it's immigration where she's sponsoring this open borders bill with diet fine dies\nOr whether it's the judges you voted no on justice Kavanaugh was all for the terrible smear that her party carried out you voted no of course that she told her six Supreme Court justices\nThat are at McCaskill is and she's just terribly out of step\nWith the state of Missouri of what the people at the state voted for and that's why we're going to replace\nSo right now on this issue of this migrant mob I don't like calling in a caravan of does not now that doesn't really [laughter] it doesn't really capture and in my view\nI one of the people of Missouri thinking about like a crash like this on the border I mean it's a ... it's going to be a crash and it's going to and it's going to cause a huge problem for immigration officials and it's for the national guard\nThat I think that the people in Missouri really worried about it I mean I as I travel all over the state I have I have people talk to me about it especially the last few days and they just yesterday every stop on may all over the state people ask me they said what is going on and they what they say is thank goodness but we have a president\nWho is strong and who was willing to take steps to defend the country\nOn like the Democrats unlike Claire McCaskill who they're open borders policy is of course are what encourage this kind of lawlessness and this kind of a threat to the country now to have Claire McCaskill of base of this threat\nOffering an open borders bill\nI I just can't think of any war so I can think of anything all week I Can't think of anything that's more dangerous for months tutor for the country\nWell when you ah Josh look at uh the rest of America right now it seems that\nThe support for Donald Trump is growing the tennis highest point in his presidency which is stunning given how perpetually negatives\nThe press is I mean it is a negative drumbeat coming out of almost every mainstream media outlet even with that he's at forty seven percent which is higher than bronco bomber was\nOr how important is the president in this race for you\nTo report and you know Missouri voted for Donald Trump by almost twenty points\nOn that that is a huge huge margin in Missouri which is still a swing state and it's because people want to what they want a stronger America I mean people voted to rebuild our country that's what they were voting for much they when they voted for President Trump and his policies\nAre rebuilding the country under good from Missouri You know we've got to the lowest unemployment rate it decades of the state of Missouri\nJob growth finally hitting new highs we've got blue collar economic growth job growth but its highest point since the Nineteen eighties in the state rural unemployment slow so we're finally starting to get those jobs back from overseas your wages grow but\nHere's what scared folks is that the Democrats Claire McCaskill want to take all by the way throw it all in reverse reverse all the games and then go back to the policy of weakness overseas weakness on our border and that you know we just can't have that and that's what this election is about\nJosh how has these if at all these undercover videos of Claire McCaskill\nHarris her and her staff is that resonated at all what the voters where people are are saying that worked for a while we have to kind of lie of the voters we can't really say what we really mean about a various issues\nThough I think what's been usually resident and you know the people to hate to to have a politician especially lifetime politician like Claire McCaskill the one thing to their face and the discipline up behind their back into the sea Claire McCaskill on tape\nSaying that she wants to take away the second Amendment rights you know he's a constitutional rights\nBelong to people by virtue of our constitution to hear her talk about I was to take those away from all five of its citizens here her staff talk about\nConcealing the donations from Planned Parenthood and other extremist abortion groups to\nTalk about the fact that well you know the McCaskill really agrees with Brock Obama on everything but she won't say that publicly because you know Missouri voters are are so close minded I mean that's a ... a staff was caught thing over and over and over again\nIt's it's really the condescension the contempt for everyday voter is really remarkable and people are tired of that they want somebody who believes in the state who is not ashamed of our way of life in this state and it's going to go represented\nA Josh ah when you look at the makeup of the Democrat Party today the\nPerpetual mob mentality that seems to be encouraged and even celebrated or by some of their top leaders or how does this you know and it seems like maybe it's just a big cities and this is happening it's not so much and\nAnd you know in in places like Missouri but if it's covered a lot in certainly certainly at Fox and other networks is that on people's minds of president says mobs not jobs ah ah and it seems like people just want things to calm down and government work for them\nYou know I think that's ... true in Missouri though I I think that what the Democrats have on offer what Claire McCaskill's offering it's\nChaos at home and weakness abroad and this this mob behavior it it is chaos than it is all\nAnd I think that folks watch mobs driving people out of restaurants screaming them down and public\nBanging on the doors of the U.S Supreme Court and shouting obscenity is I mean this is not\nThe United states of America or this is not civil democratic discourse I'm all for strong disagreement that's great that's the first amendment but\nTo try and shut down speech\nAnd harassed intimidating even using violence against people I mean and have Hillary Clinton as you say Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder out they're encouraging it as Claire McCaskill you know she is she's going right along with it I mean she is happy to see these ... tactics employed\nThat is not what the people in my state voted for him but that is not who we are as Americans\nAre Josh I'm the concern I think a lot of a conservative religious voters have is the social transformation of the country and the the idea that gender is something that is\nAnd it's from a nation of the country and the the idea that gender is something that is changeable\nAnd uh that you know that we should really\nCelebrate these things in public schools and and obviously the conscience rights and the religious rights of many say that's not what we believe we love all people but that's not what we believe how ... how are the social issues playing in your state this election cycle\nYou\nKnow the Missourians are leaving because they believe in the first amendment first and then the guarantees the freedom of religion a coup churches\nTo individual you know this was something wrong but the most of my career of all the politics you're\nYou know the ... and I know you're doing a lot of girls out there\nYeah yeah most of my career as a constitutional lawyer\nBut as a religious liberty lawyer and the other people are so they are they're minded people\nAh they you know we don't discriminate against anybody based on their religious views but you know what we believe in the importance of value face we believe that the importance of value family community and those things go around\nAnd churches in our houses of worship and we want to see those protected and I have the again the left wing agenda which has become so hostile\nTo people who have a so hospitals are religious liberties just like a talk show through our Second Amendment rights just like a ... free speech what do you think about it what the left wing it doesn't really offered to you know you agree with us or you shut up\nAnd that is just not what the people of our state laws I discovered\nI'll tell you Josh why I think that Missourians are going to do the right thing and vote for you of many many reasons obviously substantive reasons menu of the right views on critical issues from crime to the economy and immigration so forth but\nI'll tell you why I think you're going to win is because the New York times is already writing ridiculous\nArticles about about your office in turmoil first of all you show me an office that doesn't have personality conflicts in in a and people moving in and out and departures and so forth\nBut it's this is the best that they can do with you that oh well we had a lot of us just surprising number of purging departing staff from the attorney general's office I started reading this today and I was screaming laughing because it just like they can say that about pretty much everybody knows office\nWe are definitely getting the Donald Trump treatment I Love your time is from\nThe liberal state and\nI Do I wear a badge of honor I mean you know and I by the way I'm not going to apologize at all for taking up government bureaucracy you know what I came to office I was on the first Republican uh twenty five years\nOr the office needed to be shake it up it needed to be made more efficient it needed to be a ... that's what we did and you know what a great result but I don't care for New York times likes it or not I promised I Would do this for the people ... don't exactly what I said I Would do and that's where all the other two\nYeah mom I I just think it's I mean as someone who has been written about so much Josh I mean you don't you just gotten a little taste of it compared to me\nBut I read these things and I read them much differently than most people I just read between the lines like oh okay uh-huh mhm yeah right now anyway I I think that is the best news this article is like the best news I read about you\nAre so now I I like you even more of a Josh I'm I'm Glad you're not running in two states Illinois Missouri obviously I Know you're writing from Missouri uh but I we wish you the very\nBest another president came earlier in

President Trump sees Hispanic cc's panic or not is essentially what he is trying to show at these rallies or you're trying to\nThat is essentially what he is trying to show at these rallies or you're trying to make the case that if these migrants somehow get into a country where to find that many of them are with MS Thirteen the violence gang a that we're about so much he says he even said quote unquote middle Easterners or among these migrants\nYou are listening to the Laurie from show a five five forty ... um [noise] did did we have any sense of like [noise]\nWanting to use box cutters to take down planes before they did so I mean I guess we\nCould have picked up some intelligence and they wanted to fly planes into buildings but we didn't really think about it\nI always think it's better to just have a\nSmart approach to law enforcement\nAnd constantly reexamine\nYour vulnerabilities as a country\nGiven the threats that are out there [noise]\nSuitcase nuclear weapons\nRadioactive um dirty bombs or\nI mean I guess we can just take a flyer and risk it just say well we hope everybody who comes into the country is going to be economically self sufficient bringing no uh you know bringing no problems with\nDiseases not be a burden that on our schools our health care I guess we could just hope for the best\nSee that's what the Democrats want they want to hope for the best that's why they're all for the most part they're either silent on what to do with this caravan they don't want to talk about it\nThey know this is a radioactive issue for them they know speaking of radioactive they know this is a terrible issue for the Democrats reporters worth their salt should force Democrats\nTo ask\nQuestions was should we do with this caravan what should we do with all these people do you think they should all coming to America do you think they should all be released into America including women and children just to show up at a later date which they don't do\nWho do you think should pay for their health care do you believe that a free schooling is what what needs to be done for anyone who gets a foothold over the border though the Supreme Court ruled that that we have to do that\nBut when is enough enough when when is when is the human tragedy of all of this both inside and outside the United states going to be enough for the Democrats\nI think it's important to stop this caravan impart to send a signal to Russia Latin America no you're not going to be allowed to come in and in part\nBecause in the process of stopping and we're going to learn a lot about the laws of need to be changed and frankly Congress maybe in the lame duck session audibly challenged ... not to not not comprehensive reform plus they contend dumb things let's just fix one step at a time and begin to make it possible to manage our board half\nAs usual Newt Gingrich is one hundred percent correct\nDo not allow politicians to get away with these glib generalities oh we're ... we all were for border enforcement what does that mean you can't enforce the border that's being crushed by fourteen thousand people at one time can't do it so what do do they mean when they say they're for border enforcement\nDo they think the asylum laws as as they exist they shouldn't be changed so anyone who lives in fear of crime and their home country should be able to come here\nOr anyone who just wants a better life should be able to come here no matter what\nThat's what the standards going to be so we better get ready to double and triple our population really quickly and all that entails environmentally with infrastructure with new schools that need to be built a with a massive changes demographic changes to our country we better be ready\nAll that entails\nI don't think America wants any part of that we want our country to be an orderly uh to be an orderly place a safe place a clean place where freedom and liberty is guaranteed by people who are informed about our history and our founding\nWho don't consider America just a place to go to get a to get a better job that's just an economic migrant we can't we cannot keep our country unified

S. dot com slash easy today and get started for just five dollars while supplies last visit for him to dot com slash easy right now for ... dot com slash easy to see what's like ripple details mental services to him by former available if you say\n[noise] [noise] yeah I think we ought to scrap what we've been doing there shouldn't be a lottery system people who end of the country should be based on merit we should be selective on who comes to the country with regard to those who come across the border\nI Would say look you want to keep people together and keep families together do it do it within twenty four hours and send them back and the thing is is we have an immigration office apply to come in as far as refugee status what we've done is we've taken away all the rule claim to be a refugee none of the rules apply\nSo typically if you come in here legally immigrate there are some decent prohibitions on getting on welfare\nAnd on getting on government assistance\nIf you're a refugee apparently all those things go out the window so everybody knows that when you come he claimed to be a refugees you can get on welfare and get into government housing and this is something that should change I'm fine with\n... we can absorb people if they want to come and more\nEach year\nPeople that we can emitted into the country and how many we need and will make that decision each year but uh we can't allow just people just to to come across the border by the thousands\nUm we're talking to Rand Paul here on the lower Ingram shows Senator Paul what do you think um are the most important issues facing the country today given everything that we're seeing all the great\nAdvancement we've made in the economy the Republicans are leading by a historic margin in the handling the economy Seventeen point advantage in trade and the new NBC Wall Street Journal poll or those two issues are are massive plus it's for the Republicans in in a tough midterm cycle cycle normally\nSo what do you see especially coming from the Kentucky perspective\nI think the good news is overwhelming it often obscured by the media you know the ... and being carried away with all the Trump to arrangements said grow\nThe good news is overwhelming we have an economy growing at just an amazing pays over four percent annual growth unemployment at historic lows\nThe main thing I see as I go round Kentucky when I talked to plant managers as\nThey say we have a shortage of workers a shortage of people who are drug free with work ethic and so the answer here is this is a time before for that this is a time when we should convert or work programs that are on welfare programs to hey there's a job down the street programs and I think if we were able to do that\nYou know we have a great future coming ahead and most of it's because\nThis is what Republicans off in the Washington don't get they keep calling it tax reform and the president directs them no it was a tax cut a significant tax cut will return money to his rightful owner leaves the money and the private marketplace and guess what the private marketplace will boom when you leave money in the private marketplace and so\nAll of that has been great and I don't think we can emphasize that enough and I think in the election if they come to fruition that not only the cabin all the inside of the Republican base but there are reports that early voting in seven out of eight states that are reporting\nWhere people can uh decide how many a Republican and how many are Democrats the Republicans are are in a big upsurge with early voting\nYeah which is is is you know music to my ears because Tom Styron Soros than others have really funneled an enormous amount of money into voter registrations on college campuses which are overwhelmingly I'm moving to the Democrat Party or a Senator Paul why should Americans\nCare about this Saudi killing of this Jamal ... who ah was living in the United states he was or was he he was previously kind of a sympathize with the Muslim Brotherhood and he\nYou know he was mourning the death of bin Laden although he thought bin Laden went off the wrong track and got to radicalize Smith Media had been tied up on this story for you know a couple of weeks now\nI Would say that ah the killing of cars showed me by the Saudis is just one more incidents of things that they do that are not good for America that's been over a hundred billion dollars over the last several decades a supporting the ... around the world that teach hatred of Christianity Judaism and Hindus\nOver ten thousand ... says in Pakistan supported by them the Hakani network which is a group of\nA bad actors in Pakistan that attack our soldiers in Afghanistan they all the leaders of it went to um to draw a funded by Saudi Arabians Saudi Arabians fund addresses in Indonesia as it used to have a relatively moderate form of Islam is a big Islamic nation\nBut there there's a growing faction of a ghost who now believe in violence against civilians\nTaught by the Saudis so the Saudis are bad they have been doing this for decades and we sort of turn a blind I'd say it's all Iran Iran Iran we have to support the Saudis I'm not so sure that the Saudis are less evil than the uranium to tell you the truth the war in Yemen is going to drag us into another war in the middle east\nThousands of civilians are being killed\nSo the killing of the journalist I Would say is just one more item\nOf bad action by Saudi Arabia but Saudi Arabia sent arms by the hundreds of tons of it into Syria to al ... an al ... they they they supported the worst and most extreme elements of the Sunni extremists in the Syrian civil war\nSo no I Can't think of a reason why we shouldn't be the hopping mad about this\nBut what I've advised as we should quit selling them arms or should quit aiding and abetting them\nWhat they're doing throughout the middle east and the world\nWell the administration and the president himself yesterday said you know they're and they're important partners of ours so in the middle east is that not the case I mean they've actually assisted American interest in the middle east is specifically obviously with Iran which still is the largest state sponsor of terrorism\n[noise] yeah but I Would call the Saudis the largest state sponsor of radical Islam you know they really teach it throughout the world the people who came attacked us on nine eleven ... Iranians they were Saudis\nIf you really look at worldwide terrorism is the Saudis and their form of autism that is being sent an export around the world [noise] so uh as far as arms\nThey buy some of our I'm sure but I don't think the armed our military arms are or something like any other private entity like widgets or whatever\nOur arms or something unique we paid for by the taxpayer F. sixteen is not something that\nIf we could get jobs by selling up six team to China or Russia\nI Would still be against it because I'm not I don't see our arms trade as jobs program it was about our national defence and I think selling arms the Saudis\nActually puts a a set a greater risk it increases or risk that Yemen's going to devolve into chaos and like Libya before it in Syria and Iraq before that\nChaos is where terrorists breed so if we want to stop terrorists we need to quit aiding and abetting the Saudis and creating chaos\nI Know Jim ... who's the Saudi foreign minister responded to your uh view on the show you down and he said this\nForeign minister responded to your uh view on the show gay death and he said that\nI find it very surprising that some of the six thousand miles away can be sort of us in a sense of ... miles away no access information or intelligence or this is a judgment call them the parts of senator of all this is not in fact it's just based on the notions of the nation\nOr take a swing it that\nA lot to excited to be lectured by some autocrats from a dictatorship you know the Saudis have three thousand people in prison right now without trial so he says oh we shouldn't presume the crown prince to be innocent until otherwise proven or like a three thousand people in your country that you're locked up in jail and you don't give a trial too\nSo I think it's pretty galling for him to western standards our western standards of presumption of innocence\nAnd say oh you need to presume the crown prince innocent\nIt's a dictatorship nothing happens over there without the crown prince begins all the Fifteen people that were involved with killing and dismay and bring this journalist\nApparently many of them are hench bend the travel with a crown prince when he travels it goes up to two people who they are punished but now it's been being fired\nTo chop up see or to the chopping up in the December him and other journalists\nAnd you get fired my guess is they're uh they're banished met will be in royal exile somewhere with lots of money the lower level people they will probably executed an outlet talked to anyone because they would probably implicate the crown prince and as so no I'm not too excited to be lectured by these people\nA Rand Paul here on the ...
