Semitism have even violent do you think that is fair and do you want to clarify what nationalism means\nTo me I don't have to clarify ms I Love the country it means I'm fighting for the country I look into his loyalists to national is um somebody that wants to take care of our country because for many many years you know this rather than anybody power leaders have been more worried about the world and I have about the United states and they leave us in a mess\nWhen the president chose that wasn't nationalistic Kenny thought about it very hard and it is wrapped up in the connotations obsessive ness of aggressiveness of dominance of one race on one country over another\nIs that the way you view the word nationalist when you hear Trump talking nationalism\nDo you think Trump is as the BBC's Katty Kay saying there and MSNBC Trump is using the\nQuote dog whistle\nOkay oh you racist out their vote for me is that what he's\nTerrific book written um and it was just it just came out recently by your um has any called the virtue of nationalism\nAnd his point is that he's a conservative Israeli writer and a political ferret Faris and his point is that\nNationalism as properly understood this the post World War two or twenty first century nationalism\nIs merely stating that country's deserve to have\nA their focus on themselves in order to keep their own national identity and culture intact so Japan is Japan nationalist little gas because Japan has tight immigration but they also believe in the Japanese culture that there's something unique and beautiful about it\nAnd they're not constantly passing judgment on others but for Japan they want to\nPreserve their history their culture their language all those things\nThat they think make Japan special\nAnd I think for Trump and and this applies to other countries as well but for Trump the same thing for him what makes our country wonderful is our freedom our liberty\nOr an includes the free speech freedom to worship right to bear arms all the things that we have guaranteed in our bill of rights our constitution\nBut the last half to grab onto these terms if Obama said the word nationalist and explained it as Trump is they wouldn't have any problem with it but it's Trump Trump represents an existential threat to mushy headed liberalism they know it he beat them\nThey have to take away the rhetorical devices and weapons and issues that Trump has successfully used against the left to expose the laugh they have to remove those topics from his discussion if they can do that they believe they can beat him\nHe is and I let that happen all the second migrant migrant caravan has entered Mexico recording to Fox is just broke here we go so Trump can't talk about that either can't talk about the assault on Mexican police I guess either okay\nOh let's go to James in Florida on line three James welcome\n... hey Laura let me tell you that was the best interview I've ever seen with the president thank you how much job last night at all the points it must have been very exciting for you to be in front of a bank us\nToday but I I have to tell you that this is a show this is another thing from the left they knew this was coming these people only here for economic reasons everybody knows it and the fact that he wants to stop this anchor baby goes right along with it and I wish she signed that executive order today\nWell again we're going to get into the birthright citizenship issue another issue that the leftist completely botched and some Republicans have totally botched as well we've been talking about this issue for almost Twenty years\nUh All right well we need to all your calls a congressman Dave Brat is also going to join us he's in the fight of his political life I remember brat came onto the scene\nWhen he unseated Eric Cantor a this was back in a twenty fourteen and now he's up against the far left a woman who uh thinks she's going to be able to take that seat because of the redistricting that's happened\nA but we're going to a we're going to fight to the finish on this one as well congressman Dave Brat will be with us and your phone calls eight five five forty Laura who are the new sensors now\n[noise]\n\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nThat though I had a sinus headache for two days but I had a master of brain ... which of the brain and stroke and I was on my desk but I was on a respirator in a coma for thirty five days in three months later I came home in a wheelchair and double vision I have to learn to walk again to speak\nAgain one in one is to write the alphabet you know if I went out and did a little something I'd come home I'd be in bed no I'm up by like five thirty in the morning and go to the gym I Do shopping cook energy all day I mean I feel great overall by whole outlook just feeling about my mental aspect everything everything is better\nFor a little bit of time used discount code Laura and we'll take thirty five percent off your first preferred sets of fruits and veggies and have them shipped to you free call eight hundred two four six eight seven five one\nAnd what she's really saying there and this is what the Democrats are saying is forget about federal law do not follow the law of the land the rule of law as I said if\nI were just going to make it up as we go and that that is a very dangerous new direction or that are no Americans want to move in that direction and so what we got some huge challenges healthcare you know they want the Bernie Sanders thirty two trillion dollar\nSocialist healthcare pays ... ending Medicare is you know it double tax rates personal and corporate\nThat puts you an automatic recession depression so that that's the direction it it's just like you said it forward versus backward\nWell here's what I see happening on the left and\nI Would imagine that young people don't like to be told what they can and cannot speak about like issues that they just are not allowed to to address any longer because if you say you want our borders and force then here for a mass shooter [laughter] I mean it's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard but this is what the left\nIs absolutely trying to do they are trying to take your shoes off the table that Trump connects on and one of them that you connected on early on and you were way ahead of the curve on this was the issue of immigration or the sense that we have a sovereign right a God given right to determine who comes in our country\nAnd why they come in and set the terms and set the rules and the left so once they want they want is kind of take those issues away and I neutralized tromp on the campaign trail in probably neutralize people like you\n[noise] yeah and and that won't work immigration you know it's Seventy to eighty percent issue the Democrats are being told not to mention it right by all the\nTime she was an article in the deal yesterday the Democrats you know just I've just sarcastically\nCaving on the issues in just saying that well we don't have we don't have a party platform to run on why starting out there that cynical they know they have not offered a platform on any issues in immigration is I think the issue especially in my district and\nSo yeah you're right that the kids were loading up what Twenty one trillion in debt and then catch and release you know these are all children have gone to cross the border right like the cat which are good people in there but there are other people that have not been vetted at all or any family that comes in with two kids that's twenty six thousand dollars to go to school for one year\nAnd who's paying that bill right so you run those basic issues by the\nThe taxpayer and by the kids and say you're paying off is that you know we're putting all of this on your credit card you're going to pay it off\nAnd we don't do a good enough job communicating to the next generation\nOr the problem is they're going to have if you revert to a socialist you know ... the economy I talked college for Twenty years left the Obama period a high end college graduates couldn't go out and find a decent job\nAnd now it it's just a day and night that the economy is just boom and the kids are getting multiple job offers one statistic was really interesting it's just the job or belittle people are leaving their jobs\nBecause they're not confident and go get a better job it's been a long time since that's happened and so are the kids are moving up the the wage chain you know ... and ... it's just great news and so we ... we got to share that with everybody\nBut there is a group that is just dug in on the resistance right we're offering result\nThey want to resist like you said right they want to have enlisted best vacations they want to page the president impeach cabin all my opponent won't come down on any of\nThat of course not so what does she hiding I mean you know the question out asking his final final days why why is she hiding why why is that why is your challenger Mitt spanberger\nHiding on these key issues in the the voters in Virginia and deserve to know the truth about what she really believes about the changing nature of of the state the the economic burdens being laid at the feet of the taxpayers of Virginia but she's answering these glib\nCliches in Broome eyes to make us every everyone's going to feel good but that's not how the real world works she needs to answer these questions and why she hiding I Would keep saying that we're issue why she hiding\nRight right one of the things she hired and came out months ago and of course the mainstream press a let her high but she worked at a a Saudi\nA school she calls it an embassy school the only problem with that there is a U.S government shut it down under Chuck Schumer and congressman Israel because it\nAnti Semitic anti American anti woman there was a far right what hobbies fundamentalists Saudi training school that produced terrorists and after the fact she says she still proud that she worked there but like you said if you're proud of\nThe fact that you worked at this school that is a hate school then why didn't you put that on your resume she's hiding everything she's hiding or policy platform she's hiding her position on healthcare immigration taxes she won't talk about in public because you know they're losers with the people of the seventh district in Virginia\nI Want to play a ... I Want to play somebody for you this is from Joe Lockhart Clinton's old press secretary again words in subjects that they want to take off the table before the midterm vote let's listen\nHe's still talking about global is um which is a dog whistle for a for a semi he's still going after George Soros another dog whistle for anti Semite\nDonald Trump doesn't change um he might have moments where he reads the paper in front of him but he will change I mean if if if the largest slaughter of American Jews in American\nHistory won't change his attitude and his rhetoric nothing will well I got it yeah it\nIt it sounds different from Joe ... someone who was on CNN with Allison ... uh but I don't think that was ... I mean that's the sense that you can't say the word global list\nWhat why why not I mean they're the lessons use the word global is plenty of times but again they are the sensory is one day and they want to take the college speech code mentality in voice it upon society at large in that way they fix all the debates\nYeah the the left is very good and this goes back decades right they're training graduates they try to take your strength away from you and take away your strongest point to my my strongest point is Iran as an outsider I voted that way right in my small business score is a hundred percent\nAnd uh I have the support of all the the small business\nBusiness score is a hundred percent\nAnd uh I have the support of all the the small business folks across my district center I sit around all the county\nAnd so they're taught to talking points for me is I don't get around and not being paid off by big pharma but because of an Obamacare vote and so\nYou're you're right that talking point is right they're very smart on how to ship the language they do not want to have a policy debate if your policy debate when it Ninety ten they have to ship that off to the politics of personal destruction they have a hard time with me 'cause I went to seminary that no I Love everybody\nAnd so they have a hard time shifting the ground that way I mean it's so now they're just running crazy false commercials you know the biggest thing I Can't believe what the national media it it it's it's just horrible the house voted for pre existing conditions right to help people with preexisting condition\nIt passed the house and that's the number one issue the leftist riding on saying we're against it after that was the biggest bill of the year last year but you can't cut through you know not dream fake news\nUnreal now well Dave Brat\nA is a is a classic independent thinking Virginian and the type of person who the voters of the seventh district badly need representing them in Washington someone who will not be cowed by the threats from the left and who knows how uh how injurious it is\nTo the American people to have outside influences tried to shut down free speech\nAnd threaten people in intimidate people away from speaking their mind a day brat a I Know you're going to win this day if it's seven congressional district everybody get out there and vote in Virginia a and a congressman Dave Brat has been fighting for the American worker and fighting for uh the people in this incredible\nCommonwealth of Virginia now for years and we just wish you the best of luck Dave if we don't talk to you before Tuesday next Tuesday a we'll talk to you or at your a victory party\nGod Bless you for all you do Lorna people want to go check it out is Dave Brat dot com it's a nice red button that can send a few bucks or give me over the finish\nLiar I day brat dot com everybody go their help 'em out if it's five dollars twenty five dollars or more we want your help are you listening to the lower income show stay there the Laura Ingraham show [noise]\nOut today on DVD and Blu ray from number one New York times best selling author diminished as soon as it comes his latest film death of a nation\nWith one week before the midterm elections this is the most important film you'll see before you cast your vote\nDidn't actually is backing better than ever with his explosive examination of America today and what could happen if the Democrats take back Congress this film is a wakeup call for every American death of a nation on DVD and Blu ray today get your copy now at ... dot com that death of a nation movie dot com\nOr your word your identity could be held hostage you should be because ransomware does exactly that loses Tom Kelly studio of my id care making every American safer from the effect of R D served as a tall order but that's my goal so here's a tip the best thing you can do to help protect yourself from ribs and where does the backup your computer often\nIf you have questions about identity theft and even if you're struggling with fraud today my id ...\nGet Fifteen Percent off my id care dot com slash Laura my id care dot com slash Laura [noise]\nO O G O sleep better\nTalk radio six eighty W O O G o Halley Chippewa falls over\nSafety\nYou know\nUsa radio news was ... farms there's a\nReport that President Trump signed an executive order soon would end birthright citizenship for children born in the United states to mothers who are the citizens\nThat includes illegal immigrants Axios reports Trump made the comment\nDuring an interview conducted last night that will be airing on X.

[noise]\nI think again the media really miss apprehend where the American people are on this I think most Americans are probably shocked to hear that illegal aliens living in the United states have a child and that child becomes an automatic\nLiving in the United states have a child and that child becomes an automatic citizen I think most people they don't focus on these issues are off doing other things Trump all of a sudden brings it up until I can watch\nAnd then you go to U. K. doesn't allow it Spain doesn't allow it France doesn't allow it candidate does allow it\nIt other than the United states the only really advanced economy that allows this bingo\nAutomatic citizenship and Trump brings it up and it's uh we'll see where it goes but I think I think it just as a matter of commonsense setting aside constitutional\nA language which it does not require a what the last claims that requires\nA it's it's open to debate so fascinating subject\nAre joining us now Mark Krikorian also get to your calls eight five five forty Laura I'm Mark Krikorian is going to sell some of this forest Mark I'm\nThe president brings this up high yesterday\nAnd the media that they're ... loving response are basically saying oh how dare he how dare he dog with a dog whistle\nOnce again\nYeah well I mean that's to be expected quite frankly but uh the president is a I mean I think this is a smart move I haven't seen the executive order hasn't been issued yet but what I assume it is is that he is interpreting it caused within the fourteenth amendment\nSuch a way as to not automatically give citizenship to kids born to tourists\nOr foreign students are illegal aliens that phrase or it's complicated to get on the radio but it's called subject to the jurisdiction thereof that phrase is ambiguous Supreme Court has never ruled on it there's never been any legislation saying that's what this means\nSo it's perfectly appropriate in fact long overdue\nFor the president to say this is my interpretation\nWhat's gonna happen if somebody's going to sue\nIt's going to end up before the Supreme Court and then we'll have a role in one way or the other about whether the kids born to tourists\nUm our or illegal aliens are automatically citizens or not and depending on how they rule then whoever doesn't like it can you know try to do something to have a ... or something but it but the only way to get this process even started it\nIs for the president to do this issue an executive order and what I mean is that\nThe state department won't issue passports for instance for kids born to Chinese burst tourists good women who um and then somebody will sue ACLU will find one of them they'll sue and then it'll be a lawsuit that this is\nUm you know whatever you think about this Fisher ... whatever you think the policy should be this is the smart\nWay to ski up the issue so we can move it along in the process of you know public debate because all we're doing now is saying well I think that this senator and Eighteen sixty eight men X. and somebody says no this other senator and Eighteenth sixty eight meant why when the amendment was passed\nThat's pretty sterile that's not getting us anywhere this really is I think moving the ball forward regardless of what you think of the issue I think this is a smart move on the part of the present\nI completely agree we have to get this thing resolved I mean this Long Beach birth motels a Florida birth motels the Chinese the Russians and Mexican south Americans it is becoming a booming business Justin Russia alone\nOr and they get around all the other restrictions on on what we want from Russian uh investment in the United states by suddenly you have a kid as a passport and your golden yeah your gold and\nGet as if a kid has a passport he can go to a for instance UC Berkeley at um lower rates that's one of the reasons they're people from Korea\nAnd turkey who do this as a way of um helping their kids dodged the draft once they get older because they can just hop on a plane and go to the United states and then they don't have ... ... it's a retirement plan for some people because\nYou know you're having a kid at thirty well by the time your kid isn't adults and has a job and is working if uh you know you want to sponsor you for immigration so that when you were finished working retire in the United states I mean there are a bunch of different reasons people do this none of which is in the interest of the United states\nNow it's it's fast saying we're going to stay on this issue and a lot more a Mark Krikorian thank you so much for what you do from the center for

ethics so\nTell us what happened I ... I Know you and your family or have been targeted\nBecause simply the mere fact that you're a Republican and your solid a fiscal conservative running in the state of New Jersey but you've been subjected to threats yourself\nYeah we did I mean we got we got a letter somebody slashed up our lawn signs stuck in an envelope and then\nUh enclosed it with a a a letter suggesting that ah my seven children are would be unlucky if I were to win and ah it was you know disturbing a law enforcement's been fantastic uh they're on the case they're making the kids feel really really safe and

tables and congressional races and run it against the president despite the strong economy the fundamentals of this economy are incredibly strong\nAh and despite the fact that consumer confidence optimism small business unemployment all of these numbers are incredible what are you finding out there on the trail and could be a media conclusion about this uh this type of district the wrong\nOh absolutely it's wrong because the leftist jacked up so early and you'd always jacked up the taxpayers to be getting screwed in New Jersey for years and they do it and they understand it\nAnd the state has gotten more and more on affordable with every democratic governor frankly the Democratic legislature around here Jack it up taxes every chance they get so\nUh that's our message or much let's continue to grow this economy let's cut taxes are the people know that a Democrat from New Jersey is not going to Congress to cut their tax is just not going to happen it doesn't happen in Trenton it's not going to happen in Washington and\nAnd that's the distinction we're drawing and people respond to that because it's their felt experience for decades they've watched Democrats\nHike taxes around here and then the blame somebody else in Washington it's not going to work we're going to Washington to to grow this economy and that support the president's agenda which is working for the country\nAnd you and your wife I think are both um lawyers or your your I Know you're a lawyer you just you're going to graduated back in two thousand ah went to that man it's a it's an it's an okay

Tuesday we're not going to watch the returns come in and not know that we didn't do everything we possibly could for our country to expand opportunity and continue to grow this economy keep us safe\nAbroad and reform those immigration policies you've been talking about so uh we were we went all in because the country's worth it in ... people have been asked to make bigger sacrifices and is to keep our country strong and free and so if that's what we have to do this year to help our country and that's what we're going to do\nWhen you look at the national debate and uh [noise] you know

picked\nCandidates this year a dump it a lot of money and against us but uh it's a good district in good people around here who know which way they want to take the country that is lower taxes in the

facilitators behind the scenes a who've who've put the word out that it's as long as you get into this group Katie you'll be protected because there's strength and numbers\nBeing a part of a caravan does not give these special rights [noise] um\nNumbers being a part of a caravan does not give these special rights\nI'm but our message is simple and our message is clear we will not allow a large group an authorized migrants to enter the U.S an unsafe or unlawful manner we've already seen these groups for say break immigration laws and Mexico and Guatemala they've employed violent and dangerous tactics as you mentioned\nAgainst both Mexican and Guatemala and immigration security teams the secretary made clear last week\nThat we will ensure that our men and women on the front lines of protect and defend it and the president has done so in calling up the military and ensuring that we have the resources we need to not only secure the border but defend our men and women on the front lines\nHave you I'm prepared already a and homeland security with the chance that the president was referencing yesterday that you're going to now started housing people intense so they will not be released into society at large does\nAs they are being now because they're just simply aren't the facilities to house them\nYou know what we're doing is ensuring that we're prepared for you know these caravan size we're seeing every single day on the border and we've seen that in the rapid deployment of the U.S armed forces will have fifty two hundred on the border by the end of this week\nUm we are continuing to ensure that all us laws are enforced and upheld but at the same time right now we're not able to detain illegal aliens\nThroughout the tendency of their immigration hearing right now we're forced to release after twenty days if you're a family unit the words out Laura I mean right now we're seeing a six hundred and twenty percent increase in family unit apprehensions and the last five years\nWhere I record number of family that apprehensions this year alone what that says if you have a child with you we have to release you went to the interior there's also a hundred and ten percent increase in the last two years of male adults coming with children than ever before\nWe're not able to detain them and immediately return with our us immigration laws right now so even if we have the space until Congress acts there's not much we can do and the way of deterrent to immediately apprehend and repatriate which which is border security\nWhere if there were children but if they're individuals without children you could detain them at the border correct\nCorrect and we're actually repatriating about eighty percent of the male adults that we apprehend\nOkay well that's a that's a pretty decent percentage well record\nLow a male um of adult apprehensions this year I think it's like a Nineteen Seventy one is the last time we were the slow in\nTerms of adult apprehension you know so that you're able\nTo deliver a consequence know migration pattern changed when we're able to say that we're going to refer you for prosecution you broke US law we're going to send you to a judge and have a penalty you know illegal aliens they they know they know are you a lot better than members of Congress to\nAh this was Terry McAuliffe course a good front of the Clintons former governor of Virginia a speaking about the uh the use I mean current governor of Virginia speaking about the use of the military let's listen\nTo a thousand miles away their goal in three miles an hour isn't this several weeks by the time they did it and here's the point\nHe did as the show today to deploy the army do there what a disgrace this man has no politicized the military and his use or military for political purposes it's wall I was in the Marines today I can tell you is ... children who were wearing the cost of our country to protect our country\nPresident should not politicize it\nA former governor of Virginia obviously this is called sleeping for three hours a night a Katie uh you you you heard what he said the president by referencing the military as he has been doing sending them to the border\nThat that is politicizing the military\n[noise] you know all I just say is that President didn't create this caravan this caravan you know took off with no control over who started it and when you know in Central America but I Will tell you that there is no way in which a large group of migrants should be able to come into our United States\nAs a large group just because you were in that group this president has every right to ensure that our borders are secure and defended\nAnd that's what he's done\nAnd the homeland security department people you know think about you know border control and immigration and Customs Enforcement ice as part of homeland security now right I always think it's part of state but it's part of homeland security correct\nAbsolutely so we got the left wants to abolish ice on despite\nAll the great work I spoke with human trafficking drug interdiction uh and obviously important work and deporting a dangerous people from the United states\nUm but I think people don't really quite comprehend that this is not a victimless crime illegal immigration their their victims or economic victims there\nThe effect on public schools affecting our health care system how closely is homeland security working with other agencies on the effects on American society of math illegal immigration\nThe secretaries just in Yuma, Arizona last week with both Ron fatality acting ice director and Kevin ... and that had US Customs and border protection to meet with local sheriffs local officials to ensure that they have the resources they need to handle the influx of family units\nThat they see at the border you know we're meeting with these NGOs and these communities to ensure that we aren't just releasing into communities because of the sheer number we're seeing every day at the border I mean but someone has to pick up the tab when we transfer aliens to hospitals\nAnd that is the American taxpayer\nAnd I think people forget that every time you you see the illegal immigrants dropped off a bus depots or even flown around you know the the when you know the kids are kids are coming on accompanied they're placed with a quote sponsor sponsors sometimes themselves are illegal immigrants\nThat costs money it doesn't come out of thin air as my mother used to say somebody has to pay the tab\nNow we have Thirteen thousand children unaccompanied alien children in a church has custody right now they cost us taxpayers thirty three thousand dollars each annually\nWow just that just the people have to chew over that figure thirty three thousand dollars each illegal immigrant in the United states annually in the American taxpayer\nThat's more than it costs for me to go to college\nOh my gosh this was Brock Obama just a few days ago on the uh mid term trail referencing this issue of the caravan and the president's concern about it once was\nMiserable in the midst of a bunch of\nMalnourished Xi's above ... miles away [laughter]\nBut most importantly gonna\n[noise]\nEven know where all the way down there for\nFear mongering could\nLast year we apprehended Seventeen thousand criminal aliens at the border three thousand special interest aliens we know that there are criminals and this flow and the care of and that is headed north border security includes the ability to remove those we apprehend and gives us the right to defend our borders it's that simple\nWaldman spokesperson for U.S Department of homeland security Katie thanks so much we'll check back with you soon we'll take a break on the lower
