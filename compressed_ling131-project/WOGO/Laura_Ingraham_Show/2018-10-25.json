hearty courageous a mom still still has that frontier feeling well the the ... not very popular a state\nBut it's a pro Trump conservative\nPro Second Amendment of course and believe in fairness just general fairness in the cabinet deal just wasn't fair and I think most people just law that you know and so she's obviously not going to apologize for not supporting him but I think that was the\nStraw that broke the Democrats back\nIt was ... but at the same time you know I've had a double digit lead for quite a while on her and\nAnd I think the comparison was already resonating with with North Dakota and she just blew up with the cab nothing because again her everything she's pretended to be was revealed in one major illustration so and the fair to say she was really big but also\nShe's a former state attorney general she was a former North Dakota attorney general so the idea that you didn't understand fairness or due process or the value of it at a time Laura when the polls in North Dakota\nNever showed ... never showed even thirty percent support for a for opposing cabinet but rather short anywhere from sixty to fifty sixty sixty four percent\nFavoring confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh so\nIt wasn't like she didn't know where North Dakota and stood so she had a hard time and by the way even ... blaming her ... she changed her her opinion first she believed him and believed a professor port then she didn't believe\nHim but believe professor for it and then it was not about that at all it was about his demeanor she watched his hearing or you know with the sound turned off and noticed his demeanor\nYou know it just ... it was phony on top of phony and again I think it was just the veil removed\nBecause everything you described about North Dakota's lord that the independent spirit the rug and is\nThe frontier spirit that's what she has pretended to be and now all of a sudden it's quite clear that she's really quite a liberal activist\nNo I think again people have been well they've been exposed during the Trump era\nThan media has had a ...\nMirror um I think raised up to their bias and it comes out in different ways but Trump really has driven people to just peroxide the frenzy and fury and upset and and the left always takes it too far they took it too far with\nKavanaugh or we don't know what's really going on with this these packages that were sent to Trump's critics but people have a lot of theories there um\nAnd I and the leftist they're never satisfied with they get one thing and that's like okay we're going to go to the ... and now we're going to push for universal health care and it's gonna be Medicare for all and it's going to be healthcare for illegal immigrants than\nA one lesson that you you know assuming un what's it looks like you're going to um congressmen in North Dakota or what lesson do you share with others who are listening across the country about about this period and politics and\nWhat we need to do to keep this prosperity going obviously the markets had a rough ride unless you days but in general things can't be couldn't be going much better on the economy\n[laughter] no you know the main lesson I Would share and and you know I was a energy regulator before I went to Congress six years ago in in North Dakota and the the thing I Would share is\nLet's return to a respect for steaks ... you know the the these incredible laboratories of democracy called states will show the way in North Dakota chief among them and by the way\nSo will the soul of the states that I Would consider bad states at places like California North Dakota is the second leading producer of oil in the in the country not because we produce more necessarily although we have a lot of it obviously in technologies unlocked it but but because places like California that have lots of it has screwed it up\nOkay they have a right to do that and and they have a right to have a a cost of living higher than than there are a ... quality of life\nBut I I'd say that the thing I'd say is this trust the laboratories of freedom at the state level and that's what President Trump has done he's restored\nStates' rights and and that's what we're together but cabinet does on the courts and ... and just trust people at the most basic and local level and that means with their tax dollars that means with regulations it means having a respect for a return to\nCooperative federalism and you're going to find a federal government that's far more efficient and much less not necessary frankly in many cases and you'll have a you know you don't have a much better country in my view\nUm congressman finally or a month at a time but your thoughts on the sun packages arriving at the residences or offices of Trump's critics\nWell it's my first thought is as a as a member of Congress my first thought is you know here we go again and whether it's you know the left or the right we all need to be more diligent ... and it's frankly it's scary um but my my main thought his let's please not jump to conclusions let's\nYou know this was less than twenty four hours old let's let's calm down let's let the FBI and the other law enforcement agencies do their work and let's see we're all of this leads before we create something you know different than than the reality that it that is behind it all in the meantime it's always a good opportunity for self reflection on\nOn our own individual behavior in what contribution if any we make to this this discourse that's going on this lack of civility and uh without pointing fingers today I think it's a good time for us to look at ourselves\nKnow it's a great way and I'm putting it um and we really wish you the very best in this election coming up on November sex Kevin Cramer I think it'll be the next senator and the great state of North Dakota I think North Dakota is the only state in the hole\nSenator and the great state of North Dakota I

behind why they're doing it I mean\nIt's it's detracted from any other news is on the on the TV right now this is the rate at the front of you know everybody right now\nSo I don't know what political motives are trying to establish here what they're trying or ideology is trying to push for it but at the bottom line is is there's a clear cut a disruption of of normal normal news that would be out there\nAnd when you think about how this individual would be\nTrack what again with authorities be looking at\nLooking at um you know trying to establish the person did it or not to give away all the

um there's lots of entry a value to this\nUm which they should be able to ascertain that a lot of information over the next few days\nWell it seems also that they've had a uh they've had an ability to to know that some of them didn't actually go through the post office they were hand delivered or one one initially said it was delivered by courier the stamps weren't actually stamped\nThat's all well ...\nYeah it is a hard and you would think or someone had to pay for that so they should be able to to track down who gave it to that person who actually delivered it trace it back to where it came from I mean\nAre there has to be some kind of accountability or to a courier service there who who you know where they picked it up where they got it and how they got it there\nNow if it's an inert powder as it looks like it was again not meant to detonate um another comment that was made yesterday was that if you're going to send something\nIn in in you really wanted it to cause damage you wouldn't send it like this like a letter or a letter bomb apparently can be make much more lethal than a package like with a pipe that people kept saying that you don't send a pipe bomb like this through\nThe postal service because it's too easily detected is or anything to that\n[laughter] well I mean if you look or you know historical data the uh bombs have been used you know through the mail um especially when you have like a you know Ted Ted Kaczynski and what you did it or go the Unabomber stuff I mean you can use the the post office used other various means the\nCourier service FedEx or whatever but it's even a day you're not going to use what they used in the last few days that you're going to use something that's not the technical\nLooking at this again refer back to the

they're terrorists and that they do terrorize people\nAnd they're meant to intimidate and dominate the news ah and get attention a and perhaps make a political point of one sort or another but we don't know yet we don't know exactly what went down\nA we have a lot more to get to on the lower income show the campaign or it's heating up both in Florida where we had another debate last night between Rhonda Santas and Andrew Gillum\nAnd now it's tightening Gillum had opened up a sizeable lead over on the fantasy congressmen so that all important governorship\nIn the sunshine state and now it's you know about six points\nAnd Andrew Gillum is now having to explain themselves are given the fact that he lied on TV about accepting gifts\nOr from a lobbyist well it turns out that the land developer that he believes wasn't land developer turns out it was a a a FBI had been surveilling him\nAnd it looks like he had walked right into the trap and I guess thought he could get away with lying about it I don't\nTo me this whole thing is very strange with Gillum claiming that he's not under investigation how can they not be under investigation when the FBI had this ongoing operation involving him\nAnd ... with text messages now confirming that he knew he was getting theater tickets other benefits uh from someone who was ultimately the developers thinking favors\nTrying to use his brother Marcus as a shield for the past through these gifts so Andrew Gillum finding himself in a heap of trouble and of course is playing the race card in order to avoid answering the the tough

cycle of this caravan continues\nIts way up than up north and it broke early this morning that general Madison is expected to send a eight hundred more troops to the southern border\nA defense

final details are being worked out including where the troops will come from and their specific tasks\nNot yet clear if part or all of the new deployment will be federally activated National Guard forces or in fact active duty troops\nThe troops will not engage in lethal operations to stop the migrants instead they're expected to provide fencing wall materials and other technical support oh that's ... that's going to work at several points along the border where does believe the migrants may try to cross\nThe troops will also provide tents and medical care for border authorities in those areas the troops retain the right\nAh as it says of self defense\nBut border patrol officers will still be the one physically stopping illegal migration\nThe troops\nAre expected to be in position next week this deployment is separate from an ongoing National Guard effort along the border to support border authorities with other technical assistance but what do you make of this\nAh my concern is that because it's\nNot that they can defend themselves but my concern is that someone in this crowd maybe someone who infiltrate the crowd or someone who wants to cause trouble will try to trigger

they can stay they know they just have\nTo show up and they're going to be given a asylum interview they state they have credible fear they give it a few talking points that are already given to them on the way by immigration activists and then they get waved into the country they get a driven to a bus depot they get a bus ticket and then they're off\nI Hope so why wouldn't all of Guatemala and El Salvador and Honduras eventually figure out a way to get to the border and come into the United states they're not going to be deported unless they commit a violent crime and even then\nThey have sanctuary states and cities who won't hold individuals once they're released so they can be picked up by ice and deported\nSo we're making it an obvious choice for\nPeople who want to come to the United states and not go through legal channels we're we're we the people of this country if we don't get leaders in place who do this job right then we're going to see our country ultimately lost to illegal immigration we have now more than twenty two million people\nWho are illegal aliens living in the United states many of them are children who then have family ties here they've worked here are some of them criminals the lion share or not but they are here\nAnd they're not going anywhere so the question is it true just drop all pretense of a border disappointed by I mean you could see the art of it's just easier at this point that we don't have a border okay there's no border just come in if you want I don't think most people want that there was a\nGreat piece in American greatness dot com about how illegal immigration has hurt black Americans most\nJust published yesterday\nAnd the reason for this is that most illegal immigrants overwhelmingly seek work in the low skilled labor market first and because black American a labor force is so disproportionately concentrated in the same low wage sector that same urban areas\nWhere illegal immigrants flood into so there's little doubt that there are significant overlapping competition for jobs\nIn this sector of the labor market so given the inordinately high unemployment rate still for low skill black workers it's obvious that the major loser in this competition are low skilled black workers'\nWages are under\nCut by people who prefer to be paid in cash or we have fix Social Security numbers and African Americans\nAre in other poor Americans are\nLeft to deal with this it's wildly unfair uh Bob in Florida on line four\nAnd I will tell you this ah Rhonda Santa is the only choice for Florida\nOh we're going to play the sound from a last\nNight's debate in earlier that demonstrates why Andrew Gillum\nCompletely and I played with the truth to put it politely about his acceptance of gifts from lobbyists and those who seek\nPolitical favors are political consideration which that should it ended up itself that should be disqualified and he's blaming race of course for any question about his ethics\nSo we'll play the race card of the soundbite more coming up let's go to Bob Bob welcome [noise]\nThey were you bring it up is Andrew Gillum gets elected up without a leash Florida with like ... that's\nThat's just the first point but ... about all the people she going to be down there at the border walking and people will take them into is a little\nBit of all those people are called the cheese steaks and they want to be part of us without carrying American flags while they are carrying flashing their own country slugs around they don't want to come here to be Americans do you want to come here to take what we have with it for us\nAlong some excellent points are carrying the Honduran flag other blue flags that's a blue wave blue wave of foreign foreign flags on the Democrats know this has trouble or ... why haven't authorities given us more information about what's in these packages that's a good question people are asking that\nLou Dobbs tweeted about that whether they're a hoax or where actual bombs\nThey were clearly what the timing in in the eyes of many at least people think they were clearly designed to influence the election talk about election meddling\nIn a violent attempted violence attempted intimidation attempted terrorizing I'm ... I mean we we do deserve information probably faster than we are getting it but I think they don't want to copy cats and\nSo forth so I understand that as well oh let's go to Theresa Oklahoma Theresa welcome [noise]\nI Would like to hear these who are in favor of the illegal immigration pointedly asked how much of your personal time in your personal many do you spend on humanitarian causes and helping your fellow man I\nHave all ideas it's not very much it's just the soundbite for them and they really have no care\nFor those that are around them they don't have a charity in their hearts it's all about political maneuvering\nThat's a great point well I think again if you if people are willing to sponsor\nIndividuals who apply for legal of entry into the United states sponsor them economically sponsor their education sponsor their learning English and be fit financially accountable for them\nAnd also civil reliable if they commit crimes I don't think you'd see many people signing up\nI mean we know they enforce their their perimeter around their house with alarms and\nFences and gates and and servants [laughter] I mean these people\nHave more more of a perimeter then the White House and they're complaining about our border being enforced or say it's not fair I don't know how many people John Case it gets taken into his own um his own you know governor's mansion and Im sure you can take in a few it's pretty nice house it's a great point\nAll right you're listening to the lower income show a very tight race\nIn Indiana and we're going to talk to Mike Braun who's challenging the Democrat incumbent Joe Donnelly its its neck and neck it's up to point down two points so this is a tight race we're going to talk to Mike about\nIndiana as a ... it's a reliably red state meeting a conservative state so why should there be any question that the governor of that great state where Mike Pence came from of course a should also not be a Republican strong conservative\nAnd what what Indiana's think today\nExcuse me ... me for the Democrats are incumbents that are I think governor I'm so I have a governor on my mind a so obviously Joe Joe Donnelly for

without the capital\nYou know Bob but uh just a lot of good things have happened we brought a good campaign and we've resource to competitively in great fundraising and\nNot a whole lot different than executing a business plan and uh we feel good about where we are\nA well Mike the concern today and the part of the media these packages that arrived and\nUh the offices and residences of Trump's critics prominent people from John Brennan to Joe Biden or and what what is your take on this as a criticism of the president it was almost instantly even though he condemned this of course and ask for national unity it was not good enough\nOr and they're blaming him for creating the atmosphere that resulted in these packages being sent\nOne of the president's been blamed for everything gets no knowledge but for the main thing he's done the reason I'm running is uh I wouldn't be running for ah invent another outcome and sixteen now we've got a rare opportunity\nTo kind of shake the system and fix what's broken and uh he they're still really litigating I think the\nTwo thousand sixteen race and that's why he gets a no credit for the great agenda that's out there that's a exciting Hoosier Z and uh he was popular and sixteen here among conservatives and even more so and I even think the people that maybe don't love his style are going to look at the results and uh\nI think that's why I'm winning this race that's why Joe Donnelly has tried to\nBecome so Trump you when you don't eat ever a you know there's been always with the liberal side of his party's so uh\nUm I think this is just another example of how they try to distract than a give him absolutely no credit for all the good things happening\nMaxine Waters said today she responded to these packages saying I ain't scared on she called on the president to take responsibility for the kind of violence we're seeing for the first time in different ways well this is a year plus after Steve ... was almost killed\nAt the hands of aid rabid Trump a hater Andy Bernie Sanders supporter\nAnd everyone seems to forget what happened if that guy wasn't style of the security there would have been dozens dead\n[noise] exactly I mean it's a litany of um I think the real exposure to this kind of approach occurred in the capital hearings and all of its challenging Democrats in these red states or the amount of just absolute negative or lives and distortions that\nSchumer's packs up into George Soros and the rest of 'em uh\nI think it's exposed and ugly underbelly of uh what they're about which is a lack of any message completely obstructing and trying to play down all the good things that are happening with the Trump agenda\nAnd I think voters are going to hold them accountable uh I think uh\nThe capital hearings for who's yours would have been apart the point where\nOur race changed in many others and I think enough was enough for him they related back to my race and many others I sell something Fox dead on across the board the negative advertising that just swamped the airwaves and that's because they're afraid of their record\nWell again the Democrats don't want to debate the issues because they have absolutely gone out of the business if they ever were in the business of a proposal to actually advance\nOur economy or or grow our prosperity are enforced the border I mean they're just not interested in those conversations so they resort to\nPersonal attacks and even on issues where they agree on to some extent like Schumer agrees with some of the things that Trump is doing on trade he won't talk about those because you can't give the president any credit for anything anytime anywhere\nDoubt about it I'll give you a great example in my race I took all the health insurance companies about ten years ago to make sure you know be Affordable Care act the first word of it it never was and it was doomed to fail because you had big government hooked up with big healthcare is a specific\nAnd it was doomed to fail because she had big government hooked up with big healthcare specifically insurance and I covered preexisting conditions and no cap on coverage\nAnd lore of health premiums flat for ten years and it's the absolute truth and it's kind of blow them up in the sense that they can't believe a conservative actually mine out of the solution for what they you know that's their pivotal issue they think they went on and all I did was\nMade of consumer driven made a transparent the kind of things that you'd like in free markets in a great result I go to the set up talk about that and that's why we're going to win that race against the guy like Joe Donnelly who spent\nA career politician that's never had an original idea since he's been there\nI think that again when you when you see how absolutely nutty the left is driven by the Trump a progressive results the economy\nThe fact that he's not going to be back on his heels and constantly apologizing I mean that's the that's the type of Republican they liked the best they like some of like a John Case that coups forever back on his heels and apologizing for being a conservative and Trump's is not going to do that and that drives me crazy and he calls them out on and and I think it's a little\nLong since pass the time we had that type of planes speaking politician\nWell I mean thank goodness that's exactly where I'm coming from an alarm the other thing you're going to get\nThis agenda really healed then I talked about tax reform and I do think it's a income but the polling conservatives are business owners value got more Django in your pocket share it with your employers we've done that by\nFurther lowering healthcare costs after keeping the plot for ten years and are preached out all the time you do that\nI really believe that's the signature piece of legislation that they gambled would not be appreciated we've had ten months people now adding up\nMore money in their own pocket and if you get business owners like us that ... gone out there in touted tax reform we want to share the benefits with your employers people quit looking through the\nFalse hope of a federal government that the Democrats believe and that hasn't delivered over the last two or three decades and really put his you\nKnow on the brink of a financial calamity if we don't get more people in there they're going to be able to solve things and not worry about the political ramifications that's why I'm going you know there'll be more obvious but I think that jump on the bandwagon stick our necks out and joined the uh your Trump trains so\nA lot of ... well we cannot wait for election day uh Mike I think you're going to win this race or the people of Indiana and we have a huge audience in Indiana\nYou got to get out there and vote get everyone you know to get get to the polls vote for in advancing economy an uh an America that's growing that's more confident and optimistic and do
