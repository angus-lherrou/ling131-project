and said show on the stump John Berman said there's\nNothing like making a joke at a body slamming a reporter what another journalist was dismembered his fingers cut off three weeks ago and the administration has been dealing with that damage control and trying to provide cover for the Saudis frankly that very day\nAnd that night the president's impulses to joke about an unprovoked attack on a reporter sent Jacobs by the Scottish\n... he's talking about Greg ... a ... G ... GM forte who's running for ah for Congress out there in Montana um does this Walsh with you\nDoes this negate the mobs somehow out there a swarming Capitol Hill in your community in marches and rallies breaking windows antifa\nThat whole ah explosion of violence and hate we're seeing\nDoes a congressman in a disagreement with a reporter who slams them down equate with these mobs were saying by the way that happened back months and months ago\nAnd is Trump side comment I I think it's just a joke I and and to add to this\nNot unlike Lesley Stahl which we we decompose ... or ... or a demystify that interview written decompose we broke it down for you last week earlier in the show\nAnd Lesley Stahl unwittingly I Believe no was really used by the president as as a stand in for the rest of the media\nAnd I think when when the media begins its echo and they stop having original thoughts but begin to echo one another the public utterly tunes them out in fact this is why I Believe so many Democrats gave the president a second look\nBecause they said wait a minute wait if all these people are against him and they're all saying the same thing what is this guy really doing and they looked closely\nThat may be what's happening now as we approach these midterms I see some of these polls everything tightening up that naturally happens in the mid term\nOr will there be a Trump effect let's go to cliff New Jersey what do you think cliff what move do you what is moving you to the polls what's the issue\nWhat is your meat to the polls is that the Democrats I Believe are behind this march and drink at all you talking heads\nShould find out who's paying for their bathrooms who's trying to treat him coming north and you're going to find those Democrats and then publish it and that total change\nMhm you're talking about the caravan which we're going to get into it in a moment Pat Buchanan joining us uh yeah that caravan is moving up and look I'm there is certainly\nA an\nEcosystem let's put it that way there is an ecosystem of support for this caravan individuals who fund the housing the food the legal services for members of this carbon and not only that carbon but more I I don't know if\nYou saw the story the other day Lutheran refugee services as well as a Catholic migration refugee services came up with a statement demanding that we'd be more welcoming to not only these ... but anyone seeking to come to the United states of course they get\nHundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants every year that had been stymied by the Trump policies you see as his contract that the number of refugees allowed into the country their coffers of emptied\nSo they have a material financial interest in this and\nIt's hard to think that these dramatic displays the people crowding the border and that's what's happening now by the way\nApart from the Caribbean we're seeing a surge of the border and it's not individuals it's families because they know that's their ticket in you have a kid it's a ticket into the country and they can't refuse you and I can't separate you\nSo you have a catch and release policy happening where they're coming across the border we're taking their names are releasing them into mainland America\nYour thoughts on that is that a concern at all\nWill get into all of that with Pat Buchanan cliff thank you very much for the

from ramps and we're\nThat the Democrats are trying to use in these midterms might not be effective given the difficult tense out there\nWell I think my ... in my view the Democrats have no agenda mainly economy isn't very good shape extremely good shape unemployment under four percent [noise] but when the economy is good the economy is usually not the issue something else becomes issue\nA and I think that the that the Democrats are really they're pushing this ... thing\nAnd the the murder of him and this tremendously it'll or a tale of murder and the consulate in Turkey I think too\nYou know they're they they have no agenda and their season upon this and tried to attach it to to Trump but this is a what exactly for him and his the Democratic party's great agenda what is their contract with America what are they going to do more than they are going to do since the only house they can get I Believe is\nThe one house of representatives what is their agenda they don't have one\nThe big issue in this campaign is Trump\nRight no that's all they have I mean this is the he is he is the centerpiece and I'm ... now you're seeing some pollster saying by internal polls\nAre the president's approval ratings are are surging and that the Republicans could squeak out just enough seats to hold onto the majority if that doesn't happen if the Democrats take control of the house even by a slim majority what do you think happens what will the next year look like\n... [laughter] I'm sure did at all [laughter]\nBut now you've variation that you know as far as the eye can see anything\nThat can enact anything they can't you know we revised Obamacare and send it over to Republican Senate\nThen sent it down through President Trump at the White House so they can do anything so they're going to investigate everything they will be looking into his tax returns are going to be looking into any financial connections with Saudi Arabia they're going to get the Boulder report\nThey'll be looking into alleged\nYou know alleged obstruction of justice and the Russia investigation all of these things and New York\nThe southern district of New York will be investigating and the grand jury here in DC so I think that's all that they've got going for the you know but they don't want to raise the real issue you've wondered if you ask him deeply what you believe it ought to be they would say you know the goal here is impeach Trump and lock him up\nBut you know I hadn't announced that is your goal\nAnd you shrink your base your democratic base down to it's hard core which is insufficient to win the house of representatives to the degree that you rally those folks in the Democratic party on that issue\nYou don't get the broad based sort of the ballots and you live over in northern Virginia you know they've got a fighting chance on this congressional district here right if you did something like that it would kill it\n... that I Want to play something you you just mentioned the impeachment the I word impeachment uh last night made or go to bed oh three James a NATO Rourke um who is Ted Cruz's challenger in Texas did a town hall meeting and he had this this thing\nAnd you said in July that you would as a member of the house right now voted to impeach have you changed your mind I haven't according to the constitution that mean that the president has committed the crime that tree than primary primary or a high crime and misdemeanor which one of those do you think the president has committed\nI wouldn't like in an impeachment to an indictment there there was nothing there to proceed with a trial for a full vetting of the facts and to make the best informed decision in the interests of this country and our future\nYour reaction to that that does that help him and helped democratic candidates across the gun it\nStill didn't hear the charge was\nThe exact opposite [laughter]\nDoes that help it doesn't help better over work and it was in a and veterans got his own problems he's nine or ten voyage down with sixty two million and the bad guy thing but I you know no I don't take it helps him I think\nWhat federal work it seems to me he's running short of heart left or very far left for Texas a course in parliament for the Democratic party I'm beginning to wonder if he doesn't see himself as Abe Lincoln or lost the Senate race in Eighteen fifty eight and came back to win the presidency and and the Eighteenth shifting\nYeah well aside from height to there's very little commonality there that I think you I don't remember honest Abe on a skateboard but maybe I missed that chapter you you'll find a little I don't I don't know what I'm going to put him in a corner you and put you on the record year\nDo you think the Republicans hold the house and Senate going into these midterms where do you think the populace is right now you know the the the the people out there who are elected from\nI think the I think over all that you would have to say that the Democrats are probably going to get to twenty three votes to take a house I mean that would be a dramatic victory over the Republicans and I think the Republicans are favored by even more to hold on to the Senate\nThey've gotta lose a number of races where they're hit right now to lose the Senate and so I Would say it's going to be a Republican Senate dealing with Supreme Court nominees and appellate court nominees and it could be a Democratic House with all these investigation is all the rest but I don't necessarily believe\nThat it's a bad thing to have Nancy Pelosi's crowd and in charge of the house and doing all these things with the American people I don't think you're going to be enthusiastic about it especially if they've got great foreign domestic problems\nMhm have you can always great to hear from you thank you for joining us and we will be in touch OK you take it easy right thank you fat\nAnd er into old you are listening what is driving you to the polls this November are you is is there an issue it was the one

I think there are some industry is lagging Steve and um I thank you and appreciate the call I\n... and here's the thing that I Would say and if you are right now is the time for the president to back off the the bruise or if you will and start being the the the salesmen Trump and selling the great things he's delivered on and that are already under way\nOr we do have great economic news the the industrial output the manufacturing output the the the unemployment\nBut at the same time Steve there are people like you who aren't feeling the full effects of this and need to know that the a he's doing everything he can be the president is not a wizard or a magician\nHe doesn't fix everybody every aspect of every life\nThe only things as I mentioned a pet can and the two things that that people want from a precedent our security\nAnd prosperity and prosperity is best gained\nBy having an even playing field where you're not owners sleep tax to regulate it out of business and where you can you can grow a business and grow a family that's what the president should be about I think that is what he's about but that's a very limited he's powers are limited\nAnd I think the media and everybody else I mean why are we focusing on\nA journalist that may have been brutalized by Saudi Arabia now I understand he wrote for the post\nUp but we can't control Saudi Arabia\nThere are rogue regimes all over the damn world Cuba China North Korea or some of our allies including Saudi Arabia when you get into the middle east it is a crap shoot and let me tell ya they don't they don't you're talking about due process\nNo due process their due process is well let's see what side do you want to be roasted all well and from my understanding\nAs well as the the journalist wasn't even a U.S citizen of course he was resigning here but yeah he's or domestic Saudi Arabia politics problems I Know would be best advised us or does not have any interest in moving in these ...\nYeah well it's an ... it's beyond the president's ah of capabilities and frankly beyond his purview he did what he could and what he did was he sent Mike Pompeo to question them we should be concerned and I had been concerned about four years about human rights religious rights abroad\nWe have to protect those and use the might of America to push these regimes toward greater freedom and liberty for their people but that said we're not we don't have dominion over those countries all you can do is suggest push agitate and that's what the president did enough\nEnough but I the media I can prove it to\nMSNBC and CNN all last night and the night before ran on this or a ... story okay the journalists that may have been mutilated\nDismembered in a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey okay we've got two problems here turkey and Saudi Arabia\nOkay neither of them have particularly great human rights records in fact they don't\nBut we can only call them out MSNBC and CNN lead with this for two nights they lost the ratings by double digits Fox had more viewers than both of them combined\nNo one is interested in this story and it doesn't change one American Life and it doesn't affect our policy with presidents the in the least and it'll have no impact on the midterms so to push that narrative\nAnd to drive it to try to hit Trump it's stupid it doesn't work we're going to take a quick break when

posters at NYU there were all these little these little violence ... violence so we we drove recently called them the pansies anyway um tell me where we stand in these midterms mad\nOr when you look at the polling data a real clear politics has the the generic ballot Republicans down seven points does that mean anything when we're this close at this late date\nYeah it does rain if it's a great question you know basically that their ballot has been as high as fourteen Fifteen points a CNN poll\nTen days ago or ... or so that show that that why what you're seeing is that it almost all the polling that they are now that's a that's a common thread that a generic ballots start off very bad for Republicans because there are a lot of big cities and quite frankly they're caught a lot of people who aren't at work which don't tend to be Republicans\nAre and as you get close election they got a better idea actually in a boat or a ... term it's like you know roughly ... percent of the people vote so the Tour de ... going to vote it that's the real tricky question\nYup well here's here's the thing I'm there is this other CBS battleground poll\nThat has Democrats up three in the toss up districts now if you only up three and a toss up districts that's within the margin of error and in the Trump total era I I I have to look at that and say this could go anyway this this is yeah I like to call right\nI was in Florida for a speech this week I had a one or two about to be in the lobby the hotel I've noticed is a clean story don't worry as you said um she said\nHey I I just want you to do I never voted in the mid term I'm so bad about the ... street capping off I'm voting for the first time it it it it ... this is this this is the silent vote are not going to get picked up and all I think it's absolutely a dynamic that's Eighteen\nSimilar to how it was it ... ... there's a lot of Democrats who are looking at their own already\nYou know a Gallup poll came out rented that fifty seven percent Democrats are comfortable with the idea of being a socialist party the Democratic party shifting becoming much more radicalized that\nMuch more radicalized that means that in the swing districts that you're talking about that uh you know the the the whole question about electing socialists\nPeople like or cause you Cortez et cetera uh it's really wake you a lot of people at a normal folks countries say maybe I'll vote\nYeah and I I I also think when you see these explosions as we just played from uh NYU last night attacking a above a statesman like Henry Kissinger he's Ninety five years old and\nWhen you see people yeah quite mental that is what I thought you were going to tell me about the woman who came up to in Florida Man I thought she was going accused you of

nationalized what was a local race a few weeks ago\nWell first of all its historic better president would stand by a nominee like cat at the end it's historic that our president\nWould basically go all over the country it's aggressively nonstop fashion to campaign for all these candidates and I do agree with you I think it's nationalize that they can the air from\nEverything is about Trump even if they try to make it about Trump he's too big of a personality he's too big of a player in our politics so yes it's\nAbout chocolate Republicans run from it because they don't like a horse what he does or making a mistake\nBut voters that difference that down separate the one guy they don't think that every Republican his truck they know how Trump is and I don't know why some of these Republicans have so much trouble just be yourself be who you are authenticity is on the rise of politics and that's a good thing\nIs the reality the Democrats don't have any stars with Trump's magnitude they really can't\nCompete and there's no leader and there's no articulated governing vision that's the other problem with these people um what are your concerns though Matt should the
