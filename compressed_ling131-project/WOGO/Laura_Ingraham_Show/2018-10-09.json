also here's how effective it is I work with a lot of young people and I don't mean young\nTwenty five I mean you know thirty five and ... one one of the guys who works with me who's an intelligent enough guy says to me yesterday as it pertains to Kavanaugh he goes look I don't get it why don't we just why didn't they just\nGet rid of him and get another guy in there get rid of the guy who has all the baggage on all the past and just get a guy in there with a you know a clean record and move forward I don't understand why they didn't do that like you don't understand why they couldn't do that you know what do you mean all the baggage\nAll the stuff that got hooked up in the eleventh hour all the stuff that wasn't substantiate it all and said allegations from high school there there was your book I said what do you think that we're due to the next guy but he literally thought well just got a new guy in there and then he'll get a fair shake everyone moves forward\nI think that any other president would have probably drop Kavanaugh um\nAny other animals I think of other guys who ran against Trump in the twenty Eighteen twenty sixteen primary\nHow many of them was stuck it out and fought for this nomination I don't think a lot of Trump knew that this was\nSomething you could not back down from he wasn't going to apologize and I think Adam known we really find out what really happened here it's going to be a lot more sinister than we know right now with the with these accusations that came forward\nWell I agree with that but this is just your average citizen who is a good guy who just watches CNN and MSNBC NBC\nAnd that's where he gets his information and he'd legitimately wants to know what's what's wrong with Kavanaugh mhm and that's to me where the real battle is this isn't a bad guy and he's not even a particularly political guy he just watches\nNBC and MSNBC and CNN and he gets all\nThe information and it's all going through the filter\nAnd so ... what choice but draw these conclusions he couldn't do it couldn't draw any other conclusions you wouldn't either that's the only place you got your news\nYeah man you didn't have parents or anyone else kind of guiding you to the right well at least an objective kind of understanding okay this this is Kevin ... opinions you wrote three hundred he was a Bush guys in the Bush White House for seven years\nWas Justice Kennedy's Locklear come in it's not some fire breathing person's going to burn down to the Supreme Court's got you know but you're right that that's not what they're interested in they're interested in dominating the discussion Adam to the point that people are afraid to speak out and now those images and those video clips\nOf people like Susan Collins been cornered with her back against the law in an elevator\nI mean I think they would have to walk through that crowd on Saturday I don't know if she would have survived it\nFrankly\nWhere you know it's interesting because I grew up around it I grew up in the seventies I had a kind of a hippie ...\nAnd it's so funny because when you think of sort of hit the or progressive no one says hippie anymore but sort of progressive sort of tree hugger piece lover I'm going to take my daisy and I'm going to put it in a barrel of the garden\nThe national guardsmen just but nice that been near is rage it's so funny it's almost an application to hide the rage the hippies were some of the most angry people I've ever met when I was a kid I figured this one out\nMy mom was kind of a hippie but she was also kind of rage fall and I think it's a compensation for the anger that's in them you know\nA picture a Rosie O'Donnell remember the old Rosie odonnell with the ... to ... to ... Chubb club member her\nTV show from the nineties was there ever a more ... sweet character ever she's up there to big fluffy sweaters that she's laughing at it\nThat was a over compensation for the rage will Rosie O'Donnell and I think all the free to be you and me tree hugging\nA three lovers I think there's rage and it's funny because they've always painted the right as the angry war mongers Gore so Rachel but look at all the rage on the left\nWell there there again their anger is completely\nDisconnected from the overall mood of the country so as long as long I mean literally said Hillary in there and we had seven percent unemployment in interest rates were going up and\nWe were in Syria and I'm more military ... more military in Syria Adam ... they'd be fine as long as they're there are social construct as being foisted upon the American public so their their their happiness political happiness exists only as America is being transformed in their direction\n\nYes it's true it's it's a kind of adolescent approach to life if you're in your room and you have your toys\nWho cares if the whole neighborhood is crumbling as long as you're occupied with what you want or you're watching what you want to continue to be sort of a ... with immediate gratification so yes it's true listen I live in Los Angeles I I I get it\nBut I you have to step over piles of homeless people were going to have a a typist that epidemic coming any day now because uh the homeless people are getting the fleas from the rats I mean it is it's Saddam and Gomorrah here but as long as uh the folks in power keep their power\nUh they're they're happy now their rage roll again\nAgainst Trump don't get me wrong but we have I live in one of the worst runs cities in the in the country\nYeah well again [laughter] and I'm Carl is with us here on the ...
