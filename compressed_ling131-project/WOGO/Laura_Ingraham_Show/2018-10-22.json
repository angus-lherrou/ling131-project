said he sought building a wall along the southern border was political theater when\nHe was governor he gave valid state issue taxpayer paid for driving certificates to sixty one thousand illegal aliens he may tend to see a haven for\nIllegal aliens and our general assembly stepped in and stopped that policy and got rid of it but this is the difference I Believe in building a wall he thinks it's political theater\nI fought against when I was in the state Senate giving any kind of valid state issue id to illegal aliens he gave them those certificates and I believe we need to end all sanctuary city policies I think we need to end chain migration I think we need to end\nThis diversity lottery and I think Silk Road is somebody there at the border welcoming download giving them\nA state issued id and of course we know the Washington Democrats are the ones that want to abolish eyes\nOpen up our borders so I say life stand firm on this essay what makes certain deceased care of

funded this wall\nNo you're exactly right and of course my doctor legislation has passed twice in the house but we couldn't get the Senate\nTo take that up and that is a good place to start and to remind people is that is in executive them a program that is not something that was passed by Congress and passed into law\nSo dealing with those issues funding the wall I Am so for putting that money on the timetable and developing a timetable for securing that southern border you know large realized walls work anybody doubts that don't talk to Israel\nLong work and what we're trying to do\nIs to keep people out of our country that ought not to be here to keep the easy gangs out to our country I'm that would say an angel on the other day and Upper East Tennessee and our heart is broken her thirty seven year old daughter was killed by illegal aliens who had had several\nRun ins with law enforcement\nAnd of course her daughter is a dead she is rearing his grandson and that illegal alien

what I Will tell you this I think when people look at the immigration issue they do see it as a security issue not having the borders secured\nEvery towns a border town every state supporters said and it's one of the fraternal order of police has endorsed me and my race on tough on crime tough on\nTrafficking truck on tough on the drug issues the immigration issue and\nPeople see it as a security
