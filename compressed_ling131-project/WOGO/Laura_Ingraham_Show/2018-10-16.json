does allow\nYou know people that are flagged for potential uh non citizen issues to vote in our elections and that is outrageous lower and we're going to put a red wall up around the state of Georgia and say no to the socialist by by my radical own\nA she has received a lot of outside support ah which you can't blame her she didn't take anything she gets to try to make a difference in her campaign\nUh but the Democrats feel like is it if they can turn Georgia to fully a you know still a blue then that will be a wall against Trump in twenty twenty what's the key to turning out your voters and getting them to see the great a danger\nOf a democratic takeover of Georgia\nWell I think they're waking up now is one of the things is concerned us about a third base wasn't as motivated Democrats\nWere but with the cabin on the confirmation with states statements like these people are finally realizing the real Stacey Abrams you know somebody is going to having fundraisers in San Francisco\nThirty days out from the election you know doing fundraisers with Cory Booker made she said this crazy statement about the undocumented folks being part of the only way if she was with Elizabeth Warren of all the overall bugs in the state of Georgia campaign for governor\nPeople are realizing that that is not our values that is you know we're we're literally in a battle for the soul or steak applied for our future and\nNot only about me and twenty a day and it's about our state it's a tree and we're going to buy or I Will say that we saw a great turnout on our from our base yesterday in the first of\nThe first ballots are cast it early voting so I'm encouraged and all ... you know and they even middle of the road Georgia's don't agree with on citizens boating in our elections they don't agree with given free college tuition and says I don't agree with giving\nHopes scholarships which is our educational scholarship to those that are here illegally and folks they stand up yet that I mean we're literally as you said biting the rest of the country sixty five percent of her money has come from out of state this election\nI have to ask you about this caravan situation or because once again the Democrats are trying to play the\nEmotional manipulation game on this issue where the victims of illegal immigrant crime and the United states get almost no coverage in the mainstream media but the you know the tales in the woes of individuals who are making any long and dangerous track from Central America to our southern border\nAre you know their catalog and their chronicled like you know something out of Charles curl a Sunday CBS Sunday Morning you know special\n[laughter] well and and that's what that's what people are so frustrated NATO at our state that on our country they're ready for governor it's got to put them first of the special interests to make a former\nDirector for ISIS force but under the Obama administration called Stacey Abrams to get out of the race after this outlandish comment that she made and you know over the weekend she was doing the Sunday talk shows up at the city or New York or wherever she was\nYou know I was down in southwest Georgia on Saturday back again this morning where we literally have are farmers at our families suffer hurricane and you know that's what this race is about them up orders versus about putting our country first\nA head of those that are here illegally you know no one has or sympathy for people and their their flights in their countries but\nYou know we have to protect our own we have to have secure borders we cannot go to other countries get free government healthcare we cannot go to other countries and get you know free education I got three teenage daughter so you know it it's going to cost billions to do all these\nRadical things that Stacey Abrams wants to do and she's going to raise taxes on artwork or just for and people are tired of that are waking up and they're turning out we're going to put that ...\nBut we need conservatives across the country to join the bike like others are doing to help or you know drive the socialist radical liberal agenda go to jail for governor dot com and helpless if they can't or with their prayers and also their pocketbooks were in the ... of our lives are only about\nTwenty eighth inning it's about twenty twenty as oil\nYeah camp for governor dot com camp for governor dot com go to that website\nHelp out Brian because he has American first on the brain which is where what we needed to be we need the situation handled in a humane and smart way but your your focus is to care for the people of Georgia people of of this country and we cannot be good to anyone\nIf we'd dilute what we have\nWith a porous border and absurd immigration loopholes that essentially results in catch and release which is what the president is so frustrated about uh Brian I have to play for you something that Stacey Abrams\nIs a beating on pretty hard which is the claim of voter suppression despite the large voter registration record levels of voter registration in the state uh which of course can play both ways but ah we're gonna play this and get your reaction much less than\nFifty three thousand people who are being forced to go through a necessary hurdles to prove their bona fide east but the second is that you have a hundred and fifty nine counties\nThousands of volunteer and paid coworkers who are going to be asked to substantially verify that these ideas are sufficient and the challenges there is this is his objective standards it would be much easier if he actually did his job and ... people in a proper fashion and we did not have the slot exact Matt systems\nOr your reaction to it\nWe did not have the ... system\nUh your reaction to that uh the the law that requires matching matching from a licenses driver's licenses to voter rolls\nThey claim that us secretary of state are disenfranchising or suppressing the ability of especially minorities to vote in the state your response\nWell I Know this will shock you lower but I Am following state law that we have in Georgia for a vacation process because we believe that we should and I support this that we should bear a\nWho individuals are before we register to vote that's why we have a stick or a citizenship check this flight we have one you get your driver's license in our state\n... this is a manufactured crisis they did the same thing before the two thousand fourteen reelection governor Nathan Deal\nThey did the same thing before the presidential election of Donald Trump and they're doing the same thing now we had record turnout of Donald Trump was elected in Georgia most votes ever cast in our state so I don't see how that voters suppression\nRight before this outrageous claims came we announced that we had or people on our voter rolls than ever before the state of Georgia because we have things like online voter registration up push through the general assembly and implemented a secretary of state ... years ago\nWe have eight thousand more people on our roles now that we get pat on our\nTook office she voted against on line voter registration she does not support our common sense photo out the law she voted against our citizenship chit\nThe counties are the ones that are flagging these individuals because they have permission from hurt local groups is not properly filled out on the form and by the way all these people have to do to be able to vote is the same thing that I Would or any other Georgia citizen that his own our roles they just have to go to their polling location\nShow their photo out the most likely their driver's license and they can vote so that is not a hot hurdle for people to do but they can't blame me on their own canvassers can't fill out proper type or register to vote\nAnd if they use their own line system they never had any of this problem to start with so she's blaming me for a problem she created a and she's blaming me for following state law and that's why I think\nGeorgia voters are a lot smarter than she gives them credit for they're going to see the smoke screen this all they're doing this to drop their base out but it's working in reverse 'cause the Republican base that conservative base and hard work and Georgia's are going to reject a solo on November the ...\nAh well the the argument is that well if you have a letter missing in your name ... methods like Laura a Ingram versus Laura Ingraham then your your vote will be set aside is that accurate\nThat is not that is absolutely not accurate\nOkay so how is the matching take place that has anything to be a substantial match or something to the from the ... your license your driver's license to your the voter rolls yeah first\nFirst of all if it's really a vote or just simply want to our own lunch system took their driver's license or their state issued a guardian if they did a driver's license all they have to do is put that information like it is only a\nDriver's license your full name your date of birth and um you know you're you're you do the different requirements that you have for that\nAnd then the ... system it it goes through it we'll let you fill it out if you don't have all the information in there you'll have to print it out and fill it in\nThe ... men are different

O P voters citing immigration as their major concern just seven percent of Democrats said the same uh but listen to this\nForty five percent of black voters and forty four percent of Hispanic voters each said that immigration has had a negative impact on their community\nNow why is that the CBS Hugo poll why is that because of course they live in the areas\nWhere immigration has a profound effect on the public schools the healthcare system or in some cases crime\nA housing the list goes on and on\nThese are the facts Donald Trump is more in touch with the American people on immigration than pretty much any politician alive today he understands it\nJoining us now I'm delighted or he is with US Congressman Tom Garrett Republican from Virginia ... congressional district\nOr he's going to give us a the latest because he sits on the all important House Homeland Security Committee as we see these caravans up and running again with the mass migration from Central America coming into this country because they know there'll be caught in alternately released\nCongressmen I can tell you my listeners are infuriated by this they want Congress to act they want these loopholes closed what can you tell us about what Congress could do in short order to prevent this nonsense off from continuing\nEvery time will pass the bill or something ... funding stopgap measure will yank the rug out from underneath the president who wants to keep its promises on securing the border your lead and bumper where the\nGentleman that I use that term loosely talked about hardliners on immigration is symptomatic of the fact that the left as co opted the lexicon\nChanged the meaning of words and I'd like for something to do explained to me when defending your national borders and sovereignty became a hard line stance because essentially what they've done it said if you don't want to open borders than your me ...\nAnd the American voting public needs to think hard enough to understand the Barry ridiculous underlying assumptions that\nNeeds to think hard enough to understand the very ridiculous underlying assumptions that I Am all were robust and healthy legal\nImmigration system is I think you are but at what point did securing the border has become controversial and and and and why is that the Republicans cut the rug out from underneath the president as it relates to keep his promises on security our borders I Can't figure it out um and and that\nJust goes wild and let me tell you about something that happened Congress man this is very concerning again to my listeners and viewers on Fox\nAh this was a earlier this year when we had\nThe opportunity to rein in these ever broadening asylum categories meaning domestic abuse and fear of gangs or what have been included in the credible fear\nA categories as as affecting social groups in a particular country so a bad effect on certain social groups Jeff Sessions comes along as attorney general and says ... no no no no no\nA domestic domestic abuse and gang membership that's that's not part of what constitutes credible fear Congress sadly David Yoder a congressman from Kansas and a a his demo a democratic uh in uh North Carolina both acted to remove that\nFrom the ongoing congressional action on that so that was gutted by Congress that's the kind of thing that is going to make it more difficult to hold the house of representatives Republicans it's it's insane that they took they they decided to got what Jeff Sessions wanted to do their\nWell look Kevin Yoder and Kansas has got himself in a tough fight and Republicans always think moderating on the message that got him elected in the first place is some sort of magical formula for reelection\nI disagree dance with the one who rung you um and and so you find yourself in a terrible catch twenty two nobody's listening right that's a joke I'm but I'm I'm a ... if we lose the house and maybe we'll actually get up off our butts during the lame duck session and keep some of the promises we made three or two and a half three years ago\nI mean like the upside you know that the Republican might act like Republicans\nWell I think again this is the most important issue for most Americans are who are answering these polls immigration is either number one number two and these caravans come into the country if Republicans lose the house it'll get worse not going to get better it's going to get worse but\nWhat I said except maybe we'll get some some courage right you see you see leader McCarthy now talking about border security and I'm ... I'm Glad he is but I mean why now\nI fear that there's a political motivation what you're saying\nWell again I I'm not I'm not understanding really why Paul Ryan is still in as speaker of the house I think if you're going to retire or they think Paul Ryan is going to turn out to voters and in twenty Eighteen I mean God Bless all around I like um a lot but I you know there's going to turn out to voters the guy who's flying all over the country right now Donald Trump and\nCongress I'm telling you Congress is going to rue the day that that didn't get the money for this law they did an appropriate it and they didn't change the stupid asylum laws that allow people to be gaming the system and then caught\nAnd ultimately released because we do not have the facilities to house them seven hundred thousand people and immigration backlog now ... court backlog claiming credible fear another client that's absurd\nWell a lot of prosecuting for the better part of a decade and domestic violence as a scourge on any nation but it's hard to prove domestically it's it's real hard to prove when the Clinton emanates from El Salvador\nOh that is why they're saying here\nI can fear alien abduction but that doesn't mean that that it's actually happening\nYeah well again I think you and you seemed ... you understand this congressman Garrett but the American people are like we we got cities with with the homeless a villages temp villages we got a bitter veterans on the street we have people who never were able to get back on their feet after the great recession or our opioid addicted\nWe need help for those people we cannot we cannot be the saviors of the entire world we can do our best but\nAt some point ... we got to say you know we're here to focus on the American people and I hope that you take this message back to your colleagues in Congress because I'm telling you people are ... are are a light with a with rage about the situation\nA congressman thank you so much for joining us would definitely do on TV soon we'll take a break a lot more to get too including an outspoken advocate uh against affirmative action don't go to\nBill O'Riley here my new book in the killing series is killing the ss the hunt for the worst war criminals on earth\nIt's about Nazi evil and those who enabled\nThe book was stolen us Nazi hunters risk their lives to track down mass

your time\nOr are you worried your identity could be held hostage you should be because ransomware does exactly that this is Tom Kelly studio of my id care making every American safer from the effect of R D served as a tall order but that's my goal so here's a tip the best things you can do to help protect yourself from ribs and where\nHarvard received billions in federal government money they're literally taking your heart or tax money and using it to discriminate against you\nWell how am I so they take all this money they have billions in an endowment I mean they they could basically get free tuition to almost every student and still be a be you know swimming and\nMoney ah but this would mean the federal government is subsidizing racism title racism\nOr you know uh affirmative in a more but it's it's not just Harvard more than a hundred universities publicly endorsed racial discrimination I end the Supreme Court's Fisher decision a you know\nAffirmative action is a nationwide system of government funded state sponsored racism um and it it shows a huge impact on its missions\nSo what what do you um what do you think is going to happen in this court decision I mean the the the belief that diversity is the founding principal of America\nOr is I mean I bet if you pull people in colleges and universities pulled the students most would would cite diversity is a founding American principle of course America's founded on liberty\nNot founded on diversity is founded on liberty but they they think that's sacrosanct the colleges always\nList that as a compelling interest and there are a lot in their defense of these lawsuits are that diversity should be a consideration I think the court has said it can be one consideration but it can't be a Supreme Court and the Michigan affirmative action case but it can't be the only consideration correct\nOr you're you're absolutely right ah but you know I I kind of this is the point out whenever one of the points I made when I spoke at the rally was I I had the opportunity to go to UCLA after I got into medical school and dropped out UCLA is a school that doesn't practice affirmative action in admissions and\nI learned that it was possible to have a diverse class of African Americans Hispanics Asian Americans had whites\nWithout practicing racial discrimination and missions so I don't want anyone to believe that affirmative action is essential for a great quality of education you can have a great education just let people in based on merit because there are smart people of all races religions colors and creates\nWell the uh the opposition um to your point of view and say that you know you're merely your your goals would merely penalize those who have been systematically subjected to racism so there's historical racism in the United states\nA vast we must give a leg up or special consideration to those who come from that class of Americans so that it is fair then because historically they were subjected to this type of a systemic racism\nOr I Would argue in many ways it is the ultimate form of racism to assume that blacks and Hispanics and Native Americans on my dad\nCan't compete a based purely on racial problems I think that all races can compete on a fair playing field and UCLA and UC Berkeley and uh the University of Michigan and other schools across the country which don't use affirmative action or living proof of that\nYeah well uh this genie park who's Harvard Asian American alliance president was on MSNBC and made this point\nI'm laughing is not about protecting Asian Americans and brought by an anti civil rights act and that seemed to have more of them are white more rights activist Wissam trying to bring down marrying someone writes actions in American society town and ultimately about his goal to bring down and just mention\nThat is actually designed to increase fairness\nIncrease opportunities increase there are the make education better\nWhich is good for Asian Americans as well\n[noise] uh your response to that [noise]\nAh affirmative action is racial discrimination against Asian Americans all of the statistical evidence shows that it is much harder\nTo get into college in graduate school as an Asian American for every student\nWho graduated from Harvard costs like her who is a harsh shoot at Harvard or who was an Asian American there was an equally qualified Asian American student\nSomewhere in America who got rejected because of the schools racially discriminatory affirmative action policies those vehicles spoke at the Asian American coalition offer education's Raleigh a just a couple of days ago so they're speaking for the few who got in\n... there was a massive number who are victims of racial discrimination from schools like Harvard\nHow do you think this is going to turn out this court decision I mean you can never guess depends on the judge you get depends on a lot of different factors but how do you think this is going to come down\nAh it it it comes down to a ... it it comes down to ... for the first time in our nation's history we have an anti affirmative action majority in the Supreme Court\nAh we have a Justice Department who was on our side who sees this as racism or a President Trump has been our greatest ally\nIn our fight to end racial discrimination against Asian Americans and whites in the form of affirmative action uh so because we have this powerful la ... who is a champion for equal access to education for Asian Americans and white people uh I think that India and we may prevail\nGoing to be that this is probably going to go on for some time on the federal district court level then to a court of appeals and ah if they determine a circuit split on this to the Supreme Court um VJ this is fascinating ah we've got to get you on TV you gotta come on TV with us soon\nA v J in them or his book almost black the true story of how I got into medical school by pretending to be black\nOr what do you think about this the the it's racial been counting and the words of some it's\nContrary to what we hope that we would achieve a colorblind society a and does it encourage more resentment among
