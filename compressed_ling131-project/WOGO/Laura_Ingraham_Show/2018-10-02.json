All right now coming up the other big big news on and hold on if you have good comments to make ... insights questions because we are going to stay on this issue but we have to a dip into what happened yesterday the announcement of the big new NAFTA deal\nWhich is now called the U.S MCA United States Mexico Canada agreement us MCA and big announcement huge promise a maid and a huge promise delivered by Donald Trump\nGot very little coverage frankly that not the coverage and deserves the U.S trade representative was the man behind that is a deal a Bob Lighthizer will join us here on the lower Ingram show [noise]\n[noise] are you a responsible person to find yourself going deeper and deeper in credit card debt and you're not sure how to fix the problem\nThan getting ready for a toll

us one eight hundred seven mine\nThe position was now in its current state good or bad well we have large deficits\nEvery everyone would agree it was it was twenty five years out of date I mean there was no Internet price we have cell phones the size of hats when this thing went into effect and people would suggest don't upgrade it is a crazy and then in addition to change and the economy we had very large deficits\nAnd we were witnessing literally the loss of our of our automobile industry parts and companies are to Mexico and other places so the people who say we shouldn't have have um we shouldn't have renegotiated this thing or just the you know engaging in self deception and I might I might know that\nBoth the secretary Clinton and President Obama both when they ran for president\nPromised they would renegotiate it they just didn't do it in the final analysis but they both acknowledged that it needed to be arraigned done so what the president did which I which I think was terrific is we have we have by far the biggest trade bloc in in history one point\nTwo trillion dollars and we've not rewritten the rules in ways that are that are better quite frankly for all three countries particularly better for America that's who had to pay my bills and do I care about and better in a whole variety of ways\nIt's the the auto rules of origin are extremely important in terms of making sure that manufacturing moved back to America and stays in America the there is a a sunset provision that there's going to make sure we review this on a periodic basis\nWe call it a review provision their labor rights which should never been like this ever in an agreement before there's access on agriculture there's there's a hole and then you move into the next step of things like digital trade and intellectual property protection financial services all these\nThese ah twenty first century economy kinds of things that we're no adequate rules and now we have um there's even very good rules\nAre on the environment which are beyond anything we've negotiated before which I'm I'm proud of there's there's very strong and enforceable rules on currency which we've never had an a trade agreement before there there are limitations on data local is Asian which is an important thing for the digital trade people we have limitations on how\nState owned enterprises which is you think China Ken subsidize so there's\nThere's a whole variety of things in various pockets of the extremely important to Graham it better than than anything in the states as ever negotiate it before it's going to make a real difference for working men and women in this country now some businesses and some Wall Street guys will have to figure out another way to make a fortune\nBut in terms of working men and women and farmers and ranchers it's going to make a big difference and it's going to be this is the that the President Trump trade a prototype and we're going to use it going forward with countries around the world so it's really really an important day\nWe're talking about Lighthizer us trade rap or one of the chiefs of course negotiators in getting us to this new U.S Mexico Canada agreement a Bob one of the things that were wondering how this works any still Republican majority\nCongress could this mean what's the mechanism for this passing where there's there are some Republicans supporting it some probably won't but more Democrats would support this than Republicans correct\nWell I Would not say that I think you're going to find a Republicans and Democrats both supported uh\nHopefully strongly that there are a few Republicans who will probably oppose it because they don't like the fact that we're going to bring manufacturing back and they think that that ah outsourcing is not a problem there are some Democrats a little ...\nIn part because it's just something that the president wants and they're against that or they think it doesn't go far enough [noise]\nBut but I think uh the vast majority of fair minded members in both parties\nWill support this now one of the criticism you have which is sort of an odd and one in the wall Street Journal is they have this view that well we never should've talked to labor unions and Democrats when we put it together and then they draw the conclusion that for that it's worse for us\nWell if the Democrats should uh take over and of course the exact opposite is true\nWe we we designed this to be bipartisan for working men and women and\nFarmers and ranchers it's not something I I Believe it's going to end up being purely partisan and if it is a kind of thing that can only be passed with Republican votes if that's what we had to go she added that I Would agree with the with the people who say it would have trouble passing but that's not how it was designed and it's not what we did\nThis is what I'm\nJohn Harwood\nFrom CNBC said specifically regarding autos let's listen\nThere are some elements of manage trained in it that are less free that is to say the provisions for the auto industry if those provisions work\nMeans our cars will get more expensive for us consumers but there's also a chance that they are complicated enough that they won't be worth it for automakers to comply which means that the president's statement about a new dawn for the auto industry that is almost certainly not correct your\nI guess my I mean if I had to make one word it would be nonsense [noise] uh you wonder about people who make statements like that they're they're so palpable crazy and you wonder what else there thing that is also crazy so just to give you an idea all\nThe ... the major auto companies\nGeneral Motors Ford SCA was used to be Chrysler Honda and Toyota have all said this is fine they can work with this they've all said it's going to move more jobs back to America but that's not a bad thing\nYeah that's a good thing they've all set is workable they've all endorsed it so that the kind of people who don't know very much about what's going on and make those kind of wild statements I Would just take them to sort of sit down and boosting their belt and they're tired and breathe ten times and then just read something about it\nAnd they'll realize how they don't know what they're talking about this is going to be really very very important for um for American manufacturing it's going to bring a lot of jobs back\nWe at the end by the way it's not bad for for Mexico or for Canada either it'll it'll help them to\nThe biggest single thing we do let me just give you an idea what the biggest thing we do or what the two biggest things we do one is we increase the content of\nCars that are sold in America and Mexico and Canada sold in America that they think the content that is made in this region is increasing right now we say it's sixty two percent and it's really more like about fifty because of loopholes and all this special interest stuff\nWe're going to raise it up to Seventy five percent\nHow was that a bad thing under under the ... the person who is going to lose out on this is China and places like that under the TPP that these people all indoors\nIs China and places like that under the TPP that these people all endorsed half the car can be made in China and sold in America duty free it's completely lunacy the people don't talk about the other thing is we're requiring that a certain percent of the car [noise]\nBe made in a high wage area that is to say in America now it could be Canada also but in America for the most part that's not a bad thing at all why shouldn't\nWe say if we're going to give you the benefit of selling cars indoor market with no duties better than we treat anyone else in the world why shouldn't we say that a certain amount of those cars should be made in America by American labor\nNow I think what President Trump promised on his on the campaign trail he promised he delivered Bob Lighthizer us TR what's next I mean are you guys going to get a deal done with Europe some of the European countries ... deals with Switzerland or some of these other\nSmaller countries I Know they've and Swiss they're anxious to do a deal with you guys I Know that first hand\nYeah no we have a variety of things that we're we're talking to the Japanese were talking to the Europeans [noise] we have a lot of things that we're doing a small deal dot com singles doubles that people don't even know about we're talking I won't go through but there's a bunch of other countries do it and then of course\nThe big the big elephant in the room is China and one of the funny things I'll tell you there's one last time on the wall Street Journal editorial because you brought it up they kind of show a graph of the American S. and P. and then they mark certain things are sort of say oh look at this was bad for the U.S in the what they don't mark\nIs when when the president announced history has thrill one which was like in March since the market's gone straight up when the president put on tariffs on China intellectual property and into it for intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer the market's gone straight up from them I was kind of laughing this was like one of these\nWhat are the things you've got you've got ten data points less drop out the fire to prove the opposite oh it was the other ones that you should look at it I I ask any of your your list or to look at the thing if they happen to have the hopefully\nI'm looking I'm actually looking at it now and January twenty second march eighth but July and August when he's got a\nYeah I just look at the ports but at the bottom just show where the where the that the China actions are the markets like straight up from their right I mean this whole area is right as well\nI'm Glad today that I I Know without prompting what the thrill one means like how many how many people know that other than you ... what I can and careful\nI I should be careful I I used we used yet we all sort of jargon and the short and what I've been amazed at we're statute that allows us to take it allows the president to

of this but the double standard is just unbelievable\nThe views of faculty members expressed in their private capacities or their own and not the views of the university does that mean if somebody express racist views on Twitter that that person would\nNot would not be fired from Georgetown\nOur policy does not prohibits speech based on a person presenting ideas or the context of those ideas even when those ideas maybe difficult controversial or objectionable while faculty members may exercise freedom of speech\nWe expect that their classrooms and interaction with students be free of bias and geared toward thoughtful respectful dialogue\nWell when you go to go on that rate your professor website um some interesting\nReviews of this particular professors teaching style come up a namely that she's frequently rants against conservative how is that unbiased but again Georgetown would not tolerate this in a conservative it wouldn't it would never happen\nThere is no discussion questioning or did they in her class you know simply sit and listen to her opinions which are frequently incoherent and disjointed worse or lectures or never supported just presented as unvarnished dogma this is not what Georgetown is about says the latest rate my professor\nRating [noise] so this is um this is where we are in American academia if this if this were a Republican professor\nIn his

standard not a I'm not a beyond a reasonable doubt but a preponderance standard\nSo no probable cause even to undertake an investigation given the lack of crop rating information but in a in a culture where you're writing DC we're feeling Trump's facts\nThen you know it's always going to be how you how she makes you feel in her testimony\nBut and that's just the right it's about how she made people feel because\nI didn't even find her feelings credible to be honest I'm and she didn't she didn't ... like someone who was just now bringing charges about this horrible thing that so Trump traumatized her for four years to thirty six years affecting her college years and her marriage and everything else and redecorating and you know we had\nHe had no emotion that corresponded with what she was saying creepy TST and trauma and horrors of it all was there would have been more anger there were more\nFear and passion and more directed a she was attached she her anytime she ever talked about the assault she was very touching her description of it and and I don't mean innocent people can disassociate\nDissociative when their rights and stuff that she wasn't right and this is thirty six years later and she said she has PATS the which means that you're heightened awareness of what happened and so\nShe just did not she was not ... on feelings or fact ah but\nAt the end of the day we need to look at the facts and the fact that measure up she lived in an environment and in high school that was very hearty environment that carried over to a degree in college you think she got off campus after that and and things come down\nBut you know again not to blame the victim but we need to look at the entire circumstance of her life and his life if we're going to bring this kind of thing up at the last minute Laura last we had to bring up with a context to this right before Supreme Court nomination that would be changing abortion possibly\nThere's a reason for that you know we've got to really we need to protect our country and protect presumption of innocence and this isn't just about Ford or or half an hour\nIt's about our liberty principles and about our democracy about our society and and what are we going to hold his values going forward but at the principle that we're going to hold to to keep us all secure and free and personally responsible\nRight we're basically now a incentivizing unsubstantiated claims and incentivizing this type of intimidating menacing behavior of\nYou know attacking people in public restaurants or elevators or\nYou know these the people who are always worried about safe spaces DC and triggers and all are the ones who are are the first to get in your face first ones\nBecause they are driven by\nIrrationality they've banned in fact they've abandoned objectivity so they can't have a discussion on this level\nSo all they have their subject is kneeling and power and if you're not going to come to reason together if you have no basis of a ... objective truth in order to have dialogue then the most powerful the biggest bully in the room it's going to win and that's what we have going on than the feminist movement is a bunch of bully\nThey're bullying everyone in order to advance their power in it and part of that student ... there's always the struggle between men and women that there's always the threat and if you're always the victim then you always have power over those who are trying to get as you\nAnd you know so this is what's been going on in our culture it's been going on and different kinds of fears now what's going on and and the tight relationship scare and women and its ripping our country of heart\nAnd if we if this means that we have to let ... rapists go free because we can't prove that it's better to stay presumption of innocence just said the innocent than it is to round up all the guilty oh I'm actually the fact you know that's just real life that that's what it's about being a grownup world\nYeah well I think again we see that these activists Soros folks who are costing flake who lived up to his last name I mean they they they're perpetual adolescence look at me look at me look\nAt me watch me watch me you must listen to me don't you dare look away from it it's like a kid like an eighth grader this is not a serious adult with a serious way of\nUh of discussing issues they they mean to terrorize people you say bully I say terrorist is the type of political and emotional extortion they're playing this game and it it has to be exposed and resist it at all costs and and they have to feel\nThey have to feel the heat right back on them as as a journalist and I say this in a in a in a way meaning look journalists don't like to be demonized as fake news and so forth would imagine of journalists were finding themselves surrounded in an elevator\nWhere where citizens are one inch from their face screaming at them and it I think that'd be the first ones to say wait a second year in timid any of the press well what about intimidating a\nA a a citizen in a in a in a restaurant or at a gas station is as Maxine Waters urge people to go after them you know does that count at all\nHonor the gas station is as Maxine Waters urge people to go after them and it does that count at all apparently not you\nKnow and and but we like you said we need to fight back we we just can't sit back and take it which we've done for years and look where we are\nAnd that is one of my reasons for challenging a\nChristine Ford about you know her own behaviors I'm not I'm not accusing or anything I don't know what she did detailed day to day when she was in high school or college but I Know the environment she would then and again if we're going to prosecute him or questioned him prosecuting and then we need to ask for the same kind of question and\nYou know you can't answer if you can't show what kind of character you are\nUm you know when you're bringing these accusations up in a political sphere then why should we believe we are not obligated to believe you just because you make allegations we're not obligated to ... just because you're allowed in bowling yelling at us and in a restaurant\nWhere we're not you know we're not want to have to take it for you we have a right to speak as well and I think more people need to speak out I think that's what the Trump election with all about that you\nI think uh it's about people having just about enough of a little bad policies bad economic policies bad foreign policy and twisted a political correctness and identity politics I think he called BS and all of it\nAnd he said look on out of it and I've done all this thing but uh this is just ridiculous and I what before we let you go real quick do you do you think that this could actually boomerang against the Democrats in the midterms\nOh absolutely and I hope so and we need to get the word out the Democrats are very good about organizing on the ground base and then turned and we need to know that we can't sit back because the economy's going really well and the fat and happy\nWe need to be activated and we see what's going on in this kangaroo hearing\nAbout what the rest of the left is when you take it seriously and we it takes years how their infants and making sense of it all and cooking for the perfect example of how baby as she was that's what they're reducing women today and you know basic victims that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Hallie", "day": "02"}
