I Need to congratulate you I understand you've had a pretty big payday why don't you tell us about that\nWell I sold at Minnesota Vikings at on them for seven years\nAnd it was one of the great joys of my life to be able to do that I've been a professional sports team older for most of the past fifty years\nBut I had not been able to get an F. L. team it was a great experience we had a great run a loved Minnesota the fans and Minnesota everything uh couldn't quite turn the trick of getting a new stadium\nDid you see yourself as different did you stink different did you visualize it OK I'm here temporarily but I'll be out of here one day\nNo not at all as a matter of fact that I enjoy the environment that I was raised in I enjoyed the growing up and go look I have a perfect situation uh we realized that the countries in the depths of the depression a lot of people that they have jobs and that there were problems are always a was a\nWas a just instilled in me with with every sense of the fiber in my family for my mom and my dad was that education was a key to\nThe the benefits of of a good life or the benefits of your life would be that would benefit you and then you could pass on a benefit to others so education was always a big thing we're fortunate we had very good public schools in our little town\nThat I was fortunate I got to go to college football scholarship and then the GI Bill from army service\nSo I was able to get an education and uh it uh it was very important it's very important to\nAll of us I talked to a lot of kids groups are these days and try to instill in them the importance of just staying in school another week whatever it is if you get out you don't feel like you can spend four or five years in college a spin one years if you can't do that spin one semester\nBecause every day will pay off for you every day that you can get\nThe more formal education you get the better you be so Ah yes we add obstacles we really didn't see them as as much a a as I guess that they might have been and maybe that kind of positive outlook or play the good role and what we're able to do\nWell it's it's a it's obviously affected you in some positive way many positive ways you are as as a young man a young boy you are on tribute entrepreneurial almost from the beginning weren't you wreck\nI uh I was I didn't even know how to spell the word much less a\nA a understand what it was but I was always fascinated about how things work out is that how does it Gabby a bank or you get to how how does this happen um how's it going to get on his own business or whatever the business is I was always fascinated by it always tried to\nTo watch him understand as much about it is a good laugh still have that same fascination today is approach age of Seventy eight or I'm fascinated about how things work I'm fascinated\nAbout how Donald how Mr del up in the market will develop and often I'm a a duck on a\nBuilding computers and found a way to outdo everybody in the world it's fascinating I still try to learn about all those things\nYou know it's interesting to read because a lot of people say here this all the time they say well you know what they did before you can't duplicate or replicate today my my\nOpinion is you can make much bigger fortunes much faster in today's world you agree\nTotally agree and and there's another key element that\nYou've had such a such a premium these days are being young uh gives you an advantage not a disadvantage and that is just another thing I think that ...\nAre just so positively or for all of the young people that are that are coming in and tackling the various elements of of careers in one way or another\nSo on and and tackling the various elements of of careers in one way or another because there is a premium on youth and\nAnd ah it shows so I think that I I think we're living in the very best of times we should understand that and uh we should we should say that we enjoy we enjoy a good share of it\nAbsolutely you know going back to when you were about age ten you had a very simple entrepreneurial jobs created I'm\nI'm selling peanuts but I think he learned a couple of valuable lessons side of that talk about\nThat I did I learn a lesson minute or if you put too many peanuts in the sack when you get hungry you get a lot of Nichols with is not enough to pay for all your peanuts [laughter] so what happened so what happened\nWas convinced my dad that go by me another hundred pounds sack of peanuts and he said what you've already tried that and he said it didn't work very well but yeah I said well give me a chance I'll make it work\nSo I have as many peanuts and the ... I never had any complaints from my customers and I made some money so I you know you learn a lot of lessons as you as you move through laugh I learned a lot of lessons early ages and I was still around today\nYou know you also said I mean from that experience I had a quote from your book called the red zone you said if you like he's he said the first rule of private enterprise you identify in need and you know where the buyers are\nOld it's missing is the product and I think that you you mentioned that's what you learn I guess from that peanut business that is correct your mom is quoted as also saying or your mother said I gave birth to them and raise them but I've never known what made that boy check [laughter] [laughter] you you were on like the rest of the family I'll take it\nWell yeah well I I was a little bit more passionate about uh about the the things that I wanted to do and and uh uh that was so that that's just been a part of all I have always been passionate about the things I Do and I've always enjoyed the things\nThat I Do not that there haven't been problems and issues that come up as they always do but um uh the the the ... this is a God created all of us equal certainly in one respect and that is that he gives all of us this twenty four hours of today\nIt's a gift we didn't earn it slapped we deserve it it's God's Gift or so the issue is nobody else gets any more than twenty four hours today I get the same as you do everyone else gets the same issue is what do we do with it\nAnd that's that's what's kind of driven my life and uh it's it's it's worked very well for me\nI guess so many people like you were saying the you know you there's a premium on youth because unfortunately many people don't realize how valuable that head start that advantage is that they have now until maybe it's too late or or they wasted a lot of that but that's just typical isn't at rest\nWhat it is you know we're always going to find people who are who yet I'm more concerned about things than others and [noise] and uh they're always going to be some people it will finish the hand of others and that doesn't mean though that you can still do well in the race the big thing is is to get in the race it'd be a part of it\n[noise] rent you originally going to be a lawyer one happened\nWell I found out and as as if finishing my second year in law school I found out that that the that profession in Nineteen fifty a really didn't pay much\nAnd uh I was I was working two or three jobs on the campus and I was doing a found out that I was making more money than than the starting lawyers or at that time an old it discouraging anyone from the\nFrom the field of law it's a fantastic field and we all know that but in my world I was in a hurry and uh I I just felt like I needed to to move away from la and move over to the business side\nRed isn't that one of the um a common denominator ... most successful entrepreneur is what you really alluding to hear you in a sense of urgency to get out and earn a living to ...\nThen and that made a big difference in other words you didn't at that point have the patience you said you know I can calculate going forward on this track or I can get out and get into business and what did you do you quit law school you left law school where did you go would you do rent\nWell I got a corporate job through the University of

started something from a passion you know you have to have an amazing environment and\nTo me I you know it comes from who we are it shifts around with my management team and our leaders were trying to do things that are relevant to us\nI personally love Halloween is coming up here in a few weeks and we kind of how to joke around here that you're not allowed to come to work\nThat day unless you're

gosh\nI got a headache I'm telling you already but Jeremiah Smith\nDoing a great job cofounder and CEO simple tiger not crouching tiger that that's a whole mess that's karate or gun for with simple tiger dot com or yeah yeah yeah yeah so uh\nIf you want to get your ah your website in the first page of the search on Google that's what we're talking about\nAnd you know maybe we can talk about why many companies don't get the results from their ... and and what they're doing wrong so I'm going to try I'm gonna bounce around a little bit for you or because you know that's my problem obviously I'm not getting the results ... and here's another one I I remember a guy came\nTo one time I was talking to a guy you know he overheard me talking and it was a bunch of people I knew and I said I Wish I could get more Instagram followers\nYou gotta do what it costs a thousand bucks in the world I have every friend I could ever possibly want to know and Indonesia right now they all like my page I got eight thousand but who cares I don't honestly you know what I mean I don't want to buy that stuff I Need\nReal people that are actually interested in what I Do but anyway let's go back to ask ... why don't we get the results we want from as CEO Jeremiah\nThat's a great question I think there are so many answers to that it it it largely is on a case by case basis if I looked at ten different companies were investing in a CEO I highly doubt that they're all going to be the same answer so\nI Will say though that there is a an awful situation in our industry and I kind of comes ... doing this for so many years\nThere's an awful scenario where so many companies claim that they do as CEO because they understand kind of a technical portion that we talked about earlier even though they don't really understand the content or the ... portion to link building portion or any of that they understand the technical portion and so they offer up a service called us you\nAnd that just that really ... years because people out there buying that thinking that they're getting the full suite when really they are just getting the blueprints or you know kind of for the home like you were talking about earlier that only gonna get you so far\nAnd so a lot of times what what's happening there is that companies are working with either an agency or consult in our team that doesn't really know Suu that well and I said there's\nExperts in eighty it's unfortunately a lot of the idiots they pretend to be experts and that's what you're saying but I'm saying it a little more harshly than you go ahead yeah that's right yeah and I mean I think really it\nComes down to if you're investing in is you you really need to do your best to understand a CEO because it's it's kind of like just taking the first financial advisor that walks up to you when you're a hundred thousand dollar you know retirement fund that you\nWould yeah sure he'll take it but it where it needs to go into a\nPainful and you know what that's called the idiot tax I write okay go yeah yeah so you don't want to pay that\nAnd so there are reputable companies out there that will teach you a lot about us you know I think one of one great resource that you guys could easily recommend anyone would be ... miles dot com they don't offer a CEO they just teach a lot about us either way I heard\nI interviewed the wizard of Oz and I can't think of his name right now ... yeah yeah we did a business and burgers show on him you should look it up a so tell me his name again\nRand fish that you write Rand fish getting the wizard of ... they call that's all I could remember but and you know what we we sat down over a burger and we talked about all this\nMy fear for people is what I have experienced what you are articulating is that\nThere are a lot of people out there that say they are experts in this and unfortunately there are a lot of us out there that believe them because we want to believe people right end of the day we need to make sure that we are responsible for the money that\nAll right end of the day we need to make sure that we are responsible for the money that we spend on these things we cannot just said a higher that guy he's he's got a good hairdo I remember a a ran an ad like this currently mustache and he he wasn't going to shave and it was like this funny story but when it came right down to it\nLike you're doing he explained to me the things I needed to do that I Will never make these mistakes again I'd write the idiot tax you guys listening don't pay the tax listen you know\nListen to Jeremiah Smith check him out simple tiger dot com but here's my thing I mean I really believe there are predators out they're preying on us because we don't have the time to do the research sadly but that just shows about that's why we want to get guys like you and ...\nAnd the ... there was it a ...\nAnd people that can be trusted now and thank you for spending the time with us I Want if you could for a couple of minutes content marketing Lincoln building tips that you say are crucial I think in regards\nTo content marketing again earlier I referred to it as kind of the cornerstone of STO when we're working on any kind of in a CEO project after we get a lot of the optimization the clean up the setting up the house kind of taking care of\nThat a lot of what we're doing along good basis for clients and a lot of what you should be paying for if you're paying ... is a mixture of content marketing and link building and so that you understand those little bit better and could potentially do them yourself\nLook at it from a perspective of ultimately try to get outside of your company and look at it from the outside the easiest way to do that is to\nFeel questions that your sales team are constantly answering you know what are the top\nTen Fifteen twenty questions that your sales team was constantly getting\nAnd can you write a blog article about each one of those\n... are reasons why you should pay more for your service than the other guy\nYou know right about that what makes you an alternative or differentiates you from a competitor right about that there are so many different angles of ways that you could write about what it is your company does that will actually provide value to your audience and so you can produce content around that\nNow here we are talking to this audio podcasts something that I also highly recommended re purpose in content so if you have the capacity to create a video a video is kind of the mecca of content because you can start with a video and then you can take the audio track from it\nAnd use an audio podcasts from from the video and you can take that like this all audio podcasts and transcribe it into text and you can take that text and you can reform editor blogger articles and books and then you can re format quotes\nTo Instagram slides and you could see how that single video

her from a hardware store and just kind of place it under the entrance of your hotel room so nobody gets into your room but I Want you to dig deeper with us I really want to talk about your certified female\nFriendly hotel I this is really interesting to me what you specifically require for a hotel to get the certification and how many property you currently have\nA right yeah I don't need a problem with it no one I had and that\nMeans you number one right here yet but the fact that he has power\nThing and I found that to keep on going on which means that they called me over written by

CD in Los Angeles\nWelcome to our own world travel can\nOh thank you very much for having me\nAppreciate you being here today so let's begin with the crux of his phobia and how inhibiting in his for people who have it when it comes to crossing bridges are driving through tunnels to get to their various destinations\nOh it is terrifying I've had so many patients over the years with the fear of bridges and it comes in friday different forums um but it is terrifying and people will avoid it at all costs that had a patient who would rather drive thirty miles out of the way than drive over a bridge particularly if it's high or it has any sort of traffic component to it\nSo I you know I have a friend who lives in New York City and she literally doesn't want to leave the city because the only way out of the city is doing the tunnels or over the bridge and she's so paralyzed by fear and I'm curious can someone who's that paralyzed the health\nOne hundred percent but you have to want it you have to really want to overcome that fear and if you do connect with a therapist who specializes in the fear of any sort of anxiety or they can help you use cognitive behavioral therapy and exposure therapy and\nBy taking small steps over the course of time week by week people can over overcome it absolutely\nInteresting or the grandmother of suffering without as well almost didn't go to a wedding right frankly so\nPeople were void and major major life events because\nOf that yeah it was his show I remembered that my husband's marriages mentioned when she introduced us America is a great place and there are actually companies out there\nOne in particular we know of who operates in the Chesapeake Bay area that Dr fearful drivers over the Chesapeake Bay bridge for twenty five dollars and they say they're getting dozens of Dr overs during the summer season clearly profiting from this phobia\nAny thoughts on this service and you know can be helpful\nThat's a great service however for some people it's not a matter of them driving even if they're a passenger they won't do it because they have lots of fears in their mind about what if there's traffic on the bridge and and I can't get off what if there's an earthquake and the bridge collapses and it would have had a panic attack would have\nYou know there's traffic and I have a heart attack so there's lots of fears that people invent and their imagination that might cause that service not to even be viable\nOkay can for someone listening to the segment or around the country really tapping into this and has a fear of crossing bridges are tunnels any suggestions quickly on the air that you could give someone [noise]\nKnow start slowly so let's say you had a fear right now the patient with she came to me because she has a fear of driving over high rent it and so before we even went to a bridge I wanted to take her to a place that was high not even in a car not even operate in\nThe car so we went to the top of my building to deliver to the topic was like eight floors and the goal was to create things I wanted her to learn to tolerate it learned that she can deal with it\nAnd then we can move on from there but what happened was she got to the top and she wasn't anxious at all the while I was about four feet high it was kind of a big plant or four feet\nDeep and she never felt like she was going to fall off so that was kind of ways but when we were going down we took steps down and it was a metal staircase you can see through the slack and that's where she became really anxious even notice latch only about maybe five inches\nThrough this lab and that's where she became really anxious even notice latch only about maybe five inches feelings you fall\nDown and so we worked on walking up and down the stairs\nFirst holding on to the handles and maybe just one and then just standing there on one step without holding on any and she just learned that you could tolerate that discovered step by step one by one you're increasing your level of intensity in terms of the anxiety tolerating discomfort tolerating uncertainty\nAnd learning you can handle anxiety\nAnd it sounds really get to that point you're not even really isolating within ... and then you're going to incrementally take steps towards that right I really appreciate your time today we are show that discusses everything and anything in the world of trauma ... thank you for helping us help others\nI'll actually You're welcome\nThank you can have a great we can't thank you to write a great guy and I really hope that we help
