E. and burning Marcus go Home Depot they both predator mothers is having a strong influence that impacted the life\nFor many years to come you found that is well did you not\nYet has certainly in my case as well uh my father was a manager of construction project buddy many of them were you know in Europe or in Asia and so he was gone for six months or\nA or nine months or so at a time though my mother probably the biggest influence and I'm telling my goals and values and one thing that she really is built on him is that knowledge is key to progress you know\nAnd you should learn as much as possible you should do well in school and you should\nUse your other time to learn and so\nI became a very active member of the local public library and going in there for the for all the exciting new bucks it would come in and I remember one time I Try to read or\nTwenty volumes of the way they panic on the basis and I would have a database of ah everything that has happened in the world but then I realized that uh I I was only have a river mirror with everything that happened before or the book was published so\nUh I realize the important thing is keeping up to date with a new trend in the market\nAnd I I Would tend to think that that paper route also talk to the value of delivering information ahead to influence you a little bit\n[noise] yeah I certainly made me impressed by people's enthusiasm for the information I was wondering how they were I was actually working for me to come around and drop the newspaper of the day off their on their front step um and and then I can tell from um you know when I was coming in to make their collection on Saturday to\nUh for the deliveries they would be polite and say thank you and I you know really\nA greatly value getting in the newspaper a timely basis that every day a week\nOr wouldn't moving on 'em you went to parochial schools as a young man as a boy and um tell me a little bit about St Martin in Philadelphia was advantage or disadvantage going to a parochial school will do for you\nWell I think the um the nuns were very dedicated to education and has\nRight well I think the um the nuns were very dedicated to education and so they put a lot of stress on\nThe quality of education and making sure that we were learning and doing well in our uh our test the going forward so that was a\nHelpful and they certainly instilled the no belief and the importance of living a moral and ethical wife and ah you know and that really is a God is an important a factor in your life and that you should follow the commandments and\nShould treat people with respect and I'm I'm that you should make sure that you do nothing that you wouldn't be a you know that you're not going to be proud of and I do it right in the long run you'll\nYou'll wind up having the best result\nIs that what you're saying to counteract a lot of the scandals rather unfortunate through there but there's so many more stories pat or they're not of people who do the right thing to make it to the top\nAre exactly not usually a pay it pays off I think you know what goes around comes around with you and they have a you know ways if you start to to see other people pretty soon or that a deception is known and then people you know\nYou lose their confidence and you and if they lose your confidence in you then you have a tremendous a weakness in terms of they're not willing to trust you and follow your ideas is ingestion so um it is a very counterproductive to you know take shortcuts that are unethical or in Morrow\nDuring your time in St Martin high school um that was a pretty competitive environment was not\nA Oh yes it was they had the various towards the medals for the best in each subject and the\nUh the star list on the wall so there was a lot of the rating and ranking and the ... I was a you know wanted to uh get on the top of all the lists are so it was a good motivator for me to study extra hard\nWell one of the things I was going to eventually you went from saint Martin and you've got accepted\nMIT my records told me you were the first student from St Martin to ever get accepted MIT tell the listeners what you did a sister so creative um the project they got the intention to cut you an MIT\n... mentioned I'd go to the public library or several times a week and a one day I went in there and I have fifty three and there was a new book that had just been published and was available called giant brains are machines that think that was\nThe first book that tried to explain how these new computer technology would really enhance the power of the human mind would extend the memory\nFacts available to people greatly with be able to see patterns in data super high speeds and how to make more uh insightful decisions and be more productive\nSo I got so excited about this that I took a about two months of saving some paper route to the library and went down to the hardware store\nAnd bought strip civil whom foil and a bell wire and a small light bulbs\nOr from flashlights and plywood boards and\nAnd a bill to pay a handmade computer system are made up little relays\nOr that are played an unbeatable game of tic tac toe ah so ah and then I found that you know when I gave it to my friends are so excited about this apparently interact intelligent interaction with a machine but then they notice they could only time they would never win so\nI put a little counter in the back of every uh forty F move would be random occasionally they could win that found that ah that factor of hope I've made the machine very very popular and who was always lots of people queuing up to play a\nBig us would love you [laughter] and\nIt was you know they entered into a science fair and water prize and that attracted the MIT alumni association in Philadelphia [noise]\nAh you know to get me a full scholarship to to go to MIT to study a more you know seriously computer science and particularly uh uh I was excited about the idea if you if you understood the organization of human mind\nThen you could actually designed computers more effective for more effective and they use for people because you would see the analogy between the human intelligence and then the intelligence created through a V. electronic design of these systems\nNow pat when you got accepted to MIT prior to that were you encouraged or discouraged from director or the needs special that your school\n[noise] uh well that was it's an interesting point when I did a get a scholarship I previously um gotten scholarships to a number of the Catholic schools and the crust the rector says you know why didn't you go to Notre Dame or a villain over other schools that are in the Catholic tradition and ah\nI said right now appreciate that but uh\nI Would like to know forget myself I'm interested in technology and I wanted to go to school that has the best reputation\nFor teaching technology and you know the the course they'll have a chap when there and I'll be able to continue to attend religious services so I uh I said I wanted to follow that course to get the best education I could've subject I was interested in and they just try to discourage me a little bit but ah I just stuck to my commitment\nYou being kind my research said that the way you can get in there that are ...\nThere were um [noise] I think uh some uh twenty thousand students before me that uh and several had applied but has never been accepted so I was the first one they have to to MIT\nYou are very humble man folks are going to find out you know packets accepted an MIT takes biophysics how old is a ... student make the transition in the business and build up what is today a multibillion dollar diversified business\nFrom a self made man building up an organization is a powerhouse how in the world did that happen will tell you about his first big deal when every but when a second time in his life they told them it could be done on John\nResident go visiting and hearing a fascinating story of ... the founder and chairman of id will be back right after this on listens to [noise]\nCheck for twenty five thousand dollars each for half payment from nine companies well\nSo so I had a two hundred and twenty five thousand dollars checks I rushed to the bank or because I made up a name called international cooperation to bad for the proposal purposes it was just going to be a shot in the dark\nAnd then the banks that oh now that's a corporate name you can't put that in your personal account you have to form real corporation get by law have directors authorized the bank account and so I thought oh my goodness what happens if all his name is already been registered ... who are stuck\nFortunately it was in the form the corporation and and that that was all the capital that we ever put into the company was that two hundred and twenty five thousand dollars and so I become a big advocate of what we call customer base financing if while you can go out and present an idea that people interesting enough you know they will\nThey will uh makes an advanced payments and uh when they do that they become a real advocate for your 'cause they want you to succeed and they encourage their friends to buy the same thing\nAnd they become none equity investors they uh they don't show up at shareholders meetings and ask a difficult question they don't charge interest on their cash cetera so well I Would say for an entrepreneur weaken the proof he can prove that markets validity by going out and getting advance payments from customers is solid situation\nAnd so what we learn from this that was another rejection the path McGovern had another one you had what the other thing pat when they're giving you money to an eye on an advance that sure puts a flame onto your but to make sure that whatever you make it better be darned good range\nA or a real obligation to perform uh you know at the highest level of these people are expected\nThe ads

follower of\nThere's nothing wrong with that either but we have to also recognize what that brilliance is when we see it and hear it and maybe take some calls I've gotten really good at that\nNote taking as I write it down and it seems to burn a little memory in the in the plates of my mind we're talking with Kevin ... executive management and he's an entrepreneur he's worked for Cisco and sales force and singer and companies like this he and I are both on the advisory board of doc you sign\nA friend of both of ours keys crock who uh I guess I didn't even ask you about this but we must

it's not about that it's about the fact that if you're going to call out somebody has a thought leader\nI'm going to say that ah\nKeith ... is one so I'm a student and I right now I'm a student of yours Kevin and this is all good stuff can we talk about this we touched on it the pace and speed of change in business and of course the role in today's chief digital officers\nAnd the management of companies that are the big and small it really is an important role so I Would just love to have you riff on that\nSure it's a you know when when my old boss tricked Robin chose the c._e._o. and chairman of Cisco he brought me any called me a CDO and he honestly didn't want\nTransformation in my title obey a that was what he asked me to do to curb the wisdom of shock to actually call it digital was he knew that the employees had to be brought along and so when you look at that there is no\nAnd he couldn't have been more spot on but the thing that I Want people to recognize is the word transformation implies there's the finish line and I said or one of your previous segment that\nBusiness models are changing every Eighteen to twenty four months so you might as well eliminate this notion that there is a transformation with the finish line\nThe people that work for me know that when you get close to the finish line a reset it\nA little bit about another miles so that you're only going to keep running\nWhy you know what you said that I'll tell you why\nEverytime I'm fifty eight years old every time I have a business model and I go for it and I'm moving in that direction\nI Move the ball I Move in another direction of my employees are like well we just got this out and I'm like yeah but now we're going to go this way a little bit because things have changed I mean look we're on radio right now\nThe digital world has really almost eclipsed broadcast radio so now if you don't have a podcast\nYou know it's like something wrong because it used to be the only radio show guys had radio show anybody can have their own radio show now it's called they bought gas and it's available twenty four seven you don't have to make an appointment so if I stuck with the old model and didn't pod cast also\nThis model would be a dinosaur at some point and it will die at some point I think it will always be out there but you can't just do it alone it has to have an\nAdded pieces to a pod cast and videos and whatever else you know events and so the radio world had to evolve every world just like the one we're doing right now has to keep evolving you have to keep moving the mark continue\nAnd to build on that point I Am told many boards many of CEOs sea level executives\nIf you're striving for best and class process today that's like and shipping business as usual because by the time you deploy that the technologies already twenty four months ahead of you try to think about what I said if you're striving for best in class\nYou're striving for two years in ... right because the technology is moving so rapidly and so I Believe that a lot of people when they hear the word digital they think automation\nThat thing that you must understand is digital has nothing to do with automation it has everything to understanding the implications of automation to change your business model so think about a car company\nHistorically manufacturer you now feed them moving from combustion engine into ride share into a hybrid into electric into autonomous those are four different business model\nThere is not a thing\nThat is common across those four different business models are indeed different dealer implications different buying trends different you think that you go out and subscribe to your monthly cell phone service you're going to subscribe to a Mercedes Benz and a few years\nNow that are they're models are changing right yeah they are actually Porsche has something Cadillac has something called book by Cadillac and you know it it down there this access economy is what it's called and I've talked about it on the show\nPeople you know you have to realize what we're saying Kevin Mandy is articulating it quite well our world is changing that the pace of innovation is moving faster and faster and will continue to move into kind of a hyper speed\nOh my gosh okay so we come back on to take another break you get more time rather than just a\nLot of talk about the pace of innovation\nAnd how it's going to affect your our lives and we have a bit of a a visionary here who's talking about things that\nWe need to hear more opposite I'll give it a more time damage [laughter] it is a ... printer weekly they'll forget entrepreneur dot com on the Web videos and all kinds of great content right there at our podcasts of this show we'll be

now is I'm not going to sell you a piece of hardware I'm going to give you access to own going innovation what\nYou see with sales force dot com and dark you sign is I'm going to give you access to own going innovation we as consumers are now taking our demand from our personal lives over into the business life and that's changing business models because we want ongoing access and so\nWhen you think about leadership and lifting more if you have to bring the totality of the business the innovation and the talent along forward\nAnd that's why you can't be binary act you where you start what a thought leadership if it's only a binary aspect of the problem is not a lot of thought leadership\nCool man so you said something there that was just huge and I don't know whether it's yours where you've got it success is not sold success is delivered is that yours or where did that come from\nThat is a fundamental principle and what I Believe in [noise]\nDo that is freaking awesome because every salesman had just exploded they think that you know their sales technique sold something but at the end of the day if you don't deliver what you just sold the sale unwind falls apart and that

weekly now here's your host dealer so no disrespect\nTo salespeople by half a sales person that's always what I've taken pride in [noise] but to have it come to Jesus moment to realize that whatever you're selling was made and design and created by other people\nWhen you go out to sell something you are not just selling yourself as you are because you are selling yourself you are selling a product or a service that has a team of people behind you you need to make sure that you have that consciousness about you\nBecause the talent pool that is out there that you are trying to sell those\nYou know he like you said success is not sold success is delivered so\nWhen you sell some thing or some service or even some idea you better believe in it you better have bought it yourself\nAnd you better stand behind it with everything you have that is where people will trust you because they see that you have integrity you have on or you have decency because that's what needs to be in a sales person\nTo sell anything that's where success is made by delivering something that you have sold because you believed in it Kevin ... he's with us\nKevin is just bringing all kinds of intense thought process to my mind can you say\nIt's there [laughter] I'm so proud of myself Kevin [laughter]\nLet's talk now you said you're in pursuit [laughter] that's right I\nI Am talent management so now you know the sales people will call them the talent for a minute 'cause if they're if they're out there you know I mean look at\nWe got to have salespeople right because they're the ones that are ... you know the front line that's a frontline and I'm so there are a little more intense there or you know they're they're wild\nAnd um so there are a little more intense there or you know they're they're wild people the sales people how do you manage these these wild\nAnimal nature people that are on the frontline and bring them to hire thinking to me that is what as a salesperson I Would love to be brought up to a higher level of thinking which would make me a better salesperson right\nI agree with what you just said is you know for years we've talked about solutions selling we've talked about consulted a base selling we've talked about you know just letting you know many off for a A R I and you know embedded in theory on solutions\nUltimately I'm going to go back to one of the things that you and I talked about quickly which was listening\nI used to train sales people to open a conversation with no more than three sentences and that was very hard for them the other thing that I trained him to do with not to ask a question\nThat can be answered in yes or no it had to actually call somebody to engage in conversation well the reason why did that you would think was from a materialistic selling your approach but no I wanted my people to actually be able to on earth the problem that was being presented\nAnd when you look at talent today but I think a few companies are doing is making their sales people cross functionally relevant\nDo they understand why something was built in the first place do they understand it irrelevant to the competitive element why the competitors built it not the competitors product but why the competitors built it\nDo they understand the relevance of deployment from a large company a small company a medium ... do they understand the outcome that's why I trained my people to know more than three sentences and don't ask close ended questions because they jump to assumption\nOh no I heard what they wanted they won three of the that's what I'm going to go sell three is not the freaking business problem\nDo it that talent must have a forward looking ... Allen that also begins to mirror the where's technology going to enable them to be in the forward years and one of the last thing I did before leaving Cisco there was a\nTalent management person that came in and work with me and we truly began to look at the skills that we were going to need in relation to what engineering was building then we looked at it in relation to the talent to deploy by our customers\nAnd you began to see substantial gap in what our talent was as it stood today versus what it needed to be and as soon as three years\nWe stadiums strong you know stand with us and caring for our veterans\nTalk radio six eighty W O O G o Halley Chippewa falls over by\nThe same team\n\nUsa radio news for usa radio news I'm Robin ... happening right now forecasters say there is a newly formed\nHurricane brewing the name of this one ... and it could hit the coast of Mexico mid week not one ticket hits the Powerball so the jackpot Wednesday night climbs to six hundred and twenty million no one one the mega millions friday night said Tuesday night the jackpot at one point six billion\nOr if we keep going like we're going sooner than we thought it's going to be keep America great that President\nTrump and I'll go Nevada for a make America great again rally he's there to show support for Nevada senator Republican Dean Heller\nSeventeen Days the people that are going to re elect senator Dean Heller protect your job [noise]\nBorder and you continue making America great again that's what we're doing this\nIs usa radio news\nThis is a national health alerts from the healthcare hard line are you on Medicare and or have private insurance and suffer for back pain empty topical has a solution for you today you can call applied to receive a pain relieving treatment\nWhich is a comfortable back brace were customize ... but a little or no cost called indie topical toll free\nNow eight eight eight nine nine eight\nSeven to two five it just takes a couple of minutes to qualify for these amazing treatment that have helped thousands of people with severe pain you're personalized ... treatment will be delivered directly to your door cold indeed topical toll free\nEight eight eight nine nine eight seven to two five eight eight eight nine nine eight\nSeven two to five or go to envy topical dot com and get started on your road to a pain free life called indie topical toll free\nEight eight eight nine nine eight\nSeven two to five or go to empty topical dot com\nTexas people dealing with flooding and in Florida the cleanup continues in the aftermath of hurricane Michael usa radios Wendy king now with the latest on both areas\nThe math of hurricane Michael usa radios Wendy king now with the latest on both areas\nGovernor Greg Abbott says he expended the state disaster declarations from Eighteen to fifty four counties\nThis weekend rain will be focused over do Texas and then early to mid next week another more organized around the rain is expected to move through the states with heavy rain potential as well as the view strong storms\nMeantime the death toll from hurricane Michael stands at thirty five and most of those deaths\nAre in Florida the worst of the storm hit in Panama City and the two major hospitals\nThere are still not admitting patients when the ER services are available at either facility deputies in Lake County arrested at least ten people suspected of looting in the area in Callaway Aaron Guthrie had her baby things taken and Victoria Smith said someone took her purse from her hands while she was sleeping\nUsa radio news\nUpdates just were drivers who pay too much for car insurance do do do you watch the W. i.s tickets or anything else our company specializes in low cost us our twenty two auto insurance we noted mistakes happen and offered free quotes for very affordable auto insurance Mitt specifically for you the over paying high risk driver\nThe quote just free and we'll handle the filing so you could start saving money\nCalled eight hundred seven fifty eight oh seven twenty five\nEight hundred seven fifty eight oh seven twenty five eight hundred seven fifty eight oh seven twenty five\nWhere there is a clear sky this weekend many Americans will be able to witness a meteor shower usa radios John Clements now with the story ...\nAccuweather global weather center tells us about this weekend's meteor shower\nEarth orbit is actually passing through debris left behind from the trail of Haley's comment over the weekend as the earth takes that orbit through the debris some of that\nWill fell through the atmosphere is meteors in of course that was brought up through the earth's atmosphere we get quite a light show the peak of the meteor shower will be Sunday night into early Monday morning across the United states\nThe tiniest planet in the solar system about to get a visit from earth more now from usa Radio's Rick fenced in\nThe ...

ways or a visionary and river cruising so I'd like to know what did you are experiences that you know world and Viking teach you that you've taken to another level with your team and I'm a water

create theme and a cruising indictment a real gung ho who's ... who's Ryan and uh actually it it trying to achieve that goal that one day we'll be there had been in it and I think the idea of who they\nI think my God no doubts I Would agree Christine since we first met we've definitely sharing a little bit of a connection since we both\nWork with our spouses in our respective family businesses
