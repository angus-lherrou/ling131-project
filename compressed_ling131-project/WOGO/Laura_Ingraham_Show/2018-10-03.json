you know we were partying like every other kid in high school most other kids and you know this is what we did in the eighties people do different stuff now some still do the same stuff but you know this is this is enough I\nThink a lot of people if they see in right through this let's go to a militia Missouri line what Melissa\nHi I just wanted to say I'm I've been on both sides I've been in in a doctor fourth position and I've been in jets Kevin opposition where um I was a tax that was on the left it\nIn a doctor's office in fact and then um another time a former friend accused me or spread rumors about me that I was sleeping with her husband and I had no way to protect my reputation [noise] um so I Would have believed her\nIf she had come out with Kavanaugh's demeanor and said you creep you did this to me and if he had taken her demeanor and said oh I don't remember I don't remember what I did when I was in high school I Would have really the story but I didn't believe it\nI didn't believe her allegations from the get go just because of the timing of the letter and I want to start a match on your show right now Dianne Feinstein must resign\nNah I appreciate it eight five five forty Laura oh let's go to Paul main real quick Paul\n[noise] um I I just wanted to say I think um everyone tries to say so many people said a doctor for ... testimony was credible\nBut that's because it's the polite thing to say it's a politically correct thing to say it's like saying Santa Claus exists [noise] I I think\nAnybody that looks at her testimony objectively would say it wasn't credible and\nMr Trump President Trump is willing to hope that balloon of the social why he's willing to say no Santa Claus doesnt exist we need to grow up and and I I just I I think that's you know I think that's what he's trying to do here\nI appreciate it a five five forty Laura uh this is going to go down as one of the hardest fought confirmations and Supreme Court history if not the most difficult\nAh but in the end I think it's worth it you know why you can't reward people who make false charges you can't reward people who make allegations after the process has gone through with no contemporaneous preparation who\nHave some type of axe to grind can't do it and same goes with these people showing up in the Senate and cornering people in elevators none of this should be allowed it's a game of intimidation they're playing it\nWe know people who practice emotional extortion a political extortion this is a this is like an emotional terrorism so conservatives need not apply

Ford or the you know I don't know the woman but she wanted this to be kept confidential and the Democrats exposed it they leak didn't expose it intentionally for their own purpose\nBut this is part of a bigger attempt by the Democrats to take this to a new level I mean the paid activists that are around right now or my wife and I were physically accosted at a public airport on Monday This week because of this\nThese people were paid by the center of public democracy or they get money from the open society foundation which is George Soros who is putting to listen to this more than thirty two billion billion dollars into this effort over the last couple years this is a bigger issue and it's not going to go away when we confirm Kavanaugh this week\nNow and I think you're exactly right I think it's time for conservatives to stop playing defense and\nEveryone on their heels all the time like Jeff Flake like our in the elevator and then you get these guys are yelling at me it turns out the woman is a co executive\nDirector of of the Soros funded group as you said Center for democracy\nAnd I think it's time to turn the tables were okay sunshine on you who are you people\nWho are working for this organization you are carrying on and I think you could make the argument senator that uh and maybe a good lawyer plaintiff lawyer could do this or just good good litigation attorney could do this this is kind of a\nIt's almost like a Rico deal like these groups are working together to deny other people their rights to movement free movement which is guaranteed under our constitution free association\nOr they're ... they're acting in a way to deprive others I I Would say of there are inherent civil rights and totally agree meant to intimidate\nI totally agree but listen to what the senators are doing to incite the crazies in this effort this is senator Cory Booker you just had him on their here's another one\nThis is Corey Booker please get up in the face of some congresspeople representative Maxine Waters they're not going to be able to go to a restaurant go to a gas station go to shop at a department store\nTheir absolute get up and absolutely harass them Nancy Pelosi I don't know why they aren't uprising all over the country I mean it goes on to tell me again while we shouldn't confront Republicans where they eat where they sleep where they work until they stop being complicit\nThis is outrageous law and it it if it doesn't do anything else it should serve to wake us up you're exactly right Democrats had been playing office for the last hundred years this time for Republicans to stop being a minority party and wrote in and grow and grow up and\nYou don't have to grow up and become a you know stop playing defense this is this is the time right now\nA senator Purdue uh there's so much a that is happening ... which is positive\nOr in this administration the news has been unreal mitten ling ... only negative uh because ... that's just where the media are they're not going to that I mean we had this NAFTA deal pass okay or or or be able to negotiate has to pass the Senate\nEveryone said this couldn't happen they said Trump was a big uh ... uh Obama ridiculed I'm gonna made it does not have to go on for some are going to renegotiate all these deals well you know didn't took actually work to do this like Nineteen months of work I and and\nYou must hear nothing on this huge lower milestone for this administration\nIt's huge but it's part of it as part of what's going on this this economy is growing at twice the rate it did under President Obama we have a new free trade agreement with South Korea were about how wall with Mexico and Canada Europe is talking about zero tariffs we have China paying stepping up and paying attention to us now we have a nuclear\nConversation going on with North Korea to to end up in the ... of North Korea this presents agendas working at all we talk about is what the Democrats want us to talk about that is what you're saying is that we need to be on the opposite is talking about what's working in this gender before we get\nInto these elections in a few weeks\nI I can tell you the senator no one's going to want to try to stop me moving in a public street or try to harassment or restaurant okay this is a new I tolerate that anyone in my family and my kids they they they better be they'd been it'd be really reading because this is I I'm not intimidated by some\nRich kid who lives at home with his parents than in his free time you know jumps on the move on dot org website to get his marching orders okay like go home to rich parents and and who pay for your your three square meals a day and you're you're you know your your activism on the side I mean I just\nIt just doesn't impress me I call these people right after their faces\nLaw that's where we're going to be under the this week and it starts right here in the United states at people who are supporting this actively encouraging in citing it we have a state representative that actually was involved in our altercation on Monday a state representative from\nFrom Arizona okay of all places here in Washington these are not genuine people\nWho are ... out of Dr Ford or anything else they are paid activists this is a George Soros conspiracy and it's time we wake up expose them in stand up and fight for our country because that's what's at stake here\nYou think we have enough Republican money bags types to counter the effort is dire and Soros because they're just pumping tens of millions of dollars in Baltimore into voter registration and two are educating people in these training sessions on how to approach new\nVoters uh this is you know they're going to the the the new\nA Puerto Rican voters and in Florida and and land on line on them like oh Trump aides you and you had to throw the Republicans out and Georgia you see this tight governor's race which\nIs really disturbing to Stacey Abrams Abrams who's lost\nWeight or Georgia could elect a left wing Stacey Abrams to be governor great state of Georgia\nThis is what you were saying earlier one of the one of the good byproducts of this is I think it's a wake in the Republican base a was a little pass it particularly in Georgia maybe this year but I'll tell you this um that race in George has drawn thirty million dollars from a a Mike Bloomberg and\nAnd George has drawn thirty million dollars from a a Mike Bloomberg and ... and two other California investors what they're doing is they're California investors\nAnd New York donors are trying to sneak into Georgia instill that governor's race because they believe that's the way to the presidency and twenty twenty to get those electoral votes down there and it's just not going to happen we're not going to let that happen Laura\nI'm David Perdue or here in the learning them show a Jeff Flake yesterday seemed to kind of shift the goalposts little on Kavanaugh or maybe it was just commenting on his overall demeanor with the committee let's listen\nI was very troubled by the the tone of the of the remarks or the initial a defense that a judge ... capital I gave a ... was something I Hope that I Would\nSound that indignant if I were a if I felt that I was unjustly maligned but then it went on and the interaction with the members\nWas sharp and partisan and that concerns me\nA year reaction was concerning to you Kevin ... in the face of the old ...\nFloor he did exactly what I Would have expected him to do he was in ... and he should have been listening to what these guys are saying Chris Coons says if judge Kavanaugh seeking a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court\nAnd who I think now bears the bears the burden of disapproving these allegations the presumption of innocence has been a trashed in this whole process is not convenient for the Democrat\nI mean they talk about him being Cory Booker again calls him evil\nOr the other one said a Yale alum said people will die I mean the vernacular here has risen to a level that we haven't seen in decades Laura and it's dangerous Republicans had better not be asleep at this because these people are now mobilize they're funded\nAnd quite frankly this is just the the tip of the spear of what their ... activity I actually\nA Center for do in Georgia just going back briefly to this very tight governor's race\nUh what is your sense what are the people need to know I'm again this was a poll by a landmark pretty decent polling outfit unlikely voters hum\nAnd it was basically a forty five forty five dead heat or this governorship is very important for so many reasons the state of Georgia a and the growth the economic growth of Georgia's been very strong ah but what could a left wing governor due to that gross\nWell here's what they what she's saying she wants a single payer and she wants to all these give away programs that would cause a state tax has to be tripled this is the most extreme liberal progressive candidate that Georgia has ever had\nAnd she's getting funded by a all these outside donors not donors in Georgia by the way and so what's happening is all of this conversation about war women everything else is confused issue Georgia right now is right at the best state in the country and what to do business and she wants to tear that that\nWe have a great Republican candidate Brian Kemp is going to make a great governor and Republican so they get the vote out we will win that election\nI think that the people of Georgia and maybe they've gotten a little uh a little bit of an awakened awakening during the Senate entire cabinet deal I think we should make this a huge issue down there and push and push this uh the Stacey Stacey Abrams enough just come out in the cabinet thing\nThat I Would push a right to the wall and on nothing I mean it and the figurative way not literal way said don't start talking about and he didn't say anything anymore everyone's in every little word you say like slice and dice buddies left wing groups again funded by George Soros hateful little people in their basements\nUm but I I Hope they continue to ... because

change\nYeah it's a radical you know we have ... real results in this Republican a majority the results versus radicalism\nIt's yeah in fact her ceilings it's information over intimidation results over ... over and over and over again\nYeah GDP is four point to write and how it's going to be over four and a half but it's on ... ... it's what Kennedy is she right at the Kennedy did supplies\nI but I Will tell you Dave Dave I'll tell you this and I tell us on my Republican friends running numbers don't make it numbers there's a reason your opponent is doing a commercial with a a with a medically challenge child\nIt's about emotional day so you have the emotional argument is your father is your son's your brothers and real victims of sexual assault has been a have been you have ... are in jeopardy because of what's happening in Washington\nAnd and yeah well that that's right that's what you need I mean the numbers are you know that's it's great\nBut you get people jello hung up on a motion to\nDo with that my my opponent said don't don't look at the numbers are skinny number in my response to that and go look at a hundred billion Walmart shoppers\nWho sales are through the roof and then at the kitchen table issues right everybody's life is way better off now everybody two thousand bucks back in the pocket and it it's a family issue it is a kitchen table issue and so they\nAre they're they're running against the good news ah I'm I like where we are but uh\nWe we just got to have all our our entire team start focusing invested you together and like you said we've got to type stories that's where I ended up people\nIs Ryan and raising money for ... for me he's raising money just for the a congressional campaign a committee but is he ... ... ... raising money in part is getting money from them\nYeah yep yep Paul Ryan's or helped out an a a bunch of other outside groups are coming in to help out a thank goodness and so what they're doing that around the country\nAnd ah we were we can win and the economy is so fundamental right and it's just it's not just the numbers the optimism every small business that go meet with or buying a new truck or buying a new little piece of capital equipment or hiring one more person but that's a huge deal most of where I live which has made the small businesses\nAnd they're all at a good mood so it's like you said that the key is they have to get out and vote they cannot stay home we need\nEverybody out everybody go tell your church your church your business is your sports clubs just all the good decent people need to get out and vote\nFor we're not backward you want to go forward we need to go forward like this was optimistic pro American pro American worker pro manufacturing base and thank God we have people in Congress like Dave Brat and a\nPresident Trump President Trump by the way I was in the rose garden a yesterday or or was it yesterday on Monday SARS Monday during the NAFTA announcement said this\nI really believe that the people of our country they want the wall and they want border security they don't want to open borders like the Democrats want to have\nAnd I really think I have a very big decision to make some time right after the election very quickly do I want to do it before the election personally yes but I don't want to do that for a different reason 'cause I have some very find people that are running in close races in uh may affect them and it may not it may be good for them I happen to think it would be good for them\nI think Trump is usually rightness political calculation is he is he right to put this also and the Republicans until after the election\nIt either way it's his call I mean usually with the problem in the budget process it we've lost our leverage right we we let it be known that nine Senate Democrats will block us and so right now we don't have at the beginning of the cycle or it after the elections are ... back to a hundred percent\nSo he's probably right on that call and we got to have a fight on that one right that was one of the biggest rallying cries up his election\nAnd of mine and the people want to see it and a nine\n... end up mine and the people want to see it and a nine Senate Democrats ... uh we got to let the world see that and and the whole already got to come to mind the president on this immigration issue because it is the issue that just\nDivides the crony elites up in the city from the average person back in my district everybody I talk to you you want a wall you want to be able to board or you want to get rid of uh the gang activity\nAnd ... it's not just immigration is tied to the opioid problem that no three hundred billion lethal doses effect know him across the border this year in one year at like human trafficking that's like the gang activity right down to the family mental health depression of the kids is up Seventy percent\nThat's all tied in we've been working like crazy with that on our with our share of\nLike the immigration is intimately linked to all these other fundamental social problems we have you don't get it right or we're not going to solve these problems\nAre Dave Brat here on the lower income show go to Dave Brat dot com help them in this race he's one of the finest US Congressman that we have serving in America today he's he's with the president on all these critical issues and we need more data brats in Congress and we need him to return to Congress will take a break don't go away\n[noise]\n\nThe Laura Ingraham show [noise]\n\nAdmitted you probably
