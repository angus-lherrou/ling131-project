it'll be talking about the national security aspect and getting into [noise] this interesting theory\nNow so you understand a little bit more about me I have a background in Russian studies actually have a degree in in what was Soviet Studies at the time now Russian studies and so following the Soviet the former Soviet Union ah what's going on there and the U.S Russia relations is a an area of great interest to me\nUh and in fact I I'm I'm Still very close to my college advisor or and we spend a lot of time talking about especially in light of what was happening with the elections and the

and it's interesting because she said to me ... and and this is always stuck with me while I'm a ... does not chair does not care who is in charge in America\nWhen why don't report and cares about is selling as much chaos as possible and using the very things that we consider our greatest strength in our Democratic Republic\nTo use those against remember what am I putting some martial artist or and so when he wants to do is feed chaos now when this issue happen obviously lots of chatter amongst people about\nAbout a a you know who might be behind this what the motivation is who would help so it hurts a lot of folks talking about a someone who might be a progressive because as we know progressive is like to use a a bombs as their tools of of terror that's a fact\nThey don't like guns they like they like bombs [noise] um but the reality is that you know so so that's that's as we're talking about this someone said to me\n[noise] you know and what about what about the possibility\nWhat about the possibility that this could be\nA a a Russian effort then FSB effort now I had a conversation yesterday with Peter joy ... a Russian expert he was actually attacked possibly by uh uh putting cronies present I I ... anti pollutant stances\nSheep sheep specifically said to me no he did not believe that this was a Russian effort this would have been sort of beyond the pale but isn't an interesting\nI had it you know that Chuck Todd was talking about this uh yesterday on ... on on MSNBC\nI have this fear that it could be some Russian operation to is designed to do what's happening now more of this you know I think we ... and so in some ways we shouldn't roll out of me and I think it's a strange moment and we have no idea where it comes from\nWe have no idea where it comes from it's absolutely true and remember I said context\nIs everything right when we talk about when we talked about uh the Peter Struck Lisa Page the FBI situation with regards to the Trump campaign context was everything with that timeline you had to understand the timeline in order to understand what was going on\nThe same thing can apply here and get knocked conspiracy theorized and again I Am just trying to find meaning in what is a very bizarre situation\nVery bizarre situation how how do you have ten bombs or a fake or otherwise go through the postal service without a without a um a post mark on them and without that post mark on them\nHow do you discovered that they came out of Florida now that's very strange to me but but the point is this is interesting [noise] so this all up at the episode started happening a couple of days ago\nLast week last week the United states announces\nThat they are pulling out of the intermediate nuclear intermediate range nuclear forces treated the I N F treaty signed by Bob uh signed by um I'm President Reagan and negotiations were pulling out because the Russians are violating that treaty Vladimir Putin's turns around and says if the United states starts deploying missiles\nIn Europe than the Russians are going to have to retaliate they're going to start targeting those countries and that's a that's a very direct threat at the same time us backed forces and us equipment is being used\nTo kill Russian or or to kill a Russian soldiers on the ground\nIn Syria the Russians are not happy about this and so to me given what the Russians have been willing to do\nIt is not beyond the pale wasn't remember the Russians were literally killing people in Great Britain or trying to kill people in Great Britain I should say\nLiterally trying to kill people in Great Britain we notice\nSo ... it to me it's not it's not beyond the realm of possibility\nThat they would turn around and send bombs that were knocked the we're not real bombs fake bombs dummy bombs through the post office to a bunch of democratic targets in order to turn the left and right against each other even further that is what Vladimir Putin wants\n\nAnd I think it makes a heck of a lot more sense than either a right wing or left wing or sending fake bombs through the mail\n[noise] in any case when we come back we're going to be joined by Todd would former air force

fantastic special call them at eight hundred for a zero fifty two zero six or go to Jenny dot com that's ... dot com\nWell it is possible I mean what they just sprayed nerve gas all over the u._k. yeah feel several\nPeople or one person and so it is possible however I think it would be incredibly reckless and literally an act of war targeting you know former political leaders and for you know the vice president's et cetera uh of the United states I don't think the Kremlin is that reckless at this point now that's just my point you know I have reporters\nAll over the former Soviet Union and I just don't believe that they would do that\nAt this point in time well let me ask you this because getting getting back to design a treaty and you've written about and I agree with you wholeheartedly the time has come for America to pull out of it um but ... has now turned around and said that that if\nThe U.S starts placing intermediate range missiles in central Europe he's going to target and I don't know what do you mean by targeting maybe you can elucidate us on that but what you know that he's going to target these countries I talk so what is it what does that mean\nAnd and how do you what does what does it mean that he's going to target and how seriously should the u._s. be taking various threats by putting on the IMF treaty pull out\nWell that that's exactly what you would think he would say I mean what else is going to do except threaten you know the U.S in countries where we may deploy intermediate range nuclear missiles\nJust like we did a you know in the eighties under Ronald Reagan with that person chooses against the ss twenties et cetera that were deployed throughout the Warsaw Pact against western nations\nAnd so when he means by targeting is is really just putting the court and it's sort of Warsaw or you know hungry or whatever in the in the uh targeting\nA timeout holes that carry this\nTime I visited so you're literally he literally means targeting like like when when I'm a Michael Moore went to Russia to try to find the nuclear missiles that were targeted at a a Detroit there's literally he's talking about about changing target coordinates\nOh for sure he he I mean what could I mean my point of that article is that we've seen this all the Ford and this is how we bankrupted the Soviet Union there is no way that Russia\nKeep up with us economically especially under the Trump academy which in two years maybe pushing seven percent growth there is just absolutely no way they can keep up and he's trying to Boston and then I noticed he went to the United nations and\nThey tried to drum up support there to force us to not withdraw from the treaty but this is classic Trump negotiations that you know threaten to try to keep them in the treaty to begin with and had them stop violating what they're doing\nMy guess is Todd more he's a former U.S air force pilot a he's a national security columnist for the Washington Times this piece in the Washington Times an arms race with Russia bring it on I think it will go up on on more as a a Web site\nCertainly will go up on the Andrew Langer show page on Facebook so go and check that out there explain to us a little bit about what ... dot com is because that's that's fascinating to me\nYeah well I Know I have a long history or in Russia studied it in the air force academy their language I you know learned about the Soviet Union are flying for the air force I traded emerging market down on Wall street for almost Twenty years\nFocusing on Eastern Europe and other countries and so I Know a lot about the region and I just really realize that the west especially Americans in you know middle America don't know anything really about what's going on over here so I had built a team of reporters and we're growing rapidly the traffic is growing and and we're really just trying to bring news analysis\nCulture opinion as to what's happening here\nWell and the important point in and you and I own a gun to talk more about this because I was I was a Soviet Studies major in college myself and so and I also learn the language are you at the very least I Need to brush up on my Russian so I'm always looking for and we'll talk to the show dog she was on a show\nSo much but my my question a lot of sleep people what they don't understand is it is that this is really it's not for ... and it's not about\nReestablishing the Soviet Union but it really is about reestablishing the trappings of the Russian Empire and and\nYou're exactly right until the end of things like me\nWell what the bank you but you're saying it was supposed to be able to claim that a little bit explain explain what that means in the modern context of what a modern Russian Empire looks like\n\nBut I don't know what a modern Russian Empire looks like but I'll tell you what the ultimate looked like it stretched from Poland and people don't notice all the way into San Francisco there's a Fort roost you can go to in San Francisco yeah he'll exist today as a monument\nAnd so bizarre empire was huge Russia before the Soviet Union was one of the most productive successful countries they said do you uh really half the world with their economy on their agriculture\nAdjust now a hundred years later I got back to that point and so that tells you what the Soviet Union did to them it destroyed them economically destroyed them politically culturally I mean what Russia last with the Soviet um you know the ... revolution is just astounding and I would I Would I don't want to happen here so we had a lot about\nThat but I mean this is this is why this this changing stance visa V. Russia is so important I mean\nThe the idiotic Russian reset that's then secretary of State Hillary Clinton was talking about was completely ineffectual\nThe the the you know it's not just that the Russians only understand strengths it's not quite that but the Russians have to respect your ability to push back and and to know that you're serious about what you're doing I don't I mean that that's what makes what we're doing now so different than what the Obama administration tried to do with my right\nOf course and if you want collusion I mean the Obamas or their their entire administration on down with the ones that clear to Russia and still probably are in some ways\nUh you you look at a uranium so you know those sales you look at a what's going on with the Trump dossier cetera I mean there was intricate interaction with the Russian security services by the bomb in his administration against a political candidate and and so\nIt's just amazing to me that people don't get that still they don't want to be\nTaught how to folks have folks find out more about what you're up to the good working and doing that I listen I get in touch with you want I Want to talk Russian when you\nUh well I can always go to our them dot com the S.

arriving in Greece and they will be facilitated in crossing certain countries so that those countries can get them out of their their content it was ... ... it's interesting you talk about this\nIs talk of the issues of national security and I've been down to the southern border and I urge anybody in every one if you've never been down to the border go down to the border in in uh in Arizona and California\nAnd watch you know there's highways that that travel right along the border I Want to say it's a high five I don't remember I Know it's on I think that that goes north south I think it's I tend interstate ten goes right along the border there\nAnd I've watched people cross the border it is a scary prospect even if people are not coming you know into commit harm but the idea of something like that simply walk across this patch of land and and my great that that is a frightening prospect to me and I'm thinking as he was ...\nOf course and by the way you know people want to make us seem like we're a xenophobic\nA you know paranoid people because we talk about uh the danger of of course border here's the reality the president was ... by the way when he said that you know there could be middle Easterners or for example we had no idea it was causing here's what we do know\nAnd this is a conspiracy theory nonsense isn't from so far right website the Laredo station of the border patrol tells us that this year they have already arrested six hundred and Bangladeshis are crossing illegally now why do I mentioned that because obviously Mexico's a very long way from what\nI'm saying that that also happens to be a country that has a real problem with Islamic hairs\nAre so there are reasons for us to to fully met anyone coming here from Bangladesh even coming legally but the fact that they're coming illegally through Mexico I think it's very I\nSure and tells us you know that we don't know who's kind would be caught six hundred how many have we not caught um so it doesn't make sense for economic security it doesn't make sense for national security it's not fair to legal immigrants there are just so many reasons why we have to stop this and I think we need to get Mexico\nTo do their part when you use trade as the leverage and say we're going to start trade restrictions and by the way that doesn't work if it comes to it we will see all this border there will be no trade from Mexico I Hope we don't have to get better ... but I think that option has at least be on the table so that we don't have the crisis of them actually\nCrossing the border walking across as happens too often as you mentioned\n... and by the way the interstate that I was looking for the interstate eight in the south of interstate panic goes right along the border in Arizona and California and my guest is Steve Cortez and we're talking about this it it's funny because I I come back to you set a thing about being a phobia and I I Want to also make it very clear I've said this a little bit earlier on on the show\nBut one of the one of the great things about America the thing that makes America the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth\nIs affected anybody can come to America and become an American\nRight that that is that is an essential element of who we are it's a wonderful thing it's something you can't find anywhere else the you go just about anywhere else do you go in the world but I can move to France today I could live in ... in France for another Thirty years I Will never be considered French Japan in the same thing Korea the same thing\nBut anybody can come to America and and become an American it's the beauty of who we are we're just saying that you have to do it within the process you have to do it legally you and you cannot expect if you're going to come up here on moss\nAnd and do something about it so the president's talking about deploying troops down to the southern border\nUm there is a lot of discussion as to whether or not this violates ... I don't believe that it does having read the various statutes that are out there where do you come down on this\nRight now I don't think so because it's it's a clear danger to our orders external dangerous so you know I don't think it does it by the way I'm so glad you made that point two of you know look the mainstream media you play that Joe Scarborough and he was just\nRidiculous morning yes totally insulting to America trying to make us a racial issue they often do that by the way when they don't want to talk policy where they do they just call this race of course and and tried to dismiss us but here's here's the reality of America's not a race or you know as you point out right and if you believe in our values and our constitution\nAnd if you're going to bring work ethic and skills that we need a than we want you to become an illegal immigrant and you're so right the second you are you're an American\nNo questions asked that doesn't happen in the rest of the world oh so this is not about race remotely a it is about citizenship and it is about borders and it's largely by the way I pointed out to the Joe Scarborough is largely about protecting\nAmerican citizens many of whom happen to be minorities are black and Hispanic American I Believe soccer more than anyone\nFrom tolerating illegal immigration a why because many of them are working class people who have to compete in the labor market against illegal immigrant labor so it actually harms black and brown Americans perhaps the most of all to tolerate porous border\nYou know my ... my my my colleagues see motley unless government dot dot org has talked to a great deal of about that issue about the sort of the economics of this is well it in the end for me it comes down to issues of national security it comes down to issues of sovereignty or if we don't control who is migrating here\nUh them in any nation any nation that doesn't control who's coming in is pretty soon finds itself without a nation and we certainly don't want that seat court says how do we find out more about what you were up to\nYou know I'm On CNN most nights be on there and we're not tonight and on Twitter at court as the C O R G E S C\nI Will listen I appreciate that will put up links on the underlying or show page I'm sure we have ... thank you so much for joining us today\nThanks for having me free ... and it's interesting 'cause he was talking about the issues of of people of color in America\nA and one of the things that I wanted to get to today I really did get a chance to get to was this issue of uh the president speaking tonight at a gathering of conservative African Americans are they're going to be posted at the White House today and then they are doing the gala event tonight here in Washington DC\nUh you know president is really doing what he can because\nRight it's funny or the American dream is about everybody is about every but it's about bringing everybody in and the only way you can do that is by creating the conditions we're by everybody can succeed\nWe've talked about this about sort of good economic news today uh the the we have the GDP out a GDP is it a third quarter GDP a three point five percent a\nTenth of a percentage point above where it was expected that as a immeasurably good news and yet and yet we're not talking about this by the way I Am taking your tweets I did get a life as I said I Do read the critical tweets here\nKevin tweets and Andrew please stop saying ah every two seconds when I get excited to fix up eight when I get excited I I tend to speak over myself and I get a little closer to my speech be when I'm looking at breaking news on the TV sometimes I get a little distracted by that so I Do apologize\nSometimes I Do try to work very hard on my on my verbal textbook Kevin thank you so very much for listening so intimately to that\n[noise] ah Patty writes in on Twitter by the way you can tweet at me and Andrew underscores anger Patty writes I found you good job filling in for Laura we need evidence confirmed if this is the liberal sending the bombs I must be one idiot we keep sending the bombs with so much attention\nIs this is a liberal sending the bombs I it must be what idiot we keep sending the bombs with so much attention didn't Brennan have rights them come from ... to him I got to go back and look about I don't remember a friend and got it I Know a bunch of conservatives did certainly will send to folks at the Pentagon a Bible certainly double check on that\nAs we got a couple of more minutes here on the show\nBefore we close out for the day I'll continue to take your tweets at Andrew underscore Langer continue to take your phone calls\nEight five five forty Laurie is the number eight five five four zero L.
