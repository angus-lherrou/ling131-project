I Wonder what he said that I meet the press or was it at the debate what was that actually\nIt was during a live stream that he was doing from Florida where he was like explaining to his followers where\nIt was yesterday yes\nOkay good story was blowing up and this is how he addressed it yesterday what what's what is\nThe real truth you align you're hurting Mike you mentioned Mike ... he thought Mike Miller reserve the seats and his brother got them and paid for the Mike Miller is the FBI agent posing as a real estate developer whom he had a text message we now learn\nFrom a lobbyist friend who said Mike Miller and the crew have tickets for us for Hamilton tonight at eight PM awesome news Gillum responded now he's trying to shape and shape the story to make it seem as if oh I thought he only reserve the tickets and my brother paid for them and just handed them to me well\nThat this story is starting to slip and slide\nAll over the place\nIs a critical race for Donald Trump this is probably of all the races across the country it's the most important\nOr the governorship of the great state of Florida because of its effect on the twenty twenty campaign\nAnd of course that Florida is a bellwether state for where the rest of the country's going ah but CNN is even hitting at the FBI probe centers on whether developers successfully influence city projects at one point in the program undercover agents successfully infiltrated Gillum inner circle no one's been charged with any wrongdoing\nAnd killings repeatedly said he's not the focus of the investigation but as attendance at a Broadway show with lobbyists and longtime friend Adam Corey along with his brother and a federal agent who went by the name Mike Miller has been used by political\nOpponents to suggest Gillum it's potentially under more direct scrutiny you want to elect somebody who could very well be down the road indicted by the federal government given this given this story this is getting worse he he could be under even even more criminal trouble let's check in first with chip Roy a there's an interesting piece in Politico meet the next to it\nWell let's check in first with chip Roy out is an interesting piece in Politico meet the next Ted Cruz in November chip Roy is likely to be elected to Congress top House Republicans worry that he'll be to the rights of the Freedom Caucus that's

Latino and we and Raymond royal found this out when he went to the Trump rally or this week are a special correspondent there there are so many Latino voters Latino Americans legal immigrants into the United states has said what are we doing\nThis is just ridiculous they're all for Trump to offer crews and obviously they're all going to be voting for you are a lot of them are going to be voting for yet why did they want to turn this country and to the countries they left\nWell there's no of course it early tell you that the strongest advocates that I meet on the campaign trail and I caught up this district and all the taxes the strongest advocates for border security are those immigrants who come here whether those are not particularly static in Texas\nOr come here legally they know what they got a note or ... separate\nFrom places like Mexico and Central America and there beside themselves to see what the Democratic Party particular frankly some Republican or\nA supplement to their their beside themselves what they want to do to this country so that look the message recorder security strong immigration standing up for our country is selling well and by the way\nIt is much better

really well we are getting throughout the state and meeting in green and\nHad a big debate the other nights are only state wide televised debate and my opponent I chose not to show up the only Democrat who didn't show up for the debate well\nHow how would that be even possible I mean the Democrats have\nMade some fairly significant headway in in ah both the Senate seat since Norm Coleman and\nUh since uh you know we've lost the governorship plenty and then he tried to run again and he\nHe got a defeated obviously I'm In his bid for the Senate ah but where where are we now and trying to and trying to rebuild the Republican Party in that state Minnesota's economy has been doing so well and the Trump\nEra of just two years we've seen a massive ah uptick\nIn the states productivity this is all positive why would people want to vote against that now\n[noise] will they doubt out we had a or Minnesota is turning Red Cross the whole state people are feeling it they're happy with the way the economy is going and I think ... left didn't show up for the debate the other night because she didn't have any answers to this and where she stands on the issue she's so far\nLess and so extreme and and part of the resistance and obstructing everything good that is happening on the ground\nA and then she's also a for open borders and she wants to Minnesota to be a sanctuary state and she is\nDirectly tied to Keith Ellison still continuing to campaign with him yet uh\nBeing as hypocritical as as they are she's again you know wanting to impeach uh Brett Kavanaugh adjusted cabin on call for another investigation so\nMinnesotans are are some of the most well educated people when they go to the polls we don't have to register Democrat or Republican were free to move without the cabin when we go vote and they do their research and and that we have some of the ... we have the highest turn out\nIn the country when it comes to voting and so we go educated so it was really disappointing that Tina's that didn't want to debate nay or at least tell the people have Minnesota where she stands on things because she knows that's not what's resonating on the ground\nWell a Speaker Ryan Paul Ryan was in Minnesota uh yesterday and warned or the day before yesterday was warning of a green wave of democratic fundraising in a visit to drum up support for uh some of the house candidates Erik Paulsen and Jason Lewis\nAnd there are there are two of the more vulnerable in our house candidates on but the Ryan said there's enormous amount of Democrat money flooding the state uh last week Gabby Giffords came and did a a star turn there\nFor some of the Democratic congressional candidates are and they they believe that if they can fully turn\nMinnesota blue then that will be another blockade for a Trump and twenty twenty\n[noise] uh and and it's not happening I'm not feeling it anywhere even in the primary what happened to your so we are but go for it and we could have told you what was going to happen um\nMinnesota is definitely turning red we flipped our state house in two thousand and fourteen to Republican our state Senate in two thousand and sixteenth or we got up on the iron range which had voted Democrat for more than sixty years\nIs now going to flip the Republican we've got a great candidate up there and he's plus Fifteen or all of the rural areas are farmers are really on board with what the president is doing finally somebody it's fighting for our farmers and putting their issues at the forefront of campaign\nSo it's all it's all the the uh of fake media and their rhetoric and talking about the blue wave and it's I'm not feeling it anyway and that's just me not just me as a candidate I really am not when I'm traveling throughout the state there's a lot of energy the height\nOf the president and and even when he came for the two rallies he's already done to rally this cycle here in Minnesota there's a lot of excitement for my campaign and for the rest of the candidates throughout the state\nOur current housley it is a fantastic to have you on a ... everybody needs to get out there and vote because the woman who was appointed Tina Smith\nOr even worse than Al Franken if you can believe that and she you know she uh obviously you know thinks that she'll be able to just snuck or the\nMinnesotan voters for more liberal policies in open borders forget it ... the last thing the Minnesotans need our politicians in the state\nOr in a a senators representing the state who believe that they need more regulations on the small business owners and more problems for the medical device manufacturers who have done such a great job\nTo route to reinvigorate the Minnesota economy after the uh the great recession so care current housley has got to win the seat that would be phenomenal news\nAs we march or even after this election toward twenty twenty I think Donald Trump can win twenty twenty and\nTwenty twenty Minnesota He he he didn't win it last time around but he made a Mitt valiant attempt at the very end to try to pull out a victory\nA car and thank you so much best of luck in that race or for that Senate seat that was vacated by um the grope or Al Franken All right we'll take a break eight five five forty Laura we have a lot more to get to a this Andrew Gillum Rhonda\nSantas debate tonight is going to be critical

heard a commercial for trinity I gave them a call\nIf you're in depth and you need he'll call trinity at one eight hundred seven nine for over four three something\nWhen I first called I was a little embarrassed and kind of a shame and I looked at the numbers and I saw how quickly that astronomical debt that was in my life\nWould go away trinity will consolidate your accounts into one easy to manage monthly payment reduce your interests and possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands of what I Would tell other people please pick up the phone and call trinity just let them put together a program and see how affordable\nI'm doing great thanks for having me back on\nA John tell us a first of all I Want your reaction to this a series of comments about President Trump that when he says he used a nationalist that means essentially he's a white nationalist John your comments\nOr I I think that folks get so wrapped around the actual around the around identity politics and it's it's\nOh I I think that folks get so wrapped around the actual around the around identity politics and it's exactly what's driving as a part of the nation we're all Americans and one of the great artists that I've ever had my entire life is leading Americans at the battle in Iraq and bringing them all back home\nYou know one of the things that you look at when you look at things like the Olympics are the only things that are that look the same on us our our uniforms are we are together all American and I don't have a a black message or white Mrs I said last night but a red white and blue message and I I feel like you have\nA the the progressive Marxist on the left who don't have a message they don't have an identity so we need to identity politics\nIn order to keep themselves in power I reject that fundamentally on either side far left are far right and I truly believe that by serving all Americans as as equals moving all up together is exactly the type of leadership we need Washington\nWell again the lurch to claim racism\nOr at every turn and claim it's either a combination of ... being a wild or racist or Trump being Hitler which is\nWhich is now it's so disgusting on so many levels and insulting to Holocaust survivors and\nYou know all people everywhere but to me that's a sign of Democrat desperation John they have they have no\nReal solutions Debbie Stabenow your opponent in this Michigan Senate race clearly has no ideas she has no solutions for America it's all about insults personal insults a and attacking the motivations of those with home mom you know she disagrees\nAnd this this is a basic this is absolutely basic no we we learned the amount of uh of angers class we'd be logical analyses ad hominem attacks\nOn when you don't have any facts to back up your argument you go to direct directly attacking the individual you go to directly setting up these fallacies because you don't have yourself anything to stand on\nDebbie Stabenow a for her part has been a career politician for forty years has collected four million dollars and the taxpayers only got five who her co sponsored bills into law in the past Eighteen years and ... buildings she likes to bipartisanship is a buzz word when she's anything but\nShe's a salad a as a New York senator loaded with Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton Ninety five and nine to ... some of the time respectively and the promises she's made around\n... around Lauren pharmaceutical drug costs around\nAnd taking care of education and around um funding emergency ah funding for our troops who are deployed and in our veterans who were coming back home she's broken palms and so when I say to her all the time\nAnd I would I tell people in the state of Michigan to ask is why should we believe this time senator staff and now she will say anything to get reelected it will engage in this politics to drive us apart\nWhat I'm trying to do is bring us together because we're all Americans and we need to rise up together to make sure that we in all this ridiculous rhetoric\nI Love this a lot of Debbie Stabenow now claiming she's against sanctuary cities where was she when the Democrats had uh two years of of majority rule in Obama's first two years in office I mean I don't remember Debbie Stabenow standing up for the American worker back then I remember standing up for\nA better trade policies against a China or Mexico and I I don't recall any of that but now because she wants or forty four year career and politics to continue suddenly she's Donald Trump on immigration I don't think so\n[noise] she she is a selective uh in her positions she has a higher survival like you and she does whatever her polling and a Chuck Schumer will tell her\nI'm centers to have it on and you can see our debate on John James for Senate dot com and follow around 'em but senators now will do is ever convenient\nUm she voted against case law she supports sanctuary cities and uh she will not do anything to secure our border she's been up in a position to get comprehensive immigration reform done over her entire period over the past two decades or in in Washington and has failed to lead\nAnd so I Would say this is not that we need to get done right now all we need to end illegal immigration\nAnd uh the only way to do that is to get someone who's going to be more than just talk about it but somebody who's going to work with anyone and everyone to get this thing because this is a matter of uh of economic and national security and it cannot be kicked down the road and one thing I Will guarantee if W stamina gets re elected on national security will be jeopardized in our ability to grow our economy will also be jeopardized\nHey John what is the reaction among African Americans in your state uh Europe proud combat veteran\nAre you a West Point graduate are you um you're a Republican which is is you know is is not something that a lot of people in Michigan you know are are used to because the Democrats still have a\nYou know still have a monopoly on the black vote but are you finding you're getting more black support in your state is or or does the Republican label's still scare people off\nWell I'll tell you what if people get to know me for me is people begin to disassociate a me from the are by my name or the color of my skin or they begin to realize that hey guys um this this guy made\n'em want a Republican primary in a in the state and uh I'm going to be the only African American to the top of the ballot and and people are starting to realize that everything that I'm saying I'll rings true\nAnd you take a look at the center stabbing now has failed to do with with uh with what concerns African Americans and uh and Michigan's regardless of race round the state or they're taking a look at this keeping an open mind and beginning to come over\nI I Believe that the only ones who are not are ones who are who can't see past a of a a blind hatred or blind allegiance but those who I'm Talking talking to who are keeping an open mind and I recognize the I'm the best leader\nUm for Michigan into the future or bringing balance an actual experience on both from a combat environment understanding veterans' issues and national security and from a business environment understanding how to create jobs and how to protect the American dream for future generations to include our children Detroit\nThe most segregated city\nYou know now it seems like a hundred and it's it's not that I Love those rights but historically one of the most beautiful places incredible architecture incredible history of music and arts and architecture tucked in and it was amazing decades of Democrat rule\nHave destroyed so many great American cities like Baltimore and in St Louis
