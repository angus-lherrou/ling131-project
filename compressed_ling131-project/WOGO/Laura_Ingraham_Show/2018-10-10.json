dialogue I got to have respect for people that disagree with me and she ought to respect for people that disagree with our but in your face is in a way to do it\nWell she said a year ago that she was going to take Donald Trump out\nAnd what does that mean I mean she is that this I'm lesbian or gay algae beauty dinner and she goes incentive take him out\nAnd she wasn't saying take 'em out for dinner and she's like take him out and telling people that are getting harassed and restaurants and it seems like that that message really has terminated\nThe permanent protest a mentality in the Democratic party senator in in my concern is that someone's going to end up getting hurt we already had Steve's ... shot you would have thought that the that the Democrats would have calmed everyone\nDown after that but when you have Susan Collins been cornered in an elevator it's one thing when Jeff Flake is cornered in elevator but then you have poor old Susan Collins yet people being ... screen data centimeter from their face while they're trying to walk down a hallway I mean what can be done about this\nWell ah obviously for those of us that are in public office and in in public places and we're confronted with that and they're doing it under what they think is First Amendment rights the only thing you can count on his police protection we have\nBut then you can't have police protection for four five hundred and thirty five members of Congress\nEvery place they are spread throughout the United states even relying upon local police\nOr you can't do that as well so are are are\nI've gone to the conclusion and this repetitive of whatever kind of already said to you but are a democracy will be a stronger a whiz respectful political discourse as opposed to what is happening or when you a quote unquote get in their face\nWell but what senator what responsibility does something like a Dianne Feinstein or Cory Booker or Kamala Harris have to uh to speak against this type of harassment and intimidation this isn't just carrying a sign in and chanting some things this is cornering women in elevators this this is something and we have\nWe have people threatening to kill cabinet are teachers and Minnesota I mean people are taking this all the hard if you if you say someone's like a combination of not seeing a sexual predator enough time\nSome whack a doodle is gonna you know take take matters into his or her own hands got help it so what responsibility does the Democrat leadership have here\nUh I don't think they're going to exercise but they gotta they gotta responsibility to renounce it\nNo I Would I Would I'm waiting for that ah I'm waiting for that matter grassy there go ahead\nYou know wait a long time I think we started [laughter] Senator Grassley or\nThe lessons learned from this Kavanaugh saga of\nMany of us thought that in the beginning when we had to put up the hearing and kick it off from the Thursday vote initially kick it off to Monday and then it got delayed because of the Ford allegations\nAny thoughts to solidifying the rules so you can't extend hearings past the close of the original hearing date so these kind of anonymous allegations can't drop and make a difference again\nWell I've read your\nTweets ... took me to tears called me for for not calling for a whole bunch of but you can't you can't ... if I call the vote today you want to we went along we we weren't all tend to tend to rely on and so you gotta have some respect for people that are on the job here and you know doing it\nAnd so we we waited until we had the votes\nNow now I corrected myself after that I didn't delete the tweet because I set it on but I corrected myself and then you and you and McConnell both\nHindered handled this master fleet in the face of incredibly difficult\nAnd I think I'm a I'm a highly emotional highly charged atmosphere and when people say that Dr Ford was disrespected which is a guest on my show said last night she was disrespected I said oh my gosh Senator Grassley said that\nIf you need something repeated or you know if you are you okay do you need anything I mean\nYou couldn't have been more solicit isn't Dr Ford I I Can't imagine how you could have been frankly\nYeah well it reminds me of how I was confronted by Iowans because uh in the Thomas hearings because I was so mean to on the hill and I never ask a single question but I was sitting beside specter that did are questioning and everybody thought I was factor [laughter]\n[noise]\nOh my goodness I'm Senator Grassley a there was another moment that I have to get you to react to um this is Heidi Heitkamp of course Democrat in North Dakota undecided divide vote against having off a lot of people have talked about whether the court\nRemains legitimate you heard Hillary say that it's a shame that things happen as they happen\nPort remains legitimate you heard Hillary say that it's a shame that things happen as they happen because the court always was respected and this is what senator hide camps then\nYou're obviously in the midst of a very tough reelection fight and I know you you feel voting the way you did was the right way do you worry are you concerned that may have cost you your sentences\nAt the end of the day still have to look at yourself in the mirror and think about\nWhat your future holds\nYou compromise or something like this based on politics and I I Believe the asphalt would have compromised um my true belief that um this person's um did not have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court\nThey're still repeating that the temperament issues Senator Grassley\nHe\nListened this gets back to what I already told you got twelve successful years on the DC circuit the second most important a court in the land he's been college all\nOr even people like Garland a said that he had that sort of a approach to judge Judy and that means judicial temperament and not only are you have a personality that is tempered you also leave your personal views out of\nOut of a decision making you look at the law and look at the facts of the case and just to use those two things to go by so consequently a it what what she said Sandra Hi Kim said plus your question brings me\nTo a history of Thomas\nOr is it going to hurt the Supreme Court\nI listen to the same thing twenty eight years ago and then I look at twenty eight years record of Thomas on the court and I've never seen any retribution on his part towards anything that was set against him at that time and he was mad when he said he was going through our high tech\nIn Shanghai ... or something like ...\nYeah so so uh you know after twenty eight years or less the same thing about Thomas not seeing it I think that I got great confidence that Kavanaugh's going to bring great stage and knowledge and academic background\nAnd more importantly his work\nOn the second highest court ... court and it's all positive\nNo it's it's ... he's the one in the most qualified people period of time to sit on the court a Senator Grassley the uh the Susan Collins um situation in Maine [noise] of course all these leftist billionaires promising a to flood\nOr the her opponent whoever that ends up being a with lots of money you want to raise three million dollars for Susan Collins and I know Mitch McConnell has said the same thing how was that looking\nWell we're just getting started at that but a conservative even though a lot of times they disagree with Susan Collins they got all her as a senator of great principal\nAnd we need to respect that and I said three million it's going to take a lot more than three million director but they raised ... million against her so our goal is three million dollars\nRight now and everybody that really ought to respect her and want cabin on on the porch onto a go along that line and I hope a rallying cry\nFor Republicans over the next twenty eight days between now and the

special or called eight hundred three eight five fifty one sixty\nI Love him he did a fantastic job and I mean ... what about you know I I've always really liked it All right congressman what is going on now we had you had a Trump flying with all Rosenstein\nOr the other day down to where the heck when they find a Florida yeah and I saw a rod at the White House at the cabinet thing and I said well yeah wrinkle some picks the dust on the president what'd you do you say your best friend what what what is the theory there congressman\nUh I I don't know but I don't know the facts are facts and then you have to give us McCain memos that we subpoenaed\nThere are all these stories out a earlier this week that talk about how serious they took the alleged comments Mr Rosenstein made about actually recording the president in the oval office wearing a wire or tape recording in whatever they were or a phone recording wherever they were going to do\nUm and there's the fact that it now looks like Mr Rogers by not going to show up tomorrow so we don't know that for sure but we're starting to hear rumors that he's not coming to talk to Congress like he was supposed to uh tomorrow or in I'm In the Judiciary Committee so\nI made me think that because he has a good relationship with the president now he doesn't have to\n... well maybe maybe or maybe it has something to do with the stories that were written that said you know what you said that you are or is that the stories that said he said just in the summer day and this page and then when I talk to Mr Baker so um what\nWill ah will hopefully he'll hopefully he'll take change his mind it will be there tomorrow so we can asking the questions that I think American people deserve to have the answers to\nCongressman Jordan explain James Baker the ah the man who is the attorney at the FBI and why\nHis involvement in all of this and his contacts are so important to the narrative of how this whole Russian investigation was started\n'cause he's the chief counsel when you're the chief counsel the FBI and you're the guy in the middle of the two biggest investigations run by all these key players struck page McCabe call me a\nThat is important and when it's now now being recorded that uh he was he talk to both McCain and paid shortly after this meeting took place with Mr Rosenstein ... and that he understood it to be a serious comment made in that meeting that's why we need to talk to Mr Rosenstein and never forget the fundamental facts\nWhen have you ever seen this happen at any federal agency James Comey fire director former direct FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe light three times under oath fire Jim Baker chief counsel first demoted then left the FBI we used to pay jeopardy I counseled demoted then left and of course Peter ...\nAt a counter intelligence devoted than fire top people the FBI demoted or fired all the people who ran the Clinton investigation and then now as we know launched and ran the Russia investigation until the ...\nName Mr Mahler to take that investigation over so that's why this is important and that's why Mr Rosenstein needs to be in front of us so we can ask you questions about all that\nYeah he's not going to show up there's no way I don't think he I asked my producer will make it either no no he's he's not gonna he's not going to come I I just\nI I guess I don't understand why that ... they claimed it was a joke and it maybe I just don't have the sense of humor I really thought I had but I don't think that was all that funny like I'm going to wire myself we get wired going tape the president and then get the twenty Fifth Amendment going I don't understand why is that funny\nI agree with you I agree with you completely lawyer you shouldn't be joking about it about matters like that in front of support and it's made that is this is the guy who in effect is running the Justice Department and whether it's sarcasm or joke or what it should not be set\nUp particularly remember the time that this was done this was when the whole stinking town was all spun up this is between may ninth twenty Seventeen and may seventeenth twenty Seventeen late night that the date Rosenstein writes the memo that the president uses to fire Comey may seventeenth is when Rosenstein named\nBob Mueller as special counsel sometime in between there and it looks like it happened on may sixteenth is one this alleged conversation took place so even joking about something in that timeframe when that whole city was all spun up about all the special counsel obstruction of justice and all those issues\nAt all the more reason why you should not be saying something even if it was a joke\n... ... again the the main question that is on the table I think is a mother's gonna do among there's going to do but the main question on the table is why did you serve email an American citizen\nBased on information you received from and paid for from the opponent of\nDonald Trump and if that's the other hand are now you can you can start surveilling someone because they traveled to Russia and\nSaid hello to a a government official at some point and years ago you he was questioned and\nCarter Page mean where does he go to get you know his reputation back in and where does he go to get here legal fees paid I mean he's just twisted when for years\nNo I'm a ... it's good you brought that up 'cause we sometimes it's important is to go back to the basic the Clinton campaign the DNC paid curtains carry it off or who paid fusion GPS who hired a foreigner\nTo go talk to Russians and put together a document that was completely false totally bogus totally uncorroborated in that document became the basis we're going to a secret court to get a warrant to spy on Mr page because he was associated with the other party can paint\nThat is what happened here and ... and and they used the press\nTo get all kinds of information flooding the FBI so so fusion GPS is knowing what works for them she give information to her husband's events levels it to the FBI so she gives information to resort shop Justice Department official so you've got all these sources sending the lie\nTo the FBI which gives it more credibility always say the more people talking about the live Egypt allies to believe and that's exactly what took place you are but it's still a lie\nAnd they use that to go spy on the other campaign it's\nWhat you wanted to um what's your what's your sense about um the mid term elections I mean do you think Kavanaugh the energy from that is going to sustain the Republicans to cut maybe some of the Democrat gains that there are still predicting in the house I'm well how do you see this playing out\nYeah I Hope so I Hope so I was I was in or out and about across our district in but in Florida the other night when people were fired up that that are sent it helps up and are unconfirmed good man that was being attacked by the left I think a lot of people are beginning to see that the left has gone completely crazy we did a tweak the other day had more people come in and we said today's left\nA plot Capra Nick destroy capital\nAnd that's today's left that they they embraced the radical you know ... when he disrespected the flag and brace Cuomo when he says America was never that great cheer on Maxine Waters when she says go out and harassed people\nWho support the president like an old by the way will destroy cabin on the prosecutor I mean that's today's left and I think it is beginning to fire up conservative voters are Republican voters I Hope it is to stand over the next twenty six days\nThat we can keep the majority in the house\nDo you look over your shoulder more now with ah with what's happening out there\nYeah I mean I think you have to uh none of us are just as you are but my ... ... where we're at a back in June literally two days after Maxine Waters did her first ran and we got what I what I call the treatment from a lady were out and she started we're in a line of people getting moving into the theater and\nOh the treatment from a lady out and she started we're in a line of people get ... moving into the theater and um she just started\n... you know yelling shaming eagle and Jim Jordan terrible all this stuff so I mean it's ridiculous we we would never do that to people who are on the left but they seem to want to do that all the time now so you do kind of just watch a little bit or\nYou know um look I Wish they wouldn't do that I don't think it's appropriate but despite about and argue about the idea let's not let's not make it personal let's not run people at restaurants and do all the things that they're\nThat they're going to do that they found to do it and say it's it's what they have now they're holding on to the anger by the way there was an interesting thing which I forgot to ask you earlier congressman\nAndy McCarthy the former um since the U.S attorney in southern district of New York he made this point on my show last night about Rosenstein and why the president may not end up uh removing him as deputy aging\nLet's listen I think the president realized is that if he were to get rid of a Rosenstein at this point it would be like firing Comey times three and it would give mall or a reason to extend the investigation why what do you want to do that I mean it looks like now\nThere's not going to be any charges they're stepping down and have transitioned a lot of these cases that they brought to other components of the Justice Department this is about or\nWhat do you think about that yeah I mean I pretty much it seemed like things are pretty quiet some they must be writing the report\nCard it yeah I I Hope so and I think that's that's probably a ... that can be right and uh obviously respect a copy of it all the things he's written about all he's done so I look I don't think of any changes made the Justice Department till after the election until after Bob or is that I think that that's obvious but it's obvious that\nI'm the president wants to a new attorney general and um I think that that will happen at some point you but I don't think that's going to happen until after the election until after the special counsel's at work is finished\nA Jim Jordan always great to talk to you congressman buried set of Ohio congressman thanks so
