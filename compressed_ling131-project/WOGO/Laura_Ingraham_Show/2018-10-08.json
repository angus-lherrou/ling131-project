Republican shit finally grown a backbone\nOh that's very interesting ray you know I I don't know if that's right or not it John McCain actually had a endorsed a cabin up a prior to his death and I think if he had not a guy Neal if you if he'd been you know well and present than voting I I think he would have supported a cabin uh [noise]\nBut um the problem with McCain of course as he was always this big question mark your you know you never knew when he was gonna go rogue and abandoned his party eyes that he was bigger than his party\nOr a ... and that and that can be dangerous so so after after running three or four times on a platform of abolishing Obamacare evil or to keep it and and apparently he did that just to spite uh because of his anger at a at President Trump\nSo he was a loose cannon uh in a lot of ways and I think over over his time in the Senate he became more and more of a loose cannon\nAnd uh I I think I think the the the person who with respect to what is your theory might have the strongest basis is Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham was always the junior maverick er he was always ah he was always John McCain's a wing man and and um and uh with McCain are gone\nMaybe we'll find that Lindsey Graham ah won't be so prone to I'm asserting is a contrarian impulse as at precisely the worst moments or thanks for that call re if I if if you want to be hurt eight five five forty Laura is the number to call\nYou know I wrote a post on a power line on friday and and it was titled or where do we go from here and it's gotten a lot of attention and it was a link down real clear politics and a lot of other places and has been read now by sixty five Seventy thousand a people\nAnd and um as we have time here over the over the course of the program I'm going to I'm going to talk a little bit about\nAbout that posted about some of the things that I that I said there and um and and and where I think we're at what I think the landscape looks like a in the wake of a judge Kavanaugh's confirmation\nAnd lewd conduct the the abhorrent conduct that we saw from the Democratic\nParty over the last few months and then I think the the implications are significant that I think that this episode is going to be with us for a long time to come I started this post where do we go from here or by saying this\nBrett Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court tomorrow bringing to a close one of the most appalling episodes in American political history\nThe Democrats shameful treatment of Robert Bork in Nineteen eighty seven has distorted our politics not just the politics of the Supreme Court\nFor the last Thirty years but the slander the Democratic party directed toward Kavanaugh were if anything even more disgraceful\nAnd I think that's I think that's right I paused there for a moment at the smears they directed against judge Bork were outrageous Ted Kennedy of course leading the charge there but many Democrats participating\nBut at least they were they were a geared toward his judicial philosophy which they massively distorted and lied about but they but they did at least purport to relate to things you might do as a judge here we have the Democrats are trying to claim that Brett Kavanaugh total Boy Scout\nOr was involved in in gang rapes as a high school student believable or the smears that the the slander as they they directed against ah against judge Canada\nSo I continued uh but this landers the Democratic party directed toward Kavanaugh were if anything even more disgraceful we will feel the impact\nFor many years to come and I laid out various areas in which I think I which I think that's true where I think we will be seeing that in fact we're going to go to a break and when we return we'll have more about the cabinet nomination with John Malcolm a\nTimeshare honors maintenance fees will be due sooner than you know it and if you want out of your contract for the next set of fees contact resort

dot com [noise]\nA perhaps a dozen quote unquote conservative professors among that list but I have not the slightest a doubt that if I Am in that list that it will overwhelmingly skewed to the left and that's more comment I think on the state of affairs in the legal academy than it is state of affairs about Brett Kavanaugh's temperament yeah\nI think that's exactly right and I would add that I think the tide turned no Lindsey Graham obviously help too but I think the tide turned in that in that follow up here and when when a cabinet on cabinet came out a blazing\nYou know and and strongly denouncing these I think ridiculous or accusations against him I think he needed to do that not to show people he was he was sincere and I and I pocket that that's what happened\nI absolutely agree with you I remember I sat and I I was riveted it with my colleagues watching all of this and\nWhatever you want to say about you know Christine Blasey Ford she was emotional during her testimony and came across as a reasonably compelling\nYou know person you may or may not think that she did but Kavanaugh had done something to her but clearly something had happened to this woman at some point in her life to cause her to be this emotional and I think that of Brett Kavanaugh had come out and said OK I'm here now ask me questions and I'll be happy to answer them\nHe would have been in deep trouble I think the fact that he came out exactly as strongly as she did and said you are now trying to destroy\nA reputation over a lifetime you are also by the way of trying to destroy the judiciary by casting doubt about its credibility in the integrity of people who served judges\nAnd I'm not going to play along with this I think that he he very much help his uh his claws and had he come out and been had a flat aspect or you would you would have gone down to defeat in terms of you know the his nomination\nWhich talking to Jon Malcolm the Heritage Foundation John let's look forward a little bit and talk about some of the things that I'm\nI'm the Democrats frankly are trying to do what one one thing that they're doing is they're talking about the authority of the Supreme Court here are being undermined and and they're saying that uh decisions in which judge Kavanaugh participates or maybe don't need to be respected if they're close\nThey're talking about if they take the house which everyone seems to think they will I don't know but that's the reduction or they'll they'll start impeachment proceedings against against judge Kavanaugh what what what do you make of all this [noise]\nWell I have several things to say I think it is terrible but they are in fact trying to tear down the integrity of the court by making Eighteen or that it's just another political branch of government the Supreme Court hasn't helped self in that regard because it has involved itself in\nMore and more social issues frankly under the constitution ought to be left to people but you know ... that is what people are trying to do I I think singling out Brett Kavanaugh I you know I understand that people are are doing that but ... before the presidential election you had with Peter Ginsburg\nComing out and basically saying how awful she fought Donald Trump was and other than a few people grumbling when she actually came around to deciding cases over the last two terms involving stretching it called policies\nNobody was filing recusal motion to get her a to draw away and nobody expressed of the kind of outrage towards her ... her some outrage but not nearly the level of outrage at your hearing beach west towards Brett Kavanaugh of all after all only challenge the tactics of senators on the Democratic side judiciary\nA committee you know it ... impeachment is to some degree\nA political process I think that this will certainly let people know that are the stakes are high in terms of who they vote or whether they both are in the mid term election I think of the Democrats do take control\nOf the house it is possible they might impeach but kept up and be very clear impeachment is just leveling the charges and it only requires a majority in the house of representatives\nAfter he would be impeached then it would move to the Senate justices said when the house impeach Bill Clinton and then there is a mini trial and it requires a two thirds vote in the Senate before somebody is actually thrown out of office and there was no way that would ever happen to Brett Kavanaugh so the Democrats might\nDo this they might even filed charges it get where they take control of the house but there is no way that Brett Kavanaugh would be thrown off the bench\nNo that's right when we look at the at the crazed behavior not just of the Democratic senators but of the ... the Democrats who showed up\nAt ... is a mob in Washington DC and invaded senators' offices in it and and all the things that they did attack\nRand Paul the airport I may go on and on\nBut I asked myself why are they so cranes to I mean it's really strange and I think at least part of the answer has to do is roe versus Wade I I I assume that\nThat that at least part of their thinking is that there with with Kavanaugh's confirmation there now potentially is a ... vote majority on the court\nTo um undo what what many of us continue to regard as one of the worst blunders in Supreme Court history what do you think about that do you think there's a serious chance of of roe v Wade actually being a overturn\nLA step back I I certainly think that there are many on the left who are crazed and they have been crazed uh ever since ... election night when when you know Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton\nSo I think you would get a large amount of this regardless roe versus Wade is certainly a touchstone a lightning rod if you will uh for folks are on the left there have been predicting the demise of roe versus Wade with every Republican nominee to the Supreme Court\nAh starting with Sandra Day O'Connor in Nineteen eighty one and that Susan Collins pointed out of three people who voted to reaffirm a wrote the opinion that we affirmed the basics of roe versus Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey we're Sandra Day O'Connor David Souter running at the Kennedy all Republican appointees\nI don't know of course what the what the current court or would do would roe versus Wade a chief justice Roberts tends to proceed there were very\nVersus Wade a chief justice Roberts tends to proceed there were very cautiously only one current Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has outright called for roe versus Wade decision overturned\nMy prediction if I had to if I had to make one is that it's less likely that roe versus Wade will be outright overturned\nThan it will be that more restrictions placed on uh the right to have an abortion will will be more likely to be upheld that's how cases tend to come to court over the last few years when Kennedy was there\nYou that states that we have more restrictions or fewer restrictions with respect to abortion rights and the Supreme Court will weigh in on those but in terms of the\nWhole frontal assault on roe versus Wade\nI don't know whether that's going to happen anytime soon and frankly with the chief justice Roberts on the court I Know exactly what the outcome would be even if the other quote unquote conservative sweat along with overturning roe\nJohn Malcolm thank you very much for being on the program we're going to go to a break we'll come back with more on the cabinet nomination and your calls

... way on her\nBut because it was the Democrats who procured that fault false testimony I mean it seems to me that the\nThe target here is the is the Democrats we are up against a a heartbreak uh so I'm not going to take any more calls right now we'll take more later in the program after the break we're going to be joined by Heather McDonald who is the author of a a brand new\nBook uh called the

this girl Dodgers her friends so she can hook up with this guy and they're texting back and forth beforehand\nAnd as you said one of the things she checked says okay you have a condom and he replies yes and she text back\nGood yummy two minutes since so you know you never ... follows and then after the fact she apparently changes her mind for whatever reasons\nAnd now claims that this guy raped or I mean it's just unbelievable\nAnd not only did she said you have a condom and again any guidance asked if he has a condom is good was Soviets willing partner right before she left her dorm room to go down to her trip with this con demise guy\nUh she sent a message to her friends saying I'm going to have sex now so any guy that receives these messages it's going to perfectly rationally and accurately assume that he has\nAffirmative consent from his partner and yet occidental college she was under enormous pressure from the Obama administration they want it to rack up as many male scouts as possible in its feminist crusade to basically right males out of out of western civilization uh\nOccidental expelled the guy he's now he sued the school of that case is yet to be heard but that checked message trail is is completely a vindicate shame and exonerated sim\nYeah yeah there is another when you talk about um where I'm after the encounter which again long after the fact is we characterized as being as being raped\nA she checks to the to the boy how we're I'm sure the boy checks to her how do I compare with your boyfriend since she replies you were great and then of course after the fact she says I changed my mind I think I think it was rape\nYeah well you know these are not just isolated anecdotes as I describe in my book there the very first campus rape survey the one that gave rise to this epidemic of of false claims and that is hysterical\nIt's completely counterfactual belief that there's this epidemic of sexual assaults on college campuses\nFirst survey that was published in Nineteen eighty five at its magazine a\nForty three percent of the females homes they rape researcher classified as rape victims went on to have sex again with their alleged assailants now John I submit to you that that is behavior that is completely in on think of all\nIf you have actually been raped you art that is the most as I say the most terrifying experience you can come through you feel nothing but repugnant for from this violent criminal you do not go on to voluntarily have sex again and and\nThat the key to this whole whole\nHoax is that the numbers that we have on a ledge campus rape are generated by the researchers themselves this same survey from Nineteen eighty five that was published in this magazine when the researcher asks the girls who she classified as rape victims\nWhether they had been raped Seventy three percent said they had not so the ... the phony campus rape epidemic a conceit depends on\nViolating won the primary norms of feminism which we're seeing it play now with the cabinet hearing which is you always take the female at her word except if she says she has been raped in which case you know better than she does and you declare that she has [noise]\nYou know whether there's this there's a couple of things going on here what is that the left has just redefined the word rape right I mean they've got an ideologically motivated definition that allows them to vastly expand what any normal person would consider to be uh to to be rape\nBut and then that they combine that with this with this idea they tried to ram down our throats we saw in the cabinet and hearing that any woman who is complaining must be believe you know you you can't scrutinize restore you can't ask for their matches up with the known facts you can't cross examined her in question are you you just have to believe\nAnd and as you may know Heather I spent forty years in the courtroom okay and and I can I can attest from from forty years of experience that women sometimes why you know uh most witnesses or don't lie in almost all witnesses would prefer not to lie\nBut but some witnesses do and I would say that women lie in roughly the same proportion as man and for the same reasons\nAnd and I was this year the allergy that somehow women are are you know camp you know are always telling the truth is ridiculous\nSo again let's let's let's remember where the city\nElegy is coming from it is coming from the campus is and it's part of a much broader assault on on western civilization it is based on the idea that that America\nIn general and college campuses in particular are places of in jama racism and sexism that the world is divided into permanent victim classes and oppressor classes and it's a very highly competitive\nWorld the victim world it is that the ruthlessly competitive totem pole that is constantly being rearranged we thought that\nMaybe gays or at the top now trans people are at the top that they they're put decision there is is is tenuous there's going to be some new victim group I guarantee you in the next year or two that it's going to cut claim\nDog victims status but but females you know we started there early on\nAnd and they claimed that they are victims of rate of sexism this is preposterous it is it is for postures particularly on college campuses which are open to everybody where females are encouraged\nFrom from the time a girl is five years old today on where she is the in incessant recipient of messages to six feet you know women in stem girls do code\nAh encourage them it right and left from mainstream foundations from the education establishment it's boys who are an afterthought who are bombarded with a message that they are at the ... they are that\nAfter thought corporate barter message that they're ... they're the perpetrators of massive oppression you know college campuses give seminars and toxic masculinity at some point\nMail to just get a check out entirely because\nWe are now a culture that is is sending nothing but negative messages that them\nUh and you know why why bother in a world where everything that you've accomplished is is the value but it's you say the courtroom\nYou know the reason that we the western tradition developed these truths are finding mechanisms like cross examination was with the understanding that human memory is fallible even if the person in tends to be accurate\nIt's very hard to remember things implanted memory syndrome that we know about you know we don't know what this Christine for\nWhat her therapist was doing to her ... therapists these days are very left wing who knows you know one\n\nThing happened whatsoever\nYeah it's a ... and I think it was probably an eye opener to a lot of people who haven't been following closely\nThe phenomena that you describe other on college campuses it kind of burst into public view here with the accusations against a judge cabinet or a but just as the kind of thing that has been going on as you say at our universities for quite a while\nYeah people have to pay attention if you've got a child\nGoing off to college I you'd be well advised to read my book or just educate yourself and and the rest of us have to realize don't give money to your college anymore unless you've done due diligence and you can be sure that it is not perpetuating the victim ideology\nOr it's not just about the Democratic party that although the Democratic party has now been overtaken by camp this identity politics that is poison for civil society it's teaching students to hate\nThe hate each other and hate the greatest works of western civilization uh and they're carrying that animosity into the world at large\nThat's what we're seeing today you know it's great that cabinet get on the Supreme Court because his wealthier record of jurisprudence shows that he's a careful ...\nThat that just everything it can to follow the law without putting his own

to actually really good question you know and what water is talking about here is something that we we talked about it they really are on the show and that is\nA you know what the Democrats are doing is trying to use a mob action of violence and the threat of violence and and they shot a Republican officeholders they've tried to stabbed to death Republican officeholders they've assaulted Republican officeholders\nThey bus a so called protesters to Republicans homes to try to frighten them and especially frightened their children\nAre they invade a Republican senators' offices with threatening mobs they they they mob Republicans when they go out in public or they they walked through an airport and the Democrats say well this is just this is this is the American way this is democracy these are these are protesters demonstrators no they're not their minds\nAnd and the problem of course is that is that the you know they have to cross over a certain line before they can be arrested and prosecuted and put in jail and and what are the issues we have here is that even when the Democratic party's protesters are doing things that are obviously illegal obviously\nAnd the

in the right of the people to peaceably peace away to a simple and petition the government for Russian grievances everything that we've witnessed the attacks going back to ... uh the attacks on other congressman threats\nOf what we saw on television and I'm sitting here wondering where is the current journal where's the apartment of justice Shirley by now\nThere are there should be some investigation launched in regard to these leftist groups who's funding them I think we know what's going on and and what can be done about it\nYou know there was a headline justice more I got I have not had time to follow up yet I saw when I was on the air here where\nSomebody I'm from the other side is is talking about how um people were being paid to show up and engaging mob action in Washington in this this most recent uh go round\nYeah I don't know whether the deal Jay is conducting any kind of investigation or any any enforcement action brought by the department of justice would have to\nInvolve a violation of federal law obviously it would have to be some kind of a wide ranging a look at you know who's financing this stuff and some kind of you know interstate a conspiracy to violate various laws\nAnd I think they could do that but but I I Would suggest something a whole lot simpler I mean if you're the chief of police in Seattle and you've got an ... a rioting in your city smashing store front you know breaking up a\nPlaces of business are hitting people over the head with baseball bats and um and the two by fours\nAnd and setting cars on fire you don't have to wait for ah for for a sessions or the department of justice prosecute them arrest them put them in jail and if you're the the district attorney in Seattle throw the book at them you know these people deserve law in jail terms\nA big part of what's happening here is that these urban prosecutors are all Democrats\nAnd the Democrats generally view antifa as part of their movement you know there are the\nKind of like the provisional wing of the IRA back in the old days you know that's that's the activist wing of the militant wing of the Democratic party and they don't want to prosecute and they don't want to put them in jail and uh so I think that's where the that's where the enforcement really needs to be getting his at the state and local level where the crimes are taking place\nLet's go to Cheryl and Illinois on line to Sheryl welcome to the program\nHi thank you um do you remember what happened to have a weapon in Wisconsin with the newly elected Governor Scott Walker he proposed a

thousand protesters bust\nIs on ... or the country over this act capital was terrible\nYeah they actually kept inside the state capital or they threatened a Republican legislators um they came to buses which tend to the home of Scott Walker outside Milwaukee he was at the capital but it's scared you know grandma and the two teenage sons\nA Republican legislators taking a bus to the parking lot ah there was an attempt to overthrow them at any rate he wrote a book about a\nGovernor Scott Walker he was successful the Republican\nFitzgerald brothers who control the state Senate state assembly stood strong the governor stood strong and the book is called and intimidated and everything you're saying now happened in Wisconsin\nBut the people were so appalled even Special Olympics were disrupted had nothing to do with politics but I guess the governor was there\nAnd the people just a Wisconsin turn red there was set attempt to recall Governor Walker that failed all kinds of recounts lawsuit everything you're saying now uh happened in two thousand eleven against a successful\nRepublican Governor Walker and by the way they did balance their budgets in Wisconsin I'm calling from Illinois where we have a failed state bankrupt\nAnnoy us you know the Democratic legislators ran in ... that there wouldn't be a quorum remember that\nRight man\nRight they hit out and of course the Tea Party expose\nWhere they were hiding in northern Illinois in a hotel it was just you know you couldn't carry out a legislative session without people screaming and disrupting the whole process\nAnd by the way organizing for America the Wisconsin branch was busy there that was Obama's group two thousand eleven act in a while\nAnyway I assure you may you make a great point I mean we

see fit is a is really a transformative across the board\nIt really is you know I I checked\nReally a transformative across the board\nIt really is you know I I checked the Rasmussen survey this morning a President Trump has been rising in that in that poll which is the only one that's done on a daily tracking basis are currently\nAnd it shows a President Trump was fifty one percent approval forty seven percent disapproval which is which is one of the best ratings that he's had 'em and and a strong approval Rasmussen causes the approval index the difference between stronger approval and strong disapproval\nThere are now just as many voters who strongly approve of Trump is there are who strongly disapprove of him meaning that his approval index is\nRight now at zero doesn't it doesn't sound great if you don't know about the history here but at the same point in in the Obama administration Brock Obama's approval index was minus eleven\nSo Trump's at at this moment is a eleven points better so we're seeing people across the country they're responding to something a ... what do you think that um are they responding to the economy or they responded to the the outrageous conduct of the Democrats in relation to the cabinet appointment or is it some of each\nYeah you know I think it's a it's all the above and it's both things that\nHave been happening but I think the more that you think about what could happen in the future uh it it really is a stark discrepancy between\nThe two futures that are are in front of us are right now that uh that that that left is literally campaigning on the slogan repealed Trump's tax cuts and and what that what that means that you're at the Heritage Foundation with actually calculated what it needs but the average\nA tax payer in America and and with a combination of the tax cuts that it was asked last year and the economic growth projected over over the future the tax cuts are are repealed and the next year or two that could be twenty six twenty seven thousand dollars of\nLaw take home pay that that that sort of typical American can expect and that uh\nThat that that that should be scary to to most Americans that that all of this prosperity could be a could be reversed with the ah with by simply repealing somebody's big pieces that that that the house and the president ... and have put through\nYou know it's interesting just an hour or so ago the president was about to leave the White House on the helicopter he's on the White House lawn and he walks past all these all these reporters and they start yelling questions at him he stops to answer their questions\nAnd there's a bunch of questions about the cabin on nomination and and and there were questions about some other things but at one point he talked about Venezuela and he said yeah if the Democrats get their way or you know all these socialist they're popping up now they want us to be like Venezuela\nAnd I was really glad to hear him say that because you know it's amazing to me that that rather than recognizing the successes that the free market policies of this administration have enjoyed the Democrats just\nBlindly deny those successes in instead one after another they're coming out as socialists\nAnd when you look at what's happened in any socialist country around the world most recently in Venezuela you know you can tell when you're reaching the later stages of socialism because there are no more pets in the country the pets have all been eaten I mean it's unbelievable to me that the Democrats really want to go there\nThe the the record of of socialism or something like eighty six and zero it's a way it's been tried more time should have been and each and every time it's a it's it's crumbled and then left misery and destruction at wake and so that mean that the that\nAt a very high level that those are the two that you direction we can we can shoot\nThe promise of the tax cut the promise of of putting more money in people's pockets is it simply allowing Americans to decide how their money in that rather than sending it to the bureaucracy in Washington and letting it sort of lost around like people's pockets and then\nA part of it getting bad back out elsewhere that that that is just not a recipe for a strong and vibrant economy that American than American businesses no how best to spend it and invest their their resources and that's what we're seeing the power of of individual action rather than government action\nAnd we're also seeing success for for the average American or you know under socialism some people always do very very with health so Hugo Chavez's daughter left the country reportedly with about four billion dollars in Swiss bank accounts\nAnd his finance minister I think made off with even more than that so I if you're part of the ruling click or you're a part of the end the socialist in crowd yeah you can do very very well but uh the rest of the people are trying to catch rats so they can fry 'em up for dinner and that's that's socialism whereas what we're seeing\nCurrently in the Trump Administration is real progress being made all up and down the economic ladder but especially toward the bottom of the economic ladder with with new entrance into the labor force in the labor force actually being able to get a pretty good paying jobs\nThat are
