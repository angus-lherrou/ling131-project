your your take on this reopening\nOf the FBI investigation background check into Kavanaugh\nThere are some Republicans who say well this is a good thing because it uh gives cover to people like flake can Collins or to actually vote for cabin on in the end\nYou know this has been about um the light from the get go and um I think what most eloquent here is the treatment that this guy from from planet punch line\nHe said well this person asked for confidentiality um this could have been investigated by the FBI honoring all requests for confidentiality from the outset if that's what they wanted\nAnd um I think everything has to be judged in light of that\nWanted it to me it seemed very obvious\nOff from the very beginning when they were interrupting the hearing and screaming and sending the protesters in and rotating protesters coming into the airing screaming at him\nThat this was going to be a farce and so it didn't really surprise me given the fact that the left believes the Supreme Court just another a super legislature and it's not really a court it's more of a\nSocial policy making body to the left and for them it's all abortion and various social issues and cabinet even though he's a Bush guy or doesn't matter and he's a fifth vote and so by any means necessary judge\n[noise] well um I suppose we could have an interesting conversation about how it came to be that who gets appointed came to be so important I mean there's one judge has started I'm putting their own gloss on what are actually fairly limited\nA statement from the constitution that happened a long time ago when when when when when justice Douglas found a right to privacy in what he called him a nation's from a number of surrounding we'd rather amendments\nI'm quite clear that some people on the court foot that were that they can make it up if they want a long and so then I guess it very much matters who whose head is popping out from beneath the black right [noise]\nI guess it very much matters who whose head is popping out from beneath black right [noise]\nWell judge there was a a woman or I've never heard of but she was on MSNBC over the weekend who identifies herself as a Watergate prosecutor just Jill Jill wind banks I literally have never heard of her but then so be it neither now so she she she know\nExpress something that I began you you're beginning to here of course on college camps even her hearing it for years but it's actually entered the mainstream namely the race\nOf Brett Kavanaugh has come into play let's listen\nThere is a white male privilege ravens here which is I'm entitled to this I did the hard work in high school and college and I\nDeserve this I went to yeah that is not the case no one is entitled to be on the Supreme Court and no one who has behaved in high school and in college as his alleged to do and no one who performed the waves will do that on Thursday deserves to be even an judge\nYour reaction to that judge\n'em it [laughter] it's a parody of itself um this got nothing to do with race um I I Can't understand how that gets dragged into it\nUm and the notion that somehow how one appears to be or appeared to be um in high school um determines what one can do in life is I think particularly\nI mean this this is now the new standard apparently but not for liberals conservatives Republicans won't do this to the other side that we had conservative supporting Sotomayor and Kagan you you're not going to have it play the other way but for Democrats your high school\nI don't know why why high school when I go back to sixth grade I mean why is this high school the limit here but it it it all reflects on your your character and I find it interesting because they're always about\nYou know letting these you know useful indiscretions pass and they're all about\nWell everyone should have redemption and but not for this if you're a conservative you can never be redeemed never\n... or you have to do is is is have somebody claim that just stepped over the line once and that's it [noise]\nSo now they're actually they have some people on the record saying well\nWe saw him at Yale we saw him a ... a drunk and she got belligerent a few\nTimes and so he doesn't have the temperament so the new question judge it as a former federal judge yourself\nThe idea of temperament because he was fairly aggressive in responding to the questions on Capitol Hill a last week that he doesn't have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court after having written two hundred decisions on the DC circuit he doesn't the temperament\nBut that's a great I'm no when proposition um if he gets upset um having been accused of um a sexual assault than he doesn't have the temperament if he doesn't get upset that he's guilty so it's you know if he loses either way\nRight well how do you think this ultimately plays out I mean that ... Democrats are of course are complaining that there's not enough I guess they interviewed that Deborah Ramirez over the weekend a hopped on that fast right or the president said FBI can has free rein that's the phrase he gave free rein a\nFree rein to do presumably what the Senate requested um the Senate requested um a limited extension of the background check and background checks are\nAre not about you know we're not about Quebec and not criminal investigations and then I ... counter intelligence with their background investigations and they interview witnesses lay out what they say and present it to the side which ultimately makes the decision to finish the not the president [noise]\nNow the um I don't know if you saw the Jim Comey decided he needed to weigh in on\nOn all of this so that you know he's weighing in on Kavanaugh saying well then he's\nYeah he's loaded up the the the expectations 'em by talking about the capabilities of the FBI without discussing water background investigation and [noise]\nYeah well again if if high school and college drinking is now is now from the free love generation this is this is a this is\nNow what we're going to be judged on I I don't know who want want these\nYou know these nomination but I mean I don't know a lot of people frankly he didn't have something to drink in high school or college a few but not many and we all did stupid stuff and not you judge because you're just to\nHave it for men right yeah no nothing nothing stupid\nStupid at all because you're you're you're him UK is what the rest of us did\nNo um [noise] if there's anybody who would be willing to have every day of of his you've um penned up on a wall and examined then that person I don't think has led to a life of that would give them any kind of experience worthy of being a judge\nOr the other issue I just wanted to quickly weighing on this um the American bar association a supposedly it was it was of course it was improperly reported early\nOn uh that the a BA had withdrawn its recommendation that a judge Kavanaugh was you know highly qualified to be on the court and turns out it was it\nThe president of the of the APA pick up a pen and his letterhead and wrote something he wasn't authorized to writes um he's not the committee and um it was simply another reflection of the fact that the ... is is is generally left wing organization has been for years\nNow and he was a big supporter of Hillary Clinton uh and so you know the again\nInitial reports all over cable on friday when I was on the panel on Fox in the morning on friday and it was a BA withdraws and again headline writers and reporters don't do their work oh this is ... that's really bad and now of course we find out that that's all all not true\nA judge

spirit of the constitution and these guys for the constitution doesn't really matter anymore in matters of sexual assault\nWell when we when we see the\nFew moments of honesty from the Democrats [noise] uh when they really talk I'm candidly it's about the fifth vote in the court's not about whether bread did this or whether they're but none of that's really what's going on it's about the fifth vote in the court\nAnd then Jeff Flake last night on sixty minutes said admitted that if you were running for reelection he never would've\nUp he never would have asked for a delay in this a confirmation vote\nFor I mean yeah it is about the fifth\nVote but there isn't a symmetry there and that sense that when the Republicans are worried about a ... a swing voter they don't do this I mean they didn't go after\nWhen ... I Believe that a wise Latina mixed better decisions in a white male they didn't go scholar and so you're a racist and we're going to\nStop your they didn't go after a lane at Kagan's so early college years and they they just don't do that I mean they disagree Merrick Garland they try to use political used majority status but they don't do do it in the same way so it is about a fifth vote but it's about a fifth vote\nOr it's going to be conservative and therefore husband asymmetrical response if this was a fifth liberal vote they would be very angry and they would try to go over all the liberals opinions\nAnd say you know this guy's taking down the road to perdition and all that but I don't think they'd go after the person's high school a teenage years all the way they will now that's that's a progressive idea of it the noble and justify any means necessary to get there\nYou know what's also interesting uh I think is how this has taken on a racial component even though of course both cabin on Ford or white or but listen to this um tower of intellect I'm Donny Deutsch today on MSNBC picture let's listen\nNow for an entire generation women go forward they will not be able to look at the Supreme Court the same way particularly post that capital reforms that as a man I was in ... hours for him it was it was the ultimate display of all white entitlement\nThe man who made his money or in part by opening up you know PR NPR from selling selling snake oil to people and also um you know hanging out at strip clubs by\nThe way I'm self Donny Deutsch well\nUm you know hanging out at strip clubs by the way in self Donny Deutsch well\nI think what's happening in the Democratic progressive movement is that they've created this Frankenstein monster and the doctors who created are afraid of being\nDevoured you see it with Diane Feinstein here in California if you believe that how we appear adjudicate who we are that is race class not classics she was in that race or gender then\nYou have to live by that and Dianne Feinstein is a multi millionaire a white woman who's been who's running against like Kevin daily on a person quote unquote of color and the same thing is true\nOf Chuck Schumer and the same thing a spoof Coons there's a lot of old white guys on the Democratic side Richard Blumenthal and old white guy but they seem to think that that rule doesn't apply to them because they were liberal in their joining this new way but there are also doing it out of fear\nBecause they know that the logical ramifications of their own ideology comes right back boomerang right back at them\nSo you get a guy like Donny dory sure you get all these other people say or white guy old white guy old white guy even one day\nAnd they're all like they're all old white guys it's back to the end of the progressive idea that you\nAt what Andrew McCabe said you'd get insurance you try to protest so loud\nThat you're going to get some medieval dispensation that exempt you from what you're saying about other people\nIt's back to Mark Zuckerberg lecturing everybody on the walls where you have this huge wall around all of his ... and all these old white guys have privilege if you really believe Donny Deutsch you would say you know Donna you've had a good run on TV let's get a young person of color and give give them the same type of opportunities in the world that you found\nA lot of that that would make a big name very happy very happy and he'd never happens don't expect it now or\nThe we have to touch on this Jerry Brown signing into law this idea that women have to be represented on public boards in\nUh in California there has to be female representation on public point at which point at which point I treated out none of the Pacific islanders all Latino is that a black people they should all be up in arms here I mean where do they get to go they go to get their own representation on boards\nYeah I think that's a coded for a lot of very affluent women in the bay area who want to be all of these boards on there and that's where all of the decisions are made and so they want to mandate or inclusion but again\nYou're seeing a fault line because you you hit it on the head and that is once you go down the idea that how we look will be a Jew would be the case who we are and we have to do it and tribal fashion and indeed in percentage fashion of the population\nThan there are so many different tribes with claims of victimization and reparation that's almost impossible to include them all so you're going to have you're going to see a woman say well I I Want to be in that board because I'm not just a woman but I'm black or Latino you're a woman but you're only white\nTherefore I have I have greater credibility as being a person who deserves you know a set aside on the sport I we're going down there and I don't know where the ultimate project for years but either people are going to say you know what it's getting chaotic when we go to stop this and go back to the melting pot\nJust look at people by the content of their character not the color of their skin or their gender or we're gonna we're going to go into something like the Balkan\nYeah well I think again it it says all identity politics at its worst I mean it's never good to practice identity politics but you see this even in in the entertainment industry\nWhere we have an African American hip hop or by Kanye West he he's the guy who has some guts I mean I don't really agree with us and I don't like his music and I'm not here not my not my cup of tea but\nTalk about brain going out on stage on Saturday Night live the bastion of left wing progressive\nEntertainment and wearing a make America great again hats standing on stage and this is how it went down\nYou know [noise] All right oh we don't want to do that [laughter]\n[laughter] [noise]\nOh\nI Can't hear an airplane that version of it but he was actually on stage on SNL and wearing a make America great again hat he got food you got ... got harassed backstage he said for a for actually having a hat on and supporting Trump says the laughter will not tolerate any dissent Victor\nYeah I think there's two things going on one is that this Trump idea that you close the borders to only legal immigration and then you try to get the economy up at four percent GDP low unemployment means that people who\nAre Americans and I've been over look like a lot of people in the inner city suddenly they have leverage and they have worth\nAnd that's the kind of a revolutionary messy so west and others are starting to see and that's a lot better for interests that are people than to patronize wide government and title month the other thing that kind of reminds us that we want to get hung up on identity politics\nWe always have to have the strict its identity politics but it's all progressive so if you're west it doesn't really matter you're black anymore because you have the wrong ideas and if you're ... you know Keith Ellison\n'em and you're charged with sexual assault well it doesn't really matter because you have the right ideas so ideology actually Trump's in most cases you're gender or your race you have to have the proper raised a proper gender but you also have the ... have to have the proper ideology\nAnd they were in that time but how how do conservatives stand up to this with with education being what it is today in the in group the same thing all the arrangement how do we as citizens forget you know I have a platform but how does how do regular people stand up to the\n... I think people look to people like yourself or anybody has a platform because they\nThey live quiet lives of dust live lives quite desperation they're just looking around is there anybody who believes
