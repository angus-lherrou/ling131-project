as an opportunity\nTo trying to smear the President Bill Kristol smoke let's listen\nIf if the president wanted to come to our synagogue Newsweek and make some talk I Would say no thank you for now it doesn't mean I don't think he's our president I just think he does bear some responsibility for this climate and that's you know ... and we don't need him we don't need him to help us overcome this\nRight you know we don't need him but they're still in office there is no opportunity well I have a different view I think there is an opportunity for him to speak out uh Anton Anton take accountability for\nYou know crystal is empty suit these people who never truckers are just desperate or to justify their position since Trump has done everything that conservatives have wanted him to what it actually not only him but Republican presidents to do for just that they have never done\nSo the only thing they can do is uh assassinate his character which is what they\nCould simply do this is ridiculous the uh you know Trump won one comment oh\nAnd I I've I forget it was in response to her question which elicited this where one could be done you said it would be ... have been helpful if there was a security guard in the synagogue\nThere were security guards and lots of synagogues perfectly wise\nRecommendation government attack by the Democratic mayor of\nPittsburgh the forward magazine which is an extreme left wing\nJewish magazine planes him he said that Trump blamed the synagogue and blamed the synagogue he made a a perfectly reasonable point\nA they're a nut cases out there a will kill a and it's a synagogue and other other centers schools\nShould be defended but the Democrats and the left or so the reins over gun control issues that practical steps like this are hard to take\nWell I think that's the case and the former rabbi a of the synagogue or this tree of life synagogue\nWas also interviewed and again I'm not blaming anyone in the aftermath of this because people are so upset about the media really dragging into a political conversation and trying to tie Trump's entire world view\nThis evil anti he was an anti Trump\nA fanatic the shooter whose name I Will not use to dignify the airwaves you hear waves but this is what I'm John Berman on CNN drag the former mayor of former rabbi excuse me of the synagogue that suffered so greatly let's listen\nYou welcome the president of Pittsburgh in the wake of this I Do not welcome the president to him I said hey why not because he's the purveyor of hate speech\nOr the hypocritical um words that come from him um tell me nothing\nUm we have a we have very very strong leadership and the city is leaving values not just Jewish values leaving values and those are not the values and his friends and that's and I do not welcome him to Pittsburgh or the current\nEvent that you know ... forgive me for saying this but I say it is in June the Jews are out to lunch on this these issues that first of all Donald Trump was the first woman to be attacked\n... Donald Trump ... ah you know is a counter punch it basically and he doesn't spew hate for any group nothing like I mean I turned on MSNBC the other day or on the code well is that a panel\nEvery single there were four people on the panel Detroit that said I I'm a nationalist\nAnd every single one of them linked that the adults Hitler why because they were in every one of them said nationalist is dictator\nWell actually no I chose not to see any of the nineteenth century figure who created the modern state of Italy he's the one who coined nationalism\nIs a Democrat they just won't find any pretext to link Trump to Hitler a lawn so Don on CNBC\nYou said when Trump said he was a national it said we all know the word that goes with nationalist it's white\nAnd then that translates into Hitler\nThat have against Trump Doris anything that you could say that Trump Trump Trump is kind of actually funny it is a tax 'em an ally ... light hearted and everybody understands what he's doing well but these people they have dug themselves into a whole here\nAnd they they continue to defend it I mean the Democratic party this is the first time\nSince Abraham Lincoln the Democratic party or any major party as a gone to war against the legitimate Lee elected president a resistance which is what Schumer and Pelosi call there a campaign of obstruction is not a legitimate function in a democracy\nFor political party ... we have a sister both compromise we have a system where there is a peaceful transition of power and you wait for the next election and that translates normally into a honeymoon that Gallup\nEstimates is about seven months Trump didn't get seven seconds there were boycotting is inauguration there were calling for his impeachment the hate is coming from people like this rabbi oh who insist\nOn demonizing the president of the United states which is something that hurts all Americans here's our commander in chief and\nWhich is something it hurts all Americans here's our commander in chief and you know they did that the Bush to that quote Bush Hitler the Democratic party is out of control and off the rails\nAnd or the you know I think as time goes on more people are going to realize that until a there are over ... over Democrats but they're timid aided by the party left now um but they will come out of the closet\nYeah Jeffrey Maier have one and out on this with yeah exactly Jeffrey Maier yeah Jeffrey Myers says the current rabbi or who of course\nIt is just devastated by what happened to his congregation to his people his worshipers and he was asked the same question on CNN Today in responded like this\nRabbi I'm President Trump has talked about coming to Pittsburgh and coming to your synagogue in the aftermath of this do you want him to come\nUp the president of the United states is always welcome I'm\nI'm a citizen he's my president he's certainly waffles\nThat's a good answer Neal ... you know every time I go I go to a synagogue I look around ... hopefully that there's a security guard there\nBecause the universities are teaching Jewish hatred\nThey they know universities the curriculum\nIn the middle eastern studies programs but generally\nIs that you know the Jews stole land the land which is to genocide ally the land which Israel was created belong to the Turks for four hundred years previously the Turks and Arabs and they see the dilemma too because they were on the losing side of the first World War\nUh it just\nYou know this has been a Seventy year aggression against is to destroy the state of Israel and yet if you go on a college campus today the sympathies are all with the terrorists\nKnow it's pro pro Palestinian uh the Jews are\nUh the aggressors and on line today and seeing the same thing that did this was caused a buy a both the president's rhetoric and those Jews in the United states who are are helping support him and and continue to give him cover which I'm\nReading and stuff going this is this is a literally insane I I I have no words to this\nNo exactly this is the best president or from the point of view of of a Jewish survival up we've ever had a Trump you know there were there and I somewhat his kids\nAre Orthodox Jews for crying out two years I mean it's just insanity and are these so called liberal Jews\nUm are contributing to the to the problem of hate for the Jews by that I mean they're always attacking me I don't know I've done a lot of demonstrations on college campuses against students for justice and Palestine and I'm not much to the\nJewish left for that reason that it's the same thing I mean\nYou know the history here you have to do something but just having a security guard\nIn a synagogue is such a common sense of course you need that um you know but I have

President Trump can't do any of this [noise]\nNow because to do so would stoke the acts of an anti Semite\nPresident just earlier this year was cold called anti Palestinian\nUh when he decided to move that embassy to Jerusalem us embassy to Jerusalem how could you do this\nYou're now you're\nInsulting at their core the Palestinian people and there's going to be an uprising as a result of this and none of you know there wasn't an uprising as a result there's some some people are unhappy some people were not happy\nBut I think this happened before where the and I said there's been one of my angles last week on Fox and the goal here is to turn Trump into a conventional politician\nI don't think that's going to happen Trump's not a conventional politician he's going to do things the way he thinks they're going to resonate that's what the people are going to advance his agenda consumer spending by the way way up consumer confidence way up\nA three point five percent GDP last month even

course he wants to a win that Senate seat against Andrew Gillum\nAnd uh [noise] uh well no I mean excuse me the governorship obviously\nAgainst Andrew Gillum and focus on the bill Nelson race against a former governor or the current governor outgoing governor\nA and Brock Obama is in the state this weekend so he's going to end this week you're going to be campaigning for Andrew Gillum and Bill

the federal government\nOr if you're out there saying the guy should be peace I think they know I'll be able to get this stuff done and then people are really concerned about Andrews record in Tallahassee with respect to crime they've had the highest crime rate in Florida and Tallahassee when he's been mayor and last year they had a record number of murders more murders at any time in Tallahassee history\nAnd I've been endorsed by an unprecedented array of law enforcement groups because at the end of the day they want someone that's going to stand by them and support their mission Gillum is uh he's aligned with groups like the dream defenders who\nOpenly attacked law enforcement so I think people are looking at safe communities and they don't want a governor who supports open borders and sanctuary cities and abolishing ice like Andrew guys\nNow in a piece today and the hill Obama to campaign for Gillum and Bill Nelson of course is running for Senate reelection Senate ah in Florida how concerned are you about\nThe allure of President Obama has rock star quality and helping your opponent\n[noise] some I think he's going to end up turning more votes out for me than he does for\nFor Andrew because I think folks will or who may not otherwise wanted vote if they see Obama's friends or they're going to want to support me I'm particularly given his record on things like the Iran deal cozying up to the Castro regime being very weak\nOr when it comes to the Missouri River ... regime in Venezuela so I welcome President Obama how I should be paying for his travel expenses that come down um and don't forget you know we have the president of the United states coming down on October thirty first\nUh to Fort Myers in southwest Florida and then likely come again before the election happens and so you know you look at that rally that he did for Ted Cruz in Texas um you know that put the race away for a cat and I think we'll get a similar outcome here um after he comes down to Florida for me\nWell Gillum is um silver Tunde order I mean it's putting it nicely I'm trying to build a nice today I'm about about my political opponents\nBut he's he's kind of homes bond kind of throws throws off the rhetoric tries to he tries to do the cool thing that Obama\nDoes I I don't think he doesn't do it nearly as well but this is what part of what he said last debate with you for our listeners let's listen my grandmother\nUsed to say I have a dog will holler [noise]\n... spoke in first of all he's got neo Nazis helping him out in the state or he has spoken at racist conferences not calling Mr dissent is a racist I'm simply saying the racist believe he's a racist\nAnd of course the our ... our\nLovely is over and MSNBC it's center said oh that was such a brilliant line but we discovered today a there was a piece in a Breitbart today that of course these boy Connors of Israel these anti Israeli organization supporting Gillum the ... you know he's not sign this\nPledge called dream defenders I'm I planted my support to the freedom papers in the freedom papers are of course I'm also an advocate textbook socialist principles\nThe virtue of being born each of us is the absolute right to adequate food shelter et cetera uh and it goes on and on and of course I'm anti Israeli groups supporting Gillum honey response or\nYeah like I mean I thought that that that performance ah helped me tremendously but I thought it was just so outrageous I think the average voter thought it was outrageous\nUm and he keeps going back to that because I think the cupboard is bearer on any other ideas are issues and you're exactly right if you want to look at somebody who's just on representative of Florida's values\nAndrew was the one who is aligned themselves with the dream defenders\nThey are openly antagonistic to Israel they support boycott divested sanction\nOf the state of Israel they actually organized boy or a flash mob protests in Israel they take special trips or just the target Israel on and so what we're running for governor of Florida we're not running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip and so he's way out of step on that um and I would never accept an endorsement\nFrom a group a that boycotted Israel I Would never endorse them from the debate stage like he did\nUm you know it's just a couple of months ago and that group also says horrible things about law enforcement they say law enforcement as racist they say the police and prisons have no place in justice um and that law enforcement should be defined it so that's what he says\nI'm In terms of the pledge he signed on that I think that that is just way outside of what is acceptable or in the state of Florida and I don't think he's ever successfully answer those questions\nOr another piece out in the Tampa Bay times just a few days ago new Andrew Gillum documents show FBI agent might have paid for fundraising dinner\nAnd of course that's the FBI agent as part of the investigation into I guess Florida corruption\nAnd turns out you know four thousand bucks worth of food and drinks for one Gillum fundraisers a was paid for by this individual posing as a Florida real estate developer\nMust right so he said just last Sunday when we did the CNN debate when I was confronting them about all this oh I'm a grown man I pay for everything how dare you all this stuff\nWell then it turns out just a couple of days later there was a text message just showing he acknowledge that this pricey thousand dollar ticket to go see Hamilton was actually paid for by an undercover FBI agent who he thought was a with a local real estate developer\nAnd then it comes out just a couple of days ago but that same undercover FBI agent posing as a developer under road and almost five thousand dollar fundraising dinner\nFor Guillain nation governor campaign and indeed Andrew did not\nDisclose that expenditure and so he didn't even comply with Florida law so it goes around saying that he's not been investigated written being investigated but I Would ask the question\nWhat other reason what an undercover agent have for Greece and his palms with a thousand dollar ticket for underwriting of pricey fundraising dinner if he wasn't investigating Gillum that'd be the only reason you would do any of that stuff so he is under investigation he's been lying about a lot of this stuff and it is starting to catch up\nThe laser politics but I ... down to some really simple in these last closing dance there's just sleazy dishes sleazy politics as usual bribes or people people dangling little benefits and politicians jump\nAnd they just jump okay what do you need what do you need ... ... ... ... oh yeah oh yeah I'd love to have that sure it doesn't matter if it's a Hamilton ticket or a trip or restaurant it's sleazy corrupt politics at Tallahassee sadly has has become known for and if if if people want San Francisco in in\nSee sadly has has become known for and if if if people want San Francisco in in Florida then definitely vote for Andrew Gillum okay if you think San Francisco has become one of the most poorly run cities in the United states and you better get out there and vote for Iran to Santa I endorsed uh Ron over a year ago\nBecause I saw his leadership and his vision for the state of Florida and it's unparalleled\nIt's unparalleled so don't mistake the smooth\nTalking Obama want to be Gillum for\nGood leadership it's not it is it's pathetic and by the way a Ron before we let you go I got to get your take on this caravan\nOr you heard the Scarborough absurdity if you're if you're concerned about the care of and you're basically anti Semitic I mean you got your diagram that sends a but the but it looks like Floridians in the poll that just came out a couple of days ago CBS Hugo poll shows that\nOnly I'm\nOnly twenty six percent said that immigration from Mexico in Latin America has made life in the state better thirty eight percent said no impacts thirty six percent said it's made life worsen forty three percent said the migrants would ultimately pose a threat to the United states uh thirty eight\nPercent no threat that's an overall a poll there but now I'm fifty one percent of Floridians pulled said we should not try to help the migrants and the caravan forty nine percent said we should try to help this kind of a ridiculous question I mean we don't want anything to happen to these people we just don't want him to come to the United states that's a loaded question but your view on the Caribbean\nOr this is one where you cannot allow people to just illegally run across our border the fact of the matter is Mexico offered them a place to stay in Mexico they declined it so it's not like they're just trying to move away from difficult circumstance or the nearest refuge they they rejected refuge in Mexico\nBecause they think they have a right to override our border I think that's wrong Andrew Gillum a support the caravan coming into the United states is running mate was out there saying yesterday\nThat we need to welcome in the Caribbean in the United states um and so you couldn't have a more stark difference for borders Andrew stroke and borders I Want to support our men and women and if he wants to abolish ice\nAgain this is a this is an issue that I think the American people are following very closely I'm Andrew Gillum actually speaking now in Miami and I'm sure we'll all pull some sound there are Kamala Harris stumping with him right now so they they see this race a congressman\nAs absolutely critical for not just the state of Florida now but for twenty twenty and so all their big guns are coming down there so the president's coming for you you had pants down there uh what else do you have in store for the final week\nOh it's going to be non stop I mean we are going to be doing we did you know for events yesterday we're going to be on the road during multiple today and that's just what it's going to be and yeah we are doing well in the actual turnout and we're turning out the people we want to do more turning out to Democrats that we keep that up we're going to win in November sick

but\nThey will find any way to pick at President Trump fortunately in West Virginia President Trump has a lot of support\nHe won the election by forty two points when I get elected I'm going to be conservative fighter for President Trump's agenda\nAnd separately the reason why people were fleeing from Joe mansion\nIs he's another dishonest Washington liberal he's open borders he supports these radical leaders Chuck Schumer would be as first vote in the Senate and West Virginians are very concerned about returning to the Clinton Obama ears and that's why we're going to win this race\nWhy um why would they Democrat ever have much of a chance in the state of West Virginia when Donald Trump won the state by what forty point something like that\n[noise] well forty two points and and I think the reason why action is\nReally slipping dramatically in the polls is that as we've been able to get our message out and contrast to let them know what the people know that on all the issues that matter not only maps and some price of Hillary and Obama but ... is not pro life a match and supports Planned Parenthood\nMatching supports radical gun control West Virginians don't like that and I think one of the worst things of all\nIs that Joe mansion doubled down his support for Hillary Clinton's even after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work so Joe Manchin and the more people learn about his actual record\nNot his rhetoric because for what he does is he says one thing in West Virginia something completely different in Washington DC the more

first called on the Senate floor\nMansion took power and in fact he only came back the vote effort Susan Collins declared her position and whatever people think about the cabinet vote West Virginia should cast a vote there should be leadership out of West Virginia so\nJoe mansion could have defused this whole craziness this impeachment circus this obstruction a craziness that we saw if he had come out just a little bit earlier for\nCap it off we know that Feinstein held that material for months why because she wanted to play politics with the Supreme Court nominee\nJoe mansion aided in the
