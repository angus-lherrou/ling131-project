well as a defense contractor or as a a and it ... any any number of our companies that do work for the federal government have military implications and national security implications gosh there's certainly a lot of those I mean Trump pumped in another seven hundred billion dollars into the U.S military their health\nOr by the way there's a lot of ways still in those contracts I have a friend

we'll continue to take your calls on this uh coming up we're going to talk about who is funding this migrant caravan which has now supposedly four thousand people strong\nHondurans who make per capita was a two uh two thousand three hundred dollars income but they were they get the money spent seven thousand dollars a migrant to cross the border eight five five forty lore art Arthur will join us a lot more coming up\n\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule that is what I had a sinus headache for a few days but I had a master ... image of the brain and stroke\nAnd I was on my desk but I was on a respirator in a coma for thirty five days in three months later I came home in a wheelchair and double vision I have to learn to walk again to speak\nAgain one in one is to write the alphabet you know if I went out and did a little something might come home might be in bed now I'm up by like five thirty in the morning and go to the gym I Do shopping I cook I mean I have energy all day I mean I feel great\nOverall my whole outlook just feeling but my mental aspect everything everything is better\nFor a limited time use discount code Laura and we'll take thirty five percent off your first preferred sets of fruits and veggies and have them shipped to you free call eight hundred two four six eight seven five one\nAh cut down on the number of people are coming across the border to detain individuals that your purpose and come to the United states has to live and work in the United states and you get relief\nYou've got to let you want it and it's a it's an incentive for those individuals to come to the United states we need to cut off as Meg that's the president has attempted to do it but Congress has stepped up the task and [noise] you know frankly the fault is on them\nYeah I mean Congress can do a few basic things\nFairly quickly if it wanted to\nTo stop the magnet number one mandate e verify every employer must have e verify and it has to be enforced strictly with significant fines that's one thing they can do what are they are a few things could they do that are simple for our listeners to understand\nThey could expand the amount of detention that's available to the administration in order to detain these families so that their cases could be hurt quickly so that the good cases can be separated out circumspect cases will eat that night and those folks can be returned to the United states\nThey could also ah you know change the asylum laws so that if you pass through countries where they granted asylum like Guatemala like Mexico\nThat you would be expected to apply for asylum in those countries before you come to the United states and again you keep hearing that some of these you know individuals have legitimate ...\nIf they do they should be applying for asylum law tomorrow if they should be applying for asylum let's hope but there are in addition ah the ah the administration is taking steps to end the floor as a rule where unaccompanied alien a miners have to be released after twenty eight days\nUm Congress can you know step in that they can end the floor as a settlement agreement or if they'd like but again\nThere are free or judges right they're afraid of being called mean spirited that's what they're afraid it doesn't matter if ... how many instances of hideous you know criminal acts had been committed by illegal aliens even DACA kids which we've also documented on the show doesn't matter\nFor them it doesn't matter it's it it's a it's an emotional manipulation game and they want to they want to pull the heartstrings America and put these Republicans back on their heels city okay you wanna put babies in cages you want to put babies how many times did we hear kids in cages kids in cages we heard that phrase over and over and over again\nIn ... we do separate children from adults very briefly a U.S citizenship or a U.S customs and border protection does that\nIn order to protect the children but then we move them very quickly into the best facilities that we have available coverage can provide more money for that but here's really what it comes down to the trip that these people take to the United states is so horrendous waves robberies murders\nUnder the Obama administration when they had similar ah programs we saw NPR run articles about this we saw National Geographic of all things\nAre wrote an article about this but you don't actually hear about that anymore all your little girl a pink shirt standing next to her mother crying as border patrol agent\nMake sure that her mother doesn't have any cubs fan the child traveled through the night without food how in the world any parents and subject their child but this horrendous drone United States is beyond me\nUh when you when you see these four thousand people now just grows and grows and grows this caravan\nPaying for this I think there is no way when you have a per capita income of you know two thousand five hundred dollars in Honduras each individual can pay the seven thousand dollars up to ten thousand dollars it costs to\nGet to the United states so someone's footing the bill here who is it do you think\nI I I Wish I knew I Wish I had some idea and quite frankly I expected ministry should be looking into that a lot of these people though are you know doing this because they believe that the the the amount of money that they have to borrow or get from somebody or that they're given\nA they can pay back once they work in the United states for a very brief period of time and unfortunately the economics probably work in their favor this is another incentive again went back you verify that people can't work they will come\nAnd if they can't pay back their smugglers are definitely not going to run the risk of being smuggled for the United states we need mandatory e verify that the keys the kingdom but\nUntil we get to that point we need to catch that we need more immigration judges to hear these cases as quickly as possible so do a good cases can come in but the vast majority of the bad cases are can be returned\nTo eighty percent or eighty eight percent some I guess some cases by some measures of those who apply for asylum\nFrom Central America are denied yet only five percent of those who are denied actually are you know ever going to leave the country is not the case that that is that a proximity right\nThat's approximately correct we are talking to you know upwards of nine hundred thousand my God we're in the United states under five orders removal they've received their due process or it's not like they're waiting for their their their hearing\nEverything that they had coming than they've had but they remain in the United states we continue to work here again we have no ... no way\nTo verify that there are leading in\nIce chips lacks the resources to go out and find one season Tuesday's or people plus you you put on top of that the sanctuary laws places like California and localities where you know people under five orders removal\nYou know are apprehended by the police it shows up on the raft sheet that they're under a puddle order removal and yet they get released a in back into society and they're not return to their home countries\nBut everybody needs to work together in order to make the system work with any one part of it breaks down the entire system breaks down and that's what leads to a human tragedy that we see along the border\nMark Krikorian ah your colleagues on a with me last night art and he said that\nUh your colleagues on a with me last night\nArt and he said that the folks in\nA Guatemala who are being interviewed by the you know the MSNBC traveling reporter travels with migrants\nHadn't been coached yet so all he said was well look I Want to work in the United states in there and just no jobs here and\nNever mention anything about persecution and mark said well that's because he hasn't gotten to Mexico where all the ... coaching really occurs that's where you get do you know the paragraph that you have to say no matter what when when when authorities interview so the script for everybody man woman and child seems to be\nAt the same and I fear for fame for my family that I'm going to be killed by the gangs which is why\nSessions wants to remove domestic abuse and gang concern correct from the asylum a consideration\nHe already has done that through\nA homeland security bill I think it was attached to that bill yeah it but you know here's the other problem or this is the next year that's going to grow up about Seventy five\nPercent of all people who claim credible fear failed to have credible here even though the asylum numbers or a ... as you mentioned before\nThe problem is that if people allege that they have suffered or fear or something then\nUh they get referred over for torture convention claim back in Nineteen Ninety nine the Reno a Justice Department gave authority over a claims that at the convention against torture to immigration judges even though it might be years before an individual's removed from the United states\nDa chess needs to give that authority back to the Justice Department needs that authority back to ... chest so that they can make determinations whether someone's going to be tortured right before that person will leave the United states because that's really the critical\nWell and also a as is here's someone else made the point when someone claims domestic abuse there is no way for us to verify that even if that was a legitimate reason I'm horrible thing\nBut think about the people were going to be bringing into the country from all over the world it's it's well it's domestic abuse I'm afraid of domestic abuse well it hasn't even been investigated in their home country how are people to investigate\nLocal domestic violence concerns from an immigration proceeding in or review in Texas or Arizona it's just ludicrous\nIt's even worse than that because there's a regulation and plays but actually prevents United States government investigate it whether or not\nThat claimed took place in the whole country nothing that's contained asylum application and be disclosed to anyone outside of that asylum procedure really very limited exceptions none of which would apply in those cases\nAre in the turned back at the border and that's the other thing we have to be able to expedite which means even to non contiguous countries or if you're from Guatemala we need to change the law doing not so we can do immediate border turned backs like we can with Mexicans\nYes and a under a the TV puree the trafficking victims protection that we have actually a handover unaccompanied alien minors to ha chess and agents or the department of the United states government really doesn't\nThis for a for a living and yet you know Congress back in two thousand and sue decided that ha gesture to have this responsibility they don't do it very well

the another issue which is important because I Believe\nUm in light of the Kavanaugh stop these numbers probably are even more important which is the\nMain argument that the Democrats if they take the house are already many of them pledge and we now have their chairman I'm up there\nTo be terminated today when Judiciary Committee I'm sharing that letter saying what we're gonna we're gonna impeach cabinet and we're going to impeach Trump we've got all these investigations are a great belief that this will disrupt the economy and I'm a sense that um this is\nGoing to be ... chaotic and that it is going to weaponize the constitution for the purpose of going after unpopular presence whatever they say\nYou know that's their agenda\nSome had had a couple of days later said just to recap so you know some issues that would drive Republican turnout and maybe maybe even win over some Democrats\nGuide noxious yes but we'll move is the number of Democrats and many independents civil move in the third big issue of course is what the Democrats are doing the Democratic socialism or someone said to me ah you know the Dems as they now refer to them the Democratic impeachment\nMob I'm a party um uh\nAnd you know the repeal they promise to repeal every piece of a or reject every piece of the president's economic policies\nUm which are booming for most people are at least much more positive than they haven't been in years um these issues in the sense of the Democrats are opting to out of the middle what democratic socialism but Hubbard all over the idea of chaos you know whether to bang on windows they aren't going to\nDisrupt the country in a way that it for two years would be awful for the most people see\nYou know some of the law and order on Netflix right now hold on let me just again law and order safety\nLaw and order ... the respect um\nRespect yes those are really good terms and then there's the answer is is that they are so far out they are now with their projections of what they want to do or what they're saying saying\nThat this really bothers voters and that is what has been we've been seeing the closing up it is imperative that seems to me that those through what I call that prior to ...\nUm the Democrats have healthcare and you're not going to take that away from ... to light 'em but um except for the fact of what the cost is cause that goes again\nYou have a third of more Democrats who oppose the idea of the Democratic party trying to Institute\nA socially the Democratic socialism or that bothers people and man see policy does\nOkay this is yeah hold on this is what Nate Silver of course the\nWhole you know he see he see this ... this statistical a journal and he practiced statistical journalism um and he you know he didn't get the prediction right and twenty sixteen uh but this time and he's saying\nPeople should not be that surprised by a Democratic Senate\nOr a Republican House where in dangerous territory from a predict is assumption standpoint he set of four and five chance may sound like a done deal but it's simply isn't a and he said it's it just because someone thinks\nSomething is a high probability might be but it doesn't mean it's an inevitable sack so when people think it's inevitable that Republicans lose the house and no one isn't high enough about it maybe it's likely historically but it's not inevitable and I think that's what a lot of Republicans have to get through their heads\nYes this is why it's still hanging 'em I leave it there must be very hard to be predicted business environment because you don't know what's going to drive\nThis thing at the end we have a the selection that there are many many things that are under the law in this election most of all by the way is one like the Trump and sixteen a fear of returning\nThe country to the hands of the political class\nA elites and the sense of of losing what progress that has been made and the that that anti Washington anti elitism still exist very great with the issue has been from the Republican nationalize the election\nI still don't think I still think there's more they could do they could run national advertising with these things right\nStop and by the way it's cheaper to do and it's more effective because guess what when you buy network to advertise you to be inside of shows rather than crammed into local three minutes five minutes to do with the and in the states with this these commercials\nYou get to stand on your own but they need to nationalize the cars then Harris lay off year elections are\nAre off year elections are um tend to be nice for people who were in the out party that the the unhappy the disgruntled people who don't like Trump's trade between the the\n... when you put the big issues in front of people have consequences then something happens and I think the Republicans are doing and all the candidates are doing a better job of frankly the patch and all those they have not gotten together\nTo do what they could do who um two of Nash going further national\nAround polite and now we have not and not just a local election now\nIs is it a national election and people need to understand the choices because there are concerns are very great again Kavanaugh hearings and meaning of the Supreme Court the driving people out of restaurants this\nKavanaugh hearings them in the spring court the driving people out of restaurants this instability or ... years and a half in numbers yesterday that shows overwhelmingly rejection of the Hillary Clinton proposition ... even split among Democrats\nOr whether or not you know the notion that you can't be civil so when I'm there is and the things at the end they believe by the way by a large rally that if the Democrats win civility we'll get war\nWill become worse than they are now\nI Want to play a Nancy Pelosi for you or this is below sea uh discussing Trump's desire for a long especially given what we're seeing that these new migrants let's listen\nTo Laurel [laughter] we'll do\n\nIs they issue\nA manhood issue that ties into what an a list be the last question they piss people say the year the woman you have a lot of these interesting women running for office a lot of them former veterans and some of them doing really well so they are the woman you're the one it could also be the year of the man\nA because well our thing with a man and masculinity being attacked and its Kavanaugh at all\nYeah so I think there was a backlash I think that there is certainly a gender gap but it goes both ways and the men are and and again I come back to it's not just wrapping up the Republican base there are huge numbers of independents remember the Trump carried\nIn twenty sixteen and a large share Democrats who are not happy with the way things these the the prospects are going and it is an heritage really that those voters as well as the base\nBe exposed to a larger consequences of what happens if you will while the Democrats take over and what will happen to the\nCountry I think as simple as simple formulation simple formulation mobs versus jobs resistance versus results\nForward or backward we're going forward we're going up not down they want to kick they want to kick you and your down they want to kick you when you hit hard okay we're going up we're not going out looking back\nGoing up ...
