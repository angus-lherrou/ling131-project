I saw the ... yeah they said ten but now I think what they're looking for it seems is more they want to know what they can talk about\nIn the invested well they can't talk about anything\nIt's a private matter for their background but\nThe thing Senate ... and a new letter does a tweet um say there's information and Kevin was passed FBI background checks that involve either inappropriate sexual behavior alcohol abuse they didn't delve into according to reports this morning they did not delve into deeply his alcohol abuse because that's not\nWalker told W yeah your TV employers all throughout the trip or valley and the entire state or all facing the same huge challenge finding employees\nFactors are more jobs in the state right now more people unemployed and twenty Eighteen than ever before and wages and the state or up higher than they are at the national rate so wages have grown up higher than they have nationally uh jobs continue to grow up more people in the workforce than ever before\nBut Britain quarterback deputy communications director for Walker's democratic opponent Tony ... campaign challenge Walker's comments about the growth in jobs saying one in five Wisconsin workers hold poverty wage jobs eight hundred and Seventy thousand families can't afford basic necessities and health care costs continue to climb\nBecause he says Walker and puts his political interests before the people of Wisconsin or coming I\nWant to keep your car running better longer here's a few tips from Bob Adam's Adam's automotive center in Oakland where\nMost of ... just come with an inspection will catch a lot of small detail things that should be taking care of immediately our job is to make sure the customers informed them any issues with their vehicles we always informed more we see at that point is always the customers decision\nSo it gives you on your way with that and\nUm but I Do I Need all of this doubt graduate become CEO the struggling retailer JC penny company October Fifteen Jill ... is a graduate of south retail merchandising and management undergraduate program\nThe fifty one year old so I Will be the first woman to lead to one or two sixteen year old department store chain that's the latest I'm Mark ... by Adams' automotive on double the OJ trial Gina [noise]\n\nCall Laura now one eight five five forty Laura [noise]\nThe FBI investigation itself ...

I think they're just a ... they don't know what to do at this point they thought one of these things is going to pan out I mean they the stall ...\nI think it's good news for Republicans I really do I think now Republicans are more United than they've been since the day after the election maybe even more United and they've been since nine eleven that's what I said last night and that's what I really believe or let's go to a JC Florida on line one Jaycee\nLaura I'm I just wanted to say like most on the right I'm really happy and grateful Lindsey Graham said what he said and continues to call up a left but\nWe've grown so accustomed to our representatives not really doing their jobs and pushing back not fighting left on a consistent basis so when one of them simply does their job and says what needs to be said all of a sudden we're treating them like a hero you know this shouldn't be the norm and not the exception\nSo this is ... and the others were sent to Washington to do and world wedding ourselves with excitement because someone did what they were hired to do and that's a shame\nThat we don't do that\nThat's a great point you know I think you know when I when I think of that when people tweet around things like work a man helps an old lady across the street\n[laughter] you know or look ... look a uh uh uh someone helps in autistic kid in the in the seven eleven that video of helping him stock things which is nice but that's what we should do right that's humanity that's humanity that's that that is what we all should be doing\nSo I guess it's better to celebrate that than just keep saying negative things people so that it is nice but it's kind of an all I'm saying is it's kind of sad that we have to we have to note\nThat when someone is doing the right thing instead of as our caller said that's just what you should be no trouble sadly like there's so many representatives and senators they don't reflect the will of the people so when they do it you have your Sean ... Lindsey Graham\nThe other day he walked through a Fox out of the green room [noise] people who are applauding the seas walking down the halls and hands shaking him like he just came back from war but he made a speech and the committee defending the nominee that's what he did\nBy the way the Durban letter just quickly it says no where there's a Dick Durban to ... a Senator Grassley\nNowhere in any of the six Kevin ... FBI reports which the committee has reviewed on a bipartisan basis was there ever a whiff of any issue at all related in any way to inappropriate sexual behavior or alcohol abuse he wants some of that released he thinks that the tweets that Grassley has been sending out\nMiss characterize what's in these\nFBI find\nIt so it's it's casting a poll that there might be more information about sex abuse or alcohol abuse in this FBI report\nLet's go to Scott Connecticut on line three Scotty ache\nOr the I think a lot of people I've lost and appreciation for actually how profound through all the political saturation of or you know the back and forth\nOut profoundly positive you exposure of the left or they're they're I mean they're rabid aggressive approach to your to need need for power um it's\nIt's really almost like a like a drug addict addicted to the drug they're addicted to the pursuit of power so they'll literally anything to get there and what's happened in his cabinet earring is literally\nFrom what I you know for I'm I'm fifty three years old and from what I can see this is literally one of the most important periods of time to witness you know that that they it's their own destruction they did it to themselves but everybody else can now see I mean I've got plenty of Democrat from that or\nIt's just common sense you take a look at what what's been going on and everything they're loving it this guy and they're really taking themselves down they did it for themselves and it's very very obvious\nYeah that was the uh that was the open to the show last night now if there's any doubt in anyone's mind just how\nOut of control the Democrat Party is how they want to so chaos where we should have calm where they want to rebel routes and intimidate instead of show results intimidation over ideas\nThat's where it is\nI think about it it's intimidation tactics you saw in the elevator and the restaurants in airports intimidation over information and insights\nIntimidate this is all ... they're the biggest bullies in town they're intolerant other of other people's views while they claimed to be the most tolerant they call you haters while they're the most hateful\nThey say that you're anti immigrant when all they do is talk about white privilege racist in your they're obsessed with race we want people to be treated\nThe same the rule of law

point where I needed some help so I reached out and contacted trinity\nIf you're into and you need help comb trinity of one eight hundred seven mine for over four three something to talk to a

late season over limit charges reduce your interest and possibly improve your credit score you saved thousands\nAnd they were actually able to work with my creditors and being able to pay off close to Fifteen thousand dollars in the last Eighteen months\nNot make a copy of it I don't know if they're going to allow it to make notes I don't know how they're going to stop that and um and then they can leave it for the next person to review but this is it's just a matter of time before or something like that leaks out bottom line is how many interviews they have to do are\nAs many it takes the latest pass the election watch\nIt looks like they're out of cards so the current coming down on us it don't you don't you get that sense there's no there's no more delays are going to vote on this weekend\nI think they should or should not be any more delays you do the best you can do and the bottom line is the only thing that the that the Democratic side of the house really wants to hear is\nHow many more interviews you can come up with people day after day after day that have something negative to to allegedly offer ... and only to the way of looking at a a vote I think this is a ... it's going to be voted on I Believe by the end of the week\nThe um the complaint is that they did not looking to judge Kavanaugh's drinking when he was in college and law school or high school that that wasn't adequately investigate it and the supplemental what was your response to that bear\nOut and they know that if they haven't read it how do they know what's in the supplemental\nYou know they they don't know what questions are asked who was interviewed they might very well have interviewed a couple of guys that the the judge has some beers with or who should yeah I had beers with them and nothing ever happened to you know they don't know that they just surprising that they just want to keep the pot stir it up\nIn order to the you know continue that the alleged doubt\nA contrived out I look at it is but those that are opposed to the\nWomen up down here that Bill Bill or a question for you Ronan Farrow in the New Yorkers are reporting that or the FBI prove ignored testimonies from former classmates of cabin all these are people that went to Yale with him and uh they ... the ... they're trying to\nRonan Farrow claims that these are primary eyewitnesses are witnesses to the Deborah Ramirez allegations the problem is that you read and to the store you realize these are all here say witnesses who claim somebody told them that somebody told them that this happened\nSo it would the FBI proved those people are they just needed not credible witness\nThat probably not credible witnesses and and bottom line first of all is coming from Ronan a secondly I'm a these if they're if they're not I witnesses after that\nThey not permitted on the stand and a quarter law never mind are doing this and if you have to make that cut off someplace into what is you know comment what does make sense to do\nAnd none of these people make sense and if anybody can come up with some sort of a story I heard it from a friend of a friend that doesn't that doesn't carry any weight with anybody [noise]\nMhm well again people think that the FBI is conducting some global investigation into any allegation no matter how remote\nAnd interviewing people on a hearsay basis where people have just hearsay recollections of things that happened Thirty years ago it make sense\nIt makes no sense for and that's not happening\nI think the problem that exists here\nUh the bureau is going to get sucked on the one way or the other if it comes out the way it appears it's going to come out in the ... the the democratic side of the houses are going to say they're all from Trump bands from the bureau if it if for instance something comes out that that does give everybody a pause and ... and it's credible\nUh then you know the bureau's going to take a black guy from the other side of it I was\nI I just think it's a it's a very tough way to go but it's an investigation that um was demanded and done and let's get the vote\nI think again in the end people want to have people have faith in our in our institutions of government especially like the FBI and\nYou you don't want to believe that the FBI is acting in a political manner ever and I think that the media do an enormous disservice went on an issue like this with no you know with with no corroborating contemporary contemporaneous witnesses\nTo expect field agents or the FBI to be doing these types of\nYou know broad ranging ... is this kind of broad ranging slew thing into the background of some and this is not what is what the FBI does and people don't either get that or the media has been so remiss\nIn not reporting properly what they're all the FBI us\nBut you see the ignorance it's a willful ignorance of the media and then the the poor people who don't know any better or who don't have time to delve into these issues I'm like wait why are they keeping the secret outrageous this shouldn't be secret this is our Supreme Court you know that's going to happen\nOf course it's going to happen we write is a combination of everything that you should or bottom line is the some of these people\nTruly don't believe um that there's anything going on it's wrong here it's because of who they support they have to say well I Believe that does that the judge Kevin I was guilty that I knew you can't look at the facts\nAnd come out with that conclusion but they do\n... you're on the lower Ingram show Bill

I.\nThe Atlantic has a piece out um here's why white women are abandoning the G O P A new evidence suggests that many of the women may now agree\nUh and they were made some joke about Tina Fey um who took white women to task after the Trump election who's helping him get elected providing him with fifty two percent of their support\nSay stay focused her remarks on college educated white women forty four percent home of whom voted for Trump saying chastising them for\nWanting to go back to watching HGTV and forget about the election you can't look away she said\nWell now a it looks like some women are taking that to heart a morning console political poll found that President Trump's net support\nAmong Republican women had dropped by Nineteen points well that's a huge drop if that's if that translates into people voting for the Democrat Party that could be a disaster for the geo pay\nWell I think that is the the biggest but both change in the electorate concern for the Republicans and and victory points for the Democrats so far which is that the closet what I was to the closet conservatives in the country are actually\nIndependent suburban women who voted twenty points for Romney who voted probably Thirteen fourteen points for ah for for President Trump\nA and they've been up for grabs I think the Democrats than making very good kind of momentum with them I don't think this cabinet nominations never help that I always thought that a woman nominee who even a woman nominee what might have been more conservative [noise] what would actually\nHave been the right strategic choice here I think the Republicans have held on to the working class voters\nThe Trump talk but those are the voters were up for grabs and I don't see anything coming out of the Republicans to win back\nYeah well the again you would think the economy which is of course on fire women care about prosperity and security and all those issues that Trump is\nFocused on 'em but nevertheless at twenty September twenty six us see uh LA Times poll\nCounted twenty eight percent or ... percent point advantage for Democrats among all women a twenty eight percent advantage among married white college educated woman women a group along tied to the G O P the Republicans now lead by only five points\nThey had a much bigger\nA much bigger lead among that group of women before but now those are low as well um this is this is a substantial block or the married college educated women that's a substantial\nBlock but among all women I mean I\nI think a lot of this might be tone you know Trump's tone women like things calm they like things to be calm down and I think that they they sense that things are chaotic and they seem to be blaming the Republicans for that maybe the stuff in the last couple of weeks might change that I don't know [noise]\nBut they're also more skeptical about the economic progress if you look men are like wow this economy is through the roof women whom as you rightly pointed out typically are even more concerned about the economy\nAnd its effect on them and their family or less understanding of an improved economy and that's another area where the Republicans have really failed to drive their message what every day every day that the the national question is is she rapists or not\nThere's a day that do but he's focusing on the economy I mean you've seen the last day or two incredible jobs numbers come uh come out and the focus is primarily you know on the cabinet issue and it's going to stay that way at least through you know middle of next week probably\nYeah and that's um I think that's why I'm Mitch McConnell wants this vote to happen as soon as possible this is what my barnacles said this morning on MSNBC let's listen\nA lot of Republicans have come home and the state of Florida and the Gillum racing was comfortably ahead you can go to other states than show\nAgain the races are tightening in do you think that they perhaps Donald Trump is seen data that shows that this is driving conservative and conservative voting base up back home of course the the Joe\n... exactly to Donald Trump strength the one thing he is an expert in is resentment and specifically in this case white male resentment\nMale resentment um I think the white privilege discussion is driving\nEven more men though to the Republican Party I think people are really getting tired of this identity politics I'm Mark I I think that the Democrats have gone way too far in a\n... ... as you do a for a long time I I've been against both class warfare an addendum to politics\nAs a as a moderate Democrat you know I've always been against those two in favor of current or the right kind of you know social policies and balance I think what's really happening here is that\nThe Democrats were completely energize\nThey were looking for an opportunity to vote against Trump and the Republicans without a leader without a particular message\nWe're incredibly disorganized and I do think this thing has awakened the Republican base you know in a in a way that it's backfiring on the Democrats unfortunately uh [noise] I think they still have an edge but I think they probably could have had to wipe out the way this thing was heading\nAnd and now I think you're going to see it kind of a balance among turn out here\nBecause the stakes of this election have been just raised you know so high now\nYeah and I I Do think that again you\nSee what the Republicans are capable of when they stand United with the exception of the three I'm more liberal Republicans who\nYou know are are dragging their feet on the on the nomination ah the the party when it's United is pretty formidable I mean even a bunch of older white it's a pretty formidable ... never seen Mitch McConnell so\nYou know so good as he's been in the last week just as a political matter\nBook but see that's ironic thing but I think you'll see this in the Senate races and I think you see a lot of the Senate races\nTightened up because the Republicans are coming home and there's no question that this Kevin ... is a highly partisan ice vote and if you're in a state that voted for the courts for Trump you know there's no question that it's going to be a large percentage more way above a majority that would want to see you confirm it's in the Senate this has\nDone a lot I think for the Republicans you know in the house you know\nIn the Senate this has done a lot I think for the Republicans you know in the house you know not so much you know Ryan quit his job and I didn't believe there's no leadership there is no message we're we're McConnell or as you say has stepped up maybe some people think rightly maybe some people\nYou know what I think too harshly but as you said you stepped up he's got a message leading in the house there's nothing\nYeah I Would have to read or less\nIt's rather listen to and it's a Paul Ryan should've left if he's going to retire should've left to let this thing it'd be taken over by somebody wants to fight for these issues Paul Ryan's basically not even a factor right now a Mark Penn thank you so much for joining us that's always great to talk to you on radio and on the angle will take a break\nEight five five forty Laura do you believe that this uh the politics of rage that we're seeing right now I think it people said Trump was embodied the politics of rage\nUh but now it seems like the Democrats have taken on that role at least during this Kavanaugh issue how does that translate in November are you voting have you vote for some people have already voted you voting early encouraging others to vote\nYou gotta spread the good news if you believe in going forward in this economy and you

wall which is Congress this fall\nBut we did read it NAFTA he's getting the NATO nations to pay more of their fair share he got that tax reform through again it's not everything we wanted the economy is humming he's gotten a I think now he has more than a seventh of all federal judges are Trump\nAppointees uh and obviously if Kavanaugh gets confirmed and I think he will be confirmed that means they'll have to ... amazing justices on the court which will of course they will live long past Trump's administration and have a profound effect on the judiciary going forward\nYeah and and some people say uh well the reason you guys what Trump is just because we're ... no it's not just because of him it's because all the other\nJudicial appointments his foreign policy is the economy it's taxes and its regulations it's better trade deals and say it's standing up to the left and finally we have a warrior in there who will fight with the same relentless this has left us fighting and we don't have to be dirty like they are we just have to fight with the same intensity and realize\nThat we're in a in a in a serious battle to preserve our values and our freedoms so I'm I'm feeling really good about what's going on I don't know where Jeff Flake is and where mccaskey and all the others are columns but I'm hoping with this FBI favorable report and we're hearing it's favorable that they won't have the\nThe audacity to vote against him at this point\nUh David you have immerse yourself in religious history and the history of the Christian Church in your new book a Jesus has risen Paul and the early church continues um\nUh you're you're writing and you're you're you're you're really ... ...\n... in in many ways newly are emerging as a thinker on the religious underpinnings of our society but it's really important for people to understand\nHow the early church was formed how unlikely it was that these followers early followers of Christ or we're going to you know basically drop everything and devote their entire lives and and give their lives or to this ah this new phenomenon and Jesus Christ a tell us about why\nThis book was you know it was so important for you to write at this point in your own life\n[noise] ah well I'm I'm going through the New Testament when I when I became a Christian I was on fire for the Bible cause I realize for the first time in my life it was the word of God I was holding in my hands and I started inhaling everything I could about learning about it wishing that I had something some some books some guys and\n... that would help me understand it better and be less intimidated so as I've studied this for Twenty years I wanted to give back\nAnd start writing books that would help explain the Bible and so\nThe last book I wrote was about the gospels\nAnd move put a paraphrase an in state of most of the versus the gospels in chronological order and also running commentary and this book Jesus has risen is about the book of acts the history of the early church\nWhich follows the gospels and then six of false Thirteen of pistols their letters that he wrote to the early churches that he formed the planet and they were they were dissipating from the\nThe true gospel they were following falls teachers and he would write letters and they're very heartfelt human and personal letters urging them back to the true faith and they were experiencing the same kind of of\nAdversity an opposition and secular influences corner and it was a hotbed of sexual immorality and I'd olive tree with the ... the pagan influences and Paul would say don't follow those people don't\nMix and sinker ties their religion with our religion Jesus Christ is the son of God to follow him and come back and we see the same kinds of things occurring in our society today they're happening in the Catholic Church and the Protestant Church there's there's\nThe conflict in adversity from within trying to dilute the gospel which has faith in Jesus Christ alone to salvation and we see people mixing that up and mixing that message to the detriment of all\nPotential converts and so we want to ... to the truth and and encourage people to understand what the Bible really says some might the goal in my books was to help people understand what the Bible is about\nAnd encourage them ultimately to read it for themselves\nTell us about the most unlikely of Christ disciples Paul\nYes Paul was a a an observant Jew and and he was steeped in the Jewish law the mosaic law and when and he was a great persecuted of Christians because he didn't just believe that the Christians were new competing religion but that they were perverting\nReligion of God and\nAnd it was Judy as well as a religion of God's ... and ... there's nothing a false about that but Paul was outraged that they were doing this Jesus can't possibly be them aside because they expected the Jews expected a military or political uh deliver\nFrom the the forces that the authorities at the time and they didn't expect someone to be humiliated and die on the cross anybody who was a hung on a tree was a curse according to the Old Testament law Jesus not only didn't deliver them victory he didn't even raise their hand in his own defense and he was\nKilled on the cross and so he can't be the messiah and then so he's in St Paul's going around ... rounding Christians up and in fact he was on his way to Damascus and under authority of the San ... to pick up Christians and bring them back to to punish them and when Christ encountered him on the Damascus road\nBlind them with light and converted him to from the ... the greatest persecuted to the greatest evangelists So Paul then long story short went around throughout the Roman empire Asia Minor all around and that in that periphery of the Roman empire and sadness churches and they were as if they were his new\nBorn babies he wanted to nurture them and write them letters and make sure they stay true to the faith as I mentioned a minute ago but he was the least likely person to become the greatest evangelist because he was the greatest persecuted but God picked him in the Bible says before he created the universe\nAnd I think he did it because he had those qualities he veers intellectual\nAnd relentless and determined and ultimately a follower of got\nThe part I think this is Mike around two fifty seven in your book um\nWhere you talk about how the apostle Paul corrected\nTalk about how the apostle Paul corrected obviously in the letters the Corinthian church um and it the way he did it was not condemning Atari language or\n[noise] you know railing at the end pointing a thing as they're going to turn all damnation but it was with with love and respect and you talk about how that is a great lesson and I think I Need to take that lesson\nSomething we all do um because it's easy to get you know upset or demoralized or even angry at people when they don't see what you see but that's not really the way to change minds\nNo and he can't argue people into the kingdom when we got to be a little different than we are in politics but you know you don't want to be too strident and\nHe what he said he he will be all things to all people not meaning he would be a hypocrite and compromises values he would never dilute the gospel message but he would not sweat the small stuff so when he was around Jews who would adopt their practices ... as long as they didn't violate his basic core principles\nIt was around Greeks he would do what they did he was talking with invoke Greek poetry to get into their minds and to relate to them and then he was present\nThe truth of the universe and the gospel of salvation through Jesus Christ and it was kind of reminds me of one of my favorite uh apologist today Ravi Zacharias he says when we approach\nPeople in a van july's and tell them about to say we want to understand the question or as much as the question they asked meet them where they are understand where they are because you're not going to the right somebody in the kingdom you have to tell them about the good news and do it in a win some way and and that will hopefully lead to the best response\nAnd again\nTrying to advance allies and in the world today a as it is with the rise of Islam\nWith the broken ness of our culture or with the poison of pornography all of the things that we're seeing around us yet there is always hoping God in Christ there's he represent the light of hope and the light of truth and I think", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura
