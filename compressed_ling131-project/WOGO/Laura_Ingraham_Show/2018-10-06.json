has anyone take the ... down to see what kind of a material or what the bottom of the pan looked like the like the magnet where the filter\nLaw and done that yet we'll see you know the transmission will slip for two reasons one because this war out too because it's low on fluid so if you have no flute and ... I mean if you have no leaks and you check the level of the fluid\nThen it could be that it's just a hundred and Seventy one cave original collectors wore out and it's slipping a little bit but you said it's just mostly when it's cold and it's then it's warm all year\nOr was\n\nThat very well could be the fact that the flu is getting hotter and you get more lame pressure what do you think Sam work lectures work a little bit better when it's warm it\nSlips when it's cold and it gets better when it warms up usually indications of the sales in the ... getting hard and thereby passion when they're cold food bypass so you don't get enough pressure right to apply to fluctuate properly um it's a Ninety One what kind of dodges innocent as a truck or a car\nOr truck okay honey on\nNinety One dodge pick up where the three Eighteen that transmissions got bands that ... that require adjustment to\nShow you know I was I Would service transmission and have the bans adjusted and see if that improves it if it doesn't it probably going to need a transitional\nX Y every experience or\nHopefully you'll get lucky which is a service Larry but some good fresh gluten there and the new ah filter maybe get some good live pressure back and hopefully they'll save you it's not efficient and if need the transmission is twenty seven years old hundred and Seventy one K. it's given you good performance yeah absolutely I have\nA buddy well good luck with that and keep us posted let us know how you make out not thanks for the one phone call okay\nOkay now ... I think Hillary by by by you know um\n[noise] when transmissions cold\nThe shells around the back of the ... the split brings on most of them some of them have all rings\nUm when those over ... get hard I've seen a lot of cars when they fired up polls put it in here and just won't go and get the number one clock the forward Koch won't come on and it's got good pressure but the question is blowing by the rings wants to clutching gauges and the transmission starts to move from friction you get a little bit of heat\nAnd when he gets the o rings they swell up it's sort of like you know water pumps when the water pumps you\nWhen they won that won't leaking shut it off and let it sit\nToday ready or you've got a puddle under the carpet a water pump leaking one who's down the field strong fire it up get on top of the flu would get warm and it was long as you're driving and won't let you shut it off when it cools off\nBang Italy and you know not a matter of transmission by the way a lot of times they'll have a leak when they when you shut them off and let 'em ... there'll be a pot on the floor\nBut if you wiped off if you go to war and wiped out that fluid you could drive into California would wouldn't make a drop\nWhat you shut it off and wait and you got two days later you flew in on the floor the ring around the pump where the pump housing fits in front of the ... and\nThey'll do that all the time it's that's a textbook case of an hour and\nThat that's you know thrown in mind you same thing with the with the ceiling my always will be aware links between the mid than you know yes yes and that's just ignoring yeah I mean it's it's got a groove and the only one of them in that ...

or\nGood morning Sam and Sam yeah we got the two thousand for the RV believe that they're hiding out here\nAnd I sent it smells like oil running or something so we got back one day we I stuck a piece of cardboard underneath it on your side of the engine and I believe in the grips after a while you know\nAnd actually at a Capricorn oil the first time said say that it occasionally in oil changes that I've ever had that so that that might look down at the engine and we could have some oil on the Alternator\nAnd different little places but I got underneath it a couple of days ago and and you can't see anything because of the skits plates and everything but I reach back to the oil filter to make sure it was tight\nAnd it was tight and I don't know how can the oily so that you you didn't think that could be the ... name bearing no no\nNo that car has a very little about timing\nAnd writing the back with the oil filter live next to it is yeah it's a V. tech pressure switch it's what it is still annoyed that has three oil passages in it and it's under full pressure it's a high pressure leak not a low pressure seep okay\nSo what you're doing is there is a filter inside this gas ... ... it's what controls V. tech and that's why you're killing half a quarter oil is because there was a pressure early\nSo it's a very simple job three ... right next to the filter\nIt seemed to be

program and it's just a couple of weeks ago talking about his particular effort this year at the salt flats was his first time ever being there\nAnd he said it was all above the both the conditions being better than it has been in a long time\nBut I understand that's not the whole story\n[laughter] yeah it's a and and it's always good to celebrate a little improvement but the danger in the celebration is overdoing it to the point where people think oh it's all fixed we don't have to worry about any for oh that's good okay what's the next thing on the list well it's still on the list um\nWhile racing out there for the season the twenty Eighteenth season is better than it's been in the past three or four years uh it's there remains a a serious ecological problem out there that was brought forth by the\nMismanagement of the very people that are supposed to protect us for us American citizens\nNinety percent of the people out there were happy and satisfy the salt will just go to if they needed but they were people that were running probably blow three hundred miles an hour to them it was pretty great and unless you broke through\nThis thin crust everything was great you went

about the conditions at the Bonneville salt flats\nAnd the efforts of course to see the sauce which we've been talking about for the last year or so before that hard network break Louis you are telling us about this mismanagement\nAnd how it's it's led to the decline of salt flats continue your comments\n[laughter] and I'm I'm Sorry to kind of just carry on but it's it's a rather complicated long project but it with about a few minutes of conversation most folks understand and I think the one thing I Want to thank you Bob and and the listeners for those that are staying tuned in is that we're trying to just raise the awareness to let\nPeople the American people know that amateur racing in the United states is under siege\nBonneville is a place not for millionaires not for big sponsors not for big money making you get no prize money you get a trophy and you'd get bragging rights and this is where ordinary people with great big dreams go and do extraordinary things and that's what we're trying to save\nThe opportunity not just for today that when all of us are listening everyone\nDead fifty years it'll still be a place where people can train them to go up here\nSo the bottom line of of what I was trying to say is that\nIn almost every other public federal land there's something built into the release mechanism that keeps the place going ... keeps it in a good state that the American public can use it and enjoy it\nI I Can't imagine that they would allow people to repel down you know the mouse much more spray painting their names as they went\nOr throwing garbage on the Appalachian Trail or carving their name and the Saturn ... rocket in Huntsville, Alabama I just can't see that happening but for some reason Bonneville is not one of these places that anybody really gives a hoot about in the lab they say they do have a signed it\nA very technical and very serious term called an area of critical environmental concern but as far as we save the salt coalition and the Utah alliance a group of local Utah a racers who keep all of a good eye on the place every day\nAnd the say the salt which is a coalition that thank you seem I thank you thank you has put together and in many ways it's funded for a number of years\nTo help uh bring the conversation to the halls of Congress both the house the Senate the department of the interior and the the L am in Washington because we're getting we get we are getting we got nowhere with the people\nIn a Salt Lake and part of that Bob is because they play musical chairs everybody wants to be the top dog it Yosemite or at at the Grand Canyon but they don't really want to say oh I'm In charge of the Bonneville salt flats big desert [noise]\nSo they change change they change jobs all the time and every time a new person comes in we've got to turn them up and tell them about this but of course\nThere it is a race or trying to tell a ... person who is schooled and has all these degrees for land management we're trying to tell them how it should be of course we're the only people out there we either racing coming in a land speed racers amateurs everyone\nWho had been out there every single year since Nineteen forty nine and so having their our eyes on this place and because we put our loved ones and our friends on this thing in our speed machines we are damn good and careful about what we do to the surface\nAnd how we keep that surface\nIn good shape for our speed runs because the biological unit of any speed machine is the most valuable part\nOkay so ... and ... and and you can stop me any time but when you turn you put the nickel in with me I just keep going\n[laughter] well that's the thing we love your [laughter] so here's the thing that they've they've not done\nThe right the right bit there has been nothing no protection really put into place they say there is they had these fancy terms\nBut it's like a spaghetti western where you walk into the bar and as soon as you walk and you see that it's all you know a a facade and there's nothing there that that they've done all of the fees that they've gotten from racing and\nThat they've done all of the fees that they've gotten from racing and from movies\nWhich isn't the tens of millions of dollars over the years we can't get them to fix the dams sign at the end of the road that's been shot out with bullets\nAnd paper it over with stickers and scratched for an enormous amount of time and that science been there since the eighties they say oh I don't know where the money is I don't think we can do that but they take the money that's out of Bonneville that's supposed to be used for Bonneville and they use it all over the state now mind you they got a budget\nAnd I appreciate sharing to keep all Utah in good shape but even the state of Utah that government\nAgrees with the racing community and a couple of years back they did a thing called the house concurrent resolution eight\nWhich is a fancy legislative thing that was a love letter from the people of Utah to the racing community to say we agree with you that the Bonneville salt flats international speedway\nShould be restored to safe racing conditions and that's at Thirteen miles speedway it was signed by the governor and it was passed by the ...
