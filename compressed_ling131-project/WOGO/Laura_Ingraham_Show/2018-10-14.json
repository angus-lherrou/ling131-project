from everything I've been told when family members or you know and others you really did have a very very special relationship that we all know that went beyond most mother in law daughter in law relationships am I correct absolutely\nUm well first of all she had an amazing mother in law and rose laughter who with Joe as a mom\nAnd she told me when I first got married how much he loved her mother in law and how good her mother in law was to her and she said I Want to be the same kind of mother in law for you and she said and here's my rule\nEvelyn uh we're speaking about just amazing tragedy that you and your family went through leaving Vienna the Nazi invasions ah your ship almost got bombed coming in New York you finally get here what did you do and how did you eventually meet Leonard well\nMy parents\nAnd I lived on the west side and I went to the New York public schools my father was in the diamond business\nAnd dad and he found\nA beautiful yellow diamond actually on my mother's hand this yellow diamond that I'm wearing on the street in Nineteen forty seven when I was a little girl and in those days nobody a value colored down but at any rate he did well and then they went into retailing\nAnd my mother was very very fine sales person she taught me how to sell\nLike all my life because every once in a while they would always be someone who was ill and I had to come in and give them the hand after school and and I went to the sinus public schools in New York\nA Hunter College high school and then on to college when I was a freshman in college I'm One of my high school friends was dating a real nice fellow by the name of Bob Bob best friend was a boy by the name of Leonard laughter\nAnd so Stephanie invited me to a party that her parents what giving and her parents told her that she couldn't have Bob and that could bring Leonard if she can get an\nUpdate from Leonard so that the four of us could hang around while they were having a party for the grown up with a you know they were thirty people\nThere reached so\nUm my um my first date with letter with a blind date that within range by my friend Stephanie and I'm Larry came and picked me up and my dad met him and they talked for a couple of minutes and then we went over to Stephanie's house\nThan when I got home my father was sitting in the living room which he never did he was usually waiting up to me that [noise] and and so I thought something bad happened to my mother and then he was going to give me some bad news for a boy\nAnd so I said what are you doing in the living room what's happened to mom\nAnd she said nothing nothing happening to mom I just want you didn't know that the nice boy\nWow what am I Am surprised that must have been for you know it was terrible why why wasn't getting involved that it only Eighteen oh why didn't need that pressure he's used to being a dead usually you're done with being a good point [noise] darling I was so I was such a bad thing\nOh ... I was expected to tell you what are the boy you're too young\nNo no just the reverse and when his mother met me she said the same thing for him and he said oh my God I mean neither one of us were ready for a relationship because he was very young and just about to go into the navy and I was just starting college\nSo it wasn't until I graduated and then he got out of the navy that we started today\nYes and then I'm I'm\nAbout a year later and we were married so we knew each other really he wasn't my best friend isn't in our mind\nA year later we were married so we knew each other really he was my best friend isn't that an hour I'm Still surprised that I married him and he still surprised that he married at the house and they're really why is that because we were such good friends\nAnd we really liked each other we enjoy talking about a variety of topics we never kept our mouth shut and we were always talking about something and he let me a book I never returned to and then she said well I have to marry you if you\nDon't get me back the book I said okay\nThe consummate salesman let her lover [laughter] let me ask you what was it like when you first met I say\nWell I met her right in the beginning when I met Leonard and she really was very very nice to me\nAnd she was um she asked me to to help her ... a as a hostess I'm with a surprise birthday party she was going to do for him\nAnd uh she had it at her home and she said she afterwards you know she loved the way I dressed for the party\nThat taboo and and she liked the way I really did help her\nA as a house than I introduce people to each other I met people for the first time and um you know we got along very very well she was really always good to me\nWhen she ... how successful was the U.S they Lauder companies with this point and how what was it intimidating the meter was or were they not that far along in the success you\nWell you are very sensitive about that John in fact nobody had ever heard of that the laughter when I met them it was a very small company I Believe they had only started and business a few years earlier had just\nBeen the launch of the phenomenal fragrance which it became subsequently called youth do which has been\nA a serious seller for well over fifty years which is longer than most fragrances have lived and um [noise]\nYou know she\nOf what I stood behind the counter after I was married um and people would come up to the counter I the first thing I Would say was have you ever heard of that scene in order and they said well I bet she related to hear Harry Lauder\nNow I had never heard of sir Harry Lauder new\nYeah because we're both to young Sarah Halley Lauder was the\nI'm a dance hall artist Scottish who is very very famous in the thirties at in the forties apparently in England and I'm In Scotland and many many people\nKnew him here and he was very popular here\nThings kind of changed your own little do the ... there are areas are sure Harry's or relatives are you related to the U.S they take\nThe athlete now when I go into a if I if I you know you charge card and people see my name they say are you related to se Lauder so I always say oh I Wish I were I don't want them all day and then now the address off that sure want them to put us together\nYou're smart smart you know going back to the beginning I'm going to read you a quote out of a book\nI heard your issue this was going to be a success story and and this was a student loan or had to say she said nothing happens fast many stories have surrounded the growth of big business certainly my big my big business and most of them are miss\nThe most of the city is midst of all is the one the promises magic formula is an instant success it doesn't happen that way I cried more than I ate there was constant work\nConstant attention to detail last hours of sleep worries ... friends and family didn't let a day go by without discouraging much do you remember her telling you any of these stories are experiencing on yeah\nYes and the beginning I'm One of the great stories that Leonard likes to tell us how the lawyer and the account and and the friends and family discourage them\nFrom going forward and um so what he says his lawyers make good lawyers accountants make good accountants but if you want to be in business\nWhat you're doing you stick with it\nAnd you persevere and it will happen\nYes and you know that's really great advice or both or if you're just tuning in we're visiting with ... senior corporate vice president will be on the order companies and she's she's sharing with us the story really of the beginning of the state Law Order company she was there really from the very first few years\nAnd uh this is truly has been a story from everything I can tell when my research Evelyn I'm ... you were a very integral part of the growing you this business so we get back from a break coming up we're going to talk about what you did as a matter of fact\nEstee lifted that you had a number of first you introduced to the company but right before my one question is are we going to buy the miniature before we take a break one um how did you finally decided to work for the company because I Believe you're a teacher first correct\nI was a teacher and what happened is that I was married and let it and I wanted to start a family\nRight away and I was very fortunate and I was able to conceive quickly and um so about two months after we were married I discovered that I was pregnant and\nAt that time they wouldn't know vaccines for the ... health and the doctor said there's no way that you're going to go back to school\nSo I'm I was very upset because I had never not gone to school as a student or as a teacher and so um what I said to let it was when I\nUm during this period why don't I developed the first training um manual Rick kill us for the beauty advisors and teach the people who are traveling in the field how to teach the

I think that we're dealing together and you had to focus on that team our and then it kind of how you compromise or how you negotiate or an an accounting at that so I Would say just keep your eye on that I don't go that both want to be happy with what you've got\nAbsolutely Jason how about you\nSo I totally agree with that and this is a little related but it's also different you have to\nMake sure that you both have put the project that you're working on together on an equal level of priority and I would say that was the most challenging thing for Gemini because Gen\nAt times was definitely prioritizing the project over me because Gen builds book writing into her day whereas for me I often had to fit it into the evenings mornings the weekends and sometimes I Would have other projects and so it's just so much you'd be frustrated that I wasn't prioritizing is the way that she\nWas and I totally appreciate that and understand that and that can really fray at a relationship you need to make sure that you are\nBoth signaling to each other that the project is at the same level priority that one is not dragging the other because that is where a lot of resentment will build ...\n... you know I've learned over the years have you know having children I Know you guys have one and one on the way and congratulations for that and every time you reach Hanks yeah these um\nYou know I guess the bottom of one step is the top of another step you know what I'm saying right so you have to kind of keep changing and evolving\nAnd so I think that you know gosh at this stage of my life what I really learned with my wife\nIs I really have to research in my heart what love is because at a certain point you've kind of done everything you've been there and you've done that and you've explored that but it really boils down to what love is and it it really has a lot to do with patience kindness thoughtfulness\nAnd so I I just think that the the same stuff has to be woven into the relationship in business when you're working with somebody because when you were in your family you could say go get me this but you would never just say go get me this\nTo your employee you would say would you mind grabbing that for me please or would you please do this so what I've had to learn how to do is to really relate to my children and my spouse in my friends more like a in a more professional way because I think we take advantage of our families\nOften in business any thoughts on that Jason\nYeah that's a really great insight I totally agree you can\nYou can take for granted the person who is closest to you and in fact what you need to do is you need to nurture that relationship the most right because that is the one that one is going to be the longest lasting and also it was is the most complicated\nAnd you can't just start treating it like it's a like it's a commodity that just happens to be available to us that we we definitely confused that and that really goes back to what Jim was talking about right and they make sure that you remember and you keep reminding yourself that you share a goal\nThat while you're doing it yeah absolutely now is there a Web site for the book the Mr nice guy\nYeah so you can go to this day nice guy novel dot com and you can buy it at you know for that Web site at any major retailer were books I saw\nThem jazz Amazon virgin oval uh audible we did we did an audio book that was that was really interesting recording us all of the ...\nOf this show oh my God you sound I Love I Love this little side us all and it it was must have just been absolutely a of a fun project for both of you uh\nJennifer Miller Jason ...

and the ultimate effects of combined aging\n[noise]\nWell it is entrepreneur weekly I'm Alan sailor having a good time talking about the compatibility of working with your spouse or significant other family member or whatever whatever that's significant other is um or whoever they are\nJust much easier he wrote a book the couples guide to financial compatibility\nAnd uh it's a big subject these days because I think more and more entrepreneur or a husband and wife team that I met some that I Am man I'm so jealous of their relationship and look at editor in chief Jason Pfeifer and his wife Jen\nYou know their relationship got better through writing the novel Mr nice guy the fact is they actually\nCloser now it's taken me a long time but\nJust the thing that I've learned recently is that maybe I did not have enough proper respect I had certain things that were just\nAssumed to be that her husband and wife team that has been the bars and I wasn't giving enough proper respect my wife so I'm really trying hard right now to honor her and that way but I Would love to get you to give us some great advice from your book and just from your life's experiences\nWill say my wife Kendra helped me write the book as well and I think so it's really a a journey of ours and what we've done from financial side of things that we really partner in the process she was my editor behind the scenes and she gave me a lot of great insight into I think what's happened with us\nBut also she's intimately involved in our farm and and really how we operate if a company so I think [noise]\nGuinea two couples and working together and\nUnderstanding first of all clarity and understanding when you're in the work environment and when you're not in the work environment I Am a huge proponent work life balance\nAnd I think sometimes when you're working together that can just get it can get mixed up in ... and you have your work at um but yeah you're arguing with your spouse or something that's really more of a family matter\nAnd you're not you're not being distinctive and separating and sometimes it's hard with a lot of people working out of their homes more and more remotely it's easier to not draw the line I really think it's important\nWhen I leave the office to put on my dad and my spouse hat and respect that versus taking work home with me\nThat's one avenue that I Would talk to a lot of people I was just really having communication as to what what that means to both parties what what is your time it was her time involved and that it's our time involved when it comes to our business if all working together and then also our relationship and and really understanding how to separate those\nBy the way I notice here I'm just flipping through here ego is the enemy of humility keep it real talked about that\n[noise] yeah I use my employees and and we had a lot of successes affirmed we've WON Awards and and it was great you know getting up to and wrote the book and do a lot of TV work and and it can build your ego up in a way that's not healthy and I think our industry and the financial planning world is it's\nIn a way that's not healthy and I think our industry in the financial planning world is it's the same thing it can build people up and build their egos up to a point where it's not healthy so I spend a lot of time\nTalking charred visors coaching and training the eagle can be your enemy if you're not careful about what your what your how you are and how you act with your clients with your spouse put your hand with anybody here in Iraq with and I think when you exercise\nHumility it actually resonates even better with your clients and opens up more opportunities for introductions and referrals so we really spend a lotta time\nBreaking apart because our industry really does a poor job and that and I and I spend a lot of time talking about not letting ego take over because it's easy to do yeah\nHere's another one creative positive productive environment need to be selfless rather than selfish and it's interesting as we talk about this I remember seeing a man talked to his wife\nAnd he talked down to her and I did not like that at all and then my wife came to me one day and she said you know you talked down to me and I remember feeling the shock of pain in my heart because\nI had seen it before and it it was not a good positive protective environment for the employees or your family members to see that so maybe you could riff on that from it\nBecause you around for recognizing and listening to her and I think her being able to bring it up to you and I think that's where that communication is so important and whether it's a spouse or an employee relationship your ability to listen to somebody when they have something maybe that you don't want to hear\nAnd that you if you think about success I guess argue it is that if you're selfish it can go away real quickly if you're selfless and you're always thinking about what's the best interest for my clients what's the best interest for my employees or what's the best interest for my family that's a long term winner\nRight well it's funny because I was just looking I posted something because there's so much pressure on us these days\nAnd I just recently posted something I Wish I could find or maybe I'll find it during the commercial break about when you're under pressure you know pressure turns a lump of coal into a diamond only if\nIt is handled properly and that really boils down to the same thing with life and business\nYou can either take pressure and take it out on your family and your employees and people around you which destroys your business or you can take that pressure deal with it properly and turn that pressure into a dime another word you shine\nAnd you become much more valuable to dealing with the pressure properly so technically how we deal with each day of our life and every situation that happens in our lives\nYou know makes us

... has some thoughts about Romney Mac has a long history of working in travel public relations and strategic planning for travel clients\nIs president of the perception that Tom ... and he recently wrote a piece for travel weekly suggesting that Labor Day just doesn't fall on the right day where they will show nice to have you here\nThanks for having me lead to talk\nSo the first thing I learned from your piece was there in Nineteen Seventy one something called the uniform Monday holiday act in a nutshell was passed in a nutshell what is that after what was that act\nWell it's a it was an access Nineteen Seventy one when Congress decided to move a bunch of holidays and some of us are older old enough to remember when\nWashington's Birthday Lincoln's Birthday Columbus Day I'm we're on actual days around they think Seventy one all the holidays or moved to Mondays to create three day weekends in\nTheory to drive retail sales and and this is it also so people can take longer vacations stuff we at the ... seventies kick or sort of ... cruisers traveling around it was to drive the economy and Dr visitation\nOr you say that having Labor Day and the first Monday in September as it has been since Nineteen Seventy one doesn't make economic sense for a lot of reasons name a couple of army with\nOkay so some days like this July Fourth is on July Fourth Thanksgiving is always been traditionally a harvest festival so it's always in November\nBut Labor Day is arbitrary it doesn't celebrate a specific date or action or cause it it basically pays homage to a movement and the ... not near may so Labor Day it was chosen to be the first Monday of September\nThe problem is what it really has become instead of celebrating organized labor for most of us including me it means summer's over and if you have a kid especially if you're in the north east school begins\nThe irony is that if you're in most of the country school of colleges and grammar schools they are now going back in the middle of August so Labor Day just is when we shut everything down\nAnd summer isn't over in most parts of the United states and the first week of Monday in September generally speaking\nTrue I mean according to mother nature's summer doesn't end till the equinox on September twenty first and I'll give you very brief example of that I live in New Jersey and two or three years ago it was over a hundred degree share on Labor Day\nAnd on Tuesday or the lifeguards went home peaches shut down everything closed the governor actually had to order the state beaches reopen and it's a higher lifeguards so people in the state it gets to the beach because of the it was a leaf hot because it was so summer [laughter]\nYou get to the beach because of the it was a leaf hot because it was so summer\nSo if you were a number of the United states you suggest we move Labor Day to the third Monday in September but one of your main\nArguments Renee is that uh it would be an economic boost really handle that fifty seconds left but you're single for fourteen day period about thirty nine billion dollars in direct spending ugly taxes in trickle down benefits would result bikes ending Labor Day and having people stay on the job\nIt has to lose by trying to move the day or two weeks according to us travel you took that thirty nine billion dollars it's talking about hundreds of thousands of jobs\nAnd instead of having a holiday that effectively shuts down one of the country's largest industries travel could actually keep it moving for another two weeks two or three weeks long weekends people would\nBe happier and country would probably be economically better off there's there's no real downsides of this\nWhere they make is president of perception here with a interesting idea pushing a Labor Day back to the or\nA third week of September Rene thank you for\nNothing that into our heads I receive something bucks thank you very much they have the opposite
