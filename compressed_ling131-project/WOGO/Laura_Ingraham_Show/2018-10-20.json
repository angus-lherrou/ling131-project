hundred and twelve thousand miles loses all those power are better pick up a rebuild over New York which I did loaded up my tools went up to change on the side of the world\nWe won't tell you how many Youtube videos to watch to tell you how to get that Alternator out of that car without removing the motor mounts willing to the uncertain but it can be done um\nPut the new Alternator ... and I and in fact I realize I don't have the tools with me everything I Need so we have a choice to his house I work in pouring rain gets the old alma mater out get them in winning and put all the crap back in ... excuse\nMe the components back young you started out and charging system failure the digital dash indicators thing charging system failure\nOh I've already ruined the afternoon it's pouring rain I give up but I decided after reading on the Internet I take the battery out checking homeless man give it a good charge overnight next morning and go back to where he bought the alternate or have them tell us the battery make sure it's good and it's all a church [noise] go back to my son's\nWithin ten I Will drive at fifty miles home get it in my garage where all my equipment is and see what I can do with it\nSo I put another uh alternate around because I've been on the Internet and everyone says about this whole I'm driving at home I'm driving at home\nIt goes through a whole series your abs system does is pale your traction control system has failed your just about everything has failed then I lose the dash to the radio everything\nAnd it'll come back on on and off\nAnd I don't lose the engine but I lose\nEverything else\nThe thirty first Alternator re manufactured I put on a I discovered while they actually was charging I was\nGoing through the information and console and on the way home Lincoln limping homework or thought Olympic homework but\nThat was running about their tune six Thirteen age I'd turn the lights lowers the air on withhold Thirteen sex or Thirteen at it and that's what the science charging\nSo I'm after spending a lot of time\nIt really boils down to substitute another re manufactured Alternator poor rebuilds or not uncommon\nCircle get another one from them but that money on\nSame symptoms only now when I went down the road voltage is fourteen two to four to six weeks or Springfield I probably should be anyway um\nAnd the dash is we don't lose on our lights engages in\nBlowers anymore but we still have a series of four or five warnings okay that's kinda where we're at a last thing I'll tell you as I finally took it to my local guy who has a very good test equipment all well good shop\nIt's ... it's about a hundred and thirty bucks the first thing they did was clip off the double prong conductor on the altar air so that is often a source of problems and they found they save time and money for their customers in themselves they they replace that on these old vehicles before they weren't any diagnostics\n... how did we miss yup yup\nThey put the original GM connected with the special connector sealed up\nAnd verify that the park control module piece yeah over under the or on the\nOther side of the car which also has a role in moderating in old age I'm ... and all that surgery was good so\nThe cars running greatest charging great but he's getting constant warning signals and now is a warning for ... or ... not shut all the way it's going constantly um\nBut it is charging and I've been on the Internet and this was not uncommon I found dozens and dozens of his but I haven't found the answers to what's causing it\nAnd everybody says some different all in there [laughter] okay but first discussing you know the the the the the guy who took it to sound like you did a great job\nIf the generator has a feels circuit control so yeah and that's what controls ultimate output\nBy changing the voltage on the field if it has a a control circuit failure the ultimate of defaults to an open voltage of Thirteen point eight

Smith and sometimes she can give you a little bit of whiplash\nOn all the gear is perfectly fine\nThere's no or the other issue is just a slight the way\nAnd uh I've had the transmission all changed and that night had there and all changed Annette\n... have been changed right when I first\nAnd I had never end all changed and that\nSort of been changed right when I first bought it\nOkay and I had I had already I mean your body as or I'd I'd want to tell me that you need a whole new replacement transmission\nNow um I'd like to Alan expert opinion\nAnd that's why I call okay well\nYou know I was I'll start just right up and say I'm not an automatic transmission specialist but if the transmission works good\nIn the fluid and you've had the flu a change now the food that came out was it a a good color was burnt looking\nGood color\nYou try to fall by the way we do\nIt's a trio drive\nIt's a ... okay yeah\nSo you know [noise] it's intermittent that you have ... you know whether it comes on way too hard hits real hard that could be a valve and about body um\nAnd I just how intimate and is it\nUm it can get\nAt first I thought it was just because it was hot outside 'cause we had a extremely hot summer this year right but it it it shifted fine and the drive um I Try and starting out every year and it didn't matter in just a slight boy but then uh\nThen I thought you know maybe it's when it's cold and just\nThere too and it don't matter temp why is it didn't matter if the translation oil was warm or cold and yes there are men\nOkay\nWell you know when you have an intimate and problem [noise] um\nThat thing takes I'm Mark on five\nVoted yes [noise] [noise]\nYou'd probably need of our body and I'm that's what I'm going to guess um\nThe gentleman that checked it out [noise] that wants to put a whole transmission and then my question would be why if it works once you get through that initial where it applies hard and the shift fine and the flu and colors good that tells you most of the hydraulic circuitry working in the friction materials are good\nAnd if the transmission is working good and it's only in the ... you know let's just say if there was something electronic\nAnd they changed the whole transmissions or you know Fifteen hundred two thousand dollars they could still have the same problem with what you're going to do then is you know so I think you know with our bodies could be the problem and it's that mileage and yet here I mean it's not high mileage and those trucks are good they go for a long time it's one of the best little pickups on the market\nBut I Would probably opt to put a valve audience but before I did that is something you can do go to your local rally auto parts store any good parts that are close to you [noise] excuse me get some loop guard automatic transmission protecting its in a written silver bottle\nIt's about eleven ounces I thinks that don't over fills your transmission you might need to pull a little bit of hope by side from some from the ... to put this in there and driving the truck given you know a hundred miles or so a driving [noise] and see if that reduces the opportunity for this thing to his slamming hard\nAnd if it does you know for for ten bucks or whatever this bottle Carswell bucks [noise] you fix your truck and you're in good shape ... doesn't fix anything is broken patrol making automatic transmission work a lot better 'cause it treats the fluid\nIt makes the fluid better and that's what you want to do and how does that takes care of it your goals and if it doesn't take care of it I Would opt to go back to the guy that recommended of our body and investment of our body for the transmission and you'll probably in good shape\nOkay is is that those are issues\nOr the over in in the port Senate or did they have issues warping in those years\nNow they had a pretty good transmission than the an automatic transmissions [noise] excuse me have got issues with you know the seals
