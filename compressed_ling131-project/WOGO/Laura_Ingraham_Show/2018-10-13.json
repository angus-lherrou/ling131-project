course by our friendship with filters explore new products and find your filter it works filters dot com for morning Sam good morning good morning everybody of thanks for joining us today yeah well we have a very special just said this morning we have an interview with Bob Walden\nAnd he has some car star collusion centers in car star\nIs the largest network of collusion repair professionals in North America as foreign locations in the United states and Canada Bob welcome to the show good morning\nGood morning good morning thanks for having me guys\nAre pleasures so let's talk a little bit of all kinds of our listeners can get a grip on it when when you have a collision your car gets damaged what'd you do it yourself or somebody runs ... there's a lot of questions that comes up so what's your drivers look for when choosing the collision repair shop\nWell there are many things to look for Sam and I'm I guess I could start off with a um we really want to get your car fixed so that's probably the most important and then when you finally do decide how do you decide I should say\nSo customer referrals um recommendations by your insurance company maybe the dealership or maybe somebody in your family or your neighbor probably is already been there once so trying to look around and getting referrals probably one of the best things you can do\nAbsolutely so so once you make this decision okay we're going to go to Bob in cars time one of the things to consider before the repair process actually starts\nWell um I think time upfront with the with the customer when you when you\nUm I think time up front with the with the customer when you when you bring vehicle in your chances are you're probably in an accident every seven years that's the average so you're not familiar with the process and if it is your fault sometimes\nIt's a little embarrassing um so you go in there and your little vulnerable so you want to make sure that you're comfortable bringing your vehicle and\nFor that purpose just mentioned but also these costs today as you know they're not cheap so when you're spending you know twenty thirty forty fifty thousand dollars or more on a vehicle you want to make sure that it's right so you want to also make sure that you're comfortable so if you can\nMake sure you've got the high up front with the uh the appraiser from the auto body shop\nTo go over with you to explain what's gonna happen during the process\nOkay so now the cars fixed as hopefully process you know properly so when you pick up your vehicle after the repair it's not a quick process line is that\nWell again I'm\nWhen you'd like I just mentioned you spent time up front explaining what's gonna happen well\nHave a total back to the location that repetitive wherever you go some place it's a national organization that has a nationwide warranty or whether it be the dealership replacement transmissions or whatever you can take it to the local dealer or somebody in that organization and they can take care of your problem\nWhile you're on a state and that's a great way to go\nSo you got three locations that makes you a busy man\nA seven days busier than others yes [laughter]\nWell listen I'm very familiar with cars now you guys are always have to look for a car certified folks and and you meet all the criteria and of course I think one of the best reference places is the insurance company because they know the people that deliver the right product\nOn time that's the other thing you know when you say it's been two weeks three weeks to fix the vehicle and people in a rental car and stuff they're dying to get their vehicle back and they don't want to hear in a month or still gonna be another week they don't want to hear that the insurance company hold your feet to the fire also for that time don't they\nYes they do and that's what we call psycho pine so they um you know again there is a formula like anything else in life but if we have a um a vehicle that has said forty hours worth of repair that between the body the paint mechanical that adds up to forty\nThan they were looking at roughly four hours a day that we can actually work on that vehicle and that's the that's the average amount of time\nYes some days that we have more time on it but then the we have the Saturday Sundays and the holidays and everything comes into consideration that's what we call these the keys so we got the vehicle off on a a a Thursday Afternoon\nThey will at three o'clock in the afternoon that's still one day 'cause we received the keys that day so then you know friday and the Iraq for the weekend you might even have a holiday on Monday but so right four hours a day of a touch ties and that's how it would be judged\nWell that's great well you're going to do a great job and William sure appreciate you coming on December garage this morning and given as your insight and I hope people learned a lot again the website is cars star dot\nCom and I'll come and see you in Massachusetts Caroline up and like I says well we'll lobster\n[laughter] All right thank you very much I have a great weekend\nThat get you too bye guys by by\nAll righty so if you're going to college and my parents and you needed done make sure you go to a good shot but look at car star consider them insurance companies like um they do a great job you get a nationwide warranty then they got over four hundred locations in the United states and Canada so it's a big operation seemed to use you use collision China's you\nGot a guy that that uh takes as you get your Cadillac painted yes cicadas Sam\nPoor guy had a heart attack but the gold fire bird that we have been building for four years now is finally done and this was supposed to come to me on friday but he got ... a lost and traffic and I had to go to a football game at five o'clock so I had to close early but it is completed\nMy car is about I'd say thirty five percent completed he's working on some some metal around the glass and he's going to be taking care of that but now this gold one has done in mind will become concentrated on a hundred percent so we'll go there\n... years and years of life which would be good

another John Deere Jesse\n... who knows it starts obviously some kind of a chance to do with the belly more and um but it just looks mean that would be making loans cutting lawns fun mhm absolutely a lotta people commented on that you know put a picture of our new rescue dog up there and we called her angel how old is she\nShe is so wonderful she so smart\nShe's so sweet she was found in the woods a gentleman we know that has a hundred and forty eight 'cause he's a hunter any as a hunting cabin that's off the grid doesn't even have power\nAnd he he's about hunter hunting for the bow and arrow when he hunts Darren turkey and the dog showed up at his cabin starving rib cage show in just a puppy so he you know took care of it fed it and so on but he couldn't take it home to his home um he has already has animals there and uh I think he's a limit\nSo the dog was hanging around the cabin and the you know when it comes to this cabin once or twice a week\nAnd he wouldn't go there more often or just to make sure she had food and water and so on but he was afraid that she would be you know eating by coyote because there's a lot of coyotes loose up here\nBecause we have so much livestock you know you always find dead deer and turkeys that have been ... by the ... so anyway there was no room at the animal shelter the animal shelter is fall\nSo we said well we'll take her and see if we get our homeless you this week we had her spade\nHad all his shots and she's just doing great she's a smart as a whip and I take them out every morning and afternoon at night and she does like clockwork does her business in the woods or she had not done anything on the patio or in a kennel\nReally beautiful dogs she'll make somebody a great dog she reminds me I have a yeah yes she looks a lot like either yeah in all this but the one of the the ball God I don't know what it is with these black dog just stars got a little blue he or she is a mix a lab but I think she's got some blue hill or in a shit about twenty pounds\nAnd just as funny as can be so Eva anyway with\nHer not to be a great dog inch with her Doberman looking colors she scares folks and she has a mean bark and she's really a a got settled in into her new home and she's been a well trained now and she listens and doesn't run off and stuff like that\nSo it's very good if I had to live with you I'd have a million bucks to [laughter] she had a busy week\nYeah very busy week um a lot of cars on records and it's clear Sam because I tell everybody the cooling systems fail when that starts to get cool and that that's what's happened everything just shrinks and all the gaps open up and everything failed\nSo we replace a lot of cooling fans this year of this week and last week and a lot of ratings because when the fan goes out the radiator bus and uh you know it's too late when the temperature gauge is already up\nThis is all about preventive maintenance isn't it yeah absolutely and that's what the ... council talks about all the time\nBefore you go on a trip before you do any of these when the seasons change heavy car service and um you know it's funny I got an email from a gentleman that said he was in some kind of a a salvage store that has you know they get and runs and violence and stuff\nAnd he got a deal on ...\nAnd he has a a twenty sixteen GMC with a five point three in it and he got\nJugs of ...

well camp diamond in your engine which according to the all data information based on you have any code\nUm you have variable camp timing and it's got an actor waiter which screws him to the front of the ... and that's in electro hydraulic thing but the hydraulic passages of dirty poor you know slugs up\nThen the variable Valentine's isn't going to function properly you're going to get ... you know excess where and eventually get a check in July and then you need engine repair so it's a good question is a good quality which filter\nAnd the oil is recommended for that and you don't want to very off of the and say you grade or the AP I service classification of what the engine requires and if you do that on a regular basis for photosynthetic five thousand miles changes you'll be in good shape\nYup that car still should have a fuel filter I Would check and make sure you do have one spot\nYep that car still should have been a fuel filter would check and make sure you do have one spark plugs in wires every Seventy thousand um check your rear main ceiling oil paying those usually around a hundred and Seventy two hundred and twenty thousand um\nHow many miles around your truck them\nAh I think about a hundred and ten ...\nOh you got to say it's just broken\nA Ninety four when they got flooded luckily yeah we get more [noise]\nWe get more of that we didn't get any level that last on but it was well planned this\nLab for you good views the tone of your viewpoint smokers what's going on with them as well\nLast book before replaces aggravating Alternator\nBut I Know it's an alternate up kind of determine that but I was talking to another guy it was a mechanic and he said that that often either had like a fuse somewhere\nI guess a near the frame that Rand underneath the car somewhere on their the crime that he had it uh it replace one and they would like some kind of a few years and I don't know whether\nYou know here's how she can find out whether that's the case or I\nWill say oh he's a little bit of war I we work on a lot of focus as we just worked on one um Monday and we didn't notice any sort of fused but he's probably thinking maybe the a heavy red wire is fused going from the batteries bill later and they are all fused most of them live into fused block is going to be heavy yeah fuse\nUm you can easily check continuity um with the battery power on cable positive table over to the heavy connector or on the off and then it just to make sure the fuses goods you could even look for the ... needed fused with your manual and make sure that it is located and is good before you condemn Alternator\nOr because I mean that's such an aggravating out tonight or to get the I just want to make because I just I had to put it out for a year\n[laughter] sounds like me and my tire rotations at\nA job I made the determination that often at all [laughter] if you got a minute like ask another question about another vehicle absolutely\nThe the eighty eight yeah for the F for fifty super dating that's got seven point three when I bought the vehicle to get it it just ... I don't know if it could uh uh uh an injector pa problem there and uh\nI've had the vehicle for several years but it's it's not ... I'm going to a foot fuel and that container and tried to sit and jet pump withdrawal it out of a container to try to eliminate the fuel pop\nAnd it didn't pull it out of the uh of of the bucket and it was pumping fuel I mean is pumping peel ... I mean you could see where I'm from ... to the to the rail but it's not getting passed I mean uh I guess to the injectable but that's not coming from the ... or ...\nYou know it's not coming out of the engender pop\n'em and I there was also like a little so annoyed on the ... the top of another guy told me the check and that's still annoyed again I guess there's some kind of fuel cell annoyed that from happening and I guess can get stuff or whatever or or burn out and uh\nHe told me the check check that and so I just you know with them and yet about fifty thousand miles on it is is it six set a hike is stored I'm less effective both to go without even at fifty\nThousand of that seven point three was a workhorse and has had they had really very few problems with the with the problem [noise] and if somebody did put a good job on it and that's the key they put a good pump on some use out of Iraq\nBut to put a good component that should be okay the few someone always do some problems but you know those are you will you inject to zero they're hydraulic\nThey work on a high pressure oil pressure so what's critical is up in the valley there's a high pressure oil pumped to turn the inject it was on and off\nEven if they're getting fewer if they don't trigger if they don't open you won't get any fuel into the engine\nSo much critical that the oil will be the hey the correct oil the correct oil filter and the right amount of oil and that that needs to be All right before those are the injection pump to supply pressure to the doctors and and also the hydraulics open and close the injector\nThat's why they call them ... or ... unit electronically control\nSo I'm\nVehicles only half of the vehicle has a hundred and fifty eight thousand miles on it and yeah and even though it's an eighty eight I thought that you know I mean they're probably not even a good break in period I wouldn't imagine on that mode and that's why I was\nAnd I did the guy that I got it for sure that they use the I Know they use the dealership till they ran a construction company and they took her to get care of their equipment like that's why we're just trying to find out what go out\nBefore I replace it and then jet or pop\nBefore I play soccer and then jet or ... you know what were\nYou before you go to spend the money you get somebody who knows those trucks\nTo do a good diagnosis on it because you're going to find out as it could be something like I said with a high pressure oil company and directors um if there's a lot of things that can be you know the valve cover gas could have the wiring to inject present them sometimes those fail\nAnd you know it'd be crazy to spend the money to put a put a pumping it when he got a bad ah wiring city injections\nSo those are some of the thing that fail on that particular injured so really and truly spend the money what a good Ford technician that knows the seven point three let them diagnosed it properly and um you know\nUh the thing is going to turn over a good speech till you're going to have both\nSo I don't know four or five hundred rpm cranking for that oil pressure\nBe up to walk ... yeah yeah but any batteries in it and uh you know you had a spin and over again that I just it's just not\nCompeting in the field and you can hear the Illinois state and I just I'm just trying to figure out what uh\nWhat was so annoyed by quick but doesn't necessarily mean it's open and close and and that's how they shut down they shut the fuel off to them because you know a diesel doesn't have any spark ignition\nAnd when they're running a you know in the early days before the orange juice on annoyed\nThat what the caller stuffer box and they had a lever under the dash on all these rules and you would pull that off the air supply off to the engine otherwise they just run away with themselves so I mean the diesel as long as you feed it Aaron ... little Gulf harder and fast and some of the explosions\nAnd my and the guy to develop the diesel engine collect CDs all okay he actually almost got killed because he was when he was experimenting with a diesel engine if God's it ran so hard and so fast in the end the test room where he was the thing that exploded and\nBroke him into a bunch of little pieces he was in the hospital for a long time\nBefore he recovered and he went back to work and develop the engine but um you know these these just have somebody who knows what they're doing otherwise you're gonna spend a lot of money for nothing and getting back to the ... by getting back to your focus Sam said you want to check the power to the state or and so on or to the state of feet\nBut don't forget that is not just a battery in an alternate or in in some wiring on everything on that alternate is controlled\nBy the PC him the computer it senses the battery voltage it senses that uses even use it then take charge temperature sensor to know what the temperature is under the hood so it can it can adjust the charge of port\nAnd um you know the ... the computer controls that so if you put an alternate on and so those in charge make sure the connection back or they often is good make sure you got battery voltage to the heavy we're going to the Alternator\nAnd that's like Sam so that's probably fused someplace that might be usable link for it likes those\nBut also you need to put a Ford scanned tool on it\nAnd go see what the PC I miss doing because the PC um turns everything on and off the justice it I mean it won't even adjust the I don't know if it looks at the battery in the battery voltage a little low the PC animal step the I'd love to turn the generator faster the ultimate faster\nSo there's a lot going at it\nWhat I Want an addict when I had a good battery in it and I I can get up and down there to stay but then it would just like you got out that way you know and then but then when I get back it was like the battery washed or the battery was just drained and uh\nThey check it with the voltage just since the early ... jets and we have to go to a break but get someone to diagnose it through those spends a lot of money\nAnd he'll be a good chance especially that's set up for fifty that's a good truck with seven three and a good luck with that we're going to take a quick break we come back we'll go to Jason the Newbery about twenty five

only a member of the motor trends staff but also the editor in chief of truck trend magazine\nNowadays you can find them is the number one guy the editor in chief that cars dot com and the gentleman's name is Mark Williams mark welcome to the show how you doing\n[noise] thank you Bob it's always great to hear a voice or ... any chance I get to talk about pickup truck I Will I Will bend over backwards but this isn't there should be a lot of fun\nAbsolutely and we begin by talking about something I remember we talked about last year but it just seems to be growing more and more on the important skills for truck makers and for the media and that's the stakes here are taxes\nYeah it's a it's a huge show in fact it's a fair that runs for almost a month I think it's a little over three weeks and then it but uh but a significant component of\nMark off all the big truck manufacturers bring these dry\nBut just about every single truck they make in their line up on display for the people that come to the fair and it must be it must be an incredible I I think the last numbers that I saw\nPut it far and above Ninety percent of all auto show attendance so so it's a wide spectacularly focus group of people obviously Texas at Dallas area in particular\nVery big pickup truck market and they a lot of pickup trucks fans there so they essentially have a a an an audience to show what the best technology invest new trucks they have to offer\nTo too I think millions of people end up coming through there over the course of that fear\nAbsolutely and the media these days the manufacturers are very selective in where they unveil new product does it cost an awful lot of money to do in North American or world debut it one of the big shows like Los\nIf you want to do with the

as auto world your host mom long\n\nGreen radio\nLive dot com on Bob long along with the editor in chief of pickup trucks dot com and before we taught to Mark Williams about\nThe upcoming new Ford Ranger\nMark we shine the spotlight here a little bit on pickup trucks dot com till our listeners perhaps haven't had the chance to check you know what they can expect and what kind of goodies you got up there now and maybe into both stuff coming around the corner\n[noise] well a lot of the stuff that we have right now is just like we mentioned directly from the state for Texas one of the bigger pieces of news is that Toyota a on their both of their pickup trucks that Tacoma and\nThe tundra they're offering a brand new trimming package and it's it's relatively a higher value so it's not very expensive and has a very cool look they're calling it the execs coma and a aspects tundra and essentially kind of\nIt kind of delivers that that's similar midnight or a blackout theme that is so popular nowadays but it offers a ton of stuff on both vehicles\nThat standard equipment and pretty much everything that Toyota is selling now\nHas a more safety equipment and just about any other factors so that that's one thing that's a very big deal on our site right now it's getting a lot of reaction from our readers the other thing is we just had the uh sales numbers come out for the end of September\nWhich is interesting only because General Motors has decided\nSeveral months ago and I'm I'm sure you heard about this than and saw this and it didn't register very well with a mainstream media but but for us on the pickup truck side of the world\nIt it made a huge impact General Motors stop reporting there's sales numbers for their entire lineup so cars trucks SUVs crossovers band everything based stopped reporting on a monthly basis\nAnd only report their sales numbers on a quarterly basis\nSo the September sales is essentially the end of quarter number three for two thousand Eighteen so we got all the numbers from General Motors as well as all the other manufacturers that still do report\nOn a monthly timetable so we were able to see and compare how all the manufacturers are doing\nAnd they're relatively very little change but it looks like I'm GM is trying to become more efficient and focused in where they're selling their vehicles and not selling as many fleet vehicles which they don't\nSell for a significant profit and they're trying to push more and more of their vehicles on the retail side at their dealerships where they make the most profits and it looks like they're making a lot of money and they're making it work\nAbout four to spill out selling everybody with the F series even even if you add in ... actually that's not true if you if you combine the GMC Canyon and the ... and a Chevy colorado along with the Chevy Silverado GMC\nSierra talk numbers General Motors sells more pickup trucks on a monthly and quarterly and and most likely by the end of the year as well basis\nOr that they're going to be the number one pick up truck feller by the end of the year so they're they're doing good things there and they're selling a lot of pickup truck so\nThat that big news for us so if if you're not that interested in that kind of games and you know maybe you wouldn't be that as excited or kicked out is that it is I Am but but ... it's got to come right down to the wire we're going to see how close or you get to GM by year end\nAnd it certainly has been a good year for the auto manufacturers not the record years that we've seen in recent times but it is once again the pick of trail pickup truck sales that are driving\nThe or the economy here they're the ones that are going out the door with the sticker on them\nYeah you're absolutely right it's kind of the um I wouldn't call it a dirty little secret but it's definitely a well kept secret that that literally companies like for like General Motors\nLike FDA if they didn't have their half ton pickup trucks or or their full size pickup truck sales\nThose companies could not exist they wouldn't have enough money to keep the doors open the cars aren't selling sedans I mean even Ford has made the announcement are going to stop\nSelling sedans and they're going to focus on crossovers pickup trucks than SUVs 'cause that's where the money is so if I mean if you took away F. one fifty sales or took away Silverado halftime or ram halftime sales from their parents companies those companies would crumble because those vehicles\nMaking the profits that are keeping subsidizing\nBecause those vehicles are making the profits that are keeping him subsidize the\nOther a name played for those companies it's a it's a spectacularly huge an important issue to have a good selling pickup truck in your portfolio right now\nI'm because if you don't you better have some great selling civic\nOr a court or ... or ... that can sell hundreds of thousands a year but they're not making the profits that have a fully loaded Ford F. one fifty is or a fully loaded high countries Silverado half and because of those a high price tags and those\nTen twelve or Fifteen thousand dollar profit margins that those pickup trucks out those manufacturers are benefiting wow but I I mean but if those cells start nose diving I think we're going to see an industry going through some huge contractions\nYeah that's quite the market when you stop and think about it ten to twelve thousand dollars per unit that one did they yeah it's a matter of fact she was just love the trucks\nThere's quite too that's true I mean you know how much\nThey cost you can get a fully loaded ... truck first sixty or Seventy thousand dollars and if you're looking at our one son that's going to be telling you know a magnificent trailer you can get those things decked out to eighty or Ninety thousand dollars\nAmazing absolutely amazing or telephone number is eight five five six zero four to six one he's five five six six zero four to six one\nThe new ranger everybody's eagerly anticipating the new ranger from Ford and I understand that we're going to actually see a raft or variant as well tell us yeah\nYeah absolutely there now there's no official statement or out that yet however they used ... this is a ranger that they sell in other global markets civically Australia South America but the in\nAustralia and uh if some of the Asian countries as well to it does incredibly well and has a wonderful markup for Ford as well too so the vehicle already this in other markets\nNow the U.S is getting the ranger to come here or drag their feet long enough but this is the return of the ranger that they've finally concluded that this mid sized segment might see some enough gross that it's going to justify bringing this back in and building it in the u._s.\nBut ... I mean it it it's like the worst kept secret in the auto industry that there is no doubt in my mind that maybe in less than a year after we see a these first Ford rangers get into dealerships which
