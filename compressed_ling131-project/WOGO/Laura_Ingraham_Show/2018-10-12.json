your reaction to Trump flipping the script will it actually result in more African American votes for Republicans or at least get them to look twice at the Republican Party\nEight five five forty or I Want to hear your reaction OK so cognac continues after he talks about the the fact that he didn't have a lot of it was basically saying you didn't have a real ... male role model at home and then he continued\nHillary everyone right but it's half hey I was just sitting making you know the guy that he can get to see my dad all the time like a guy that was it was something about like put his hat off it made me feel like Superman made\nThat was the favorite superhero and you made a Superman tape for me\nSo Donald Trump or as someone who defied the odds to win the presidency that is what Kanye West is is referencing there I Believe like anything's possible in America\nThey all said you couldn't do it they all said you your campaign would flame out they said you would get transpire Jeb Bush they said that ah they're Hillary was then going to destroy you it was going to be a member of the other productions that Trump would lose and a massive landslide you remember that I Do we played 'em every night and every day\nWell all of that was false and Trump became president and Kanye West I think as a man who you know he didn't have a lot of male role models Donald Trump has been a friend for a long time it doesn't mean Donald Trump gets everything right personally we know he hasn't none of us do\nBut I think that there was something profound and what he said there the ... the Hillary campaign slogan was I'm with her and for African American men they love their moms of course a lot of these women are heroic are trying to raise kids on their own it's not easy and but they\nHe's saying and it's it's probably in today's day and age not politically correct but he doesn't care to I I wanted a male role model to follow in a ... someone who is going to bring\nMale energy to the office of the presidency Hillary slogan didn't speak to him it's just his personal opinion\nI mean you can disagree with it you can say it's well it's kind of off off base Hillary was just really smart and she would have been a bit better president how we obviously no that's not true\nBut the do you notice that Don Lemon et cetera did not actually speak about any of the substance that Conyers brought up let's keep listening to Kanye West let's listen to\nThe needs of all the other needs someone to help him and the guy them and then he's a hug more than anything calling you back away from the cameras\nDo get some help and then come back and make your case nobody if you want to be conservative if you want to support Donald Trump that is your business but as you're doing it have some sense with it make sense educate yourself oh wait a second so\nJay Z and Beyonce who were at the president's side and on speed dial I think they joke they're big policy experts and George Clooney because he testified before Congress he's the be all and end all and human rights and in Africa I mean I guess I woke\nUp okay he knows more than all the diplomats and all the people devoted their lives for this well I mean you could raise a question about that right but no one ever did they never raised the question about any of these folks and how about Miley Cyrus running from dorm room to dorm room\nKaty Perry running around college campuses ... trying to explain domestic policy to students okay these people wouldn't know a domestic policy of a bit I'm In the back side will take a break John Cornyn coming up your calls\nEight five five forty Laura we'll get to all your calls Kanye West helps tromp and the Republicans flip the script this is a unconventional moves\nAnd we'll see if it pays off it certainly is interesting don't go after\nThis is Michael ... and here with Mike stole from health markets helping folks find the right Medicare coverage that news reports say that the rates might be going down the cost of\nMany Medicare plans are decreasing this year so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best rate help markets offers a free service with access to thousands on Medicare plans plans I can eliminate you're out of pocket cost plans with zero dollar premiums and even plans I pay you back\nWhat is that people need to keep in mind with so many new option it can be confusing you can get objective help to find a plan that may cost less and cover more with what we're co pay more choices like dental vision and prescription drug coverage\nAnd the freedom to see the doctors and you don't miss out on savings you deserve our health markets Medicare assistance is free\nJustified of this best but you know at some point it it gets to the level of incitement we're not talking about free speech we're talking about inciting people to violence like Eric Holder did which is a dangerous and I don't think ah I don't think we ought to reward that at all\nNow and it seems to me that the more successful Senator Cornyn this administration is the more Congress you nights with the president on\nIssues such as this statement actually and United it's almost like it's driving the last ... into a uncontrolled frenzy and they can't stand it the better America is doing they are there more and more angry\n[noise] what was you know war the holy grail for the left as the Supreme Court and they can't stay on the idea that a President Trump has now pointed to outstanding nominees to the Supreme Court as well as our confirming a number of a larger number probably the largest at this point in the presidency\nI'm a court of appeals judges and a district judges and this is the driving them I think to uh to to this uh unattractive uh to say the least I'm sort of activism which frankly I mean do we want to turn the government over to these people after the midterm elections I don't think so\nThere was an interview with a colleague Ted Cruz's challenge or the other day Beto O'Rourke about on the confirmation of Kevin I'm going to play it and get your reaction let's listen let me get you on the record on on judge Kavanaugh would you voted\nTo confirm him I Would not have when the Supreme Court justice who believes in voting rights\nA justice who believes in a woman's right to make her own decision about her own body and have access to the health care than ensures that she can he fails more on each and every single one of those tests so the next justice to be nominated can only be confirmed if she were importantly she can meet those qualifications\n\nYour reaction to that\nClip baked do ah I Know they do pretty well and he's a he's a he's a nice enough guy but clearly he's not running for the United States Senate from Texas I'm he's out of step with the with Texas values and and this and every other important area\nMy only suspicion laws he's running for the Democratic nomination for president in twenty twenty because he's appealing to the national Democrats and the hard left\nOr who were who were uh we're seeing a or create these the sort of a mob rule\nAnd then it or what is your best take right now on the Republicans in the mid terms mean you've heard ... are very confident that the Democrats are going to swamp the Republicans in the house and Senate but how does things really look we'll start with the cruise seat\n[noise] well I think Ted's in cuts in good shape the latest Quinnipiac poll shows him nine points up but as you know this is all about turnout we know the left as angry the people that are still angry that Trump won and twenty sixteen and mid term elections we usually see down the and the turnout but\nUh I think the Kavanaugh hearings shove energized our our base and um we've seen people like governor ... in Tennessee said well he would have voted for a cabin all but I'm the truth is\nIf you are what the Democrat this mid term than we're going to jeopardize our ability to conform more federal judges and a Chuck turn the Senate over to Chuck Schumer and uh I just don't think ah ah the country is ready for that\nNo well I certainly I certainly hope not speaking at this back on account on an issue for a moment I devoted a lot of time on my show senator to discussing what next when the president if the president gets another Supreme Court pack\nThe incentive to me seems to be still there for\nThat type of circus we saw for Kavanaugh and namely there's no there's no repercussions for leaving a FBI report\nOr or a or a letter or anything confidential that's not supposed to be public there are no repercussions so given the fact that there were no repercussions at least now there hasn't been yet\nDo you think it's appropriate for the president or would you recommend that the president authorizes an FBI investigation into how this\nInformation about Dr Ford ended up leaking out to the press [noise]\nSo I have a pretty good suspicion about how it leaked out to the press has you know after Senator Feinstein sat on the SAT on the letter\nAnd then a leaked that set it to the FBI after the initial um initial hearing\nThan it was returned by the FBI to the judiciary committee's background investigation file where it was available to every senator on the Judiciary Committee so much suspicion is that uh one of the one of the Democratic senators or their staff are the ones ultimately responsible for leaking\nThe letter or um\nThose cats or a doctor forge warrior although she certainly did serve Dr Ford interest very well in the way she handled all of this but yet we're gonna we're gonna get to the bottom of this ah I think they'll probably be an ethics committee\nInvestigation and my hope is the Judiciary Committee will get to the bottom of this because this is simply unacceptable and thank goodness we didn't reward this with a\nA success and killing the nomination of of cabinet or this would be the new normal\nYeah I I agree with you senator I I just think it's so important for the country going forward that names when we need to know names we need to know who did this and we need to know the extent of the a\nCollaboration with outside groups many of them funded by the political ... of the Republicans and how that coordination occurred that means people have to preserve their emails and their text messages I I just think you know getting involved the ethics you know an ethics investigation is fine\nBut there's nothing like an FBI investigation really trace what happened who did it and someone is lying someone dying here\nWell I guess what we need to do is identify the\nI Am someone dying here\nWell I guess what we need to do is identify the what are the jurisdiction of federal district whether a federal crime was committed here uh I I hadn't really thought that much about it but perhaps there isn't that would provide the hook for an FBI investigation and if there has been\nFederal crime committed I wholeheartedly support that investigation by the FBI\nOr Senator John Cornyn uh here in the lower income show senator uh for the next uh you know three and a half weeks on this is going to be a sprint to the finish for Republicans I have the sense that the Republican Party\nIs more unified than it's been\nI don't know since when I mean it just it seemed like all hands on deck people are working together they're not back biting each other as much in Jeff Flake is is not a fan of the president's he wants a primary challenge but Marco Rubio said the president will win re election Nikki Haley saying she's going to campaign for the president twenty twenty\nOr what is your sense of the Republican unity right now\nA lot more optimistic that I've been in a long time well I mean the record of accomplishment with Republican majorities in the house the Senate is pretty darned impressive I Know the mainstream media doesn't cover a lot of the success that we've had here but\nReally this focus on the judiciary and the fact that the Democratic candidates for the Senate are not going to support President Trump's nominees this has become the crucible and which I think a\nA has United all all Republicans and people all across the political spectrum from the center right uh to the right and so I'm I'm very optimistic but we just have to keep that energy up but the fact of the matter is people like John tester who doesn't support either Gorsuch or\nA cabinet or some of the other Democrats on the\nBallot Catskill McCaskill exactly on Missouri I'm did not support President Trump's nominees and that I think is going to be the issue that's going to pick up seats force in the mid term\nSenator your reaction to the Kanye West to parents in the oval office yesterday\n[noise] I just think it's hilarious that are that the mainstream media is hyperventilating over that uh we all know that President Obama had rappers and other celebrities in the oval office during his time\nBut there is a double standard as we all know uh for this president and I just thought it was I thought it was pretty hilarious\nYeah I mean Michelle Obama invited that profane rapper common to the White House to read poetry his his his stuff is filled with every expletive on earth but he was up there reading poetry so and now with everything that's great we're reaching out with this wonderful it's authentic and meanwhile Trump has that's near west in there\nYou have to admit Senator Cornyn\nTruck makes things pretty pretty unconventional and in in kind of holds up a mirror to the Democrats does he not I\nI think so well it's just drive and he makes their heads explode and they act and all sorts of or Russian irrational ways and and\nUh we've seen that look to the judicial confirmation but we saw again yesterday on the on TV and uh I think the ... we just need to get this midterm election behind us we need to keep the house in the ... so we can continue making progress for the American people including the adding more federal judges to the bench\nOh my gosh is it the judicial branch coal equal branch of our government article three judges and we need more Trump nominees on the bench

Sorry that wasn't Martin Luther king's dream that shouldn't be the aspiration of uh people a free people\nI I and and frankly listening to the hatred the racist hatred coming from even members of Kanye West west own race it's appalling what Don Lemon said yesterday and I'm gonna play it for you um he invoked ... mother\nWhich I thought was particularly egregious listen\nWe need to take the cameras away from Tanya a and from a lot of this craziness that happens in the White House because it is not normal this was an embarrassment calling a mother is rolling over in her grave she would be terribly disturbed by this in Congress has not been the same since his mother died\nThank you Dr now he's a psychiatrist now you can plumbed the depths of Kanye West mind and heart and his grief

Khanna Thailand and other people\nThey have started to pull back the curtain and twenty five minutes yesterday 'cause I watched the whole thing I wanted to know exactly what went down and twenty five minutes caught up in that cartoon about twenty five more fake\nMhm well that's the danger here and I do think he was he was being very vulnerable in front of all those cameras and ... to ... Don lemons point CNN was running the event live to\nJust like everybody else they were desperate for every moment they were not going to miss Kanye West meeting with Donald Trump it was a big moment it was a big moment so to say take the cameras away spare me okay then you you go back to talking about you know the trade surplus in Indonesia on CNN International\nAnd we'll watch your ratings continue to crater lower than they are no\nBut I you know I see I Want more cameras I Want to see more I Want to see the other side of crazy I Want to see the cameras on Capitol Hill and a lobbyist shaping our our our every bill and pushing legislation that the American people don't want let's see that\nYou want to public service let's show that crazy\nSee we ... we hyper wheels hyper focus I think all things like this this is important to the African American vote as a bloc it's very important because a major influential are agents of influence in the middle of that community\nHas decided to come out and say you know what I think differently from what I'm supposed to think\nI'm going to right outside the lines here and that is dangerous talk dangerous strong but the nice it was something else there was a cultural critique about something happening in the black community about father listening about what it means to be a man and not only in the black community in the wider community as\nWell thank you for that call um I Know I wanted to talk cat in Kansas now ... you're in the mid west\nOr the Roseanne show was originally designed to appeal to people like you\nAnd that is where the heart of the viewership for that show came from and I think returned when it re booted some of the highest ratings of last year without Roseanne will you watch the Connors and why not\nFor now I Will not I I Can't say that daughter of ours\nUm I like John that link and I don't mind her sister but I without Roseanne she was the center of the whole show without her that show is nothing and I felt bad for a job that you know just for staying there I feel like he is kind of a\nOh by himself fair but I I Will I Will watch it basically because of how they get Roseanne and the eye to eye ... bought our first\n[laughter] [laughter] well I think you know John Goodman in in um interview said you know I think\nCharacter is going to spend most of the season moping around or you know feeling sorry because he lost his wife and I think that's probably right that look there's no reason for the show to go on without Roseanne that's the reality\nThe only reason is ABC was already out of pocket so they were either going to do some show with these people or they were just going to be right paychecks of these folks who go off and have a vacation but they were on the hook so that's why the Conner says going forward but is it going to\nBut they were on the hook so that's why the Conner says going forward but is it going to die you bet I think it will be canceled after a few shows that's my production will see like a cat for the call mark Florida you wanted to say what then we'll go to a break in a moment\n[noise] yeah right I mean if you recall back during Katrina Conway county and west spoke out against trial or I'm Sorry against the Bush and that a ... black people\nAnd now it's just amazing a ... million out that he's a ... for crop of a sudden I got a mental illness and also the believable\nNo no well this is the again because as as one of the caller said earlier it's almost like stromboli and input Nokia when the puppet is doing what you want it to do yes yes this is great when the puppet cuts the strings then it's a problem\nLook I ... and this is why I'm not saying Kanye West is you know a a ... there's he's not Lincoln here let's not get ahead of ourselves\nI think there are people on the right who want to suddenly crown Kanye West is the leader of you know African Americans in in Republican circles well look to somebody like Clarence Thomas or or you know Walter Williams is somebody who really has a\nFull flashed philosophy\nOn politics and race that is informed impassioned and thoughtful I think that's where you look for that kind of leadership so let's not get ahead of our skis here and anoint Kanye West is somehow the you know sum total of a black conservative thought\nAt the same time he shouldn't be ridiculed now\nFor saying something that the media considers crazier outlandish because he's going to meet with Donald Trump when the other day something crazy and outlandish that he said was considered brilliant because he was attacking a Republican president so it's a it's an interesting double standard we're going to take a break we'll be right back during group she'll continue in moments take", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Hallie", "day": "12"}
