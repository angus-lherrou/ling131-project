Hillary Clinton who's gonna when they go at the two justices you've got\nAnd hell or even ... oh my God you know they'd be so far to the left and so so unwilling to look at the American constitution that will really been a very dramatic difference compared to where we are now\nOr I Want to play for you I'm Larry ... who of course famously bombed in his protections for twenty sixteen but nevertheless has this production for them in terms\nOf the air has ever been an abnormal presidency were in it\nAnd the Trump is violated so many of the rules of politics in so many of the norms of politics a red wave ain't going to happen it's just a question of how big the blue wave is they could be a suit on me it could be a middle sized way they can be a small way it's going to be a blue wave\nOr what is your reaction thought well maybe he's right\nBut it probably isn't I'm In the first question I asked is how come we just won a you a state Senate special election\nIn Texas state Senate seats in Texas were bigger than congressional seats eight hundred thousand people along the border sixty three percent are Hispanic or and we won for the first time on a hundred and thirty nine years what's his explanation\nOr how come a mix Sally the Republican nominee in Arizona's now ahead or how come that er Kramer the Republican candidate in North Dakota is ahead by maybe fourteen points or in his in ah\nTennessee as people we have to realize the British and actually the Democrat actually wrote a book explaining that Obamacare didn't go far enough and explaining how you could get to a government run health system ... starting to fall apart mhm antennas she is going to end up electric motor I'm dumb as getting a sense of\nYou know somebody out of self sabotage and say oh where's the where is the blue wave in the Senate I don't think it exists\nNow and of course we see these races in any somebody's governors' races the one that I'm really watching\nIs the Andrew\nGillum versus Ron I'm a ... because for me and for some many of watch the growth of Florida and how well it's been a run by Rick Scott and and to\nThe idea of turning that state over is critical is that state in the country electoral politics to a guy who was basically a socialist is just that just cannot happen then yeah he's got millions and millions of dollars Newt from all the usual suspects\nCharlie Chaplin I mean Gillum is um [noise]\nThe latest great hope\nBecause he came out of nowhere as a radical Democrats uh he won an upset primary victory a C. D. temporarily looks very good I think you'll be fading day by day as this goes on but uh but when you say governorships remember that there's a study that just came out the ten most popular governors in states\nAre all Republican every single one\nOf the ten highest rated governors or a Republican or the governor of Massachusetts hardly a red state is gonna win in a landslide the governor of Maryland hardly a red state is gonna win or in a landslide and the reason is exactly why we're building a majority in the country they get results\nThey don't just have resistance are they actually have things that work they don't just have fantasies and strange ideas\nAnd I think we have to be prepared to wage a campaign that drives home again and again and again the difference between a the kind of left wing fantasies that are not you can't afford them you can implement them a long run they're not going to work\nAnd I think that's one of our key jobs this campaign is to draw the distinction between results in resistance and certainly the attorney General Holder was a perfect example of the resistance\nAnd certainly the attorney General Holder was a perfect example of the resistance as the alternative\nYeah I I really think and again we'll see how it translates into turn out I think those images of the protesters banging on the Supreme Court doors completely out of control\nA I think that's I I don't think people like that they might not like everything Trump tweets or\nThey might be annoyed as some of the things he says are exaggerates crowds I what I get that but I think the frenzy people want it all to calm down they just want things to come down they want to come down on both sides\nAnd I so I think the Democrats made a really bad miscalculation on this cabin on thing and\nI think it puts them in a much more vulnerable place in a midterm cycle that they thought they you know they were going to just roll right into with you know a fifty seat pickup so that's my sense of it in holders comments Maxine Waters\nI don't know I think all of it is it it gives people a bad feeling\nAnd I think you can draw the contrast you mean here you have an economy which is booming at a level people said was impossible your jobs being created your lowest\nBlack on employment in history the lowest Latino unemployment in history or you have a remarkable achievers would deregulation you have solid conservative judges being appointed so every time you turn around right now you're seeing genuine results\nAnd then you have as you point out um people who seem crazed\nUh I mean is this really the America you want you really want people who come into a restaurant or harass people and drive them out when people banging on the Supreme Court doors are and I and I think in some cases of course we know the George stores and others actually pay for them\nOr which doesn't you know does that justify him but the whole system that the left to try to create I think is in the end or not a sustainable system\nNewt I Know you're doing a lot of uh advance before the midterm elections and there's one on October Fifteen\nOr where you can register to um attend an

liberal the media don't give a rip about minorities you said you said they want a mano climatic voting bloc they do because it's a means to an end that and is absolute power\nI think it's it's always been about power and the power is to change the American social construct\nThey want to destroy the foundations of this country so they can rebuild it and the way that they think\nIt should have been built in the first place they hate the founding of this country they think the country was founded on corrupt principles and a corrupt way that it was that from the American Indians and the Mexicans

deal I Want to talk about what you see because you know one of the smartest political analysts out there with all your experience and reporting over decades or what you're seeing play out now in the country is is worse\nThan um you expected and are we approaching perhaps the Nineteen sixty eight\nStyle a type of frenzy in the streets\nBut I think we're ... or beyond that now I think it's worse that I've seen in my forty five year journalism career and you have basically a nexus of ah the media the corrupt media I'm now a promoting embracing um whatever word you want to use the most\nRadical progressive movement\nEver seen in this country ever in the history of the country\nSo you have a guy's like and everybody knows this named George Soros but others as well with unlimited amounts of money we're basically um formed organizations\nTo attack and destroy people with whom they disagreed this is why it's different than the Tea Party or the uh uh hypocrites on CNN and MSNBC who you know from day to day will change their story depending on what they're told to do [noise] um you have now a\nOf organizations so he saw it and the Kavanaugh hearings that send people out these aren't mob people these are targeted people who are paid to do certain things\nYou know the confined senators in elevators or with the CNN camera right behind them to ah prevent um Senator Cruz and his wife from having dinner the these aren't accidents\nAll right to get Bill O'Reilly off the air\nNot an accident mhm\nOkay so you have this and in the past journalism reporters would have investigated it it gives this huge money behind it but they don't now instead they promote it\nThey're in business with the radical left in business with them\nCNN and MSNBC make money lots of it promoting the most radical progressive organizations in the country which will stop at nothing including violence to get political power so that's what we're looking at\nDo you think that uh the president's handling\nOf this ah the star and the way he's addressed it has been health law has it been illuminating\n\nI don't think he knows what's going on\nThe way I just laid it out to you and your listeners\nAre just don't think he knows what's going on I don't think he knows the seriousness ... whenever you have organizations\nThat are in the shadows that people never heard of I'll give you one color of change Mm All right and you've got twenty of them and they take their orders from big money to radical left people\nAll right they say okay you pay us this and we'll do that the woman who confronted Senator Flake in the elevator is paid one hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year by George Soros funded foundations\nWas widely reported Laura you hear that\nMm no no no\nOkay and so people think it's spontaneous all this woman just showed up to yell at a flake because she's a victim or whatever she said she is that's what's happening\nAnd you know I I draw the correlation between what's happening in America now what happened in Germany\nIn the late Nineteen twenties and Nineteen thirties we've had a fanatical movement Nazi ism\nAccumulating power behind the scenes by violent methods are there and it was big money in it as well okay while the population was looking away wasn't interested was engaged\nAnd the media in Germany basically we're afraid of the Nazis and they wouldn't tell the truth about that\nThat was more of a fear thing than than a what we have now is that the media in America is ideologically in line with the progress ones there cause in the media is the same cause a George Soros so it was a little bit more extreme than the editor to the New York times but not much\n[noise] so this big picture that's formulated over the past I Would say ten years um I don't think President Trump understands it\nUm and I'll give you another thing if I were President Trump I Would order an FBI investigation into the cabin or debacle\nBecause I Know and I think you do to that it was no accident Dianne Feinstein held back that letter from Dr Ford for six weeks that was not an accident\nIt was no accident it was leaked against Dr for its wishes which I'm not exactly sure were sincere\nBut let's say let's take it for face value that letter was linked putting the woman in danger and it was leaked by somebody in Congress because only two people have the letter\nSo the FBI should be investigating that and should get to the bottom and I'll tell you if they start that investigation which I Would order if I were president that scandal that whole thing is going to unravel fast because that was no accident what happened a cabinet\nAnd the women were all the women are all lying by the way they were all line\nTwo and a couple of people are looking into this who actually knew or knew both of them now now you two of them\nWhatever it was ... I went through this I went through this myself mhm right and and I saw things leveled against me that were insane\nAnd I you know at this point in this country people are gonna have to want to make a decision right the progressive left this figured out that they have the media in their pocket and they can do what they want\nThey can do exactly what they want and they almost got cabinet they almost got him and does this kind of country what\n... is is it you're not going to get an honest take from the media they're not going to investigate things they're not going to try to find the truth except it\nExcept that because it's been in Plano for quite some time so who do you depend on to get the truth be only apparatus is the criminal justice system\nTo get the truth the only the apparatus is the criminal justice system\nAnd I'll put forth a President Trump should really see a bigger picture he takes everything personally any fights back effectively himself but I don't know if you see in the big picture what's happening here\nYou know once you start to erode basic rights like presumption of innocence ... process which you say they don't matter as the senator from Hawaii say don't matter\nPresumption of innocence if somebody accuses you of misconduct none you're guilty because in the past some women have been abused I mean think about it\nThey're they're attacking the fundamental rights that Americans have and habitat\nAnd nothing what is what is being done nothing and I think ... I mean it's a division but I'm just so worried about it I Can't\nI Am I Am petrified of this I I ... I completely agree with you and I was slammed\nFor the last three weeks for saying just because someone alleges something and says this is my truth\nDoesn't mean that you can just say okay this person has to be fired this person has to be boycotted this person has to be a thrown to the kicked to the curb denounced um put up on across crucified lose a promotion\nThis is going to stop that 'cause I got up at anybody well and it had happened it happened to me it has to have obviously things happen to you look what happened to you things yeah and it it is a brutal unfair situation and and once you're accused of something where do you go to ...\n\nAnd there isn't anybody in place to rectify it although President Trump could do it by trying to get to the bottom of this cabinet mess my new column host Bill O'Reilly dot com as it is about this issue mhm is about ... exactly about how uh your truth says replaced bought truth\nOkay so ... and I and I take it off the University of North

mortgage dot com\nAre better energy in government than the than the Republicans are so at the Democratic party was direction but it's going and just the opposite direction they're almost virtually guarantee a reelection of of Donald Trump two thousand twenty by my making themselves so marginal so crazy\nFor all of a Donald Trump and two thousand twenty by my making themselves so march so crazy so uh you know out there that they just are revolting to most you know decent law abiding American citizens\nWell in it and you have a situation where the former attorney general\nThe for the the chief law enforcement officer advocated violence\n... and it's disgusting\nSo he advocated violence a Hillary Clinton says you can't be civil\nWith people who want to destroy your your beliefs are so they are two fairly important people in the Democratic party you had Dianne Feinstein um claim that her office didn't leak this confidential document I don't know she leak dinner for over\nYeah yeah yeah yeah from the let me give you another struggle now gee if I may plays\nIs that in the late sixties the radical left was you know the colleges campuses where a flame uh the radical up being funded by the KGB and she argued which has historically documented proof the Soviets were funding the ah anti war protests of the sixties is that they became crazier and crazier and more out of touch more touch\nAnd what happened was was that\nThey temporarily took over the Democratic party and they came up with a nominee George McGovern was a lunatic and who got you know creamed by Richard Nixon in Nineteen Seventy two\nAnd so so the Democrats swore that weren't going to happen again so they they took control of the party and and nominated a centrist Jimmy Carter and won the Republican the Democratic party is now spinning out of control again as it did in ah sixty eight\nVirtually assuring that they're going to nominate a very extreme left is a Marxist Democrat who Trump will have an easy time to feeding in two thousand twenty\nDo you think that because as mass immigration and social media there is more of a chance of the country embracing that left wing radical ideology than it was a Nineteen Seventy two\nNo three social media is just the opposite you know we we we it is taking power this is part of the reason why\nThe left as so enraged because they are losing power and authority the Washington Post\nIs a sad joke itself let's face it the New York times has said Joe CBS NBC ABC I Can't remember the last time I watched any programming on any of those three networks except for a football games\nAre on a on Sundays on to the to the networks are but I don't know anybody who does is that their power is draining away too\nYou know the lower income show and the Fox news and two of you know Newsmax and one American news and conservative talk radio and blogs and and so they become more and more and rage they become more and more marginal\nAnd they're doing just the opposite there were telling their marginal viewers Marshall readers merger listeners and send them send them all through the Republican Party which day by day is looking more calm and laugh at\nAt a reasonable just because of the craziness of the Democrats\nSo it's important than that the president himself a I think appear\nCommon this storm don't you agree with that and\nYeah Donald Trump's image is set for the American people you know he can't he can't really altered or change it or what but but one thing they do believe\nIs is that he's done a pretty good job as president certainly better than bronco bomb and certainly better than Hillary Clinton would have done he's got a chance to improve his standing as as you know people uh you know a job approval and things like that as a ... economy can do to prove North Korea ISIS other things like this\nUh but it stand is pretty well fixed but it's it's in he's in better shape\nThan the Democrats are worth a are at this point in time\nSo go go back and this goes back to the historical moment in we talked about this a bit last night since you're Reagan biographer are so many great Reagan books how Reagan dealt with the the riots will play a bit of sound a lot of you who missed the show last night let's listen\nTo those people told you four days in advance that if the universities to head with that construction they were going to physically destroy the university\nOn our moon many negotiate what she said what is what it was it sees a public institution that is right here in the universe its own community in the community in Berkeley the live around all\nOf them began the first time some of you know better and are old enough to know better ... young people think that they have the right to choose the law they would all day as long as they were doing it in the name of social proof that\nHe gets up any leads yeah yeah that point what do you know construction he was talking about\nOh there there was a there was a park there in Berkeley and they left I Want to do a a build some type of bizarre a memorial to a Vietnam Vietnam Viet Cong soldiers that are saying it was completely\nOut of control it was just it was basically the left you know a stickler Feldman the eyes establishment is what it was all about but what I Love about Reagan or old friend Marty Anderson who's to say that Ronald Reagan was he said warmly ruthless and if you listen to ... he says these professors somebody if you're old enough and ought to know better you know the way he just\nDismiss them but so smoothly and so clearly and so\nYou know a ruthlessly but it just it was the master of this type of thing\nAnd I I just I Love the fact that he he he he went right to the ... the salient point here Craig which is that if people are led to believe that there\nOutrage or their emotions can justify any conduct their behavior then we're in big trouble after ... ... it's a huge huge problem\nSure but it is situational ethics and that's the difference today between the modern Democratic Party in the modern liberal moving in modern American conservatism is is that you know rule of law is one thing where is is that the rule of the mob is quite another by the way\nThis idea that are over on CNN you can't use the word mob look up what Webster I tweeted out this morning Webster's Dictionary ... a ... a a describes a mob\nAs being an unruly group of people set about to cause a political upheaval but [laughter] but that's what they've been doing for the last several weeks was exactly that so you can call them up because you're offended by the Webster's Dictionary\n[laughter] yeah I agree with the mob one of the Tea Party when they're dressed in period garb yeah and [laughter] that's\nWhy the left doesn't get it because they're incapable most people on the left is that they they're they don't they ... they think in a linear sense and they think well if the Tea Party at a protest and the liberal side of protest it must be one of the same no they're not one of the same id motives has everything to do with it\nNow and it's again it's feeling feeling is enough right\nAs long as they feel and they're on the right side then that's all you need so if you feel like well you you if you want to want to stand up for women in algae BT and then you then you got to go out and vote Democrat like what\nBut but that maybe I've said this before and showing up at your part of a hat but the difference today between moderate conservative leader modern conserve politician than a modern liberal politics\nToday between moderate conservative leader marks or politician than a modern liberal politician is the liberal politician goes before the voters says give me power so I can do good things for you and some voters go oh geez I felt pretty good you know\nIt but it but a moderate conservative and that's an emotional response because because liberals gonna do with the good things for you moderate conservative politician goes before the voters says give me power so I may give it back to\n... have to think about it you have to go through the intellectual discipline to realize what he's talking about which is a Republican form of government conservatism federalism\nHowever whatever iteration it comes in is that but it's about taking power away from Washington and send it back to the states or localities and ultimately the individual or the frame or some founders intended it to be there in the first place\nWell again power to power to the people the let me try to show up that slogan but they never really ... but that's\nThe that's the Latin basis for the Republican\nYeah power to the people stays with them not submit some big nameless faceless bureaucracies a critic I Want to play one more thing fee then we're out of time now this was Jeane Kirkpatrick and it was it the Nineteen eighty four Republican convention center in Dallas yeah let's let's yeah Harry Truman\nBasic source of our spring spirit\nWe believe in the dignity of man\nPresidential candidate\nAm not alone and noticing the San Francisco Democrats\nGod she was great\nBut shoo wonderful old friend um I was there on the floor in Dallas that unless you get that speech also brought down the house when she called the Democrats the blame America First crowd\nThat I forgot about that oh my gosh\nI Would urge speech
