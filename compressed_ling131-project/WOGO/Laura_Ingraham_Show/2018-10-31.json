lefty that has made your state a magnet for illegal immigrants and now the push to get health care\nOr to illegal immigrants after we find out that the cost to the state of California the legal immigration including any taxes they pay twenty\nThree billion dollars a year congressman twenty three billion\nRight well uh ... what's really going on in obviously\nA we have some people who either are really\nA ignorant or they are intentionally ignorant of these facts or our systems in the process of going down our quality of life in California is purely being attacked by this massive offering illegals not to mention that is that\nPart of the labels of course some of them are criminals but even those that aren't we can't afford to spend limited dollars on our ... our education system from from in the last twenty or Thirty years has gone for one of the best one of the worst\nAnd uh we'll just have said we cannot afford to take care of everybody in the whole to get it here and if we do it's a crime against our own people\nA congressman or our back or the ... is the sad thing I think for so many Americans is how it's become a point of controversy for you to say\nAny of us to say we want the border and forced why is that controversial that we might have border\n[noise] or that or we're going to have to come to grips with us and they're very ... people\nAre I Hope or are observing this trying to figure out what's going to happen with their lives\nAs this situation deteriorates I having columns people and these are this guy I Know they call the book caravans but he's her columns of invaders governing the dark country now admittedly most are probably good people below significant number are chronically criminals\nAnd no matter what it is we can't afford to have these massive numbers of people if we let them through this time and I I'm I have faith that our bras than will stop this uh invasion of our country\nAnd we let him this time I work we get a check more and more and more just like we have individually as we let them across the border we now have probably twenty to thirty billion the illegals here\nOr are you being outspent significantly on the ... in the ad wars in other outreach to voters getting in to the polls are online social media and so forth\nThat's there's the irony of all of this of course we're being called because of our positions like on illegal immigration\nWere being called the establishment Republicans or the party of the rich rubbery told but we've got these billionaires point money and I get my opponent's campaign and them to all of the uh how you say a combat or\nYou're in all of the districts that are in combat between Republicans and Democrats\nTheir ... their point in the big guys are pouring millions and ... hundreds of millions of dollars across the country\nMillions and millions in in my district so it's difficult because uh I I Am not a very wealthy man my opponent a is a wealthy person and he came here he's only been in California about six or seven years\nHere are they from his dad came out of your while I don't have the money that I spent on the campaigns are here it's a real challenge\nFor close to where it goes to actually having no money left but we have raised over two million dollars to hire pool that's four and a half million dollars not to mention the Bloomberg\nType money that's coming into the into the race\nThat the press is calling this a forty eighth district race in California\nA referendum on Trump and the Trump agenda what is your take on a\n[noise] I think that it you know\nThat's one element of the race certainly a a I think though that I've been to a sport or the president on things like your legal immigration I differ with the president once or twice as well on a on a major issues for the most things like that on the president's side\nAnd I admire the president and the good job but he's been doing so that is an issue here\nHowever the the most important thing is\nIs that my opponent she got a choice to be open another person and how the Democratic candidates are proud of him and she or he basically does he's a newcomer to the area and he doesn't understand any of the things\nThat are at the heart of what it's like to be coming up this uh this county in this part of the country\nAnd I mean I grew up surfing along the beaches here and uh I've been uh I I went to high school here in ... and a college here have come to your show what it is is that it's\nThe president is of the issue but we've got an outsider in this district was trying to a game right to represent us a guy on me\nAs being part of our community really\nYeah well there you know obviously in the ... year see is a is quite a trophy at the Democrats can defeat you or event in Fifteen terms\nI you came in as a strong Reagan a conservative or libertarian leaning and are you now are in the fight with someone who's getting an enormous amount of outside money who's\nChallenging the entire world view of a Trump and conservatism as Orange County itself has seen an influx of a folks from Los Angeles\nAnd more liberal enclaves of the state of California uh so what do you say to my listeners a congressman or our back or about\nWhat California has done wrong that could end up transplanting itself across the United states extending across the United states\nWell what part of our of our big problem that are in California and of course but it's it's now having a major impact as I say on our quality of life\nYou have to look at that things and and how pervasive this whole issue\nOf vision of having millions of of non citizens are coming here illegally into cars into our society are right that our education system\nIs going as go ... it it's been a disaster\nFor education system but we have issues that people talk about like ah how about the homeless and when you take a look close looks at what that means is there are a lot of people out our state for example who are down in the White House the homeless people you guys\nHave drug and alcohol problems but there are probably half of the people were homeless who are people who had gone through ... they lost their job or something and they can't find a housing\nThey lost their job so I'll be ... or ... that\nThat they can afford a ... they have the money to be able to pay the rent that's because\nFor the last Fifteen Years\nWhat's happened is all the ... the low low priced housing that would be available like crazy how soon will claim that we live in it has been picked it up here and they built it two or three families so here we have so much of our\nOf our problems bill directly from the fact that the federal government\nIs in control in order\nAnd as I say here\nI think when people think about it I think historically successful I Hope he will this person with a critical and\nTurn around the country but I Want to\nPlay something really quickly for you this is from your a primary I think this is from the primary debate with your current your your opponent Harley root of all let's listen\nTo what do you support expanding expanding Medicaid for undocumented adults as well Mr ... yes and when I talk about Medicare for all or some of these other measures that provide some level of assistance to some groups are the answer would be for all residents of the United states of America\nYeah so it ends period that matters or wherever you come from whatever country you're from visa overstays the hundreds of thousands who decided not to pay attention\nTo their immigration court hearing dates you all get free Medicare operate that\nYou're right this I have a heart\nAnd said that what is it doesn't I don't see how you get understand when he says I'm here for all including illegal aliens what that means is ... ... can be a better job for nobody will", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Laura Ingraham Show", "city": "Hallie", "day": "31"}
