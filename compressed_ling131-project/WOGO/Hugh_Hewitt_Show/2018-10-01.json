why we have had this hearing miss for these allegations and accomplish a letter to die and find sign in July shortly after Brett Kavanaugh was nominated the very not he was nominated Chuck Schumer the Democratic leader\nSaid that he would do everything in his power to stop the nomination and that's what happened for three months the Democrats have turned the advice and consent process into a search and destroy mission these allegations are completely supportive my any evidence what evidence there is to eight thirty six year old claim\nAll support judge Kavanaugh's denial but then the Democrats have disgrace this process and the United States Senate and the orchestrated smear campaign of character assassination they've run against judge Kavanaugh their argument of course\nWas that doctor for an ass have this housing confidentiality and if they tried to do that and that's what he was on let me let me alone I don't know no no no no John\nLet me talk to you about that when you talk to your listeners about your views about that there was a well established process a competent jelly on the committee Dianne Feinstein could have showed that letter to Chuck Grassley and the two of them as the leaders of that committee could have shared it with the FBI who could have discreetly conducted\nThis inquiry in July and August without betraying missed sports confidence is and they have a trainer they pointed her lawyers\nWho Lied to her and did not tell her that the committee staff was willing to go to California to interview her all that now all that water under the bridge those lawyers gonna have to face in DC more investigation in the midst their misconduct Dianne Feinstein and her staff is going to face an investigation for why they leak that all this could have been done to ... happens hundreds upon hundreds of times\nEvery year and the committee doesn't have\nTo keep going ... number twenty\nFive years on any impact this entire episode has had on women's willingness to come forward and report sexual assault which I encourage them also do immediately after it happens\nIt's caused by the Democrats it's caused by Dianne Feinstein and Chuck Schumer not respected her request for confidentiality smell when you come forward with an accusation as serious as the U.S it has to be tested against the evidence and against proof and we would have known that confidentially inside of this year committee wasting its time\nAnd I don't know what I don't know what the FBI is going to find that the committee has not already found that the committee staff has already interviewed all the witnesses that missed four sided interviewed miss forward and judge Kavanaugh for six hours and ...\nAnd she sent a letter that why you know an interview but you're not right about that so they've either interviewed them or they received a letter for letter under penalty of perjury I sent for nowadays are actual interview so I'd be surprised if any of these people under penalty of perjury change their statements they've already given this year well\nIs it cut number twenty six keep going John\nWe already know what everyone who's alleged to be at the party has said they've submitted statements or been interviewed under penalty of perjury I Would be shocked if any of them ... statement under penalty of perjury to the FBI but if this makes a few senators more comfortable about going forward and voting on judge Kavanaugh is\nVery highly qualified nomination in in the face of an orchestrated democratic smear campaign then was that may end up as a good I was just cannot truthful intervene sent in his testimony I found him to be truthful throughout his testimony I found them to be turns out he he was and\nI found him to be appropriately indignant ... at the smear campaign and I I'm disappointed what Chris ... set on that video leading yeah and it reminds me of the old proverb this animal is very wicked\nIt defends itself and attacked if they didn't want him to come in\nCome in and be angry and indignant at their false accusations they should have thought about that before they accused him of being a serial sex criminal for the Miami is one\nMore kind of Tom Cotton on face the nation yesterday cut number twenty seven\nIf it turns out that he was not truthful about something that has nothing to do with what allegedly happened thirty six years ago truthfulness is still something you want and the Supreme Court nominee though is that relevant\n... what are you talking about it if it turns out in the course of the FBI investigate it and it is if you want to have an open ended fishing expedition I think that's not fair senator what are you talking about\nI'm asking you if in the investigation and turns out that something outside of that is it is his testimony turns out to look\nAt John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham said if there's some shocking new bit of a not an accusation but evidence improve then of course I'm open to value wedding that evidence but I said I strongly suspect that every statement that was made the Judiciary Committee under penalty of perjury is the exact same statements can be made to the FBI\nAnd we're you know I just cannot get over the McCarthyism going on here Tom Cotton good on you Adrian, Missouri what do you say Audrey\nMorning a first off I Would like to say that I'm I'm proud of Lindsey Graham and I wish Trey Gowdy was on that [laughter] the other thing is\nI have very serious concerns about the FBI investigation as to whether we might be getting a a eight or ... or at least a page\nI don't I think it will be very very well done and I think they have a limited witness list because of the terms of the agreement that were struck but did you watch the testimony\nI only got the part of it I
