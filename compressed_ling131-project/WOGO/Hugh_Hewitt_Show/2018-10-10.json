historic investments in our military and um make no mistake about it we we will continue to stand by\nA all of our interests across the Asia Pacific and when I travel to the region when I travel to the region um a in a month or at the a pack and I'll see on conferences will be reiterating\nSpirit or any of that very same message that\nWe as we are committed to defending or ... years we've committed to defend Taiwan against an attack is that commitment still got\nA we continue to stand firmly behind all of our treaty obligations than to Taiwan act out all of that all of the\n... all of that as bloody as you know with the one China policy um that uh but as I said last week of the Hudson and we we believe that democracy in Taiwan represents a the best way for them it does to\nThe Iranians have stopped harassing our ships because they know what a Trump Pence response would be the PR scenes harassing our ships have we communicate to them that that will be on them if an incident occurs\nWell as you know last week a when an American warship was making its way through international waters in the south China Sea\nAre literally a a a Chinese ship a came within some uh fifty yards of that American warship there's there's also been similar acts of provocation and what we've made very clear or is that we are going to continue to operate\nA a A R navy a and keep the sea lanes open\nIn all ... all international waters and we're seeing here right now as we've seen as you know we've seen China constructing a a you know a Ireland's on coral reefs there were commitments made by president Jean to the last administration that they they would never have a military assets\nOn those islands I recounted last week that that is no longer the case or that there are there are military assets that have been deployed to\nThose Chinese constructed islands in the south China Sea but all of this is say look\nWe're going to continue to stand strong we're going to continue to\nAssert America's interests throughout the Indo Pacific a and we're gonna we're gonna continue to stand strong on behalf of a\nOf of the American people's values of freedom and liberty but also for the American economy I mean when when you you look at\nOf course in in direction of this relationship with China we we literally\nAs the president often says we literally built China or over the last thirty five years and I'm\nA and yet China is still listed a in international organizations as a developing country um and continues to restrict the ability of uh of American trade to move freely and American goods to move freely into China or those things have to change that all of that being said\nUm let me say President Trump and I\nAnd our team continued to be hopeful that we will see change not more words but deeds\nBecause of truthfully the president has forged a a strong personal relationship with President Xi of China or they met in the United states last year they met in China last year I expect a you know I expect that the relationship\nOr will continue or\nTo go forward and our hope is\nOur hope is on the basis of that personal relationship that President Trump is former president Jean that will finally begin to see China take the kind of actions that will set it uh\nThat will set it on a pathway toward a more economic exchange and I'm In and greater respect a greater respect for nations around the world\nTo more questions about China's rise president the president made an explosive promise of a\nThree hundred and fifty five ship may be going up here during the campaign on the deck of the forward that the only problem is that his con completely unfulfilled there is NO PLAN to get there before twenty fifty it's major failure of the administration that we do not have a plan to get the three hundred and fifty five ships will that be remedied sue\n[noise] well what what I can promise you is that working with this Congress or this president's going to continue\nTo rebuild our military or the uh Seventy billion dollar increase in our military and our first budget um now will be at seven hundred and sixteen billion dollars total or in the new national defense authorization budget that was a sign by the president but look\nI'm a that President Trump is absolutely committed to making sure that our soldiers sailors airmen marine and coast guard have the resources have the equipment I have the training to accomplished their mission I promise you were going to continue to drive toward that objective I mean we we we truly do believe\nIn peace through strength it is a it is a governing philosophy that President Trump brought into the oval office like his predecessor to forty as president and we're going to continue\nAnd he said rain rain American Pie you know he said three fifty five again and again Mr Vice president and there is NO PLAN it's like the navy and the ...\nWell just stay tuned oh we've got more ships being built
