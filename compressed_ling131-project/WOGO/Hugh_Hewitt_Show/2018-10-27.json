to buy a AAA eight to five five two to five\nTrevor is whether it's in Greensboro North Carolina Hi Trevor how are you\nI'm doing great Dave thank you for taking my call sure what's up\nA well me and my wife were working on the debt snowball I'm In July I got laid off\nI'm kind of a blessing in disguise I Am working again\nI'm making less money but a lot less stress and so what is your input on a plan that we had to sell our house who to pay off all of our debt and and kick start us going in and be kind of start over\nHow much debt do you have not counting your house or fifty three thousand [noise] and so on your home will clear that\nYeah and then started with a much more would you put in your pocket past that\nAre probably about twenty five plus thousand rather you know real for for years and everything\nOkay and so um what's your household income today about eighty thousand okay so you just don't like the house\nWe're not in love with it or we bought at four and a half years ago um 'cause we want it to chase somebody else's dream and then we're realizing it's not our dream and it was either\nA mortgage racing [noise] you're deciding oh I Love her oh man yeah I'm so we we don't we're not in love with it ah and we have different goals in our priorities have changed so\n\nOkay so where are you going to live\nA well that was kind of ... and the plan with we could basically jumpstart through a baby step three and say the other money put some of the other money put it in as our merge defined\nAnd then either rent for a short period of time while we built up more of a down payment or use the money and buy a smaller property I'm and smaller house um that uh that we can you know they will enjoy\nMhm sure\nWill enjoy mhm oh yeah [noise] um\n\nThere's nothing wrong with any of this equation um but I Will be straight with you I I'm afraid\nI'm hearing something else that in order to be happy you have to make less money\nAnd that is not a script I Want to join in on\nOr you can be happy and make more money\nAnd this idea that in order for your life to be good you have to take a dumbed down job and you're not living to your potential and I'm not suggesting you go back into a high stress situation but uh doing something you love you could make double what you're making now and it feels a little bit like your surrendering settling\nCertainly thank you how can I help\n[noise] okay [noise] so I've been following your plan for around like a couple of months now I had the emergency finals and I'm working on baby steps too good on my issue and I had made progress not a ton of progress it's on our last\nNight issue is idea of a chronic illness and I still work fulltime I I'm not letting\nIt take over my life good on my question is is how do I I check 'em for like the doctor ball on it and I recently I recently switched ... started again I'm\nSorry I also have a chronic illness you're going to hit the duck double every year\nRight um\nIt's ... thank God it's nothing on the go it it's not to do if he has not life threatening are you going to do it\nEvery year\nNow okay ... what what is the nature of this what was the nature of the illness\nI mean I don't want to go into detail that is that it's a nerve pain condition and the doctors are unsure of what it comes from okay um so so what's your what I Want to do is really I'm sure because it's relatively new guy that I yeah\nFor what I Would do is just try to estimate what you think it's going to cost you a year\nAnd the more experienced got to help you that you have with is the better your estimates are badly because once you've ... battle with it for five years you're you're going to kind of know a five year average versus five months you're kind of guessing what it's going to cost you in a year right\nRight and you just put that in has a budget item so let's just make up a number okay if you're the duck double was six thousand and you're going to run through your six thousand though the duck double every year then that's five hundred bucks a month\nIf it's three thousand dollars a year this is going to cost me out of pocket that's two hundred and fifty a month and I just put a you know\nA a whatever a line in your budget for medical expense all knowing chronic medical when just call your call chronic or whatever just give it a name and the money set aside so that so that every 'cause it's kind of like we know it's going to come up\nAnd leave a little while now someday hopefully you'll find a cure and you know it's not a lifetime of this or something broke now yeah but for now for now you're saying it's predictable\nOr that you're going to have issues we just don't know how severe or expensive they are going to be up into your future and so ... for the next so many months we need to just be budgeting is if we think we're going to spend X per year divided by twelve in your monthly budget\nI mean my issue is that I'm literally on like penny pinching\nI don't like seeing where I can make that happen so what I've been hearing is I mean I decided starting next month and then a kick out fifty dollars that you really like right now on what I'm I'm hoping overtime all the other you know take out more\nSo why are we finally got an income problem a debt problem or a spending problem\nWhere I had that problem [laughter] I'm I'm sixty thousand on that\nI made I don't think a lot I'm a licensed social worker and because of my condition actually switch to a job I had more flexibility\nOn some at a fee for service division as opposed to a salary position mhm and I make anywhere from Thirteen hundred Fifteen hundred ... a paycheck um\nI knew he had twice a month ... you back twice a month okay and you said you're living with them\nI guess I'm I'm living with a roommate I paying nine Seventy five for rent each of us from a lot um and I do that somehow from down line\nFrom and what is the nature of the debt student loan\nPratt is everything credit card all also because they can hear it I was trying a lot of holistic thing mhm um medical and then it's student loan as most of it is like a fifty thousand of it so I have like a total of sixty thousand\nOkay show for the short term we're going to make sure you take care of the most important things and that's food\nPantry not eating not eating outside and you're paying more than half your life\nNot eating not eating out in your ... your life your lights and water and your rent and your transportation so food shoulders loading in transportation and utilities the eighth grade we used to call that a civics lesson what's in the sense will be in the city is only the debt you've got is not necessities\nYou take care of the debt only after you've taken care of the necessities in the new work this out into the debt as you can\nAnd here's the thing you're either going to repair for these medical expenses or they're going to be new debt\nRight because they are coming\nYou're told me that that's why you're called yeah yeah yeah I mean it's not me declaring it I'm saying ... actually I've got an ongoing medical\nHow to prepare for you're saving coverage so\nNow that's our short term long term okay we gotta get your income up and you're out go down to knock this debt out long term but that has to do with your medical condition and has to do with your career and has to do with a lot of different things that you've got to face\nAnd so um but that's how I Would you begin to look at it get to take care of the short term make sure you're taking care of you so that you\nCan you know be prepared to take on the long term which is get your income up but uh we got to get past some of the medical stuff and you got to really start looking at this career really hard chop up those credit cards is time for a plastic surgery Tucker is with us in Atlanta Georgia Hi Tucker how are you\nOn doing well how are you better than I deserve what's up\nFor me and my wife I'm going through a baby step to right now I'm In fact we just paid off our second credit card today though we are dollar credit card and moved on if they don't mind\nThat is good news um [noise] but um so we're worried that too and we're looking at our budget and yesterday and um after church we had a big argument about hiding I don't think that we want to ... percent and um I ... that\nWe were not in a position to give right now we're trying to pay all that we can get later on\nBut what I'm saying what economists model that I'm kind of a ... law and get your input on it we\nHave our ten percent but it but we want to live without thinking about quitting data\nAnd giving back to the church and then having that extra five percent and kind of giving it to um other\nCharitable organizations that we believe in that are doing day the ... you know when the crisis mission and so we're trying to looking at trial give what we can for people who need it\nUm but if she don't love and wanting to strike and present a church I think you are or what we don't what we can't give you know we're not in the media and she wants to give it to church and\nWe got a big argument about five and yesterday was\nOut on you know the the definition of dies the definition of the time was when you look it up in the Hebrew it's an Old Testament term and Jesus reaffirmed given the New Testament is tense it literally means chant the word means tamp\nIt doesn't mean sphere that doesn't mean ... it means to him\nNow you can decide whether you want to ... they're not you get to decide that um but if we're going to walk with Christ and we want to and we I'm an evangelical Christian which means I look for what the scripture tells me to do\nI'm doing my best to follow what the word of God says ... opinion is doesn't matter what Tucker plan is er Tucker's opinion is doesn't matter\nI'm looking for what God says to do in his love letter to me and he says Tucker and Dave I'm I'm you're my kid I'm Crazy about you\nI Love you and you can give are not\nGiven all still love you but the best way to live your life is to to gifts\nAnd all throughout the Old Testament and Jesus reaffirmed as in the New Testament is a time of the tens of urine from evangelicals are taught and believe for Fifteen hundred years the ... is your baseline minimum giving and it comes off the top before you do anything else and it goes to your local church [noise]\nSo if you want to biblical answer\nYour wife Wednesday arguing [noise] that's the biblical your wife was argument but she was correct biblical [laughter]\nActually both are probably true [laughter]\nGood luck with that brother [laughter]\nIn order to be a successful business owner you have to be prepared for change as an

was making before a year before okay um what do you make now why now I'm In real estate I'm actually I got my license in March and June ... June was my first day in real estate\nMhm I've got to choose the house has sold takes listings and ending clothing bought into uh the second week of November So\nWhat is your projected income for the uh the that six month period of time\nI'm I'm thinking maybe like twenty five thousand by the end of the year\nAnd now what is your why didn't make of the one on phonics\nFifty a she made a fifty one dollar\nOkay so basically it sounds like in real estate you're going to make as much as you use to make\nYes okay good good news right\nI guess right now what she's worried about is that she's bringing in most of the income because of course it's slow when you first start out\nI'm only selling to houses that between that long span 'em and everything and she wants to keep her car because she's saying she's making money to pay her car [noise]\n'cause that's not how it works when we're married that's how it works when your roommates\nYou get to do whatever you want when your roommates but when you're married it's for richer for pour in sickness and health and onto the all my worldly goods I pledge is what the old marriage vows said\nAnd so it you know if you want to be divorced you get to keep whatever you want to Cape but if you want to be married we are doing this together in other words if she gets cancer you don't look at her and go oh you just you can handle that cancer thing there by yourself and those groups that came out you get to do that by yourself\nYou're not going to do that to her right no\nNo you would take care of her because we are now one when we're married and and it's in sickness and health and right now the house a sick and so we don't get to be a print system be selfish that's not an option sorry\nYes and and um that's what I was trying to explain to her that we need my my truck is for sale already I have it on the market good home as soon as I as soon as I Do some of these qualities of course we'll have\nIf I can get what I was asking for what you what would I oh I'm going to pay the difference to get rid of it completely good um what these clothing and that's what I was trying to tell her to is\nI'll get a car cash and then she sells her car and then what have at least one car right now [noise]\nMm well I don't know I don't ... I don't agree with that I Would get her a car and I'm not sure we're gonna move down and out of her car if you can make fifty five thousand\nIf you can get these closings and everything you've gotten the pipeline it sounds like you're pipelines pretty good it's just it's been tough from the lay off in other firing until now but here's the money that you've got ... the the business that you have coming\nShould create the income that used to have if I heard you correctly\nYes and and like I told her like she's she's worried that it's not coming in fast enough and I told her there are ending for closing by then the second week of November everything should be close to six\nMonths just to kind of three weeks from now yeah I mean so three weeks from now all this goes away so here's what I Would I Would not sell her car today\nWould show your trial today and I but\nI Would I Would say I would tear this this this ridiculous philosophy that she has all the ... I'm not putting up with that crap okay this idea that outlined make money I can keep ... well that's if your room mates that's just BS okay I'm not going with that so uh\nBut uh but but the idea that I think she should keep her car and I think the two of you and I think you're going to be making enough money that then the two of you could work through a budget\nThat has not a hundred and five thousand dollars worth about making about a little over a hundred but instead it has about Seventy five thousand dollars of debt making a little over a hundred if both of you are willing to roll up your sleeves and\nPay off thirty seven thousand dollars for the ... a year for two years we can keep her car but if you're not willing to do that as I household then you don't have a financial trouble

so let's try that other approaches I think it's reasonable financially to keep her car if your income goes right looks like your income is going to go\nThen you might be looking at different Greer and

that's do you have that are not home equity or for one\nI have a hundred thousand and vehicle fifth wheel toys like larger items worth more than ten Fifteen dollars ...\nThat are all going down in value okay yeah and you might have Seventy five thousand dollars a year\nYeah yeah but I I'm thirty one I I okay yeah I'm scared about what you're going to say about my house but\nYeah so what is your a house payment\nNow famous Thirteen fifty it's got to balance the two thirty and then what's your take on a tickle in about thirty four hundred a month\nThat must be after four O. one K. contributions or something\nMust be after four O. one K. contributions or something yeah yeah okay how ... ... what's your take home pay if we don't count a four O. one K. contributions\nWe do we have a question about um insurance as it relates to a nonprofit attrition I have about two and a half years to go\nThen we're going to retire from our jobs and will laugh in Alaska relocate to Missouri and set up a law enforcement retreat camp for officers that are just need a place to go in and reconnect with their family but we're wondering is what kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential liability\nThe camp will be\nA the the operations of the camp will be done by the nonprofit the land that it is on them all and we'll be rented or\nWe currently own that property currently on that property and we'll be living on it are\nInto him and um I Would suggest you keep that separate from the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent from you for a dollar or whatever and then you would carry law journal liability on your land or in case something happened with the rent or\nWhich happens to be your non profit and in the nonprofit you would sit down and talk about what kind of a\nYou know you need to get with an insurance broker and what kind of insurance is appropriate then\nFor a a a camp setting a liability will be the main thing I Will be concerned about uh that if somebody fell and hurt themselves or something like that who are they going to say well they could sue the a landlord or they could sell the turn of the good so the the nonprofit or you either one and so\nOn a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm probably more concerned about that and then ... if the structures on the property\nOr they they would be owned by you individually or are you in a company separate from the nonprofit that company would carry or that individual would carry the insurance on the structures more like homeowners insurance trophy on the farm or something and and you keep that because I rent or can't insure\n'em\nThings that they don't own you don't have an insurer more interest and I I I really would not put the land in the name of the nonprofit or are we keep it separate from a risk standpoint and you know in case something changes with the nonprofit you're not\nYou know you you're not stuck with land in a non profit that can get real sticky if you want to do so let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land\nYou know you got mess on your hands off the land is owned by the nonprofit usually what I'm saying yeah they keep that separates a infiltrate the you know the landlord heck can only ensure the buildings the business so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liabilities right with that and any of the things that the\nUh if you're a tenant for instance in a house you can get confidence insurance you ensure your stuff that's in that landlords ... you see what I'm saying and so treat these things separately in your mind that way but an insurance broker can walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camera insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the types of uh of interests people to shop several different companies to get you the best deal\nAnd for instance I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay and so you don't go to State Farm and get an airplane insurance okay they don't sell it in my but you wouldn't want to buy their even if they did so you you said you would go to insurance broker and they shot five different companies that right airplane insurance\nAnd then they come back and tell you how that ... ability works on that and how the different you know and the the if there's a crash what would happen in the same kind of thing here they would find five different companies that ride camp insurance\nFor for families or adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would make a market that means an insurance where they find somebody that ride your policy\nOr two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing and it costs to this much of this cover company covers the same stuff accepted the number one thing and it caused this much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually the individual part will be a lot cleaner\n'cause it's basically a insurance on a farm or or insurance on the foreign plus a few cabins you know almost like a\nThat kind of stuff so you're covering the structure that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff you just get somebody that that can you know go into that little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for if I were in your shoes is but the main thing you want is liability\nDue to hold harmless agreements carry any weight in any of this um\nNo uh ... yeah they carry weight but I'm\n... and\nAre no agreements that keep someone from ... you cannot contract away liability okay so let's say that a floor was rotten and one of the cabins okay and um\nThat's a liability that your fault regardless of if they found a whole arm wash you you are liable for that uh you're standing in my building\nIf you slip and fall and uh because we didn't you know properly installed\nIf you slip and fall and uh because we\nDidn't you know properly and stole the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something then we're liable for that regardless of if we had you sign a hold on just before he walked in here\nYou know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff separate an ownership like we were talking about anyway those are called that's those moves or risk management moves you're you're managing your risk I but I hold harmless is\nThat what that does is it it's like a lot of contracts keeps honest people honest\nRight it's like do you know you were you were walking across the employee fell on your face 'cause you trip\nYou know and you're trying to hold harmless agreement and you know then you're going to call him out just on his honor you know if he doesn't have any the insurance companies lawyers gonna call him out on his on her and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case they're not after writing a check but you need the backup in case you were to lose that\nUh and it'd be proven that that you are liable regardless of the whole harmless but I I I Would have um signed them in those cases for sure as you know when you register to you're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and I have an attorney draw up a little simple one page thing but\nYou know if if you're on a four wheeler a expedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles you know you sound these two page documents that are all find Brenda about how if you die you're not ... they're not liable\nThey're still wobble [laughter] they'll still loose [laughter] so I mean it that they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you and thanks for the call I appreciate your joining U.S Open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five you jump in we'll talk about your life and your money\nAnd a\nJump in and we'll talk AAA eight to five five two to five All right Lindsay is with us in Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Lindsay how are you\nI'm Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um okay I have a Christian and and I knew it so I Apologize to this is something that you've touched on our website and find new to the baby and I know that number one we have the ads and dollar and mark and the fun mhm\nMy question is do you ever think ... saving\nMore than that and and the reason I asked my husband works and oil and gas industry and getting laid off isn't really an uncommon thing happened mhm um and I stay at home I got a kid mhm but I'm just wondering and how you think we should prepare\nGenerally I Do not suggest more than that until you get better baby step three but here's what I Would dare okay he's in an unstable environment where this job is what you're saying and I agree with you\nOK but um\nThat's one level of quote worry\nI'm not going to raise it based on that level of gory but what I Would do is stop the baby steps and pile up cash if we get wind that he's really going to get laid off\nHow much notice did they usually give him if he's laid off\nUm [noise] I don't it's never he's only been working for three years oh no never happened we really lucky we've never been laid off when you go in and they get sent home pretty quick I mean within a couple\nOf weeks she'd have a couple of weeks to do something and he's going to find something to do when he comes home and they did get laid off so uh [noise] you know if he looks up at five of his buddies were laid off last week I Would push pause\nOn the whole total moneymaker baby step thing and just pile of cash but just generally worried about it you know generally worried about it as we all have and that's why we get out of that\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run to help I recommend all my listeners check out one dental dot com it's not dental insurance one dental as a dental discount program that functions like a membership club think of it like Costco\nYou join for a small yearly fee and you say big every time you use it\nOn talking discounts on all procedures from routine cleaning to root canals in fact two of my team members of saved over a thousand dollars with the one dental plan\nAnd this is not just for you and your family there are group rates for your business church or association available fulltime part time and contract employees volunteers and members\nOh I'm not sure that that if you got\nTo get two cars I'm a credit card debt but I paid pretty much about Fifteen thousand in the last I Would say three or four months\nYou've got your your debt free but two cars in two houses right okay how much do you own your cars\nI'm fifty thousand on balls each or total\nOkay how much do you own your cars I'm fifty thousand on bald each or total on both total okay wow and what's your household income or one thirty okay you have a lot of car and um\nSo what do you own your primary and what do you owe on the rental\nMy primary I go to fix the and it's worth about five if the\n...\nAnd the rental and now my my rental Ohio one takes the and it's worth about I Would say or thirty to look at work to be but I if I'm at a little bit less\nOkay so I mean the two ways to do it is usually income to clear up the mess or use the rental to clean up the mess right\n[noise] right\nAnd so on you know if we take take and say I'm you know I'm going to start paying I'm going to live on beans and rice and till I get these cars paid off and so they're going to be paid off in well under a year\nAnd then once they're paid off a then I'm going to decide I'm going to pay all the the little house or the rental first probably go ahead and pay off the rental um my pay off the house first I don't know either one's fun but um you know you start doing what forty fifty grand a year at that\nStuff let's see here we got three four uh four twenty so you've got about five to ten you got about seven to ten years to clean up those two things after the Europe paying off your car um Oregon shoulder rental now and be done right\nI mean that's what I really had him classroom whether to to do that and and pay off most of the party much taller and try and pay off pretty much all my that yeah the ... on it but I also have in mind for that but I have a son who's about to well I Would say in in three years she's going to go to college\nSo I don't have a house payment you can catch while they're right okay you know debt now the only way this makes sense is if you don't borrow money anymore right now my credit cards are cut up there and they're going to be very by a car\nYou pay cash for it I'm All right you never grow money again on anything if you do this because otherwise it doesn't make sense\nRight up the planet you can to get on track\nYeah you can't shorter ride this out of debt horse\nIt doesn't work you can't shorter ride him you gotta ride him or not and so if you're gonna ride him it makes a lot of sense and I think it makes sense I Would sell the rental and pay off everything\nCash flow college than outside my mom is from other rentals with cash or go along out there into the future and I think ten years from today you'll be in a better place by having done that if you stay on budget and you don't keep you know you don't spend money that you don't have to go back out there and borrow money and all that kind of stuff but you got to stop it\nYou got to break the cycle and if you've broken the cycle and yeah I don't the rental on pay off the cars and pay off the house um\nAnd it does look like you got enough to do both I'm barely close very close but you need to be a hundred percent that free a slap build your emergency fund and then start building George junior college fund and then once you've got junior college covered um by just don't want it to start in a savings account to junior college junior college just ordinary\nBuild it up build it up build it up build it up and work your way right through it and then I'm\nA ... then once that's done then you just start saving up and paying cash for rentals or doing other kinds of investing along the way but we're working the baby steps here are the only thing is we're just short short getting everything by the ... I Would I Love rental property but I Love being there for a more\nAnd so I don't borrow money in life is good when I don't have any payments any where life is good it's awesome\nI thanks for the call man we're pretty sure you're joining U.S Open phones this hour as we talk about your life and your money it's a free call the phone number is triple eight eight to five\nFive two to five day what's your opinion on used car warranties I don't recommend any extended warranties ever\nUsed car warranties are especially bad\nThey're very very expensive\nSelf insured for your home with her\nTwelve percent of what you're spending on those once he actually goes to cover the cost over for eighty eight percent profit\nThey make a lot of money on that\nMoney is probably make more money on one Bill McCollum\nListen up leaders if you want to be a better later if you want us to arrive at not just survive in today's market I got some great news on November night we are live streaming our entree leadership one day\nThat's right entree leadership one day live stream is a full day leadership prevent that you can stream from anywhere you'll see me along with every day millionaires and retirement expert Chris Hogan pastor and founder of the ... version Bible lap Bobby Grunwald and founder and CEO of charity water Scott Harrison\nDiscover what these top leaders due to disrupt the marketplace you can download the event workbook interact with other attendees through a live feed and get all the same great content as if you were attending in person know travel required make it a day\nFor you and your team to watch together registered today Dave Ramsey dot com slash advance or text anyone indeed twenty Eighteen to\nForty four to twenty two for more information [noise]\nDon't wait until you're tactics mission left you know it needs something Dan in the valley Seventy ...

I'm not exactly sure what ... think again if I'm not the beneficiary of that in her how to handle it\nMhm okay so he took us out when your husband was a trial yeah\nThis is not a term policy it's a whole life life insurance policy\nAnd it's quite annoying dollar\nWhile it should be canceled okay\nIt's a whole life insurance policy about ... million dollars is a very expensive\nRight and they are and like my parents you know I found out the beneficiary I don't I mean you hit the great guy I'm not worried about you know that it's\nOut on my own group has a good guy\nDoesn't matter of fact a good guy that's it's it's really weird that it's continued to have the parents are the beneficiary and this is a grown man with family of four with four kids\nYeah there is a very very down on you know a wild one\nBut it's strange how long have you been married for a long you been married five years you know five years they've not address this issue that strength the strength you know it really I mean they should you should address the issue that\nThey should not be the beneficiaries anymore you should be and really the policy ought to just be canceled\nBecause I Would I Would not want to pick up the ... I Would not want to pick up the premiums on a half a million dollar policy that's a whole lot policy because it's twenty times more expensive than term to create an investment inside of it called cash value that has a poor right of return that when you die they keep your money\nSo our whole life insurance is a horrible financial product\n\nAnd so if you just called me up and you just owned by half a million dollars a whole life I Would say cancel it as soon as you've got your term in ...\nBut you're not paying for it today anyway so today you get your term insurance symbolizes proper on you and your husband\nAnd I I think your husband should have a discussion with his dad and said that um I'm going to go ahead and suggest you drop that policy now I Will not be taking over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you ought to drop it\nRight yeah that's ... like I don't want anything to pay for something I Do not have them because they have like I said\nWell it's not only do I need it because we're not going to take it over and that was the original plan plan has now changed yeah\nCause you to make decisions as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve how are you\nDavid how are you\nDave is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve how are you\nDavid how are you today better than I deserve what's up yeah I have a question uh regarding up part of my retirement savings ... conversation I called a penchant for my company\nAnd that overall is a bad guy eight percent of my total as ... or\n... or ...\n... oh well it's I mean a person it's projected to be a at a projected retirement pay two hundred and eighty four thousand dollars and that is that would be by eight percent of my total have had you know and and\nMy question is whether the cat hair a lump\nSum yes or ... okay\nYes here's why okay if you die or not if you die when you die [laughter] 'cause we're all going to die or get when you die a that money's gone\n'cause it's a ... and you get your ... and you if you have a survivor benefit or something there it might it might go to your spouse for a while but when your spouse you and your spouse die even if there's a survivor benefit the money's gone ...\nAnd if you live are as long as you live it's going to pay at a rate of about five percent in this current market\nSo it's ... if you had an account and the investment advisor said Okay Steve we got an account for you over here two hundred Ninety five thousand you can invest it you make five percent on your money and when you die the money's gone\nBefore you get two hundred and eighty five thousand you can roll into some mutual funds in a good IRA roll over and mutual funds will perform better than five percent and when you die the money stays with your family well that'd be a better deal right\nYes by [laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah versus a hundred percent joint and survivor annuity but ... so\nIt's still you know if you die then yeah you got survivorship on it but when both of you know the same concept to block so the bottom line is it's got a decent but low rate of return while you live but the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you\nDie makes this a bad deal and so you\nAlways take pension lumps on are almost always take Benjamin lumps arms enroll them to IRAs and invest them and good roast duck mutual funds which sounds like your net worth sending system or a million\nBut yeah it's a closer to close but it's been a it's probably about four oh well in their total total network to assets house and so forth\nYou know where ... congratulations [laughter] how old are you I'm sixty three way to go\nHow much of this did you inherit\n[noise] um probably somewhere in a hurry to four hundred range from ... my um my family and my wife ...\nWhere are you a millionaire or that was before that happened\nA\nMillionaire or my wife's mother passed away yes uh when my mom my my parents type relatively young at that point in time not a millionaire no\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar net worth because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\nA holding pattern or because of the amount you know your heritage is ... maybe ... percent ... percent\nSince I was home lowest irrelevant yeah OK cool yes I'm I'm always researching and asking millionaires how they did it for the benefit of our listeners because I got a twenty four year old listening right now that's got the opportunity of hearing from an actual sixty four year old person who actually has a four million dollar net worth what would you tell about twenty four year old how how should they be you when they grow up\n[laughter] [noise]\nWell I certainly you got to a live well below you mean they are a modest lifestyle which uh we have done\nAnd I think also too I I I Know when I was new people do stupid things I've done the stupid things show I think if you can
