broke so I don't know that would be a dumb idea we're not going to do that um what we are going to do is find out two pieces of information one is called the car fleece company that you are paying the ... to ...\nAnd find out what the early buyout on the car is\nNow the early buyout is different than the total of your lease payments pleasure residual value at the end it should be less because you're these leases are very new and there should be it's kind of like an early pay off I'm Alone when it doesn't include all the intro stripped from\nThe time that you know from keeping alone the whole time\nShow the early buyout as your hourly pay off now now that what it's what strikes by the car off and get the title in your hand then you compare that to KB dot com Kelley Blue book dot com private sales what the car is actually worse\nAnd I'll just make up some numbers let's pretend that the early buyout is twenty thousand and then you look it up in the car is actually worse sixteen thousand that would leave you four thousand dollars on the whole probably not far off of what you're going to find\n... four thousand dollars in the home and you sell the car for sixteen you've got to put four thousand dollars cash with the sixteen in order to get the title for the buyer\nAnd so um\nYou have to have that other four thousand dollars to be able to cover the whole richer and the

mainly from my student loans\nAnd um we have fifty six hundred dollars in savings and my question is um we have\nA baby coming and yeah yeah I Wonder if maybe to a um April nineteenth the duty great\nYeah fixated so with that I Would initially gonna use you know get the thousand dollar emergency fund and use forty six hundred to pay off those yeah but not now with the baby I didn't say okay that's what I was wondering what how we should kind of attack that\nWhat I Would suggest she do is push pause on the total moneymaker over okay and pile up cash\nAs big pile as you can pile between now and the time by becomes okay and um\nAnd then whatever you are piled up and and then when mommy and baby come home from the hospital in everybody's fine in April was that event is than behind us in any worries are frets or anything we would have had about that is behind us right\nUm well I mean there's the whole thing of raising the baby but I you know eight eight years yeah there is now but I but basically the you know we want to make sure labor and delivery and everything goes and we don't have any corruption when we got money okay so let's say you save up what what's your household income\nRight now it's about a Seventy seven thousand okay\nSo let's say you save up twenty five thousand hours between now and then got into it and twenty four thousand after you come home from the hospital and push play on your total money make over and take your account down to a thousand dollars and throw it at the at the uh student loan you will have lost no ground\nOkay unless you go maybe spending crazy during the next few months\nWe had a lot of stuff like this is our second child talking you had a lot of stuff the only thing that would be a little bit different in a gated a boy 'cause I have a lot of girls close yeah\nWell there is no but I mean other than that I don't you know what I'm Talking about by by because you've had some friends do that or they just like oh dropped twenty grand to get ready for\nYou know on a pound human being I mean they just go nuts and so if you'll just calm down and just you know manager budget like you were trying to get out of that but it's to the throwing it at the debt you keep everything tight you throw it in a pile of cash\nAnd then we don't spend it on baby a than is necessary for my survival and uh we uh throw it at the dead one by being mommy come home we push play again the pause comes off\nAnd we get out of debt especially if we can but in the meantime\nFilms off and we get out of debt as fast as we can but in the meantime we just created all your loses a little bit of interest on that money between now and the time the babies delivered that's all you lose it's not a big deal Tim is with us in West Palm Beach

just have term\nAnd he said Dave Ramsey talking about the whole law permanent insurance not portfolio they permanent insurance which is what you do is it failed bad\nShall we still didn't get the term\nI I don't know he doesn't know much about Dave Ramsey [laughter] okay Dave Ramsey does not ever invest sounds real clear on the lesson you heard me yeah when you are never tell you under any circumstances to use\nLife insurance as an investment vehicle\nOne hundred percent of the time it sucks\nSo when you say because what we told him I wanted to do it\nWhy would you say you need a new financial advisor that's what I Would show you you don't have a financial advisor you have a life insurance salesman\nOkay the shelling you insurance\nSo what we were thinking we should do it switched to four hundred thousand just the term H. and then that money we were because it was like three hundred dollars a month which I don't want 'em and just go ahead and open up our by Ron R. IRA and start getting money into that\nIn bed with mutual funds okay it's exactly what you learn in class wasn't yeah so you already knew what she said yeah he just language tells me one of those things either this guy's a liar or he's are ignorant\nBut he's a family friend isn't T I'm actually one of our friends did apparently gave them our number ... for as well\nYeah yeah okay so I don't know which is I mean I don't know I don't know but but I Do know that I've never in my life told someone to buy life insurance as an investment under any brand heading name or description ever\nRight and the last thing it on our current policy um on your class he said you know twenty or Thirty years whatever was on ... and our term policy with and can we were eighty with hand\n[laughter] okay\nWhy don't you jump on the sand or insurance dot com and see what you can buy a twenty year level term policy for I think it's going to blow your mind how much this guy's overcharged you for everything you sold your\nCar and you're probably going to end up just canceling everything with him so this kind of really needs a good firing hey\nThat sounds like well Oregon ... I'm In the end of this week\nAll right thank you for calling in and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about using life insurance as an investment vehicle and the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the ... election or number for some reason I heard a Ramsey talk about this\nCase someone else ever brings this up because it does come up periodically um\nThe people who show investment based or\nWhole life or permanent life or portfolio or universal or anything where there is an investment going into insurance are not happy with me they don't like me\nAnd the show they generally try to ignore me or lie about me or something else because I pretty much cost them all a bunch of business\nBecause they sell crap crap in a bag that's what it is okay it's pretty simple so here's the thing when you use\nLife insurance as an investment vehicle hey you get a bad right of return regardless of what they quote you after they take all of their fees which usually in the first two years is one hundred per cent\n\nSometimes up to four years is one hundred percent of what should have gone to the investment goes out and fees even after that you're going to make three four five percent on your money and you should've been a good mutual fund making ten eleven twelve percent on your money\nAnd that's where you should be when you die with cash value\nPermanent portfolio universal indexed universal life insurance they pay only the face amount of the policy not the extra money that you put into the investment that money is gone\nSo you have a savings account that for the first several years I keep all your money after that they give you a better way to return it when you die they keep it all\nSo bad savings account bad investment broker the pay the the\nLife insurance products that give you the opportunity to pay twenty times more\nGive you the opportunity to pay twenty times more than you would pay for term insurance in order that you create an investment inside of the policy\nAre basically the payday lender the middle class their crap and that's what they Ramsey is always at four twenty five years here on the air upset it\nFor twenty five years is alive owned myself I have never owned while this show was operating any kind of whole life or investment based life insurance of any kind\nEver now I did get a horrible northwestern mutual whole life\nGrotesque old school one of the worst of the worst of the whole lives when I was in my early twenties and it was the same way Brittany it was a guy my wife knew from college came around selling right after we got married and we bought this crap from him\nI had it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked the numbers for me and I about kicked my own but when I saw how bad it was and got rid of it and since then I have never owned it and since then I've never told anyone to buy anything\nOther than\nFifteen to twenty two year\nTerm life insurance about ten to twelve times your income on you the best way to buy life insurance is through a broker the shops several companies the best way to buy insurance of any connoisseur a broker that shop several companies and get you the best possible deal\nOr their car insurance your homeowner's insurance your long term care insurance your life insurance or insurance of any kind\nLetter broke her shop among several companies and get you the best kinds of deal and that's why we've indoors for about Twenty years ... insurance\nJeff sander has become a personal friend of mine during that time and I buy my personal life insurance from Zander and I don't own Zander insurance on our own any of it that show that live that's always told about me\nI Would I Would have a whole lot more money if I did um Zander insurance goes Jeff has done rather well due to the day Ramsey endorsement but the reason they done well is he he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price on term life insurance and it takes about like Thirteen seconds\nAnd they don't sell your name the list of people when you go on there either so that's why I've endorsed it's real simple and takes care of you guys you the listener and you need to get term life insurance has been cost that much\nSo just jump in there and do it so Brittany thank you for calling with that question given the opportunity to clarify on that yet again yet again yet again yet again yet again\nYes you need life insurance oh by the way a broker\n... you know like even with your car insurance jump on the air with ... with the help they usually a north local providers for your ... what we call PNC property in casual you got your car and your homeowner's insurance you can shop most people saved three to eight hundred dollars a year on their car\nAnd homeowners when you're shopping among several companies instead of using what we call a captive agents in the business a captive agent can sell for one company like a state for a major foreign nation wide and hatred\nFor Peyton Manning and Brad Paisley can sing to you agent\nWas it nationwide that's nationwide and um [noise] but um and they're both good guys I like both of them it's nothing to do with that what you're paying for those guys when you when you use that insurance it's ... it's built in and neither one of those guys were cheap I'll just tell you\nThis is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nFocus is one of my favorite times of year the kids in school football season is here and people everywhere are preparing for the new routines well while you're in preparation mode think about this when was the last time you checked on your financial plant you heard me or do you even have one\nI listened with a financial plan in place you're more likely to reach your investment goals and the best place to start is by sitting down and talking with an investing professional our smart vest her program helps you quickly fine the only professionals in your area that our team personally works with\nAnd look on oh meeting with a broken feel intimidating especially if you don't

Ramsey dot com\nJust oh I think I Would probably like having anxiety attack it would be bad Carl is with us in Pennsylvania hey Karl welcome ...\nHi Dave thanks for taking my call I appreciate it sure what's up\nCarl welcome to the Dave Ramsey show I gave thanks for taking my call I appreciate it sure what's up hey I've got a good problem that I'm hoping he can give you some advice on I'm forty eight years old would that free uh recently at our house off yeah the way to go\nYeah we're happy about that a decided to sell off some investments just to do that people kind of said well why would you do that\nOther people's money ... interest\nThat's right and I tell you what the peace of mind is great fun you know hey the top of my habits were able to sell some stock options and I've got about five or six hundred thousand dollar that I'm trying to figure out what to do with a mix you\nAbout about the same amount in four one K. which I have to be in the market\nUm I'm a little nervous about possibly also investing the amount of money in the market and I'm\nFive foot homes we for about ten home in the past and I'm thinking about using that money to buy a rental properties no outright mhm and a and B that maybe diversify a little more ... than I Want to hear what your thoughts were on that\nOkay um I think it's excellent if you've got the stomach for real estate real estate gives you a better return than the stock market will give you but it's a higher hassle factor\nYeah it is you know you put money mutual fund they don't bother you\nYou know but you you put put a renter and how much they go around here [laughter] and so there's a ... you know you got the hassle of buying it you got to pay the taxes you gotta pay the insurance I mean they're dealing with managing real estate all the aspects of it is a national fact I've got a bunch of it\nI'm not by far I have more in real estate than I Do in the stock market I met a lot in both\nBut a lot of real estate will give you a better rate of return but it requires\nManagement by you or someone else and even if you have somebody else to what you got to manage the manager you cannot ignore it and so my real estate with an internal right of return which is the tax benefit the the you know that appreciation schedule in other words\nThe actual cash on cash return the ... modest expenses as a return on investment and the growth in value you put those three things together and real estate you get the actual returns which is called the intern right of return the IRR\nOkay which you would compare to a mutual fund right of return to do apples to apples higher hassle factor but most of my real estate is Seventeen to twenty percent right of return I are are\nNot casual cash is about ten\nOkay or a little less in some of it okay but uh I our our total with the increases in value and other stuff so I'm making more on that than I Am on the road to ... on the other maybe double what on that are making a mutual fund but I've got a lot more hassle with it\nI mean I'm you know even though I don't management of my son in law runs our our real estate company and he manages all of it and I don't I don't put up I don't personally\nDeal with a renter or something like that or anything or vacancy or a broken air conditioner all that he deals with all that stuff but but you know I went over all the ... this morning with him and to see how the properties are doing we check on him and he's telling me the stories all the drama he gets to deal with and such is real estate but I Love real estate do\nYou have to ask if our question I'm sure they might price point was a hundred thousand dollar house so at five hundred thousand [laughter] I have I can get five home mhm I'm all in a hundred thousand each now so I Am I on them out right all the rents minus expenses are free and clear or somebody else said wanting to buy three\nAnd four fifty percent\nYeah well I don't ... you you know I don't\nI don't think I Know your answer there on a\nLeveraging I I'm not going to leveraging the I don't I ... I Want the extra pain in the butt of dealing with a banker on top of this right and on top of that I got risk and it just takes all the joy out of this whole discussion um what's the average price point in your area nationwide it's a little over two hundred thousand\nYeah probably about that I mean I can get a three bedroom one bath three bedroom two bath for about a hundred maybe a hundred and twenty ... single family home yeah\nI I'm probably gonna bump on up in the hundred and fifty range in you and do three\nThree one fifty one Seventy five is right in there or rather than five ones and

money you make a little bit it'll be fine pay some taxes on it and if you want to launch a Roth IRA for her or something\nThe point here in this situation is when you have a kid running a business to\nThe point is not the business\nThe point is what the kid is learning\nThey're learning work they're learning interface with customers on how to treat people ah they're learning that they have to deliver on time they have to deliver quality they're learning how to put prices on something or they're learning that it's a good thing to make a profit to capitalism is not evil\n... that these are the lessons are what is important\nTo understand that he actually if she makes some money that's just a bonus\nRight but what ... what are you what you've identified as you've identified the way this kid is wired and a lot of us that are entrepreneurial are are a lot or at least a little bit ADD [laughter] right right I mean how much will pass anything the shiny I run towards it you know since\nI'm sure you know but I ... if you start maybe but it starts in like a hundred thousand dollars a year or something you may want to do and they all asleep but if you if you're making under a hundred grand where the profit\nI have a national you know unless you just hit some bizarre thing or something like home depot wants to buy or out or something I don't know but you know what you're trying to do is teach her the lessons of how to set up operate a business deliver on time\nFollow through responsibility the character of work ethic those kinds of things that you have to have to run a business initiative\nAnd it's a wonderful thing to teach a team or pre teen like that is absolutely fabulous so much so that Anthony O'Neill here on our team put together the teen entrepreneurial entrepreneur tool box it's a box of teaching age for parents to work with their kids on how to start and run a business\nAnd as you know we have a student loan crisis with a half a trillion dollars\nIn student loan debt we have an entire department within our company called Ramsey education\nThat puts a curriculum and the high schools and in the colleges across America we are now and forty percent of the high schools teaching high schoolers this common sense stuff of staying out of that and being on a budget and learning to save money and all of that kind of thing\nAnd what happens from time to time as the schools can't afford the basic resources and so someone will come a long shot in the community of business or an entity of some kind and we'll pay for that high school to have\nFoundations in personal finance curriculum from the Ramsey organization is that we've got about four million students go through one of the coolest things that's happened lately is the University of Wyoming\nHas decided that every high school in the entire state of Wyoming needs to have this curriculum and they're sponsoring it in paying for it\nDang dang touchdown baby\nThat's how that happens the college university says we're going to take care of these high schoolers\nIn our state and make sure they learn about money and of course University of Wyoming is the best cost alternative in the Wyoming area to go to college so this all works out really really good now Tyler Moore is with me on the line and\nKyle is from the University of Wyoming usually associate vice provost of enrollment Kyle White uh go man thank you for doing that\nWell it's a pleasure to be with you and thanks for that we are certainly Saturday here in the state of Wyoming to be able to partner with a Ramsey education and provide some practical\nApplicable being\nFor students to be able to apply that college search and and and be real fatty consumer higher education\nYeah because you guys do have low tuition I mean you're you're you're you're the best deal round I wasn't getting right\nYes there we are we have the lower resident tuition any public institution that grant doctoral degrees anywhere in the United states\nOf all fifty states of all the ... so like your cheaper than my University of Tennessee or your cheaper than the University of dot dot dot that's correct\nVery cool very cool and I got to tell you when I heard what your whole promotion was\nVery cool and I got to tell you when I heard what your whole promotion was\nBehind this I immediately wanted to steal it and bring it and use it somewhere in like in the University of Tennessee and I'll tell you were doing a few minutes but I Will get them to do it yeah you guys are creative I Love this tell everybody about this uh about this campaign and the the motto for the campaign is hands down the best thing I've heard\nSo that our our campaign is called the world needs more cowboys\nWe're we're not talking about guys and cowboy hats that ride off into the sunset but we're talking about a state with a long heritage and a university mascot and a cowboy that can be\nAnyone from any gender any background but we're talking about that enters here we're talking about a curiosity independence boldness\nAt pursuit of adventure and we're talking about someone who changes landscapes and and books for opportunities to make differences in the world we are talking about trailblazers and people exemplify the spirit of the underdog you know it's not a cowboy isn't\nWhat you are but it's who you are\nYeah well and you guys are the cowboys I mean so it's a play on words obviously I mean if you're a mascot right\nThat looked at your football team your basketball team whatever's the cowboys I mean like my University of Tennessee Volunteers I think they ought to steal it inside of the world needs more volunteers that makes it just as much sense right and so as good I play on words but you you guys got though that you got to the table first with this way to go man I Love it\nIt's a great motto ed 'cause it says so much in just a so few words very very cool well we're really grateful to all of our sponsors around the country that are helping us and\nYou got sponsoring the high school every high school in Wyoming is going to have\nAs a coming up soon the the high school curriculum because the cowboys paid for it [laughter]\nThat's pretty cool guile thank you man\nWe're happy to be happy to be a partner we uh we are we are state that is very practical where state that very much um applicable in terms of being smart with our money we wanted to make sure that we were not leaving out our opportunity to educate the future generations\nAnd know that there are opportunities in higher education to be smart with your money to be smart about that investment and your future and the University of Wyoming is a way to do that and we're we're helping helping our students in our future generation and the state of Wyoming through the Ramsey education product\nWell it's one of those when when when things as far as I'm concerned because you're\nYou know you're you're helping them by sponsoring this ... going in there we're blessed because you're doing it with us and we appreciate that I'm In the winter is is that you get to put the University of Wyoming cowboys right in front of every high school student and remind them that's where they ought to go to college\nThere sometimes people do silly things like wander across the state line I've talked to a lot of ... around the country I'm my own chancellor and vice chancellor of the University of Tennessee and it's a constant thing\nThe ... the state is trying to woo their own residence to their own university and it's become a thing you gotta you gotta go after it don't you\nYes sir absolutely and we have a lot of great students here in the state of Wyoming and there are a lot of great students across the country who need to know that there are opportunities even out of state but you have to be\nSmart and you have to do your due diligence in that process of searching for higher education in addition to being the lowest cost per resident tuition Doctorow ranting institution\nWe're near the very lowest for non residents to come to Wyoming so we have a lot to offer not just here in the great state of Wyoming but from coast to coast north and south we can be a solution that provide students an incredible opportunity for education\nAnd we're going to be very very good at making sure that we are\nHelping a student be successful not just students success and part of that is not racking up a lot of debt at the end of their degree completion I meant so how many students on your campus\nWe have we have a little over or twelve thousand so twelve thousand a little over twelve thousand four hundred students here that are called himself the cowboys\nYou know that's a good size school that's not too big another's mall that's a that's a that's just right those are ... deal just right very cool very cool ... it's an honor to talk to you again brother thank you for coming on with us\nThank you very much a best wishes to you and your team there in uh in Tennessee and we appreciate the opportunity to say the world needs more cowboys\nI Love it I Love the motto and I think the world doesn't even more cowboys in so many ways [laughter] good stuff I got a little picture John Wayne going in my head I can't help but it's just the way it is but\nA bottom line is lesser mascot and so now it's a\nVery cool stuff I Love it and what a neat thing that the college the University of the state is buying it for every single high school now if you're a business or university and you'd like to do something like that maybe you don't have to maybe don't have the money to buy the whole state or something every high school in the states some states have more high schools and others can you imagine you know\nBut uh um you know maybe you just want to do it to the hospital used to go to um I went over spoke to at them in the building where I used to go to high school the other day and snow middle school\nSo I had all the forty really bright and shiny little eighth graders looking at me that's the hardest speaking you'll ever have all this\nUm but no this is Anthony O'Neill's got tough job you're all but a pretty cool it's pretty cool to go back over there and you know if it wasn't by the way that the school has our curriculum furniture to them on the sponsor on that [noise] but\nSee
