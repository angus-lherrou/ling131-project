now moved to an international level Chris you guys are very involved in that aspect part of the reason you're in Texas today\nThat's correct a it was\nThe international while I crime stop has actually been around since Nineteen eighty eight three eighty nine but it wasn't until a few years ago when we realized we kind of took the game warden approach them for for many years we got together around the nation that game wardens just shared information ideas and we kinda kept it to ourselves\nA few years ago we met and we decided why are we why is this organization why are we not operating this organization the way we work where we get the public involved and get the word out there and worldwide get people working together to stop poaching\nWe know there's numerous organizations out there that are conservation minded they're they're anti poaching and all that but there's not many organizations that provide the actual enforcement and go after these people and that's what we're all about\nAnd and as this gentleman was saying down here we absolutely cannot catch poachers without the without the help of the public we can go out and get a few\nBut the bulk of our major cases where you read about these cases were multiple deer were caught a were were killed multiple anything most of these cases come from the relationship the game or to have with the sporting public and and\nI

the voter registration\nLet me talk to you about um Martha McSally in Arizona because I think ...\nIs not fit the serve based on what she said and Martha McSally first woman attacked pilot in combat history in America I Can't believe that's going to be close but I just can't\nI Can't see that being any more than two points in either direction\nAnd I think that that one is is done yet I think that that by the way Martha McSally clearly has the momentum and this caravan that's making its way to the border believe me in the research I've done in Arizona\nImmigration is the number one issue and they are set up with people coming across the border with out\nEfficient effective border security that has said democratic challenger is very tough\nWell known in Arizona and that one is still too close to call\nYou know what's good news there is a doozy is robbing and the governor's race I'm back to big pharma one more word on the caravan I ah it's up to according to some reports eleven thousand other reports fourteen thousand and it's getting amazing press conference how does that play in the elections Frank\nThe public looks that goes from says why do we have no control over our borders why is it still happening to us and they ... and here's what's interesting\nAh the vast majority of Americans want to compromise they're willing to accept a path\nTo legal status or citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants would so the so called DREAM Act in return for some sort of a barrier and genuine border security with the American people are saying is first fix the border then\nWhy should we punish those who came here to no fault of their own I Know a lot of your listeners don't like that second part but the majority of Americans support\nBoth actually my audience is very much beyond that my audiences profound some pro regular as they shouldn't be on DACA my audience is reasonable it's Ninety percent of Ninety percent agree\nPeople that were in the country already or not lawbreakers can stay but we want to double sided strong called fence with a road between it and I know my I I've been talking about this for Fifteen Years of my audience there you'll find other audiences that are harder line but my audience is very\nVery smart very apple and very educated very a Christian memory fades failed people who do not want to punish anyone\nNow Frank what should a Republican candidate B. saying about drug prices what should they be saying\nAbout big firemen and you also it's also ... I don't know my brother worked for almost seven years as a research toxicologist for big pharma I Know the good that they do the drugs we developed everybody gets that but this pricing is crazy what should have Republicans say on the stump about big pharma\nThat they should get it if the pharmaceutical companies refused to do it voluntarily\nThe public does not want to invade the free market system but they don't want Americans pay more than Canadian that if they will not let were drug prices here as they've done in in other countries that Americans should be allowed to purchase drugs under FDA supervision says nobody wants that the high line to be\nPoisoned by the American should be able to purchase drugs across the border and that one change about\nThe pharmaceutical companies will bring down their prices that you cannot have a situation where people are literally literally dying\nBecause of the pursuit of profitability I remind you of conservatives do believe in the free market system but they also believe that monopoly should be broken up and then when you have cartels they should be challenged that's what you've got in this situation\nNo secretaries are of H H us has been against on my show what he's talking about transparency and pricing that's really what the ah new regulations coming out of the department of health and Human Services are about will that feel the need or does more than that need to be done Frank was\nMore than that needs to be done at least one of the public perspective because knowing that you're paying the highest prices on the face ... doesn't help\nIt's actually finding a way that they will still be profitable but that people will be able to afford the medications they didn't want competition in the marketplace they want the ability to buy cheaper medications if they are available and\nThe tired of all this money going into things\nIssues if they are available and the tired of all this money going into things other than research and development when they claim that all the money that they're spending is going into research and development they want it Saturday noticed them and they don't feel like to have it now\nOkay I Would like a very quick response to the bombs I Believe that the FBI when they up seven to eight or nine bombs are more new bumps being tonight report it as we speak in lower Manhattan but they'll be able to find a sending that we can get the FBI that much evidence without creating a trail unless\nIt's a hostile foreign nation using professionals which is I'm not ruled that out what do
