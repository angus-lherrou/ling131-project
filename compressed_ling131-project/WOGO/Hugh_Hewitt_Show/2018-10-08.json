let me read do Michael I have a common the Washington Post today you know I'm a contributing columnist over there and\nIt's paragraph as Trump is as we're seeing today as Andrew Jackson must have been in Eighteen twenty nine to the people of both parties or used to different rules set by can be done in one of them that's my criticism to the present or many in detail but my fear of the wild I laughed\nIs far greater than my discomfort with his bowl in China shop politics the left we\nSaw this weekend last contrast on favorably with the president's hyperbole an occasional cruelty the left is now in snarling\nEnraged collective screen it so I think they took the Trump issue and throw it away because I don't like cruel you most Americans\nDon't like cruelty or they don't like unfairness but boy was that mob and the Senate and the house and bursting through the barricades at the Supreme Court that's an image that is going to stick with the people in in Montana and North Dakota and in Missouri and in Florida I mean that is not what the Democrats needed\nWell I don't I so I I don't want to necessarily associate myself with with your characterization doors re with your general said\nKeep in mind the one thing you which is that if people see the events differently depending on their perspective and their land while I agree with you that there's a big chunk of the population of how we can see that like you do the the one\nGroup that I'm not certain number of people in the middle the moderate independents a true independent that people who just called them do that but the true independents will they see a mob rushing through the capital or will they see victims of\nThese women who are in the attic\nWho wanted to be heard and will their anger at the Democrats\nYou know you know be the kind of visceral anger that you have that motivate them to vote against Democrats or will they be conflicted like uh some of those so to some of the senators or at least the Murkowski in Alaska Republican but you know who he sort of came down the other way I just don't know\nAnd and I and I am at least open to the possibility that that that if people saw these events in different in different ways to a different context\nThat's what I had thirty nine women first time caller is on friday show thirty nine it never happened there was an avalanche I've been doing this since Nineteen Ninety it's the only show I've ever had like that all of them\nUm many of them survivors met a psychiatrist a few prosecutor is a long haul truck driver widow mother of seven I mean I had I

a thirty five year old allegation without contemporaneous corroboration but a lot of sympathy Michael ... did not generate any sympathy and that\nIs the accusation without back up but I think scared people against which the backdrop of the demonstrators in screaming um it wasn't the person who confronted flake so much I think it was outside the capital and birth to the barricades at the Supreme Court I've just never seen that before\nYeah although you know you and I both been around long enough there's\nThere's passion that that I mean I've seen passionate like that I Can't remember if there's was where somebody tried to burst through a barricade at the court but I but I but I don't disagree with you that um the ... um his presence as part of it which I mean he's he's he's viewed so much as a\nA kind of I'm a control part isn't kind of attack dog\nI'm so that immediately you know cast a of a particular character on those accusations and then the accusations from his plate we're so outrageous that wild that I Do think they colored people's perceptions of the whole uh of the whole ...\nYeah I agree ... last question what do you make them better and the Trump Kim Jong or the election\nI think you're probably right I I don't have any reporting necessarily to say that it's for sure but I think you know might then\nWould be that he would probably want to do that I don't know uh I assume it probably is a plus politically for the president but talk about a wild card you just do a you know meet maybe a meeting goes extremely smoothly like the last one but maybe it doesn't
