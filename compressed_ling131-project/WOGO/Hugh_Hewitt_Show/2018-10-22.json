friend Ron dissenters congressman extraordinary Harvard law school graduate navy veteran deployed with the seals in Iraq is a terrific guy\nWho's up against the mayor of Tampa Andrew Gillum and they had a a no holds barred a doll house excuse me I'm miracle as your data no holds barred debate last night moderated by Jake Tapper we played a little bit of this cut number two\nI Want to bring up an issue that is that it's been a flagging each one of the aisle start with you a merry go on the FBI has been investigating potential corruption in Tallahassee now for three years the probe appears to include lobbyists\nAnd former a campaign treasure refer you Adam Corey you've been trying to distance yourself from Korea but you've been friends with him for more than a decade and two trips he took together are part of the investigation how plant can Floridians trust your judgment when someone under FBI investigation was part of your inner circle\nYeah well you know we all have friends that sometimes let us down and uh the truth is is let me be very clear about what the record is I I Am not under FBI investigation and neither neither is my city government\nAre and what we have done is we welcome that men if there is someone who is done something wrong they ought to be held fully accountable for their actions we made every public record available on a public me searchable website and our city a contrast how I dealt with the FBI by comparison to how Mr distinctive deals with the FBI\nOr he has gone out of his way before he quit his job in Congress to protect a Donald Trump or to curb the inquiry by Mr Mahler\nOr he is gone even so far as to suggest that some deep state is that worked to undermine the president say I mean he's a conspiracy theory if you will so if you take the way we dealt with their investigation as opposed to how Mr dissenters has dealt with it I'll take our example every single day of the\nThe difference between a Andrew me that when I get with the FBI is a prosecutor I was working hand in hand with them to bring people in the justice when Andrew deals with um he's dealing with an undercover agent posing as a contractor who he was on a junket with a New York city you went to a Broadway show without undercover FBI agent you went to Costa Rica with these\nTo a Broadway show with an undercover FBI agent you went to Costa Rica with the same lobbyists and guess what happened\nThe lobbyists that wine and dine Andrew they got a two million dollar grant from the city government so to me corruption is when you're in a position of power you're getting something you shouldn't have had he shouldn't have gotten the Broadway tickets he shouldn't have gotten the trip to Costa Rica and then you give something to someone in return he gave two million dollars today is your name lobbyist\nBam bam bam I don't know how Andrew Gillum wins this thing you run to the census is eight straight shooting prosecutor Harvard law school graduate navy veteran and Florida is booming now they've been hit very hard by hurricane including Michael most recently\nAnd they if they give their stayed over to Andrew Gillum who cannot run Tallahassee what do they expect to have happened down there\nThe election is turning towards the Republican President Trump's approval up to forty seven percent unemployment I I told you earlier that story in Minnesota's amazing unemployment in Minnesota is two or three percent or excuse me two point nine percent that's not actually unemployment\nBut that's below full employment that just people you know people quit move and do things like that it's it's remarkable what is going on in this country's economy do you want to hand it over to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer do not vote for one Democrat not one at any level\nThe country needs to grow it absolutely needs to grow and the president also we need the best military in the world he talked about that last number five\n[noise] we [noise] we secured seven hundred

it here and we're not going to do it on my watch or secretary of state\nBrian Kemp fewer I've got a steady lead over Stacey Abrams I mean in every poll it's two points or more and to a certain extent

consuming in shorter and shorter hot takes right now and that means we have less and less wisdom\nI mean there is actually lots of data showing Americans reading significantly less than Thirty years ago if everybody were reading Lewis like that or even lion the witch and the wardrobe or or the weight of glory and other s as\nThere is so much weight there that starts from that assumption of a modern day\nSo to the Judeo Christian tradition the assumption that people are created in the image of God and they have dignity soul humans soles are immortal and so if you treat people like that it means that even if I differ with somebody on policy and there's lots of legislative\nPriorities in policies that you're going to differ with your neighbors about\nThat doesn't change the fact that they're a human worthy of dignity created in God's image and ... at descendant of a line before them and maybe the parents of line that's coming after them\nAnd if my neighbor for doors down and I completely on this in my view the stupidity of a Fifteen dollar minimum wage and all the economic destruction that will cause that doesn't change the fact that we're going to root for the Oscars together and I'm going to sweep their kid up in my driveway if she skins are neat falling off the bike like\nThat not that go ahead that is the that is the rediscovery of community but NO PLAN for me senator says to a problem which I've been talking about all morning\nThere were seven thousand human beings marching towards our border they are human beings they are embargo day they they deserve dignity but at the same time our laws cannot be kept up to the mob you can't march into America and if seven thousand people can mix them all be fourteen thousand then I'll be fifty thousand\nHow do you want to frame what we ought to do about this for the public\nYeah so let's go back and and this is not a you know just trying to blame the prior administration because I Want to be clear our immigration problem started decades and they called me\nThree huge part of this problem is in twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen when we didn't send the clearer signal and Central America that the assumptions that people and especially bad people I mean they don't have the image of God but we can distinguish what we had more time between\nThe electrical righteousness and civil rights but human traffickers are in Central America\nTold people they told moms and dads when they were trying to take big payments out of that to say we can get your kids into the U.S\nThey told them that the U.S is catch and release policy in twenty Thirteen fourteen meant that if you got to the border you were basically guaranteed admission and passage into the U.S the U.S has to have borders every nation has to have orders and if you're going to secure your border\nThat means you will and it stopped the upstream hurt in this case downstream the goals\nThat are telling people our policies are so dumb that if you can get to the border and turn yourself into a border patrol agent we can't pet process the backlog and civil immediately just release these migrants straight into the U.S and they'll have a six month pass until there trial date and some super majority of them I don't know the current statistics\nBut I asked the percentage of them don't ever show up for their trials that are for their deportation trial that was stupid and now we have a big problem because these assumptions have been set for so long we need to send a signal\nThat the U.S has border is hard and getting harder and needs to be heart and more\nAnd that you won't get in under the dumps catch and release policy and at the same time we need to make sure that the ways that we communicate that continue to articulate the US's grand vision of seven and a half billion people could being creative with dignity that doesn't mean you get free passage into the United states of America\nYou know the fence must be the outward expression of an invisible resolved to both control your border but be a welcoming country and let me play for you then as we talked a lot senator during the confirmation of justice cabin up\nChuck Todd on meet the press on friday has been all over the country doing what I'm doing doing meet and greets with voters whose conclusion ... number four\nIn my travels this week\nNo Democrat was set on the record\nAmazing how consistent some of them were people running some of them will be ... some of them will be voting although we're going\nWashing up some of them went by name name tech some of these [laughter] these are Democrats out campaign trail frustrating to cap it off\nTo stop the math so Ben Sasse why the Rick oil I think Chuck is right I've heard the same thing it's in the polling there's a window that the Republicans back what is it about those proceedings the cause of America to shutter\n[noise] well I I I'm going to be delicate about this because I I think the backdrop is the gender gap in America now thirty five no I'm no I'm you know ah\nTrying to think ooh my ... my favorite pollster of the moment as unbearable bowling expert but when you have a gender gap a plus thirty five um historically Republicans usually trial you know for ten point\nAh with women um when you have plus twenty five with women and now for Democrats and now a plus for teenage or for Republicans with men sometimes just fundamentally broken in the country so there's a lot to say that isn't just about the Kavanaugh hearings um but I think in the cabinet hearings\nYou saw an attempt to politicize and hijack the me too movement and make it something\nYou saw an attempt to politicize and hijack the me too movement and bake it something that is owned by partisans in Washington DC I'm I think to be to live with is incredibly important because I Do think we have a culture of a lot of sexual violence in this country and I think the V. chip in his on that a very good thing\nBut I think you saw it in the cabin not hearing an assumption that politicians can just grab any cultural movement and do what they want with it\nAnd the reality is we have a long\nTradition and the British and American legal tradition\nOf rights not just of the accuser but of the accused\nAnd there were people talking rhetorically around the cabin on hearings like there's no such thing as a right of the accused and I think I'm ... moms and dads don't want that for their sons they don't have a sexual violence for their daughters but they want a world where there's a lot more cautious deliberation that was that was happening and that media circus\nA very quick exit a senator in my case it says to justice love kind of ... with your God that's kind of internalizing every Christian in America and Jews as well I don't think kindness was on board and justice was certainly not present in that Senate proceed\nNo you're right I mean that the the big gap there where politics and politics for instance TV um happens like that for so many people who are the politically addicted class of Washington\nThat is because I think and again why I wrote the book them of of upstream things that are happening where a digital revolution is undermining combat community the nuclear family is in statistical collapsed in America deep\nFriendship has been cut in half and the last twenty seven years in America job to ration is getting shorter local worshipping communities are declining or becoming so large that their suburban commuter campuses all of that undermining of place and the stick relationship inevitably undermines our ability to think about our neighbor as hope people\nNot just partisans on the other side of the political while politics are important but if it's the senator life something is fundamentally broken\nWe will come back and talk more about them next week the new book by Senator Ben Sasse when back in my voice is whole senator says thank you really factor dot
