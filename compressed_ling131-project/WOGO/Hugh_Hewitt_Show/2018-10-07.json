decided to keep the fish and take it home where he could give it a closer look at when he got there what he discovered was quite a shock\nHe had caught a large mouth bass the first ever caught at Alaska there are no native ... species in Alaska as a matter of fact the nearest populations are over one thousand miles away so how on earth did it get just sand lake\n[laughter] the investigation is on nobody knows it's a head scratcher\nLast weekend alone Wyoming game and fish personnel had to deal with for grizzly bears occupying a corn may near Clark, Wyoming over near what PT\nThree grizzlies were frequenting a residential area eating pet food and were filmed trying to enter the back door of the ... an occupied house several reports of folks having to deploy bears spray and dealing with aggressive bears\nYeah generally up here in the northeast um I don't hunt during the day predators or you can do it and as I Know some guys at um do do it\nBut you're probably four to five times more likely to call predator in at night they're more nocturnal now when I go out west to Nebraska or some other states or you know if I go down into I was down New Mexico and the\nDaylight hunting is no problem you know there's you know especially if you're hunting coyotes the\nCoyotes throughout the United states there's different subspecies so they act different um they respond different there are more light shy up here in the northeast and they are out west or down south\nAnd a day like calling is a very productive I Know we we should quite a bit when we go out to Nebraska during the day\nUm we do a few nights Hans out there and and this just as productive as it is in a day so they're they're pretty much equal but here in the northeast up in Pennsylvania New York Ohio you know nighttime is going to be your best time to pursue those predators\nWill you are set up for thirty minutes we will call and if you don't see anything move on to you sit there for three hours told me about your set up how long that last\nYeah generally I'm an set up between not thirty minutes to forty five minutes now\nThat's not to say that if I have and I'm working on a group of coyotes that I might not stay longer I might even move a hundred two hundred yards\nUm and try to um a challenge to the uh the alpha male and the group or try some other tactic to try to get them to come in and I might say an hour and a half um but generally speaking if I'm just going from\nStand to stand I'll go about forty minutes I'm On average give or take and then I'll eat I'll go at least a mile between my stance\nIn when I'm fishing for chicken always small mouth bass when I when I catch one and I'm bringing into the boat in Clearwater a lot of times there's two or three more trailing along behind him coming in with Amy ... base that he's got in his mouth after you shoot a coyote or a bobcat or Fox or whatever\nDo you get out of there and go find another spot or is it worth hanging around a little while\nActually has an excellent question um [noise]\nI actually stay there um\nHave a a photograph of a we have ten predators that we shot it was for coyotes and six Fox and we only went to five stands so if we only been five stand and we shot ten predator show you we were able to call in multiple predators per stance\nWhen I won't either my partner I shoot I usually go to a distress sound or a top the stress of a ... and then we sit down and we get ... for five minutes and then we continue to call\nAnd just because you shoot one you know the hunt is not over you stay there you keep calling and you will be surprise you can call to even three in on one sand and\nYou know I see that a lot of the people who do the high fives after they shoot they go you know after five minutes calling and that's fine but you've probably given up for educators some of the other ... that were coming in to the to the call so sit tight sit quiet for a little bit and then continue to call and you'll be surprised how many other writers you will\nBe um he will actually call in and have success on\nWe're going to get into some of your calling in because she's a little bit later on because you really smart about that and have a lot to share with an audience over calling can be a problem and I don't want to talk about over calling us on a set up or how long have you called I Want to talk about a piece of property\nOr if you heard that place a one night how long will you wait before you go back\nI usually wait at least you know um it would depend on the weather obviously but about at least three weeks to four weeks before I'll hit that same spot again and if I did hit the same spot I Try to do it at a different time of the night so if I was at seven PM or ATM\nYou know this month I might wait next month and headed to three in the morning\nAlso try to shut up on a little different areas of property now the wind is going to dictate where we set up but you know if possible we'll try up on a different area and we've been very successful with that I mean I can tell you all one location in particular we hit three times during the winter season so we were there three different times\nOver a period of about three and a half months and we scored every time and multiple all predators each time\nI have always set up with my nose pointing directly into the wind taught you about that and I've been doing this wrong or not necessarily wrong but not the best way maybe you like to heart across wins\nIt was wrong not necessarily wrong but not the best way maybe you like to heart across when\nWell yeah I mean you know you never going to have the wind perfect\nFor you on every single set so you have to improvise I mean I like the wind in my face of possible because number one I'm parking my vehicle I'm walking into the wind so I'm not nothing is smelling me going in\nBut you know you're not always going to have that I like cross when I'm just as much as I I like to hunt a window strictly in my face because you know a predator generally speaking it's not all the time sometimes they'll just break all the rules and just come rushing right in\nBut most of the time as you're approaching to your call they're going to try to angle downwind or try to get downwind of you\nSo you have to be able to see down when and if I'm Out in the open and shut up and the winds cross when I Want to be able to make sure whether it's blowing left or right that I can see that down when sides because eventually that predator is going to try to angle that in that location and you have to stop them before you get your when sent and make the shot\nYou ever set up decoys or ... or ... and water the pros and cons there\nYeah I mean I don't think there's anything wrong with the cause I don't use them um I have used them during the day like hunts you know when if I was hung out west there in Texas are there some other states where you know you're you're going to um have good success during the day because I understand this\nDaylight hunting and night hunting is like night and day literally because when you're daylight hunting you want the predator to concentrate away from you so you want to be camouflaged you want to be up and get your outline up against some brush or something to break up your outline\nAnd you want your call your ... out in front of you because you want that predator to concentrate on that the call and call and keep his eyes off and you say you have a little bit more movement and then you can make a shot at nighttime\nYou're using your light is your camouflage concealment but you want them to look at you at night because you're able to see their eye reflection from your skin and you're able to use that light as your concealment so\nYou want to call close to you and to declare really wanting the I'm really a benefit in my opinion because they really can't see anything behind that light anyway I'm not saying that they they couldn't be beneficial if used and you know the right circumstances\nJoe ... they were going to come back and talk about calling calling intricacies and normal something from you there and actually do a little salt and can you hang around I sure can predator\nHunting and exciting and all the way to get a youngster started in the outdoors my thanks to my friends for the for a for bringing us this quarter the

a couple of minutes where the guy who knows everything about him I'm convinced Tom docket welcome back to the show on a lot of the water fell seasons up when seasons are starting to open up now and during the course of a hunting season going back to last year some times if\nWe're more involved in the hot and watching the birds rather than the dogs you know bad habits can occur and then they occur over and over again in the ... regular routine for a\nGood idea to guard against that during the hunting season itself\nYou know what I mean he is a lot of people don't you know the hunting season or for quite a while they didn't really write down inventory but things that went wrong we have a tendency to go like that was the greatest season my dog never did anything wrong\nAnd we never missed a doctor so that kinda stuff but it does happen retrievers in general if we're going to have the tuna dog back up after a season where a client shaken a dog and and taking them out hunting [noise]\nTwo things normally come to mind the dog probably got into a breaking habit you know maybe he didn't break till you know you're shot the gun and go oh that's okay Amy he waited a least till I shot but that's going to get worse he's going to get to the point where\nWhen he sees ducks coming and he's just going to budge shot to the wine and try to get a we always work on a steady drills with the retrievers\nAnd then we're going to work basic obedience and and you don't have to be out on a hundred acres to do this law that's just yard work reinforcing they'll sing and then when we come into that first ...\nHours to get people if you've got a buddy with you\nWork the dog on the first couple of blocks put your gun down make sure that\nWork the dog on the first couple of blocks put your gun down make sure the dog's doing his job right let your buddy showed\nAnd then you're you know back in in order so\nUh it's paying attention to detail because you can have a dog that year after year it gets better and better Oregon to have a dog year after year gets worse and worse and yeah it can absolute bad habits can can grow if we ignore them or or leave them alone so there is a good steady drill anything else comes to mind that we can do in the backyard maybe if we don't\nHave a buddy there ourselves well another thing we get back to that steady drill most people if they're working or retrieving dog what they're gonna do go to the back yard pro dummy have the dog sit and wait and then send them for the retreat but yeah the dog is really anxious I mean he's just right on the verge of just I'm going to break but he doesn't [noise]\nI'll do a little drill where you can throw a dummy\nThrown other dummy thrown other dummy thrown other dummy\nMake the dog sit there and just go pick them up yourself and you go well isn't that the dog's job but what happened to the dog that super antsy you do this drill for a little bit [noise] and all of a sudden he starts to relax he goes just because I've seen some Paul\nDoesn't mean I'm going to get to go in and it just kind of calm down and then you know if you have somebody who can help you out you get you know incorporate the gun and shoot some\nIssues some blanks out and then do that same thing and you'll just see a calming effect come over the dog over a period of time and then send them for one make 'em sit through that drill against a ... it's just mixing things up but most people when they work on studying this\nThey don't have to work on retrieving these are working on a steady enough so that that's a big difference and you're just you're building desire and that dog to go do it\nRight and you know some dogs you're trying to build desire and other ones you're trying to curb it you know to work right and the ones that are breaking constantly you normally have to curb it\nHigh on my jacket with ducks unlimited TV and when I'm Out in the great outdoors I'm thinking about it with big belly candor
