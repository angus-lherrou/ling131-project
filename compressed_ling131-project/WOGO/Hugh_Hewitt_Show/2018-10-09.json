the ... of Sunday's Los in Detroit\nThey tried with whitewater and and ah ... it'd be Ken Starr and Monica Lewinsky and indeed this is just the latest in a line of sort of increasingly desperate things Democrats or Republicans have resorted to to try to take down Bill Clinton it was viewed in that context\nAnd and it's it's it's language I I've seen on the other side in relation to the Ford in ... in the last week\nNo yeah it's it it will resonate with everyone on every level but let's dig into the nineties I think probably the seminal moment is not the election of Bill Clinton do that is for history but for politics\nIt's the counter revolution in Nineteen Ninety four I was live on PBS in LA I hosted the local PBS show with Patt Morrison kind of medics when we went live on Nineteen Ninety four I can remember Claire Isabel if it was a fight they stop it\nIt was such a traumatic event for the Democrats fifty two house seats lost nine Senate seats you know that Richard Shelby switch parties after what made the carnage even worse I don't know that\nTwenty ten or twenty fourteen whereas traumatic to the political system is Nineteen Ninety four what do you think Steve cracking\nI completely agree and one of the reasons twenty ten and twenty fourteen weren't as traumatic was because we'd been through Nineteen Ninety four and and I had to put it in\nPerspective for folks who who who weren't following it back then or maybe a forgotten a little bit I mean it had been forty years in Nineteen Ninety four since Republicans had control the house and they hadn't even been close\nYou know we've got a midterm coming up right now we're Democrats are at a gain of twenty three seats away it's it it may may not happen but it's doable for them and and it seems like every election we go into these days it's it's conceivable that control the house could switch um it was inconceivable for\nDecades in American politics from the fifties into the Nineteen nineties\nThe Republicans would control the house it was known as the permanent Democratic Congress\nThe speaker's gavel was it was handed down almost like a hereditary tool um from one democratic speaker to another or Republicans were you know eighty Ninety a hundred seats buried in the majority in the minority excuse me\nAnd it was an expectation heading into Nineteen Ninety four that\nIt would be a good year for Republicans you know the Clinton presidency had been very rocky his approval rating\nWas pretty low but the the thought going into election night Ninety four with a a good night Republicans will pick up the Senate and make a dent in the house um when the return started coming in and I mean things started happening that night like a speaker of the house Tom Foley\nLost re election in his home district that hadn't happened since the civil war or Dan Rostenkowski this just sort of old bowl chair of the ways and Means Committee he'd been um he was later you know prosecuted but I'm a Dan Rostenkowski lost his seat in Chicago I mean this is this is like\nIs it a district that was like forty points democratic and Dan Rostenkowski loses his seat there Mario Cuomo who is the the um it was the most famous uh in Bolivia liberals in the country in Nineteen eighty four loses in New York state I'm\nJust happening all over the map and and to go back and and relive the the the way this was regarded in the moment and Newt Gingrich of course become speaker of the house this was this was also and think of all in politics because he'd been a ... inch er and into his own party even an irritant just a few years earlier [noise]\nUm but it was there were serious discussions of in the media in the wake of that election that not only was Bill Clinton finished that was taken as a given but that the Democratic party and in liberalism itself where we're headed for in immediate extinction\nIt was also the first media shock now I have often told people if the media had a concussion protocol we'd all still begin it after twenty sixteen you and I were together on election night twenty sixteen but\nThat shock of Nineteen Ninety four was as great it was like Nineteen eighty and it doesn't occur very often and you read describe it for our millennials out they're going to be fascinated by the way the ... that in the red and blue\nPeople who are still on the front page like Nancy Pelosi are playing very large rules I Want to cook for page three sixty nine where a speaker of former Speaker Pelosi at that time just to leading Democrat was commenting on Monica Lewinsky uh I don't think it happened but if it did it comes to the big surprise I don't\nThink for one moment there's an atmosphere of sexual harassment and the White House I read that because you're not easy on anyone here just telling the story you because I Want my conservative audience understand the productive plays this right down the middle in the right of the blue you're not this is not an advocacy book\nThis is a narrative of a a multi decade\nI think you were saying that because that's exactly what I Would I aim to do here I'm In I'm just trying to explain how we ended up the goal with the book um is to use as sort of the endpoint election night two thousand and it's the closest thing to a perfect time we've ever seen in a presidential election in this country comes down to\nThose five hundred thirty seven votes in Florida the Supreme Court ruling the recount and all of that\nAnd I think that division that map that just almost perfect split down in the middle of the country I think it's the product of of all of the political battles and political wars in the Nineteen nineties that it just took Americans in and made them choose sides Democrat or Republican\nI'm In and I think each party and its own way contributed to it the way it the way it responded to the other part of the way it played off the other party the way it unintentionally reinforced with their party was trying to do um you know I write about\nOne aspect I write about here is sort of the rise of Newt Gingrich and his\nWho um you know I write about\nA one aspect I write about here is sort of the rise of Newt Gingrich and his style of politics in the house which of course culminated in his his grandest our that that night in Nineteen Ninety four when he become speaker and one of the things you see I I think that I that I Hope people see at least in reading this is in that long rise of Newt Gingrich in the house um\nHe is absolutely changing a lot of the norms and traditions in in blowing them up and and embracing much more combative style\nBut the Democrats who the prominent Democratic majority as it was known back at that time they played right into his hand and they ended up pushing it through the way it's a particularly house speaker Jim Wright says the guy from the late Nineteen eighties particularly the way he ran the house it pushed Republican moderates\nEngine Newt Gingrich's camp and it without the moderates saying you know what we're getting nowhere with the leadership we've been following it for three decades let's give this guy new to try\nBob Michel a great
