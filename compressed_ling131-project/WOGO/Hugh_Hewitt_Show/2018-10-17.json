call it a few people many called employment lawyer the city where the hell them up for two years and then down a severance deal that maybe gave him insurance and five percent\nBut went alliance

the military or the only response I could I could muster right now is that that in itself is an expensive proposition\nAnd I could I could muster right now is that that in itself is an expensive\nProposition right and you know it's always hard to predict uh how ... how heavy storms are going to be no one certainly thought it was going to hit\nSend all the way it did a Michael was initially supposed to be a tropical storm for that area before Kindle took a direct hit and so\nI think that's a fair question hopefully from this we can\nIdentify some key lessons learned um we can avoid making the same mistake in the future but again we need the appropriate unity officials to testify before the house armed services committee to figure out exactly what's happening here because of course the air force is putting their spin on it it's hard to get an accurate picture of exactly what happened and who made the decision\nYou know I read that it would require ten million dollars to reopen the line\nAnd I thought to myself that is next to nothing compared to the strategic advantage this particular plane gives us over our near tear or near peer China I mean not it really is almost nothing if it had to go back and start producing these planes do you think we should\nWell by the ethical I've seen is that it would take two billion in five years to restart the line but it just a question of what timeframe or the substance you're making get the planes that have production um I think I I tend to disagree although more planes will be better and obviously he did it go back and look at that you'd have nine decision with\nA lot of regret but we really need to do is we look through the prism of this long journey great power competition with China and the kitten ability China's developing is waiting to celebrate the beach Twenty one production in order to get range back into the air force and therefore reallocate some of the balance from fighters to bombers\nThat's really the challenge is presented by China and rising great powers and so we need to get that range back ideally you could do a bit of both but you know resource constrained environment you have to make very difficult decisions like that\nRight now let's talk about what you wrote for real clear defense this week about the navy what'd you summarize what your article is and people can find it by Googling Mike Gallagher in real clear defense\nWell he was you know I'm Irish Catholic so I'm always walking around with guilt over things I did didn't do and I felt guilty after our discussion last week I did it feel like an answer your question about\nWhere is the plan for three hundred fifty five shifts and so I went and I started writing my thoughts on paper and talking to a a bunch of people because as you pointed out a three hundred fifty five ships\nLeave was that they can get your defense campaign promise to then candidate Trump and basically the vice president talking to you said stay tuned\nThere's more to follow well I don't think that that's all right now the question is is a navy backtrack we had a two thousand six team for structure assessment that endorsed a three hundred and fifty five ship number\nNow since then we've had a change in administration and the new defense strategy and in light of these changes it makes sense that the navy wants to review the size and composition of its future flee the problem however is\nThe way in which this was happening back in March the navy told us that they were planning on conducting a new force structure assessment then they renounced a forthcoming new assessment just last month do sometime and twenty Nineteen\nWhat we don't really know is what they've been doing in the six months in between his announcement for why the new study won't be out until more than one year after the N. D. S. so I guess you if I could summarize why are we commissioning a whole host of new studies when we have the three hundred and fifty five shit number that's been endorsed by the navy itself\nBy numerous outside assessments and by the president himself\nAs we know from the experience of the Reagan Administration the window to make change and ramp up is really in the first two years of administration\nAnd tasks that the bureaucracy starts doing its thing it restores the status quo and so I see here we are missing a key windows here and I want the navy to tell us what's going to come from these new assassins cause of the assessment comes back as\nJust kidding we only need three hundred and thirty ships\nFor whatever reason that is unacceptable\n[noise] do you think the president and his aware that he's being slow roll by the navy bureaucracy 'cause that's what I think is happening and I had Richard Spencer on when I had an MSNBC show show no no we're going to get your plan and honestly I I think the president thinks there is a plan out there for three hundred and fifty five ships and nobody tells him no it's not there\nAre no I don't think he's aware listen to president is a is a busy man he's got a thousand things to worry about he needs to expect\nThat when he gives a clear direction to his service secretary of too is is is in fact I just as and the service secretaries that that'd executed with a lack of dirty and so I don't think the president is dating they're having this discussion I think your interview with hand\nHopefully will serve as a wakeup call for the White House but it's going to take that presidential level involvement pushing the navy pushing the department of defense to go as fast as humanly possible because if you're actually will always invent excuses and you could fashion a strategic rationale as an excuse for not building worship\nWell I Hope you are right I just read tweeted out everybody ought to go and read my Gallagher's calm but maybe the nation needs now in real clear defense and congressman\nGood luck to you by this week this time tomorrow as we got to be talking about the browns and I honestly I don't know if they're in Rogers can make it to the halfway point of the season so we'll see about that but I think congressman his lip and I mean honestly we need to get him some relief factor I'll tell people that [noise]\nBut first patriot mobile brings us Mike Gallagher every week and patriot mobile said my bacon again today and we got all Internet problem because I got my picture mobile backup phone everyone needs to phones\nPatriot mobile out to be your new phone go to patriot mobile dot com forward slash cue to get that and they've got great rates really well writes fur coat you know unlimited Texan talking\nThe kind of network equal to anyone in the country at the same network big mobile uses pot a portion of every cell phone bill you pay\nFor your patriot mobile phone goes to the Heritage Foundation of the national Rifle Association to the Susan B.

O W the genie\nIn the back side of Washington DC beltway joined my MSNBC stepping arrow\nColleague there she rules but all in the afternoon Stephanie tell me about um your reaction I add Alan Greenspan\nOh you're in the afternoon Stephanie tell me about um your reaction I at Alan Greenspan on yesterday there was amazing new book a capitalism in America history\nHe loves the Trump tax cuts he says there were not politically correct but they've done what needed to be done in order to unleash the animal spirits Alan Greenspan's Alan Greenspan Stephanie it's pretty tough to argue with him\nAre you sure he said he loves the term tax cuts\nOr you're sitting there constructed now he loved them a lot but they were politically incorrect now what he doesn't love is that we haven't done entitlement reform to a company that I Want to come into that but he loves the drunk tax cuts\nWell one of the things about settlement reforms that does need as it surprises me the young people don't get more engaged on entitlement reform yet you know they sort of latch on to issues that you know are very very popular in the news the entitlement reform or something I think people should really care about this and\nThe issue with the tax cut is\nIt's a clear positive for corporate America ... as it was far too complicated but\nThe amount of taxes that they cut you could ask Jamy diamond he will say listen I'm Glad we got the tax cuts we didn't need it you eat as much as it is because we are facing I'm On massive deficit\nAnd as far as the tax cut goes we're seeing corporations do so well two weeks ago I visited council summit there had been a hunter fortune five hundred CEO's they're\nTickled pink and they're saying they're spending their investing their hiring and even without the tax cuts deregulation has been a huge positive for corporate America because remember in the Obama administration it was not a pro business administration and even if companies weren't face new taxes the threat\nOf of regulations of the rat a more could be coming down the pike was preventing companies from spending your ... corporate America in a very good place to look at the stock market one of the reason\nThe stock market is doing so well suddenly corporations have twice as much cash on the books so it is a positive we obviously have a very tight labor market time to see wages push up more than they have this far\nSo Stephanie roll your in the second blue is bubbling America I always think that silicon valley's a blower bubble the Manhattan but\nI just had Marsha Blackburn on she got a Nineteen points swinging her direction over two weeks Heidi Heitkamp has fallen apart and she did a pro ball releasing the name of a abused survivors against their will yesterday that is blowing up you've got mc Sally surging ahead of cinema or do you sense\nThat the blue tired as a thing of the past and that in fact we're looking at a red tide and I've\nTalked about this a lot I've never seen a massive blue wave coming the thing that distresses me isn't are we going massive lure massive read the thing that distresses me is the hollowing out of the center on both sides that is what I think is the most concerning and I think we're seeing it in both parties\nNow did you read David Brooks piece yesterday about the eight percent on the line you know it\nIt today how are you really because that is yeah that's the most interesting thing but the noise comes from those two groups that the north and by the way our cable channels both left and right to be that noise I don't know how we're ever going to break out of this\nYou you are one hundred percent correct on to use an example for you on Monday when I woke up I wasn't on TV I heard was\nNot the media of thought of what Hillary Clinton said on Monday on Sunday about her husband to Monica lint okay saying it was not an abusive power\nSo I said via Twitter takes something clear when the president of the United states has a sexual encounter with an intern it doesn't matter how she behaved blah blah blah that's an abusive power I'm not saying it's rats meant I'm not saying it is it just saw it as an abusive power\nWhen I tell you Hugh I got\nAnd now I have a lead on Twitter and I should hold on a second\nYou know because of course everyone said what about Trump what am I and I said both things can be true abusive power is not unique to one industry one sport ah one one nation or one political party but the tribalism we are seeing the absolute forgiveness of one side\nAnd an assault of another must stop it's unreasonable\nJust going to be very difficult to break away from the profit motive of super serving the six in the eight percent but I'm Glad you're doing the day but that's what's that's why I watch jeopardy real she can do the David ... column\nAnd building Brooks column is the smartest thing I've read in ages\n... and that's definitely a real good to talk to as ... on Twitter America and of course on MSNBC don't go anywhere I'm coming right back America time to keep talking about these midterms the red tide is coming everything turned up roses for the

Monday nights come from behind when at home over San Francisco screened by faces a challenging stretch where four out of the next five games are on the road\nThat is the entire strategy for turnout if you're a Democrat and twenty eight teen and I think it reinforces everything David Brooks said in that column\nI agree with that there is one exception to that which is the Georgia governor's race I was on with Al Sharpton this weekend I I like working without\nA cause it's it gives you a chance they actually answer I've noticed on a few of our friends CNN panels recently you're not being given much of a chance to answer a question Matt and we're going to come back to jobs versus ... and the second\nBut when ... when I meet the press this weekend and talked about voter suppression I've used that as a concession speech or that's not how you when you you normally when on positive\nAh developments in pushing agendas and health care and jobs or education not on complaining about fifty three thousand voter matches but that was her her big patch trying to energize and I think what they discovered\nIs that they don't have any energy ... that that maybe the economy is so big and the the match ups like Kevin Cramer over Heidi Heitkamp and Martha McSally ever Christian cinema have just taken the wind out of Democrats you do you think I monitor something here\nWe'll get there I think the Kavanaugh effect is very real the economy\nUm that's a big deal to write um so how do you fire people up for some reason\nI've talked to pollsters developed this for some reason and\nEthnic

they were actually African Americans Trump has said horrible thing but for some reason\nThey don't they don't really have Donald Trump the people who really despise and both Donald Trump and have the energy for some reason tend to be college educated single white women and so I think it's no surprise that that was the attack\nOr that sort of ended up being pushed that was the angle from the cabin all going for it I really think I'm sure we can find congressional districts out there where that's not the case I'm sure we can find you know local races where\nYou know the idea will be the turnout African Americans against the Republican but for some reason when it comes to Donald Trump I eat\nThat the one group who really is going to be the problem it's much more about the gender gap that I

Portland video to go viral why did they not want people counting on the Supreme Court to be called them up what is it that they're reacting against\nI actually don't understand the phenomena to be quite Frank with you I mean why\nThat's why I said I don't understand why the pushback because first of all\nI think I've been pretty consistent at call any right wing Bob's at sort of Charlottesville didn't sing yeah and then so but when the left does it when they chased Ted Cruz out of out of a restaurant when they pound on the doors at the Supreme Court um\nI call that a mob and I I actually they they somehow viewed that as like almost like an existential threat I don't really understand it I don't think that's an indictment on liberalism it isn't it I mean on mob on on the streets with
