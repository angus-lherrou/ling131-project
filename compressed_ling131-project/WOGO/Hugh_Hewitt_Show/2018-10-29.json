know I Am in a diplomatic position I Want to be very careful [noise] um I I Want to say unequivocal early that I'm Kevin McCarthy as my friend I Know him from California\nAnd and that's an outrageous charge against Kevin it's wrong it's ... it's outrageous and and we should not have politics of destruction like this\nThat is exactly are you and I both know McCarthy and the idea he that he talking about SARS and Bloomberg inspired giving money that that is somehow anti Semitic when in fact that it's simply an objective\nLook at who is funding just like a dull and coke or funding us a recording outlet make let me close by asking is um how soon will it be when we will have clarity as to who the next German Chancellor will be\nWell first of all we will know in December who the next party chair

or Richard gr now the United states ambassador to Germany always a very powerful and effective voice for America abroad and in Germany good luck in keeping us posted in keeping our interest represented well in Berlin is he has done for the past year\nI I Want to tell everyone out there as well [noise] that one of the uh I Will not let this Kevin McCarthy is let her go on answered right it is it is traffic in the left\nI've known Kevin since Nineteen eighty nine he is as at the least and I ate there isn't a inch a tank sure of anti Semitism in his as welcoming to every one of all races and backgrounds as anyone you possibly could\nAnd that it's been ginned up isn't it I again I'll tell you the Democrats are desperate they thought they had a blue wave they don't have a blue wave they thought that the bomber would help them in hasn't helped him they thought that um they could somehow make the president responsible for Pittsburgh that didn't work\nNothing is working for them because people don't want Nancy Pelosi back as speaker and they are voting to increase Mitch McConnell's majorities in the Senate and therefore it just bottom of the barrel time and smearing

I I Want to say something about the depth of it is they think about the Jews that was ... when you said that Walker per se quoi which I had not heard before and that wonderful yeah\nThey get the Jews are unique in history and they are unique because there is the first ancient people whose God did not disappear when the polity was defeated\nAnd they kept their God you're there X. files and this got claims to be the one God and the creator of all\nAnd then this God claims to have a concern for everybody on earth and the covenant with Abraham is a covenant and this should be a blessing to all the people on the face of the year\nNow you won't find anything like that and the ancient religions have which Judaism is one right three thousand VCR before\nAnd so that's the first thing but the second thing is because they\nUh they didn't they didn't this band when their country was overcome the promised land was overcome overcome then what they had been is an exile people for a long long time incredibly stubborn and keeping their identity\nAnd so that that places them in lots of other countries and that means the oldest opportunity for resentment of of of strangers in our midst of the Jews\nAnd you know it's just another great fact\nThat about the United states of America that George Washington and Seventeen Ninety eight wrote to the Hebrew congregation in Newport Rhode Island that it is now no more that we speak of religious toleration as if it were by the indulgence of some that others enjoy their inherent natural rights\nAnd that is probably the first letter written by chief executive of any country except ancient Israel to some Jews addressing them as equal citizens that the American heritage and there's no reason to believe that Kevin McCarthy does not does not\nFeel

divides us in the following way we Americans agree that a human being has rights and our country is founded to defend those rights\nAnd to be a citizen of America is the practices and belief\nThat stem from that and it's got nothing to do with color now I think that's what Donald Trump has to say to the world and says it a lot and has been saying that I looked it up before the election back for decades and so if you say that your enemies are acting bad\nAnd the and and you know he says that hard right one of the reasons the political or the political debate is so intense is it now it's a real fight and Trump does fight like with like\nIn the sense that he denounces people you know really clearly but I don't think you know racist way\nAnd he does not call for violence ... for his victory that he really wants to win the Senate he really wanted to win Brett Kavanaugh he really wanted the tax cuts he really wants to win like you said you'll get sick of winning\nBut he doesn't call for violence in the information that he does the idea that chance or somehow car chases are hurling insults are like hurling rocks that is a vanity or the left and the media conceit that contributes to their narrative\nThat's right and uh [laughter] that's right I mean one of Lincoln's great early speeches was you know against mob rule that young man's life see I'm address and and he just made the point that there'd been some lynchings\nAnd they weren't all black and uh although there were so and so he he makes the point that if you stream out into the street and act like that and do violence on somebody without due process of law then freedom itself is endangered and you know there is\nYou know we don't they don't play on the news that crazy things that so many say and uh you know in the famous ones from presidential candidates are Hillary and her deployed both and Brock Obama and their guns and their God and whatever else it is\nLet me let me play for you George

have invented and the Chinese are stealing it and knock it off the global economy globalization doesn't work Larry Kudlow but\nWhen he got to the end where he said at the center of it right Well Donald Trump does it since\nIn where he said at the center of it right well I don't jump to the center of this only in the sense of he's the one that got elected president United States\nBut the campaign in which he ran lord what was said about him right wasn't he called a Nazi over and over isn't T today constantly called that he's only in the center in the sense that he won the election\nAnd so it doesn't make him more culpable ... last one hopes\nAnd remember the theme we always forget this right the theme of of Trump's first inaugural addresses\nIn our common citizenship
