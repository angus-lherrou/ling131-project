the basic principle which it's born and then expand that to the consent of the govern made necessary by that principle this is the first thing in the world in human history to undertake that\nSo so they um they uh so they have to you know they're going to figure out a way to do it and you know if you think now you know that big countries of the great rule you know\nBut the truth is they art right the European Union is an attempt to unite the European continent\nAnd it's falling apart right\nAnd China has got intermittent at this assemblies of itself right and the Russian Federation you know is strained at the corners right and so and and yet these big powerful countries\nHave a better a means of defending themselves and the small weak countries you know if you want to keep your independence for sure and certain for the rest of time\nYou don't really want to be Belgium 'cause they've managed to survive\nBut it took some really big countries getting on their side to help that happen yeah so how do you hold them together right and this is you know this is the American experiment right and remember this experiment was conducted on a new continent right never been anything like didn't know how big it was you know I think much about it really\nAnd so they so they uh their idea was local thing will be governed cheaply by local things\nAnd then the Senate becomes a protection in the national thing of the prerogative of the local things and that that device is a powerful um it's a powerful a protector\nYou know I think you need you need to explain that again it becomes a powerful national interest in the protection of local interest would you in on that\nWell it was better when the Senate was in ... uh was appointed by state legislatures although I confessed filled is this the Senate was often not very important in that time because first of all there wasn't this whacking big federal government with the ability to reach into every\nTown I mean there's a federal institution installation basically in every town and they do they don't just do the post office anymore now there's you know local and private thing of all kinds\nThat are that are that are that are influenced by the federal government and so that that wasn't possible\nWhen the Senate was chosen but the state legislatures and I would go back to that although I think there's little prospect of it because I think that would be a really good uh um\nYou know we're not going to I Would uh we're not going to reopen the seventeenth amendment as a practical matter I'm against it can mentioned the states as a matter as well but when we come back we're going to continue to talk about the glory of the Senate and this current eruption of attacks upon it as an institution\nNot on any particular decision the decision to confirm Brett Kavanaugh is a great and good decision\nBut it launched it triggered on the left a\nMad cow brush to denounce the Senate and we stand here as we

Democratic Senate equally state represented Senate the right to confirm and the house was excluded from that process\nAnd I think it was because Dr aren't they did not want the majority ... influence on the people who would be making the laws\nThat's right that's right and well you know 'cause I remember the whole point\n... you you can't say that without also at the point that that ultimately it is to people in their majority who should rule\nAnd so how do you set up a system where there is deliberation and debate and ultimately the people will and if if if it's a you know any people by the way if you if you look at a mob anywhere in the world what you're saying is a bunch of human beings who\nIs capable of good behavior\nAnd\nAnd so you need a system for them to participate in\nThat will respond to that good behavior\nAnd not to they're marching in the streets you know I I read this article long as the fact that having apparently a long time ago that the Palestinian authority or when they got their government their parliament set up they passed a law that it was the death penalty to sell the land and land in the west bank to a Jew\nAnd then apparently a horde of them left the place and marched down the street with a bunch of others and arrested some people and beat them and that I think they might have killed one of them right so\nYou know the the the mob and ... you can't have that and that's and so this idea that it's just you know is ... fit right there and had a way with words he said in all cases\nMajority rule but for the rule to the rightful it must be reasonable and protected the rights of minorities\nAnd that when we come back for the final segment of this week's Hillsdale dialogue is what will focus on how does the majority rule even when you have an anti majority turning institution like the Senate\nAnd the answer will be they rule constitutionally through mediating institutions that are designed exactly in functioning exact queens they were designed to do and no it is not white privilege no it is not rural privileged hits the constitution are going to be right", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Hallie", "day": "19"}
