conversations off air oh yeah\nI'm not I'm not a advocate I tried to tell the truth yep and I do agree with you about Texas Tennessee I think those races now John\nI think that North Dakota is definitely a Republican pick up I think it is tied in Missouri I think that\nIndiana could be competitive\nUh I Believe Montana will end up in the Democratic column\nI I didn't I didn't mention Montana that's going to take a lot more yeah\nAnd and the issue with Florida for your listeners is that the place that was destroyed\nWas the place that was the strongest Republican votes that there'll be fifty thousand less Republicans voting because there are no places to vote to honor schools there is no electricity we are twelve days away from the Thirteen days away from the election they don't even have only place\nAnd they've got no place to go\nI read I was in Tampa last week and I read the governor's executive order on this anyone who wants to vote they will come and find you and let you vote by a mobile machine you got to look in just called the voter registration\nLet me talk to you about um Martha McSally al in Arizona or because I think ...\n... is not fit the serve a based on what she said and Martha McSally first woman attacked pilot in combat history in America I Can't believe that's going to be close but I just can't\nI Can't see that being any more than two points in either direction and I think that that one is\nIs done yet I think that that\nBy the way Martha McSally clearly has the momentum and this caravan that's making its way to the border believe me in the research I've done in Arizona immigration is the number one issue and they are set up with people coming across the border with out fishing adoptive border security\nThat has said democratic challenger is very tough\nWell known in Arizona and that one is still too close to call\nYou know what's good news there is a doozy is wrong thing and the governor's race I'm back to big pharma one more word on the caravan I ah it's up to according to some reports eleven thousand other reports fourteen thousand and it's getting amazing press conference how does that play in the elections Frank\n... the public looks that goes from says why do we have no control over our borders why is this still happening to us and they ... and here's what's interesting\nAh the vast majority of Americans want to compromise they're willing to accept a path to legal status or citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants would so the so called DREAM Act in return for some sort of barrier and genuine\nBorder security with the American people are saying is first fix the border then why should we punish those who came here to no fault of their own I Know a lot of your listeners don't like that second part but the majority of Americans support\nBoth actually my audience is very much beyond that my audiences pro fence and pro regular as they shouldn't be on DACA my audience is reasonable it's Ninety percent of Ninety percent agree people who are in the country already we're not lawbreakers can stay but we want to double sided strong tall fence with a road between that\nAnd I know my I I've been talking about this for Fifteen Years of my audience that you'll find other audiences that are harder line but my audience is very very smart very apple and very educated very a Christian very they failed people who do not want to punish anyone\nNow Frank what should a Republican candidate B. saying about drug prices what should they be saying about big firemen and you also it's also the author no my brother worked for almost seven years as a research toxicologist for big pharma\nI Know the good that they do the drugs he developed everybody gets that but this pricing it's crazy what should have Republicans say on the stump about big pharma\nThat they should get it if the pharmaceutical companies refused to do it voluntarily\nThe public does not want to invade the free market system but they don't want Americans pay more than Canadian that if they will not let were drug prices here as they've done it in other countries that Americans should be allowed to purchase drugs\nUnder FDA supervision 'cause nobody wants the hype lines the poison\nBut Americans should be able to purchase drugs across the border and that won't change about\nThe pharmaceutical companies will bring down their prices that you cannot have a situation where people are literally literally dying\nBecause of the pursuit of profitability I remind you of conservatives do believe in the same market system but they also believe that monopoly should be broken up and then when you have cartels they should be challenged that's what you've got in this situation\nNo secretaries are of H H us has been a guest on my show what you're talking about transparency and pricing that's really what the ah new regulations coming out of the department of health and Human Services are about will that feel the need or does more than that need to be done Frank was\nMore than that needs to be done at least some of the public perspective because knowing that you're paying the highest prices on the face low doesn't help\nIt's actually finding a way that they will still be profitable but that people will be able to afford the medications are ... they want competition in the marketplace they want the ability to buy cheaper medications if they are available and\nTired of all this money going into things other than research and development when they claim that all the money that they're spending is going into research and development they want integrity in the system and they don't feel like they have it now\nOkay I Would like a very quick response to the bombs I Believe that the FBI when they have seven to eight or nine bombs are more new bombs being that I report it as we speak in lower Manhattan that that will be able to find a sending them you can't get the guy that much evidence without creating a trail\nUnless it's a hostile foreign nation using professionals which is I'm not ruled that out what do you think the bombs represent Franklin's\nI think I think they

and until the economy can have more equitable distribution of the natural wealth of the country to the people who are working for it and it's got to be clearly an underlying fire that's ready to be

money they can keep your mind but distribute their jobs in places where there need that's why that Google going in Arbor is such a great idea why hope Amazon goes to Columbus or Virginia or someplace that needs a lot of jobs let me turn to the end of leadership in turbulent times because it was there we find\nMaybe the best friends which under the current era and President Trump you write about wiccan T. R. FDR and LBJ the fame they craved the recognition they thought bears little resemblance to today's cult of celebrity for these leaders the final measure of their achievements would be realized by the Suffolk you are\nVery mittens tuned in during plays in communal memory before we talk about President Trump and that goal what is an enduring place in communal memory I think I Know where it is but you explain\nWhat I think what it means is that at a certain point when a leader goes into politics they go in perhaps for themselves at the start\nBut at a certain point it gets transferred into an ambition for the greater good to accomplish something that will stand the test of time and that normally means something that creates more economic opportunity and a greater degree of social justice we know when we look back at our leaders what happened during their era did people be able to share more in the country's\nGoods did people feel better at the end that something had\nHappened in their lives that they had more opportunity it's not hard to figure it out or was there a war that was prosecuted that has to be one and that was one like depression that has to be lifted\nOff and the leaders of go into communal memory by those who have great challenges to face that is what Abigail Adams that great assessed these create great virtues but it's not always do that they are up to those challenges though sometimes they can go into memory in a very negative life I mean James Buchanan with the president when the country was falling apart and the Eighteen fifty\nAnd was only able to exacerbate the problem is rather than hills up\nAnd he goes down as one of the worst part of history\nI'm not sure that um that Herbert Hoover was capable of his given his temperament of dealing with a depression is extraordinarily good man but had it fixed ideology but he stays the same challenge that FDR was FDR goes down and you know memory\nAs a Teddy Roosevelt and asked us Abraham Lincoln and even at that Lyndon Johnson having faced civil rights as a southerner\nAnd made his conviction that the civil rights bill it'd be his first priority the risky tough that memory of civil rights will go down even though the war in Vietnam will always be a scar on his legacy it was not celebrities not doing what you want at that moment it's not just campaigning it's really going forward and mobilizing the country\nToward tasks that will make the country and the people in the fat or if it's a big thing and and that's if that's your desire it somehow lift you above the daily struggle\nArguably the greatest leader Americans had in terms of the longest period of time would be like a leader of a ... do the invasion of leadership a NATO a leader of Columbia University of course eight years in the White House during a period of time when the Soviets reached parity with us from a hydrogen bomb and we had to begin\nA a recognition of the new world order with a nuclear age I could pull that off but I I don't really think has a place in our communal memory yet Doris Kearns Goodwin do you\nI think it's missing place I think there will be more biographies of Eisenhower\nI think the way he handles the presidency and the dignity that he brought to it and clearly the leadership he brought during World War two and two the beginnings of the Cold War I I think these leaders sometimes it takes a generation or takes the biography written about the person to put their whole life is you just did in in those moments in perspective not just\nBut he did his presidency but what his whole life meant to be\nAnd yeah I think he'll come up in the presidential historian polls they come up and down after a period of time and sometimes it's looking back on an era from the context of our own era of the relative ... of the Nineteen fifties I thanks so much that us now and we don't take it for granted\nThe way we might have ... now that we've had a period of such perpetual war on our side similarly the looking back on Lyndon Johnson ability to deal with Congress and get bipartisan support\nFor nature legislation not great civil rights laws that Medicare PBS NPR headstart immigration reform and most importantly bringing both Republicans and Democrats together\nIn our broken political system that looks so much better what we took for granted thrown its current generation but I'd say I said how as a person definitely ready for great leadership stuffy\nDoors ... question about leadership and turbulent times has to do with Donald Trump whose numbers are improving is change the Supreme Court is one of the third year battle for the Supreme Court\nMilitary bring rebuild the economy is harming along but of course we're divided country and I'm just watching the news this morning was blaming Trump for the pipe bomb that cetera what do you see emerging which way as his reputation going to go based upon extrapolating the first two years in the next two and possibly six\nI think the main question will be is there a point in which he will recognize that he has done a lot of things that he hoped to do and that and try and he has to reach out to expand the base not just do the base\nAnd try and become the leader of all the people that is a huge transition that still has not taken place and the question will be yes people are feeling better about their jobs they may be feeling better and that's important they may be feeling better even about the confidence in the economy\nDid they feel better as citizens right now they feel that the country is in a more a better place the way the language is going the way people are fighting the way the polarization is deepening the way they wake up every morning and they see\nSomething on television that they wished they weren't seeing that sense of feeling good about being a citizen as the country is another level I think of judging are you a better or worse off having been here for two years than simply the material goods that are at the bottom which absolutely important as well\nSo we'll see what happens if that shift if that gets worse if the polarization deep and if it leads into even more violence as we might be seeing potentially in these last couple of days and I think we have to\nUse that as a standard for is this leader leading us in a direction\nThat is helping us become a better country\nOr is or the discourse that he's not only responsible for but it's just escalating under his watch and we need drawing about\nDoris Kearns Goodwin direct people coming and joining me leadership in turbulent times

think the behavior of Senate Democrats was a highly\nUh and I do think a lot a lot of Americans saw it and and and what really horrified because they warn Endeavour you have a fair process they weren't trying to find the troops that they they just wanted a partisan witch hunt\nAnd and they were willing to go into the gutter\nAs they were willing to smear judge Kavanaugh smear his family by the way he was for the record I'm not part of his\nCar [laughter] you know I don't know I keep a straight face to those hearings center it's pretty amazing\nBut but that that's all right you you you got to have a sense of humor you gotta laugh I'm ... that that's part of I I actually think for Republicans it's important when the leftist so angry so bitter so filled with hatred one of the things I urge conservatives all the time don't respond in kind\nWe should be happy warriors we should be ...\nAnd ... and in part because the policies were fighting or\nThey've worked low taxes low regulations it works we're seeing an economic boom throughout the throughout the country that is incredible and and so we said you have to tell the truth I talk about policies before and make a difference of people's lives and the contrast if we are laughing happy delightful warriors\n... is sticking if you're not a cabinet effect you know I've done I think thirty town halls and rally than the last six week I I had just just the other day in Beaumont I had one gentleman come up with this whole family that you know I was not going to vote this year that I'm coming out not voting because a cab and all that was the most horrifying thing I've ever say\nSo in that in light of that um would you think do you believe that the Democrats will modify their behavior in the next two years or has President
