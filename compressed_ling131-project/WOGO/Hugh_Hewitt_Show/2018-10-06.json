E. they've got football they got cheerleaders\nCheerleaders they got lockers man if I could get over to middle school I'd be happy then you remember that and\nThen I was in middle school I got to be about the ninth grade and I was fourteen Fifteen Years old and one of my buddies got his driver's license\nAnd oh\nMan if I could just get my driver's license that'd be free I could drive myself to McDonald's and we go through a McDonald's I'll tell you how long ago it was we would go through the McDonald's drive through and we could get a Big Mac and a small coke for a buck sixteen\nChilly here that are hitting me cats path like that can leave that money and continue contributing to their pre paid plan how much is in there\n[noise] um about eighty six hundred\nEighty six hundred dollars and how much do you own your car\nWe have a ten thousand and what do you own your credit cards off by that\nTime and um are you guys on a budget in reducing debt already\nWe started at ... and that's and I realize when you get that they got that an orderly having that Peter Pan ... pan and then I don't know what to do it I Gotcha okay I'm\nIn your household income as well [noise] um has been ... twenty five and I have a small business that brings in about twelve thousand a year\nOkay so about sixty thousand give or take All right um no I Would not cash would stop adding to it um and um you do need to get on a budget and follow through with what you're learning in financial ... University in just work your baby steps if you stop adding to its you'll be fine\nThe other thing I probably wouldn't do a norm urgency or no rush but sometime in the next year or two I Would probably take that money out of there and roll it into a five twenty nine plan in good mutual funds and here's why\nYou're much better off to save for college in a five twenty nine or an E. S. A. and mutual funds than you are with prepaid college plans here is the reason anytime you ... pay something your rate of return is what it increases in price\nAnd so\nIf I prepay a an item I pay a thousand dollars and increases in price\nTo twelve hundred dollars my rate of return if it did that in one year would be twenty percent so that'd be a nice rate of return right so how much of the increase in price because that's the only return when you ... pay anything they're not giving you an interest rate they're not giving your growth rate you simply are saving the increases in tuition\nBy paying it ahead of time that's all you're doing now tuition for the last Seventy odd years as average about seven point two percent inflation right so that\nMeans you're making about seven point two percent on your money when you do prepaid college in a good growth stocks mutual fund you ought to be ten to fourteen percent\nAverage annual return over that same period of time minded and so on you make more\nBy putting it in and you actually get some headway towards college the other problem with prepaid college is a ... and it's a blanket statement but and it will vary from state to state many many many of the state's\nBusiness government are very poorly run\nAnd they screw up some of the prepaid college plans on the process I mean they're just horrible administrators now some states are well run my state happens to be well run show in the state of Tennessee I wouldn't be concerned today\nUnder the current administration with a with the stability of the ... still wouldn't do prepaid college even in Tennessee because of the other reason I was talking about I Want a better rate of return on my money than simply the inflation rate of tuition\nSo all of that to say a row you already six hundred bucks into five twenty nine and a good mutual fund\nAt some point right now I just stop adding get yourself on a budget cranky lifestyle down stop going out to eat canceled the trip that you had planned to call to vacation because you're broken you've been spending more than you make and you have to stop that and that's how you got a car loan and credit card\nDebt so you're right on track you're doing the right kind of things and that's what I Would do if I were in your shoes Matthew's with us in Fort Worth Texas have Matthew how are ya\nI'm excellent uh want to thank you for ... for a a ... I was going through rep you for the last seven years we paid off over a hundred thousand dollars good for him would have been in bankruptcy had a had we not gone through a few wow so ...\nTo my question because this was a wonderful thing it's fixing to happen or we were my family my parents have received an inheritance a mineral rights in West Texas mhm\nMy parents have received them inheritance a mineral rights in West Texas ... a large portion\nAnd a habit struck oil a lot of oil we've had it for a hundred years and had a fuel oil wells but not not a time mhm uh speculators are wanting to sell a or by our rights for a large sum of money mhm\nUh over a million dollars [laughter] and we're deciding whether or not we should sell mhm and cash out or hopefully going to we're being told don't sell because there's going to be a boom mhm and we want to you know large nice inheritance and I want to make sure it's managed properly mhm\n[noise] well there's only a boom if it's not a dry hole\nAnd there's only a boom if after it's not a dry hole there is an actual um oil prices that sustain a drilling a and and that's one reason west Texas is struggling run our oil prices are so far down that there is no boom okay I mean when the gas for five dollars a gallon or the boom by you know what I mean\nBut er and could that come back yeah I just probably depends on you know what OPEC does on turning on or off the faucet on the supply the man that's the issue all of that to say I'm no expert on the oil business I don't know much about it at all to get just about everything I Know just in\nA [noise] but um and so the way I asked myself that question if I'm In your shoes and you might answer the question differently than I Would\nBecause you might know more or your family might know more ah oh let me ask you this you have to sell all of them you have to sell all it was an all or none\nNo it's not an all or none or whether you're it's it's simply a they're looking at a three million for all the and or or you know obviously one point five perhaps\nOkay so you're just added on how one\nYeah and my biggest concern is the risk yeah I mean we are not oil people\nYeah I don't know why I'm asking is women I'm ... so you're only talking about selling the house\n[noise] we're deciding on how much to sell\n... aren't if I were in your shoes I don't know much about the oil business and if someone asked me if I had a pile of money in the middle of my kitchen table that said three million dollars on it when I go by oil rights within my answer would quickly be no\nMainly because I don't like that much risk and I don't know much about that\nOkay those two things would take it off the table for me I Would rather buy something else with it\nThat I that I Know a little bit more about like real estate and it's a little bit more predictable and less risk personally okay but that's the way you ask yourself the question if I had three million dollars in the middle kitchen table when I go go by our rights in West Texas where the if the answer is no then it's time to sell\nFor the same reason I think you know that you wouldn't know why and I ...\nAnd that's that's what I agree with his getting the family to understand that you know when we're afraid the stock market might crash yeah well\nIt might but I and that's how I got to start getting less rock markets less risk than growing holes\nYeah we're a hundred percent sure that you don't ... I mean walking around since tells you that you don't have to be all person to know that now uh so what I Would do a ... the family has to do these are family owned and so you can't just sell like yours off\n... uh no this is I'm I'm helping or my mother and father and make it to say\nOh I see so it's a just a day and they can make the decision for the whole thing or not\nYeah All right then if I were in their shoes I Would at least to sell Seventy five percent of it\nOkay I probably would sell at all but on the off chance that they're just dying to be a little bit and they all business and they're scared to death of ... you know they're scared to death that they're going to miss out on something here right and uh you know so that that\nYou know if it struck out right after I sold it I regretted the rest of my life you know those kinds of statements then maybe keep twenty five percent of it and sell Seventy five percent and then let's buy some real estate or by some mutual funds or something that's a whole lot less risk with that I'm definitely not\nSome advisors set of families entire portfolio three million dollar network\nBe caught up in ...\nI wouldn't do that personally and if somebody asked me\nAs a financial coach should they do that I Would say no [noise]\nSo I I Would take the majority or all of that money off the tides\nThe news to have a blessing like that though\nThis is the Ramsey show [noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care of the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely\nLegally in forever is with time share exit team they have offices all around the country where you can sit down face to face and review your contract to find a solution they've accepted\nThousands of timeshare owners this year alone they're the best in the business because they simply have more options for exit than anyone else it could be a long process\nBut there with you every step of the way and timeshare exit teams so confident in their exit service that if they don't get you out you get a full\nKnow going in the you know the the condo the other day we stopped and there are going to get a condo over knocks when one of the ball game over there and the heat and air was out so it was hot air conditioner was out so three hundred dollars later it was fixed but there's always something you know you just figure that's part of the equation when you own property\nThe more crap you own the more stuff more repairman you have to know [laughter]\nIt just goes with the territory so long as you're going to animal that emotionally to go with it and you're not looking for it to be in a big time investment that you get rich on then you'll be fine\nJamie is with us Jamie is in Alexandria, Louisiana Hi Jamie How are you\nHow they how you doing better than I deserve what's up in your life\nAt the end of August I'm I have a friend who has been following you gave me some information and I had been struggling that the single parent and I just got a new job in the month of march\nAnd I'm like I make enough income but it's like I don't have any money left over ten my groceries I put gas in my car and I work a pretty good ways away from home and I have two boys one in high school who in sports and very active and\nI had a lot of things going on as well [noise] everything that I pay my hat and ...

three vehicles two of them are mine that I use for work they're both paid off um I use a truck and then I also have a come your car that I use regularly on most days of the week but the truck I have

since the car loan or they're ... percent interest should we just sell it to you know get rid of\nSome of the dead or should we should we keep it because it hurts our\nMm zero percent wouldn't enter into my decision it would just be whether or not I wanted to work hard enough to pay off eleven thousand dollars in debt and how fast you can pay it off water all three of these cars worth\n[noise] um the truck is probably worth about Fifteen my car's probably also worth about Fifteen her car we think we can probably sell it for about ten\nOkay because one rule of thumb is you don't want vehicles things with motors in them totaled up being more than about half your annual income\nThen you've got too much stuff going down in value OK okay not violating that though show or good or the second rule of thumb I use is can you be out of debt everything but your house in two years so what's your household income\nOr about a hundred and forty thousand good and how much debt other than eleven thousand dollar car do you have not counting your mortgage\nOr we have about Ninety thousand okay\nBut that it that include the car the car and what is the Ninety thousand on\n[noise] mostly student loans or we have some tax stuff a medical bills\nOkay so can you pay off forty five a year making one forty and be debt free in two years my answer would be yes yes\nAnd um that would mean that if you want to keep her car there's nothing out of line with keeping it but just by it off I mean we're not going to keep a bad ah regardless of the interest right we're just going to get rid of it but you know so but if you told me you owe thirty thousand dollars on her car and I would sell it in a heartbeat\nBecause when we were it wouldn't it wouldn't fit neither one of these equations I mean you wouldn't be dead already in two years probably and on top of that uh uh of of course you'd have too much\nBring it in two years probably and on top of that uh of of course you'd have too much caught up in vehicles and so that would change my equation that's how I usually it's just a decision making paradigm that's all it is gives you a critical thinking ... filter to look at this and say what are you doing there what are you doing\nI'm I'm I'm Thirty years old I'm among baby step for I've about Seventy thousand dollars cash mhm um I Know that other than my house\nUm which has about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars left on I'm On a third year mortgage and when I bought it I put Ninety thousand dollars down on so I have no equity in it\nUm and I have about fourteen thousand coming in as a gift for my one year old college fund um [noise] so I'm going to be putting that into a check five twenty nine I think for him and then kind of picking out some\nGrowth stocks mutual fund to I don't know she goes from there okay um so my question is what are kind of my\nWhat do I deal with this kind of piled cash that I have um you know ideally I Want to keep my living expenses for for um you know every any given monsters about twenty\nSeven hundred dollars um my wife stays at home with her child so I'm pretty much the only income right now I'm so I wanted to keep you know a good portion of that set aside and just cash and then kind of want to know what to do with the rats shut shut draw towards my how he owns a little bit every year or\nShould I put it someplace else\nWe teach Taylor is a process we call the baby steps and it tells you what to do at different phases of your financial plan and as you lay the foundation then as you build a house and you put the roof on your financial planet tells you each time what to do and what to do first what to do second and so forth\nSo I'm baby steps one is thousand dollars you've done that too was dead free but the home you've done that three is an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses um that's going to be nine to Eighteen thousand dollars in your case\nAnd so uh twenty thousand dollar emergency fund is adequate as adjust to an emergency fund in cash okay then that brings us to baby steps four or five and six and we do those simultaneously for is putting Fifteen Percent of your income into your retirement plans now uh what do you make\n'em so I'm about Seventy eight year\nIs the household income yeah yeah okay All right and uh do you have a four one K. at work\nYou know I have a pension um that I put a about a hundred and thirty dollars every two weeks into it um so I didn't know how that kind of played in the cards as well\nWhich I use that mandatory\nOkay All right I probably would not count that it's a fairly small amount of money and I probably still would put Fifteen Percent is a Fifteen Percent or Seventy thousand ten thousand five hundred okay and that would be a around eight hundred and fifty bucks a month going into something do you have a four one K. available at work you don't\nKnow I have a I currently have just opened up a rock or re ... with a better man which is one of the high hundreds for me I'm familiar\nWith what I Would do instead is I Would use I'm a ... a\nPerson that as an advisor today a robo shortcoming they're they're they're doing pretty good but none of 'em are strong enough yet that I'm willing to go there I've not got any of my money in ... at this stage of the game there'll be a time in a place that those things evolve to the point that they're probably going to be a good thing to do\nWith some or you know in certain situations and so forth but what I Would do just go to smart bastard die Ramsey dot com click on the smart restroom pro link and it'll drop down a list of people in your area that are that we recommend I'm not in the investment business so I don't care what you do okay I don't affect my income at all\nBut people have always ask me who do you recommend recommend people that have the heart of a teacher that will sit down with you\nYou and your argument you you're married\nYou're married um and have a Thirteen month old\nOkay so you and your wife can do a fifty five hundred each unless you're over fifty years old and but that gets you there are fifty five hundred his eleven thousand then that'd be fully funded ... and I would have those in gross stock mutual funds\nI spread Mayan personal investments across four types of growth stock mutual funds that's also what I recommend and I put a force in growth in income uh fourth and gross a fourth and aggressive growth and force in international\nNow once you're doing that and you have the monthly draft coming out of your checking account you shouldn't need any of the Seventy thousand dollars to do that with\nYou've already dumped a ton and your kids four five oh five twenty nine and you've got it in mutual funds that you're watching which is just fine okay I'd just be watching that you could you could review that with a smart Mr pro and so you you know if they teach you anything that\nYou could you could review that with a smart rest or pro and so you you know if they teach you anything that makes you want to move it but you may want to just leave it where it is that's fine there's no issue there um\nAnd then everything above that that's maybe step three is fit or babysit for Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement\nFive is address kids' college and it's different in ... in ... how many kids how old they are and that kind of thing so we don't have a balance on that but you're addressing it and then once you're putting your ... and you're doing your Fifteen Percent\nAbove that everything I can find in my budget uh any extra money I come in to throw it at the house 'cause I'm going to get the house paid off that's baby steps six when the house is paid off that leads you to the last maybe step and that's max out all retirement and invest invest invest give give give and become very wealthy\nOr what you will do especially when you get rid of your house payments so all of that to say I'm probably going about fifty grand out of your Seventy at your house\nAnd then I'm going to set up those two Roth IRAs and any other money I'll find and my budget almost keep jumping around that house you're probably going to that house paid off in three or four years of this right\nThat's what it sounds like me and that's the direction I Would go Josh is with us in Arlington, Virginia Hi Josh how are you\nI Do I'm great how are you Dr better than I deserve what's up\nAlready so I have a currently two hundred and twenty three thousand then got a hundred and Ninety three thousand it's pretty normal it's currently with a U.S department of treasury um it as a result of having been a just an old service academy or three years ago\nUm end up remaining thirty ... like a pretty normal debt I'm obviously much smaller so my question is I'm I'm familiar with the baby steps I'm a I'm a huge fan of yours I told you for a while um should I continue\nPaying off the smallest at first or should I I'm just kind of start to save rapidly but a hundred and Ninety three thousand um reason I ask because I Believe it's going to go actually I Know that that will eventually end up any collections account if I'm not able to pay the amount of all I'm\nYeah I'm In what is your income now\nSo it varies um last year uh I I made a hundred and Ninety thousand um I I got married this year so combined income between me and my wife um should be this year at least a about a hundred ... a hundred and fifty thousand on calmed down a little bit this year also\nWhile so you might learn if you guys are on the side and so what I'm going to just put this on a night three in the debt snowball and knock it out as fast as I can cause you got a wonderful income you'll be dead for\nTwo years it's not going to collections okay\nWhen you start going to thirty thousand bucks this thing or it's going to go way really really fast you make a lot of money\nYou're getting a real tight budget and clean up the mess so I I have never heard of this I'm curious I'm about to learn something you went to a service academy one of the military academies got this enrolled and they charge you for all the tuition\nYes or so yeah a little known fact that you're just an old I'm pretty much under any circumstance following junior year you're either ask that served in the service or you're assigned\nTo the recruitment and death um and it goes to the defense finance and accounting service initially and if it if it's not paid it it goes over to the U.S treasury\nSo you have the option of serving\nAs an enlisted person if you get this enroll for a period of time and it's for given\nA yes or however my case I was not afforded that option I I was given an honorable discharge half the pay back\nSo like West Point as an example you can get hammered with fish I did not know that you have to learn something wow well the only good news in this story as you make a lot of money so you can clean up the mess quickly [noise]\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have to be intentional with every decision you make\nAs an example if you're a business

I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago but\nThat never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nWrite I actually last January took myself yeah\nOn you All right I actually last January took myself you know of her checking because\nHeart when I got ... got involved more friends obviously not a bright boy show on\nHe was doing drugs you know and and so he wasn't in his right mind I rest\nMy case you got so [laughter] so bottom line is what I Would do if I'm her mom is I Want to participate in her healing financially emotionally getting back on track so that she can be a good mom to this baby and have a good life\nAnd make good decisions independent from drug addicts and independent for mom of initially\nBut if you can get her back I I don't want you to set up a checking account and you manage everything and not be perpetual\nBut to do that to like run yeah I'd be out but to do that to get her back up and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of the seat until you learn to ride the bike and then we're going to let go of the seat again but you like go to the seat last time not because she was healthy but because she was on healthy yeah\nAnd I'd like to get her up and running and healthy you know we got the meds worked out we got the counseling it's for the rest of her life\nShe's got to balance that stuff but if she doesn't she gonna hit the bridge every time man and be back in my office or in your home trashed again financially here we are

on a couple of different met\nHer ... her only shopping is what we're talking about but our goal is this girl to be forty four and all this to be a memory\nCan happen yeah and it happens to people all the time\nSo what did she say right now when they call\nYou ought to show you get nothing so she does pick up the phone\nYou know are you might as well but I wouldn't have long conversations with them 'cause you're just you know because they're going to just I don't\nThink I should be talking she should be telling them\nEither one of the American long conversation it's I got nothing you get nothing because all they're gonna ... her and that's not ... the situation now once you've got a little money and some jobs going then we start negotiating and trying to work our way through the debt right well\nI think this goes on a year or two and they will eventually come back and want to negotiate and\nI aren't going to negotiate after two months\nOh really yeah okay\nI think it's been longer than that I think it's been at least six months how their their during our pliable\nToday but she's got no money and you're not giving or any you know so they get nothing\nThey get nothing today now\nSix months from now she's balanced on her meds taking care of the baby working still living under your roof and give her the emotional support you can put your arm around her and walk with her as she fights through dealing with these nasty people call collectors\nAnd let's say I mean she'll show a little bit here Thirteen inch it they're eight and get their share hey look at can we work at a deal

with about five hundred dollars a week on like a debit card that for him to buy food\nAnd what are you doing with the rest of the bat I'm Sorry what are you doing with the rest of the money\nOh I'm paying on and on than on his cell he still has about 'em and K left from the equity loan ... two thousand on a credit card mhm\nEight thousand on a car and eight thousand on the house [noise]\nAnd how much are you able to put on the debt which\nI'm putting everything was the turning out the auto everything on on that much money does that amount to what is it\nAmong [noise] mhm\nI think it amounts to about a thousand a month\nAnd that's pretty good okay so he's got Fifteen and eight and two did I get that right\nTo aid on the car eight on the house and she won a credit card\nOkay All right and it ... you know if you divide that about four thousand a month I think you're done in a year\nOkay and your first go would be to get him debt free you're done with a better than a year right rankles to get him to free 'cause he's Seventy five years old and he's still working a steel plant and understand that right yes that was going to come a moment and it'll come suddenly that he just can't do that\nAnd I'm afraid of you know my prayer is at least that he gets through this year\nMhm and that way you that free and if he's a hundred percent that free house and everything you can probably make it on the Social Security if you had to write okay mom yeah not ideal not what we want but we can probably get there and uh then\nThe next step is if we get past that that'd be wonderful let's get debt free then let's build an emergency found a three to six months of expenses but we get past that then let's start building some mistake for retirement but the fastest way to build a nest egg for retirement is to clear that data to have that emergency fund and Bush and his still the baby steps in other words\n[noise] okay that sounds good I'm asking is why at a bank loan um [noise] um someone at his age and the K\n[noise] um come run at his age and the K ... now for and they and they\nCan be paid off in twenty forty cream knowing that\nHe went to\nLive that long\nWhen two reasons one is they're stupid\nAnd the second reason is counting on my house I've got a lien against the house right now that\nIn some of the house will be sold upon his death and they would get their money or they can foreclose on it upon his death and they'll get their money they've got the collateral as part of it on and so that's part of the equation the other part of the equation is you know asking a bank or if you should borrow money is like asking a dog if it's hungry\nI mean they'll they'll loan anybody to breathe or not breathing money you know what I'm saying\nThe lending has gotten completely out of control and stupid so there's nothing you know just because someone offers you alone does not mean that you are capable of paying the loan it just means you might be breathing\nOn hand and so the industry is you're stupid is what it amounts to but uh so we have to protect ourselves from them offering us things because sometimes people go oh they wouldn't have offered me this credit card if I couldn't afford it and it's like no they would've offered the dog that credit card\nSo I mean in dead people get credit card offers show is you know it doesn't mean anything doesn't even mean it doesn't mean you're not a dog and doesn't mean you're alive\nIf you've got a credit card offer you could be a dead dog and get a credit card off or it can happen so I mean you could be that low on the deal so that that's what you got to think through and just you've got to take care of him and you are you're doing a really good job congratulations Tim is with us in Dayton, Ohio I tell them how are you\nOn the umpires have I got to require retirement okay\nUm did you hear about a year ... and um I got ... mentioned I don't have a four weekends off of you know what a good way mhm I click here at fifty two it'd be better to file for Social Security and weight while before it goes on for we have for\nRetirement age\nYou can run the math out [noise] but usually your rate of return on your four O. one K. on the mutual fund that money is growing at a faster rate than your Social Security check will grow if you delay it\nAnd that's the way you're comparing it say words if you wait from sixty three sixty five to start receiving it\nWill you know what is the rate of return on that you know how much more do you get as a result and usually you get more in a mutual fund generally speaking um and then the other question comes of you know even if I don't need it should I take it\nUm and uh I I you know if you're willing to live on less than you make in in a sense invest some or all of it um by not taking out your four one K. or by some other things than than usually comes out better to take it earlier uh but but you know there's a lot of different\nParts to that equation and you know if you know when you're going to die sure makes it easier to do the equation oh\nThat would definitely [laughter] yeah so you got you got to kind of gas and you got to say you know average death age of a male and the U.S is Seventy six averaged ... deaf age of a female in the U.S is Seventy eight\nBut once you've lived to be sixty it's higher than that because that and those numbers include infant mortality include teenage death that kind of a thing and so you know if you're healthy sixty year old you got a real shot at Ninety\nAccording to the stat tables right now and so um that that's what you've got to walk through and think through in the process so good question ma'am thank you for joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five taught as in New Hampshire I taught how
