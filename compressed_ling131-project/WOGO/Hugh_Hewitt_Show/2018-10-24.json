Seventy good morning morning to you\nThank you for joining us okay so the story of the day seems to have more from the caravan at least for the time being anyway to what it means to be a national is the president of course declared it a Houston rally there he is not a global is to you as a nationalist and he was instantly seized upon as being\nA white Knight well asked anyway by Jim Acosta don't you mean white nationalist is it possible to just be a nationalist meaning I care about Americans before I care about the concerns of the globe\nHere's the thing this is just ... or a great way to articulate that you're a patriot a patriot be someone who defends our nation without our nation above all others in a perfect world could say well that could mean and national is to let a perfect world Euclid\nBut we both know and we've heard from the likes of extraordinary leaders like John McCain that's not a word we need to use it as a dog whistle at a time where we are seeing racism and seen a phobia on the rise let's be better and not use that word\nWhy why why why if if it is anonymous whip patriot which I agree patriotism nationalism\nI said in a perfect but we're not living in a perfect\nWorld why don't we strive for world instead of playing to the fears and the and the and the racist a allegations of of people for political partisanship why don't we make our property world\nBecause it's not like we're saying it's not like we're hearing from someone that has a high anti gets word who strive for a perfect world is a president who took him time after time and time again at the way that I speak saying that he you know David is\nThe president has already said in the last week up there are good people from the middle east on that caravan and you and I both know he's been dog whistling straight out of the gate since he came down the elevator at Trump Tower wait\nWait wait a minute wait a minute this this is this the president said after he pulled out of the Paris climate accord I was elected by the people of Pittsburgh not the people of terrorists is that a dog whistle or an acknowledgement that my first duty and obligation is to the people of our country that's not a dog whistle that are just they don't have a loyalty to the to the people who are elected him\nThat's not a dog whistle so I'm not saying\nAs they're not saying everything is on a nationalist oh about an hour people before the people of Paris are the people around the globe\nI'm not saying that what he said specifically about the Paris climate accord was a dog whistle but many many other things including many sides speaking about Charlottesville work dog whistle\nBut the president's Stephanie the president very clearly in Houston\nVery clearly defined what he means by comparing\nNationalism to globalism not comparing whites to blacks not comparing white America to to minority America he said global is think about the globe burst in our country second a national is think about our country first and the globe second I'm a nationalist he made it very clear\nThat this had nothing to do with white nationalism and it seems like people are going out of their way to find fault with it\nAnd we're going to agree to disagree\nGiven the president's history on racial issues giving his professional history given his father's professional history I prefer ... extra careful in his word choices especially as we go into an election where he is capitalizing on the ... so we're going to agree to that ...\nWell yeah we we certainly are but what I Want to know what is ... how it is that you are going to take the position you are when he defined globalism before defining what he means when he says nationalism you can't put words in people's mouths and I feel like that's not caused it sounds like what you're doing stuff and\nI'm not putting anywhere in his mouth what I Will be able to do is look back on many many things president has said over the years and it's why it makes me feel uncomfortable\nOkay what what exactly has the president said recently about this issue that makes you feel so uncomfortable has been you know your your expertise is is largely in economics you or your you know Bloomberg TV a editors while you're a former anyway you\nYou know you so given all of your economic history the president is largely talking about global or ah nationalism in globalism in were you know it matters of trade you know he has often said look we're going to stop other countries from taking advantage of the United states if I have to use tariffs if I have to start trade wars in order to make sure that we get a better danger our market is that\nIt helped not economic nationalism but is that not economic nationalism is my question\nNot if you look at the way the president is conducting themselves to give you the truth chat an impact he would engage in things like ... to point out partner with our outlining set of attacks\nWhich is to say

I mean to a da chess or ... the first installment and then and then we hope that at that point when that happens we'll see the activity pick up across the country I actually had Bob a guy like staff came in ... before I went to Washington last week and\nSaid look you've got to read this letter was from a gentleman in Ontario, Oregon I opened it up\nThere was a five dollar bill five one dollar bills with a note attached to it said please build a wall between the United states and Mexico\nAnd I see Iraq's the envelope and the five bills and the five dollar bill and I sent it to all these sheriff's around the country that went with us to Washington from the thirty five states said listen\nThis gentleman represents the best of America and he's maybe of modest means but he believes in some way that he can help you know joined with the sheriff's across this nation and fight to get this wall built which we've been asking for for Twenty years\nAnd um protect our neighborhoods because he sees as most Americans do our communities are getting worse and worse when it comes to the victimization by criminal illegal aliens\nAnd um and I said you know this not only does he represent the best of America\nThat this represents why we a sheriff's now have to take over for what Congress has refused to do are elected by the exact same people that Congress are\nBut it's it's our time in history now to step up stand with our people and let's get this border security and lets you know fulfill our obligation and our promise to the people are in spite of what Congress is doing the work against us\nWhile it is extraordinarily important and I'm so glad to see people like you taking a leadership position because again we you know we we are going to have to accept this I think the president's intentions of the best absolutely I think he has promised to put military at the border is is a great thing although it's nothing but show because they're not going to fire on people they're not going to physically\nYou know a stop people with tanks and ... they're going to just be there for show as a backdrop\nBut at the end of the day if they come up and use the right coded language the code words that they've been coached to say when they got there as far as claiming asylum they're going to get a they're going to be given a you know a summons to come back and have that can serve but it's going to take many months and as we know they're going to be here they're going to be\nWell I don't know if you saw Bob I'm going to solve this but it's important again for people to really understand what's going on and who's behind this we believe I'm obviously there are people in this country who are encouraging it or right before the midterms have some of that is part but\nIf you look at the two thousand five there they were showing it to two thousand five tape on Obama he said we cannot allow people just to come into this country ah and and violate our laws
