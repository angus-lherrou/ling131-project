after his\nRally in Pittsburgh last night but I was a tough one a rallying against the president knows a battleground soccer\nStore event in Pittsburgh obviously with you and your colleagues Michael my bed and others I'm sure it was great event but uh uh you have that deal in Pittsburgh while battling the uh the illness that took his voice from him yesterday so I'm very happy to be sitting in for today\nFrom the pain free really factor dot com studios of am fourteen twenty the answer in Cleveland so\nThe president a rally last night as a\nMentioned uh for Ted Cruz but also rallying for himself in for just the conservative Republican vision in this country and why it is it's so important is so integral for the Republicans to not only a hold on to but maybe expand their majority in the United States Senate but also to try to hold off\nA the Democrats whether it'd be a waiver a trickle\nJust cannot let them are in it but the president says of course I'll take over the house\nWe cannot deal with Speaker Pelosi we cannot deal with the Democrats the shareholders I'm a chair persons of various committees which will wipe out important investigations are ongoing right now which will start new investigations that will be politically motivated and more so\nYou know the president is doing everything you can I said before the break you know his energy level is absolutely\nUnmatched I say that not to just be you know overly overly complementary of the leader of my party but quite honestly if President Trump and his ability at his age to continue to turn out these performances and this high level of energy to try to rally people\nFor now these performances and this high level of energy to try to rally people for um you know congressional vote for Republicans who simply amazing you've never seen it before President Reagan didn't do this\nYou know President Bush won or Bush to didn't do this you can go back further than that there's nobody does this but the president is just continuing\nTo make this worldwide are not worldwide but nationwide tour of a of rallies in order to support Republicans if they do not when I'm going to say something about President Trump\nThere needs to be said\nBecause he was mocked for this in some circles a few weeks ago when he said that if we don't when\nUm the house or maintain control of the house don't blame me\nAnd some people mocked importance all Trump trying to avoid responsibility you know when clearly if a reporter if voters turn against Republicans it's going to be a repudiation of Trump what the president meant was and I think last night as another great example of this it's not for my lack of effort\nDon't blame me I Am going around\nAnd I am doing everything I can to rally support for people to uh you continue to enact\nThe vision the the agenda that was laid out in twenty sixteen when I ran for office I ran for office and said I Would do a B C D and all the way through dizzy and I am doing it but some of it I cannot do because of congressional obstruction\nAnd I'm doing everything I can to support that Congress and to make sure that we remove the obstructionists\nAnd that would mean the Democrats and we have to not only like I said hold on to hopefully grow\nIf it doesn't happen if we lose that twenty three to two to twenty seven or thirty seats or whatever it is that is the average and this is what happens in the mid term election the opposite party of who's in the White House loses that number of seats in virtually every mid term election\nIn modern American history political history\nThis would not be a repudiation of Trump it would be a direct\nUm you know following of of of historical tradition just in terms of voter norms\nIf she is able to buck those trends if he is able to stop that that wave from happening\nIt would be one of the most amazing accomplishments in modern political history\nIt just would he would be he would be stopping\nSomething from happening which is expected of the minority party which is to gain that number of seats if you somehow heads at off not only should we be given all of the praising the world for his ability to uh to rally voters in the face of incessant negativity from the media about\nHis own party to keep control but he would be ... you know he would be bucking political history in the same way that he bucked it when he won the office of president in the first\nPlace it would just be an amazing thing but at any rate the president last night obviously a spending a great deal of time talking about votes and voters in the United states and tying it\nTo the caravans why and how quite simply because the Democrats are trying to import more voters by way of ... he says we're going to stop it and he says we will have nothing that we will not used to stop that\nWe're going to talk more about that as we continue this morning about brands live in Cleveland, Ohio sitting in for the great do you if you're on the ...

illegal immigrants\nBeing allowed to vote [laughter]\nIllegal voting suddenly they're silent on the issue that doesn't matter that's okay so the president or getting that message out there last night and also talking about I'm speaking of our our relationship around the world look while the Democrats continue\nTo push for an advocate for open borders and essentially that is what they have done is they are calling for open borders we see it and we hear all of the time\nAh they're arguing that these people should be allowed to come to the United states because we are should've immigrants in humanitarian this and then when it says humanitarian concerns or be or the you know the model on the statue of liberty and so on and so forth [noise]\nAh they they simply won't open borders they want people to be able to come and go to the United states as they pleased turning it into a world a nation of global nation as opposed to one with sovereignty one that must be protected the president stated something last night that it's not going to play well with the people who hate him\nBut the good news is these people already hate him so it doesn't matter what they say when he says this cut Thirteen\nWe gotta we gotta\nWait a minute I Want to do it\nFast and you know what's happening right now as a law where they caught a caravan [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nI think Democrats something to do and I think we made a mistake or seeing how bad it is how they made a mistake\nSo and that is an assault on our [noise]\nAnd then you'll have some very bad very bad [noise] and we can't let that happen to our country and it's not [noise]\n[noise] so the president went on\nTo say that he is a nationalist he is not a global is we missed that part in that clip but he says he is a national is not a global as global is of course are concerned with the worldwide a care of people around the world as opposed to caring for the people that you were voted to support and voted to ah to represent\nPresident made that very clear by the way very early on his presidency saying I wasn't voted president of the world as well as for the president of the United states and that's what I'm supposed to do is represent the interests of the people of the United states rather than the global to gender advance by the likes of Brock Obama\nHere's a hundred percent correct in that now as it pertains to stopping that caravan this is very important I Want to make sure you understand this and I know because you're a human's Hugh Hewitt audience the Hugh Hewitt listener you already know this is your intelligent\nOr about the I in a the immigration and nationality act or from Nineteen fifty two section to twelve F it is one of the most important\nA congressional powers granted to the executive of the country this wasn't written for Donald Trump\nThis was written for the president whoever it may be was done in Nineteen fifty to\nThe president has vowed to send us many troops as necessary to the border to keep this caravan of migrants and they're not migrants their invaders marching under a foreign flag trying to cross the southern border eventually\nMarching under that foreign flag and demanding access to the United states that they do not deserve\nAnd the president says he will send as many troops is necessary to the border he is one hundred percent correct in doing this by way of two twelve F\nOf immigration and nationality act of Nineteen fifty two that means he doesn't need Congress he doesn't need a judge to sign off on this the president can stop this caravan in its tracks using military if need be because of the powers given in by the Congress\nQuote this is to twelve F quote whenever the president signs\nThat the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens into the United states would be detrimental to the interests of the United states he made by proclamation\nAnd for such period as he shall deem necessary suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or non immigrants or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem inappropriate\nI Want you to take that with you I Want you to share that with every one you know that language you may be familiar with again as I Know he was audience knows most of this but if you don't know this take that with you and share it with every left is that you know\nIt doesn't say Congress gets to make those decisions it doesn't say a judge has to sign off on those decisions this Congress giving the executive under his own judgment the authority to make those decisions himself\nSo very very important for people to understand that we'll discuss it with David I'm rocker who will be joining us next stop France joining you live or from Cleveland, Ohio on the

coach to know what that languages\nTo claim persecution\nAre based on their race race or ethnicity or sexual orientation or whatever the case might be\nAnd then of course knowing the outrage\nThat was expressed by the left one the last caravan came through in these people are made these claims were then held in families centers detention centers if you want to call them that housing centers some parents were separated from their kids kids kids can't be held in the same facilities with adults and all that nonsense that we\nSaw by the way even if we do\nThe same facilities with adults and all

continental United States not stopping in the border states\nThey're coming up to date the coming up to Ohio gonna Pennsylvania the going throughout the north east they're going quite frankly all over the country and what are they doing when they get there when you heard the man in the clip that I played previously they're taking jobs\nThey're taking jobs they're using resources there using educational resources health care resources and so on and so forth and then they're sending the money that they earned back repatriating those dollars to their families are waiting them over are back in Honduras\nOr El Salvador Guatemala or Mexico or wherever it is that they're coming from\nThat's what their goal is you're still to what links do you think the president should go in order to stop this\nAre we talking a full militarized border are we talking about tanks on our side are we talking about\nSoldiers in troops in guardsman locked arm in arm saying you're not coming through you're not getting to the port of entry to make your claims what should the president do\nBecause in an interview aboard air force one yesterday the president made clear there is no limit the number of

give me an idea of what life is actually like in Honduras or I Believe it's probably every bit of what President Trump once described a mouse\nHonduras or I Believe it's probably every bit of what President Trump once described a much to the outrage of the left you know one of the Blanco countries it's third world it's impoverished we understand that but that does not give people in those impoverished third world countries no right to just circumvent us immigration law\nViolate our sovereignty and and pour into this country unabated it cannot happen we cannot be the world's dumping ground for all of the rest of the world's problems\nAs it pertains to asylum this part as important as well and I and and I want people to understand there's three basic requirements for asylum first and asylum out an applicant must establish that he or she fears persecution in their home country second they have to prove that they would be persecuted if they go back\nOn account of one of five protected grounds\nRace religion nationality political opinion or social group in other words a Honduran migrant or invader\nComing to the border of the United states after plowing through a Guatemala and plowing through Mexico and getting to our border they wouldn't have to say if I go back to Honduras they're going to persecute me on the base of my race weight your hunger and\nOn the base of my religion what religion are you that's going to be persecuted in Honduras my nationality again you're Honduran\nMy political opinion or my ... participation in a social group in third the applicant must establish that it's the government of Honduras then is persecuting for said things\nNow we just heard from one of the migrant or we have one of the migrant caravan ah members in that piece that I played last hour from Fox and you've heard what he's saying is that why you why do you want to come to the United states and you were when he said jobs we want to come to work\nWell that's that's not fleeing persecution which means when they go to the United states port of entry they're going to lie and say I'm being persecuted when the reality is they just want to come to the United states take jobs from Americans or from legal immigrants to the United states and then repatriate the dollars they earn for those jobs back to their country\nThat cannot happen\nThat is a violation of American sovereignty there is no two ways about it let's go to Houston Lucas look yes you're on the Hugh Hewitt show where you at the rally last night in Houston\nWith my father in law and my family\nSo you know where that is amazing that is fantastic can you tell me something\nCan you give me an idea and I know you didn't call about this but I have to ask you can you give me an idea of how many people how many thousands of people were still outside that venue [noise] uh and and could not get in but wanted to stay and Sheeran support the president and Senator Cruz numbers\nWise I cannot say but I Know all of downtown where shut down because no cars could drive through because of the amount of people still outside trying to get in and just trying to celebrate freedom\nThe president's ah estimate from his team was around twenty five thousand people outside the venue but your police chief down their heart Acevedo said ah maybe three thousand people\n[laughter] now I think it was probably more like ten to Fifteen I mean all all the roads were shut down all around us\nAnd I know they they try to minimize the president's impact in fact they they do that all the time and I know or else I mean it was a very very liberal a sheriff down there and ah I Know what he stands for but at any rate what'd you call about\nSo I mean I I'm a marine and I feel that just because a government our government says one thing doesn't mean that might be or be not best for the people I thought for this country I don't bite\nTo a sit back and watch our country being invaded we've already made certain understanding that they're not being there not leaving on doors because of prosecution they're leaping because they want what we have we've fought for what we have enough they're not ready to grab a gun and fight for what they want then they can sit back and kill them we can sit back and just do it needs to get done\nThe problem today is is we don't drink a cold beer out of the death\nOf a skull of our enemy that we've fought we don't but dead bodies on a wall to let people know that you don't come in here we are a great country and we're only great because we fought for it we didn't walk into someone else's country and take it\nAnd that's what they're doing they're not coming here because they need help coming here because they want what we have we need to stand up and fight for what we had before we all lose that\nJust because the government just because Trump or the Democrats or Republicans does it matter or country of one we all need to stand up together as one and fight back not sit back and just hope it got it doesn't affect us in our little out wherever we live\nTell me this marine how do you feel when you see these people marching under a Honduran flag\nI feel like we need to take a Hogwarts just go down that road just take care of 'em real quick\n[laughter] thank you for your service to our country got blessed thank you Lucas ah that that would offend me as a member of the United states armed forces had I served more than anything else\nWe fought for our flag and these people are marching to invade our country not carrying our flag so showing they want to be one of us carrying the Honduran flag saying they just want to move their nation into our nation of prosperity that's a problem not Branson for Hugh Hewitt here on the Salem

fourteen twenty dancer and beautiful Cleveland, Ohio beat her personality is with us Peter is a member of the United states commission on civil rights\nFor Cleveland, Ohio Peter cursing our is with us Peter is a member of the United states commission on civil rights and we're talking about the migrant caravan the legalities of it all the politics of it all and now the security of it all Peter\nThe president said in an interview on air force one yesterday there is no limit to the number of troops he's willing to send to the border to stop this caravan he repeated that last night or does have been in Houston for Ted Cruz he has the plan a re power\nTo deny anybody admission to the United states as long as he deems it in the interest of the United states this is granted him by the uh immigration and nationality act in Nineteen fifty to\nThe question is how far do you think he is willing to go and how far should he be willing to go in order to literally physically militarized that border with troops with tanks with James with whatever's in order to stop these migrants from getting to the port of entry where they can dust then make their asylum claims\n[noise] well I think he's willing to go as far as he can go under the law of absolutely no doubt a fused motivation and use determination to do that as opposed to some other presidents\nHowever there is a you know eat a certain conflict in terms of the law you know and it hasn't been complete your Judy key to it as far as the terms of how far can go we've got some historical perspective as to how far we can go\nBut although he's got the right I think you've just indicated and we've discussed the snow asked\nTo do my classes of aliens entry into the United states and it's sort of political like the\nMeans by which he does that is subject to dispute because he is constrained in terms of the use of the military domestically but a policy kind of taught us act\nNow works like substance to that and has them fully litigated as to the extent of the president's power in terms of using um [noise] uh troops to do that\nWith the president can do for example is he can ask states to to you I'm a deployed the national guard he condense federalize\nThe national guard troops but if you federalized with them again he comes up against the policy kind of hard to say now what they can do is engaging non law enforcement act that is that as a deterrent but they can't easily equipment or vehicles that can't stop and frisk can pursue individuals\nWrecked as law enforcement or you know a law enforcement has to be but there are at least some with maintained there are exceptions to that and let the president might have the ability\nTo have a two tours quest that the national guard retain their state status and then there they may potentially use them in active use if uh it's deemed necessary to do so but there's there was a real gray area in terms of law now\nSetting that aside as to whether or not there was affected by which would you use federalize National Guard or army troops or even state National Guard\nTroops to engage in the kind of tradition activity\nThe presence of the army there or ... of troops there\nActs as a deterrent and as a back to back stuff now you may recall that earlier in the year the president said that he was going to send troops down there in support and to do and just typical assistance to free up the border patrol in others to engage in the border\nEnforcement activities and I think that uh you know look he's got plenty of authority to do that that's without question uh there was a real question as to whether or not you know some would say well the this so called ... and that's coming in who knows how large will be by the time it reaches order is not really an invading force per se\nOr it doesn't have weapons but at what point does it become a threat to national security\nYou know many of us would argue it's already a threat to national security looked at several thousand that are a threat to national security is Fifteen thousand what about if it rises level what we saw in Europe where it's tens of thousands maybe a hundred thousand\nIf it's on the way it it's on the way by the way new Mexican news agencies now say that caravan is at fourteen thousand and it only started a short while ago went from two thousand uh fourteen thousand by the time it gets here you know several days from now because there's still a thousand miles away Pete where we are going to be in the tens of thousands\nRight and do they have to be carrying weapons in order to be considered invading force official which could uh uh justify the use of troops I don't know there's a lot of gray areas there but I think that\nIn the first instance the president added states as the commander in chief needs to do what's necessary to secure the for\nThe border that may not include the law enforcement activity but at the turn out in the water is it\nThat it is indeed that Peter thank you so much Peter personnel us commission on civil rights for joining us twenty seven minutes after the hour by friends sitting in for he went right back out\nInto the Hugh Hewitt

Sunday at three twenty five a that's a decision for the medical staff\nYou come to a port of entry again this is why a border wall and itself cannot solve everything because you just they these people just go to a port of entry and they claim credible fear they say I have credible fear of returning to my homeland\nAnd that's their initial basis for an asylum claim and and we we approve those credible fear claims and math so when they say I claim credible fear\nThen they get an appointment before an immigration judge\nTo women ... or ... let me interrupt for a second to clarify something\nIt's it's my understanding that credible fear it has to be on the grounds of one of five protected grounds central race religion nationality political opinion or particular social group\nNone of these people I mean ... they're all Honduras so where you can't be rising nationality or their religion I I I unless they're claiming their Muslim and they're they're being discriminated against in a largely Christian population which I don't know that they are political opinion or public particular social group they don't have any book where you're writing on those grounds\nYou're right but but you remember just look how organized this caravan is these people are coached their coach they know exactly what to say when they get there\nTo fall under that credible fear determination and a lot of the times works you know these people are getting approved enlarged numbers they were approved and a lot larger numbers in the Obama administration but they still are and that's just the initial German determination\nSo they come in they get released into the interior of the country or asylum backlog is massive it's I think it's around five hundred thousand\nSometimes it can take years for their claimed to be heard so they get released into the country in some cases they even get work permits employment authorization documents so that's what they want they know that can happen and a lot of times again they just disappear so Congress needs to tighten our credible fear standards and again with these family units in ... in our law right now\nUm Mexicans are the only people that can be promptly deported\nAgain Central Americans can't be promptly repatriated at the TV PR a loophole it's called or you can get a listener asylum system is is riddled with loopholes I mean those are the main pool factors for people to come here and as long as Congress just just sits on their hand that doesn't do anything these caravans will still\nCome and keep happening and again President Trump's talking about the border wall securing funding in December but a border wall will not do much good overall with this current crisis we have in less those loopholes are also close\nOr ... helped me out helped me understand this it was reported yesterday that are on Fox that the Mexican government has offered asylum to these people\nUm if that is the case we don't have to repatriate them back to Honduras or run a mile or El Salvador we can repeat your pay dripping back to Mexico there are no longer in fear of persecution from their governments if we're not sending back to them back to their governments were sending them to the country that well actually we're just saying\nStay in the country or in right now you have been granted am not asylum at amnesty by the Mexican government\nTherefore your claim of persecution by the under a government holds no water\nYeah I'm I'm I'm that we're not clear how it's exactly working out with what the Mexicans are doing and one in one instance I saw it as well that when they reached a certain area in Mexico Mexican authorities were right they're offering them an opportunity\nTo claim asylum and then the care of and blue right past them again so it it's it's unclear kind of how that would be treated when they do get here but again as you mentioned yes these people are no the fact that they entered in a safe third country they entered into Mexico shows that they are no longer fleeing violence is that are not willing to stay\nRight where they are in it what we can all agree is markedly safer situation\nSo if that's the case then I mean how how do we why do we have to then go on through the process of allowing them into the United states or is that what you're calling for you know our job when you talk about let's bring everybody back in the campaign trail and vote on this can we do if language does not exist in our laws that maybe that's why we need a ride and then if you have been granted\nIf you've been granted amnesty or asylum by a third party country year than your claim of asylum in the United states is no longer about\nRight no that's called a safe third country agreement again too and that would that\nThat is something that needs to be that done with Mexico and it's something that but again those people have to be interacting with the Mexican authorities NAFTA actually interact with them rather than blowing past them and just continue on to our border\nI mean they ... they have to enter a process if you will but again\nThis is just something that Congress needs to rectify and I know President Trump is working his tail off on this issue and and and he wants to stop this caravan but again in some in some areas the administration's hands are tied again you see what the travel ban it anything this administration does on immigration\nEnding DACA other things like that\nThey get into these open borders groups forum shop they go find an activist judge who who doesn't who doesn't care about our sovereignty\nAnd then they get their ruling that they want the administration can't can't ... can't act on on our national security it's simply ridiculous that's why Congress needs to act and if Democrats want to obstruct than they should do that in front of the American people and let them decide\nAre you familiar with the Merida Initiative and if so what what what good does it do to have this I'm not familiar with that I\nIt's ... it's also called planned Mexico a it's a new security cooperation between the U.S Mexico and the countries of Central America in which they're all agree to essentially not allowed to have happened what's happening right now and uh obviously music is playing so we can't get that answer an R.
