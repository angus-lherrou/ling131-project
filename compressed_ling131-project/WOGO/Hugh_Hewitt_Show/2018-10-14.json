six hundred yards actually arranged does go to eight hundred yards\nBut the majority of people ended up shooting five hundred yards and they feel good about it you know there's two ways to shoot way out there uh the dial up method where you either need to target you arrange it you dial it up with a bullet drop compensate or\nPut the cross air exactly where you want the bulletin break the shot that day one day to when you come back out we were cold over\nSo if you show up when the optic like a ... by for where the uh the tour is calibrated in in in quarter minute clicks you know for clicks two minute\nThe hash marks on the radical\nThey too are set up into him away edge marks so day one once we do the discovery in minutes of angle dial up at three four or five and six they too as a piece of cake it's a cake walk because you come back in and you have your hold over hash marks so I have\nTo you all you have to do is go to your whole points you know and and do you hold over so at the end of two days\nYou got plenty of ain't point event impacts shooting with a dial up and they tell you that hold over\nThe hash mark pointed out to a five six hundred\nYards yeah so you're in you're going to go to school they're going to learn everything there is about to open up that gun and and getting out there exactly where you want to be washed our credentials and people that have hunted like me\nI have a shot up by gun since I was ten years old I've hunted extensively my whole life I've never trusted myself with a three hundred yard shot\nAfter visiting with you half a day that's a chip shot for me I have full confidence in that not a problem at all the credentials even people that shot forever [noise] ah you know maybe have never ventured out there to pass two hundred yards or a hundred and fifty yards\nA and there are different places they can go to do that but it's a foreign language to them they've never they've never driven a Ferrari before so why you Robert you got the credentials\n[noise] um I I obviously we all have a starting point uh in in our shooting slash instruction careers and and mine was a military slash I trained with several people like Jeff ...\nOut of the past and some of those guys but I Would think that my my greatest a set of credentials as the fact that we watch people shoot for almost forty years uh and and I see a common flaw\nIn and shooters and I would say that that common flaw\nManifest itself and trigger management Paso over the years and it's been probably thirty five at the Texas pistol and rifle academy a Texas pistol dot com over those years we've learned that trigger management is the key to to the precision rifle program\nAnd we teach a surprise break method a ... with the crust three pound trigger a week and uh we we can we can send you out to your hunting environment so that you can ride the gory trained\nTo the skinny Shia [laughter] I like that and I said what you'd diverted from yourself and went to a year teaching methods but I'll say at twenty two years US military special forces you have been on a range or two in your life and you've learned from the very best and you train\nOr some of the very best as well let's talk about day one when folks first come to see you or they bring their equipment their gun they're optic uh what else should they bring with the [noise]\nWe have a list of equipment a on a DVD that we send out once the person confirms with us and and says okay I Want to shoot with you guys you know here's my credentials use my credit card money but once they get booked in with us\nBut we send a DVD which reviews the necessary equipment or it will be used what we like to see in a way of optic or what we like to see in the way of a specific bullet that the gun likes\nSo that once they get here they're shooting a very tight shot group a and that makes our job and our life a little bit easier so is a walk through the door we want them to have the proper equipment\nBecause the proper equipment is one third of the battle so they show up here good equipment one third of the battle one and the two days with us and and then we make them a pointed vein pointing impacts shooter on day one in a holdover shooter on day two to five hundred\nPlus yards and when they first come here it's classroom setting you're going to\nA hundred plus yards and when they first come here it's classroom setting you're going to spend a considerable time I'm a ... probably I'm guessing half a day or so in in the classroom or what are you doing there\nIn the in the classroom the first thing we want to do is we want to spend a little time with the individual and find out exactly what his objectives are\nUh you know everybody just a little bit different in what they want to shoot the position they're going to take but the the foundation shooting the bone support the most or all actually surprised breaking the trigger is all the same so number one\nWe're going to look at that rifle we're going to address that rifle to fit that individual we're going to make sure that it's pristine clean and push team dry and everything is good and tied on the topic and then we roll into our instruction on how to manage the rifle and how to release the trigger a break the trigger\nBut and we feel like that trigger management once you learn that but it will it will it will tighten that shot group for you a\n... I knew that from friends that have been here and that's how I first heard about your friends who have been here said man you've got to go see this guy I don't care how well you shoot he's going to make it better and then I watched the video that you referring to and man there's some more of my friends on there and I'm thinking we're of I've been all my buddies are going to see Robert all this time and\nAnd I haven't I tell you what we're going to take a quick break but then we're going to come back and talk a little bit about Dr fire and how important\nThat is certainly a if if if you recognize this the following name a that is is probably the most renowned elephant hunter that ever lived as Karen ... bill\nA nobody uh in our history set maybe call us has got one of those guys\nBut Chris Kyle dry fired as much as Kara mo Jo bell did\nAnd Karen mojo Bell's claim to fame as I understand it is that he could place that shot yeah in that in that in the front or or from the rear of the elephant and get into the brain so that that an elephant would collapse on its knees and the other bulls wouldn't be disturb\nShouldn't so so he uh he he uh not only a drive fired a continuously his whole life but he was able to position that shot and his subconscious mind would make that correction if the last moment if it wasn't exactly correct dry dry far as the key to it all\nUp and we're going to go through it next after we make a little run to the coffee pot I'm not going any further without a cup of coffee Ron sounds great to me\nGood money this is Ian Harrison history channels ... champion and when I Know in the great outdoors I'm thinking about it with big really came to outdoors\nCome to a marksman firearms in to lean on Saturday October thirtieth from ten am until seven pm for our big birthday blowout we'll have our Lee gun give away all day door buster special ed free to the first two people in the door get a free fire are so come early\nIt all goes down Saturday October thirtieth at our big birthday blowout it marksman firearms in Philly located at Twenty one oh three ...

keeping a watchful eye out for their son\nHowever with an expanding grizzly bear population into the prairie an agricultural lands in central Montana now burned hunters need to follow suit\nPheasant season is opening on top of other upland seasons that have been open since the first of September in Montana and this is the time of year when bears move off of seasonal sources of food like\nChoke cherries berries and they start looking for other things to eat this annual search for food and calories is called hyper ... and it's what bears do in preparation for a long winters now\nYou bird hunters headed for Montana really need to understand that you could be in close proximity to bears even if they're miles away from the Rocky Mountains from\nHunter should be particularly careful near thick patches of brush it even more so in those tickets along canals creeks grizzlies have even been known to bed and tall grass or cat tales but prefer very thick shrubs\nKeep a watchful eye on your dogs too is they may stir up a sleeping ... units David be prepared\nOf our our our uh our a good majority of our shooters uh have book to hunt or to shoot something exotic a long way off a ... a Marco Polo a desert bighorn [noise]\nYou know and and their their guide say listen you know if you want a nice ram a unit you need to be able to shoot five six hundred yards with a first round out of the tube accurately well if this guy's going to climb up the side of the mountain he usually want something pretty light\nTo to tone up there you know he doesn't want to have the five and a half counter barrel ... shooter my use [noise]\nSo uh we see a in regards to your question Billy we see some carbon fibre type or barrels come through we we see some some some thin a very small I'm a counter barrels that shoot very very well\nAnd in a stainless steel floated so those guns that are that we see today or the thing to impresses me is that they're very light but they hold a three shot group so we can do our due diligence on bullet performance so I I Would say the uh\nYou know the the the new kid on the block is that the light\nCarbon fibre a type rifle is easy easy to carry up the side of the mountain but still shoots a dead nuts\nOr if we need to purchase a new optic what are some teachers on that new object that we need to make sure that they have they feature before we spend our money on it\nWell a lot of the shooters that come through here\nUh occasionally they'll use our rifles we have rifles lined guns available and I'll make reference to our line guns as an entry level rifle ... certainly if you've if you've been a consumer out in the marketplace you know there's there's there's a lot of high end rifles out there that shoot a phenomenally well\nBut are are are entry level rifle or might be a a Remington seven hundred and three oh wait a little LT are light tactical rifle far that three hundred Winchester magnum\nA in a Remington seven hundred a sin Darrow series so once we choose maybe one of those two rifles and we'd rate to three oh eight zero to five hundred yards free to write the three hundred when magazine wrote a thousand yards then we look for an optic\nAnd the ... the the the the uh the the the the defining the defining components of that in finding a aspects of that rifle we want a a current and elevation toward that she can dial up look at the numbers and really feel the cliques\nAnd also on the radical uh on the southern vertical axis we want the hash marks in minutes of angle\nOr every two MOHA you you'll you'll you'll see a holdover you'll see a number two four six eight and ten so once we do our due diligence on day one\nAnd we dial that elevation up and we get our dial up at three four or five and six and minutes of angle but it's a very easy transition day to to the hold over because the hold over his hash marks and minutes of angle\nTwo four six eight and ten you know will hash marks in between each one of those are no rules so uh if I could say entry level rifle Remington seven hundred a and that vortex diaper you know might be the ... we would make a suggestion in regards to your pick this up if you want an entry level rifle\nMore checks vie for is going to have all the elements that you're going to need to make a any shot in Africa or or for that Marco Polo sheep and to ... or wherever you might be going\nIt's going to handle everything that long range from Texas whitetail or on out there are no one should feel intimidated if they want to learn to to shoot better no one should feel intimidated to call you should\nWell are you know not at all and you ask what kind of guys come through the door [noise]\nUm you know we have all types of shooters or the guy that maybe he's never pull the trigger on that rifle a or the guy that has a serious book jerk or slap ... accelerator heart rate in one of the primary things we do is we teach trigger management under accelerated heart

a President Obama has the advantage of basically having free uh money out in the uh the economy at zero percent interest rate from the bad habits are saying\nAnd this is just kind of a natural question at a a great economy um that has decided to rate them of the interest rate and the market itself is raising interest rates because the dollars strong right that doesn't just kind of a natural
