mother she babysit their kids or our kid right now will be two here in November I'm and she's planning on moving back so right now we live with my mother in law which is my wife's mom\nAnd if my mom raised my wife has to quit her job to take care of the kids because the cost of\nA child care here is exponentially high um and we have an option to move down there with them\nI'm I'm thinking we should but because of Baltimore jobs are transferable mhm we could transfer their Phil ... for a job if she quits also we our health insurance goes to my health insurance which is a lot more expensive than hers mhm and\nSo what does your wife make er about thirty two thousand a year mhm\nAnd I make around forty okay you\nKnow she's not going to know that a lot out for daycare on that you want to lose money she basically be working for daycare and health insurance but mainly um I mean it's not going to end just not twenty five hundred dollars a month but it is probably going to be\nA you know Fifteen hundred isn't it yeah a couple of Eighteen 'cause one will be born you know going out to babies okay yeah I'm\nAll right and what do you do for a living\nI'm In sales or my wife works for the state what do you sell\nA pest control and termites stuff like that\nMhm and that your company has a branch and the other city\nOh yeah and we're throughout the state okay right [noise] um\nWell here's what she waits which ears\nRight um well here's the thing as you age which\nYou know your ears and I think I Would want to decide where idle Leo's based on some formula other than where the babysitter live ...\nYes\nOkay I don't like that formula much I get how you're going there\nBut I think you need to decide where you live based on the quality of life based on\nI Want to be near family based on the job that I Want is their land we figure out a babysitter\nI'm it sounds like you're following mom around a little bit I don't mean that in a negative way I mean it's yeah it's just a babysitter thing is drawing un and it feels like that's the wrong way to make this decision I'm not sure it's a bad decision\nThat you take out only when you would want to\nWish you could get pre approved\nAnd have a lien against your house for a certain amount of money and that's a line of credit home equity line of credit means you're pledged your house for that line of credit\nUm and this is a method of getting a second mortgage on your home basically a show a is it worth having or should I avoid it will die and we tell folks to avoid that we try to take it the other way we went through to get rid of your heat lock your home equity line of credit if you have one once you get reverse mortgage if you have\nOne we want you to get out of debt 'cause when you don't have any payment you know what you have money the bar or a slave to the lender so now we don't recommend home equity lines of credit and bar Paul is on Facebook is there a mileage limit your use as a rule of thumb when buying a used car\nUm\nKnow what I'm trying to determine is is the core worn out to the point it's going to give me trouble so the more inexpensive and cheaply made the car is the more the miles would affect it\nIn other words a hundred thousand miles dodge neon would be different than a hundred thousand miles Mercedes\nLike one is used up and the other one is just getting started\nAt that point you know what I'm saying the ... is really tired under the hood of that neon at that point I mean do they still make a dodge neon but you get my point the cheap little dinky but car I mean you got a hundred thousand miles smart car that's called dom okay\nIt's not called smart anymore so I just give you that example so no chance I Want that thing\nBut if you got a car that's built let's say a higher in nicer vehicle uh they're typically well bill I mean ... again a Honda Lexus a Mercedes a beamer a Cadillac um\nThe larger body Ford products forge building a great product a truck\nA Chevy Truck afford truck with a hundred thousand miles on that one thing about that\nIt's got easily another hundred in it may be another three hundred and it depends on how you took care of it and what you were driving and that kind of thing\nUm but I I wouldn't think anything about that at all uh again that we can depend on your budget and how nice car you want obviously the least miles or the last year's car I bought was a raptor at at Nineteen thousand miles on when I bought it I drove until I got about sixty or not got the got about fifty something on it\nAnd um so it was a very low my car when I got rid of it the other day and um so you know you just you're looking at your situation to what is the um what is your situation and what can you do but generally speaking the\nThe I'm more of an economy car it is quote unquote the uh the more the miles would have a negative effect on it\nUm because I'm just I'm just really don't know how to address them all and looking for is dependability and how much life is left in it that's a cool question very interesting Dustin is with us in St Louis Hi Dustin\nHow are you taking my call Sherman what's up I'm\nSeventeen years ago and I cook a near um got about three thousand dollars and I mean the camp out donating should I invest in China and\nYou're going to college\nYeah community college with an H ... program in St Louis and olive tree\nOkay so you're only going to do two years\nAnd then ending on how the program ... maybe ... service the maturity and I keep them at community colleges is either and you write up north yeah no\nI Will be true if you get some search some certifications and stuff and not the four year degree might not even be a wise investment I agree with that crime so that's what you want to do you won't be programmer you want to be an hour or whatever\nMm [laughter] okay uh and the community college is paid for as long as you keep an eye plus yeah um\nYou can invest it All right here's the thing I always tell folks at your age I'm I'm much more concerned that you complete all of your educational goals with no debt than I Am whether you have an investment mutual fund\nOn a scale of one to pin a nine point nine finish college and all your education was he wrote that so if there was a bump in the ...\nWait nine finish college and all your education was he wrote that so if there was a bump in the road in your little plan you might need some money\nTo finish your schooling and that's much much you dust and as a better investment than a mutual fund is assuming you're studying something like you're talking about studying which is a very usable\nField of study that you can you know really make some good money and and the you know getting that level of education is really gonna cause your income to go be a lot a lot higher than if you didn't have that education so um you know you're the best investment we can make much\nBetter than a mutual fund I like mutual funds and I you know maybe I'll talk about um all the time so if you want to invest some of it into a mutual fund that's fine I Would not put it in a retirement account to stage a with this amount of money in your situation because again my\nMain goal for you is your friend is for you to get your degree and your field of study whether it's a two year or the certifications and the ... tech field or or whether it's a four year degree my main goal for you is to give you the tools in your belt the educational tools in your belt for you to be able to deliver your dream\nWithout any of that and that three thousand dollar spin on that is more important than than the mutual fund so if you put it in a mutual fund and you run into a bump don't be afraid to take it out and use it for college if you're going to go that route [noise]\nIf you need to thanks for calling open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Mike is in Chicago Hi Mike how are you\nI'm great Dave it's an honor to speak with you\nYou too sir what's up in your world\nMy wife and I are currently on baby step forward in time for retirement and we're using the excess our budget to pay off our mortgage early cool and we're both teachers and the state run pension pay nine percent of our growth take home pay\nOur dilemma is when we have an extra Fifteen Percent on top of that nine percent that we already contribute we don't have much left over from August coloration so when we say the ...\nWere able to save a lot for a mortgage to tolerate so is it okay to do that or him recommend saving the twenty four\nPercent now they the mandatory amount that you're putting in our ... are you invested in that is that uh uh you're choosing an investment for that or as a pension\nGet the answer is no options yeah it's it's mandatory its pension and you don't have control of it right and when you leave you can't take it with you correct that the weight on sixty thousand or okay uh and it's nine percent nine percent\nYup okay so the the equation is do we put Fifteen on top of that or do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct correct I probably would split the difference\nBecause I don't like the pinch and we're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be you don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run through its horribly run state and now we're better than all those guys\n[laughter] huh yea no thank you so uh but what I count some of it yeah ... some of it I'm not going to count it as a whole new line what if we counted it as a four or five\nIf we Canada's or for then that means we need to put it in ten percent right you got a million that you don't have a choice but I'm saying if we because we don't have a lot of faith in it I don't like it but it's there and we'll probably get some of it I mean like ... I'm not predicting the failure of the teachers pension and they'll annoy it's\nJust horribly run and if it was ever going to fail anywhere it'd be there\nYou know so um that that that's the truth and you know that show a given that let's just let's give it a fifty percent hit\nOr so and just round numbers let's put it in ten percent of the button and Fifteen Percent on top or something like that not only celebrate your mortgage a little bit I'm not going to be perfect but you know it's a little bit more to get that way and you can go that direction so um\nThat was that's what I Would back off

they're doing it to think further out into the future and um and to recognize that\nMy reason why it might not be the exact same reason it hits why but the end goal that that way in front of us is

mother on it's I don't remember\nOkay here's where I start um I I start with the premise that his somewhere down inside of you all but it's not there all the time my premises is the shortest way to become wealthy is\nTo have no payments and use your assets and your income to invest and grow things that have no pain much I'm In the show the shortest way is not to borrow because\nI have no pain much I'm In the show the shortest way is not to borrow because if the shortest way was to borrow you'd go to this deal like Tom's ten you do ten more of these right\nHave mortgages on and and the two and a half years we've had a little graduate high school he's in college ...\nAbout how the today show he's taking out loans for the other half and I stop contributing to a four one K. and if I got a beginner baby steps save but I just feel like I I'm not sure what to do next I I feel like a ... lot doing everything I could do for my family right now\nWhat's your household income but a hundred thousand ... okay so can the two of you you and him a cash flow the school and I stopped the studios but\nIf we don't if we're not as aggressive on a these rental property as we in the past couple of years okay if you um\nI mean it it's a matter of choice for you I I personally wouldn't put my kid into bed I Would rather get them through school debt free and then work on the Reynolds is there a reason they plan doesn't sound good\nNo it it does but I just I guess I just needed to hear a because he's got two younger brothers they're going to be going to college to hear a lecture years\nYou know will ... maybe some ... for five and six are simultaneous for is Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement five is kids college what you want or cash flowing in this case and a six is payoffs mortgages\nHow you know rentals in the house and so forth a but really um you know in your case you're going to really is you're going to lay working on six much in order to fund these colleges or in a sense you're borrowing on student loan debt to\nPay on your mortgage is yeah which is in an indirect way that's what's occurring you follow me\nSo I just think a lot of our consumer that we should just save up a a three maybe four month emergency fund them then yep\nAnd then and then let them stop taking out student loans and clear 'em out and then do the same with the other two and then but\nIf you can find cash flow above taking care of these college issues between the three kids if there is money above that then we start throwing it at your either your mortgage or your rentals one of the two but it sounded like a rental are tiny\nThey're not you know there are about sixty Seventy thousand dollars apiece they're not huge but they're they're still there\nIn the house is tiny but then and then around your house mortgage must be small\nIt's about about fifty sixty Seventy thousand hippies\nOkay or fifty cars you said to Fifteen\nYeah yeah and for what was the only one of the only twenty five dollars and write them a check like a year from now when I was going to show good and my son is still either take out a loan\nYeah that that's that's and that's the little rental okay I knew there was one in there somewhere to my mouth work All right ah yeah still I'm just going to plink along on those minimum ... and take your college without that first\nOnce we got college without that then we find money we throw it at the at the probably go knock out a little twenty five one out and then among ... house out 'cause it's pretty even with the other ones\nAnd then how about ... back in the world one K. or not\nSo I get back in the four one K. a Fifteen Percent now\nNow okay yeah well no so did you get your emergency fund right yeah emergency fund is maybe step three and then maybe step force Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement then we'll take care of college and then if we find some more money will keep while we're doing those are the two things will start throwing it at the rentals in the house\nThat's your order of attack maybe steps four five six in order\nTo actually three four five six 'cause you're finishing up the emergency fund in order right but it's not like about four or five and six or all simultaneous Fifteen Percent were taking care of college and then of course money left we keep going down the list and the next thing on the list is mortgages\nDoctrine is that there's so there's still a prioritization even though it simultaneously that logical\nYeah I guess I was just trying to jump at the for skipping tree or two and three I guess technically\nYou're skipping five or ... yeah yeah yeah and you have any skip three to yeah [laughter] yeah so yeah you're on around the ways in which you're back in order that's\nAll we did you can do it good plan man thanks for calling in a lease is with us in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Hi Lisa how are you\nI mean it's an honor to talk to you how can I don't quite often for yeah okay\nUm we had our house currently on the market right now we live in July for pain [noise] um [noise] I Know there is not an email in our\nArea [noise] um we kept lowered it down to one Ninety nine nine [laughter] we've had only one going we've had\nHundreds of heads on line [noise] um what were struggling here we paid one state for the how the average stays on the market in my area as three hundred and sixty nine [laughter] good\nLord what is wrong on the area\nIt sort of a weird situation it's rural um Pennsylvania we\nWell it sort of a weird situation it's rural um Pennsylvania we have like an elite area about Fifteen miles from us and those houses are selling for about a half a million [noise] um\nAnd then the end of the Haitian Qatar lake we're on water on a on a dream but um our military than at our house is kind of out of the local market so we're waiting on a vacation or\nYou know so you're not in in Harrisburg proper them\nNo no I'm In like northeast ... up here in New York border but\nSo your biggest problem is you have a very limited market\nYeah the I mean three or six to nine days on the market is unbelievably long in this current environment that we're in I mean and all that says as you're in a very rural setting um and it's not true resort it's sort of adjacent to resort stuff\nRight and you just have a limited market I don't know what\nTo tell your other than a is there anyone in the resort area if you drive up in the area that is true resort and you're like fringe resort\nIs or is there a a realtor up in that area that's moving a bunch of that property that you see there are signs everywhere that kinda specializes in that so that if they had a client that really didn't want to quite pony up for that area but one of the have stepped down they knew you were there\nI mean they're they're reaching out to our relatives that are not not purchasing\nI'm Talking about your the real estate agent in that area is or someone who dominates that resort area\nThe higher and stuff\nI'm not really honestly I mean we kind of stepped out to our nearest town they get a kind of a high ... I mean we had a professional photographer [noise] it look gorgeous on line it's not you know these rural it kinda like everybody's second job [laughter]\nSo why are you moving [noise] we need to get it or we have an hour drive to work like can I Can't do it anymore you know okay I mean can you know\nOn the road for hours a day and my husband didn't know how how significant like that we just say oh well\nI don't think I don't think prices your problem or you've got a marketing problem you know what I mean by looking at\nThey're looking at it on line all their\nWorkers they're not they're not clients are lurking they just like the picture flip through and then they realized where it was I walked away there were not client's\nLocation kill them it was not the house and it was not surprised\nBecause our neighbor's house I mean the closest neighbor um same set up as ours held for one eighty nine half the size of our house but double the lot you know\nBut he found a buyer for ... I mean you just don't have any potential buyers much and that's what I'm trying to do is fix the marketing side of this this is a this is a really tough one I mean do I pick another well yes\nAnd that's what I was trying to get you to do to go up there and look at the resort area who's moving those half million dollar houses\nThat when someone comes about ... million dollar house and just gulp I really can't afford it but I Love this area they go oh I got this place down there in the fringe at under two hundred and it's the sweetest little house and you got to see it and that's who your sexual yourself through your realtor is\nThe person that can do that this that the people that are gathering the leads in the upper area and they can funnel them down to you for the people that don't want to spend enough to be in the other area\nAnd and that's your best shot you just need more potential buyers you and that a good potential buyers and it's probably not your real first of all they probably just don't work this area\nAnd they and they don't have a central Meyer stores you need to it's a very unique\nSemi rural ... situation oh I'm Sorry this is the day Ramsey show\nIdentity theft has become an epidemic data breaches or being reported every\nDay and hundreds of millions of people about their identity stolen sometimes multiple times that's crazy now I've seen first hand

you go it wasn't that big a dominance for that matter but um you know the same thing here so I guess what you need a backup from and say\nI like being ... about things I'm getting old I liked legacy things I like old things that other people in that I loved touched inhaled and treasured I like having those things in my life houses a little bit difficult to be nostalgic about its large\nOr is this got a lot a lot like a lot of land with it as it multiple generation or is it just a subdivision house and I happened to be where he grew up\nIt does happen like that and that's where he grew up and

horrible tragedy\nUh caused your financial trouble but had you had a pile of cash and absolutely no doubt at all you probably could have survived that so that's our new goal was to become wealthy without any dead\nAnd so as life uh lives opportunities and problems come along you're in better shape to tackle either and so how can we quickly most quickly rebuild your financial life now that you're rebuilding your overall life\nAnd uh that's the stuff you're hearing me teach every day that get on a written plan a budget or avoid that build up an emergency fund and then begin investing long term um and as you're able to get out on your own again a medically and financially you'll do\nAnd as you're able to get out on your own again medically and financially you will do that to re establish yourself as a you know a single young twenty eight year old guy that doesn't live at home or no shame in that game right now but a long term you'll want to be out right just like you want to

dollar that\nUm that that actually that's the guy I was making paint it on a monthly payments are now I Need the fat on my deck that full collection but to get out I think we'll thousand dollars mhm\n[noise] and I've already received a lot of like settlement from the mail mhm or less like I had a federal king hundred dollar bill that they're there\nFor a cake founding hundred for a friend of mine like telling me that that thousand dollars that were given mhm that apple pay taxes on that at the end of the electric wondering like true\nThat is true that is not giving us except on a mortgage on your home is a taxable income and they likely will send you a ten Ninety nine for the amount that they forgave\nOh okay\nSo what's your household income\n[noise] um [noise] it it's very very ... about how about forty five thousand is here\nOkay so let's say let's say you're out ... percent tax bracket as an example okay let's pretend if you were in a twenty percent tax bracket and you had a thousand dollars in forgiveness that didn't cost you a thousand dollars and only costs you two hundred dollars\nRight and so it's still a good deal what's your yeah your I have about two hundred dollars per thousand so that is forgiven that'll hit your taxes if they ten Ninety nine you\nIf they don't you have no obligation to list it and I would just wait until you know they do that if they follow through on that but at the end the larger the forgiveness is the more likely they will follow through with a ten Ninety nine\nAnd send you that but as you get that then you will do the taxes so\nYeah I'd I'd get ready for some taxes at tax time that I'm by April ... you know that you may have\nIn in addition to that now if you had a larger return coming because you're over withholding

numbers I don't tell a four year old that you're worth ten million dollars because they will go to kindergarten and tell it\nOkay and they're not emotionally capable of handling that information our children in our case did not know our wealth as a matter of fact when we finally did unveil it and they were in their early twenties it was shocking to them because they were raised\nLike regular people but I had a lot of wealth in the background and um so I didn't want to mess up their childhood by them making assumptions about things I didn't need to make assumptions about\nBut then as we presented to them it was presented as a responsibility\nNot who we hit the lottery has asked for me in my house we sort of more\nMeaning that you don't know anything you're just managing for God\nAnd that takes a little of the ... who all of it\nAnd so they need to be emotionally mature and ... with him and we do about once a year [noise] this is the day Ramsey show\nIt's time to take another look
