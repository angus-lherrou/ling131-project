eleven people being ... and ... in Pittsburgh people in a crowded and people are laughing so here we are after the carnage and this man this moral monster is playing those basic things\nI don't want to play the political game with regards to that I Know what the fourteenth amendment was all about is that they think sixty eight is part of the reconstruction and everything to do with the miners slavery everything to do with making us being able to have citizenship as everything to do what part of the second fouling of the country\nDon't read the second inaugural\nLook at what Lincoln said so play politically innocent shows that the country's profoundly race\nNow you see what's what's interesting about that is because Eddie gets work that\nYou would tend to think he's got the moral argument he doesn't he just made it profoundly immoral argument calling the president a moral monster the debate over birthright citizenship and by the way I agree on the interpretation of the fourteenth amendment that Eddie puts forward but it is an open question an here is Harry Reid of all people\nOn the Senate floor in Nineteen Ninety three proposing an amendment a law to him and so it's not a constitutional issue in his view\nCut number five\nMaking it easy to be an illegal alien is now\nHow about offering a reward for being in a legal [noise]\nNo sun no sane country would do that\nIf you break our laws\nBy entering this country without permission to give birth to a child\nWe reward that child with US citizenship\nAnd guarantee a full access to all public of social services this society provides that a lot of ... [noise]\nIs it any wonder that two thirds of babies born taxpayer expensive country county run hospitals Los Angeles for born\nTo illegal alien ...\nThat's ... so it simply Eddie loud should be mad at\nHarry Reid for being a racist in a moral monster it's not a moral monitored to argue about whether or not the constitution was intended to convert citizenship on children whose parents are in the country illegally when they're born\nMeanwhile Jonathan Turley a man of the left professor at George Washington University School of law went on Fox News with Martha McCown last night to make the same argument watch it on the screen or listen to it cut number eight\nWere about a hundred and fifty years late in finding out what this amendment means there has been a debate since this was first ratified all of this debate turns on these six rather ill chosen words as to what it was men by being subject to the jurisdiction of the United states\nSome of the draft or that the time clearly evidence to believe that non citizens that come to this country whether they're diplomats are undocumented would not have immediate citizenship for their children\nAnd so there is a good debate here there are three different types of interpretations that have been put forward\nI Can't imagine how people can say with such certainty that this language means that anyone in the United states for any reason\nUm can have a Simpson or when they give birth on our soil I mean that's not evidence from the text of the amendment many people at the time clearly didn't hold that few\nNow it's not a ... that's not a frivolous view there's in good faith arguments on both sides but the Supreme Court has never said with any clarity or finality what it means\nThat you see that is Jonathan Turley being calm heady glad not being called let me do the other news or the morning the wall Street Journal is a story that ear buns European hit squads are back yes we've been upset about the murder of ... that

those crazy people step in the earlier today on John James enemies are running for candidate for Senate and he's a West Point graduate Apache attack helicopter African American\nI played for him this clip of Eddie go out our mutual friend on your show this is what that is that\nHow it works politically but I Do because it means something citizenship in this country has always been tied to free white person system naturalization act and Seventeen Ninety so when folks this question of immigration and you're saying ... with the Republican base is all about a certain conception of what is\nThis idea of why is it has led to eleven people being in in in Pittsburgh people in a Kroger and go to people who are less so here we are after the carnage and this man this moral monster is playing to those base\nNow and it's definitely when I asked John James has been endorsed by Trump loves Trump is going to support Trump and is an African American what he thought about they said well he got excited it's obviously passionate and true but it's not representative of the entire African American community what do you deal with\nThat no one person's voice is representative an entire community right whether it's any or John or President Trump or you or me my voice doesn't represent all women it doesn't represent our mothers doesn't represent off from New Jersey um so I I think that he can have the view and I think the candidate you speak up connected\nSo when when it he says moral monster which is what I'm getting too it struck me as like when Julia ... said the Jake Tapper that the president had radicalized more people than ISIS and she had to stop and get her moment to apologize I don't think Donald Trump's immoral monster do you\nI struggled with Donald Trump from a moral perspective right he he's the president of the United states\nAnd while he might say things that you could say Seventy I've said that at the dinner table you've said that at the dinner table it doesn't matter I didn't have to hold himself to a higher scandal while you can say seventies guilt she said you know nationalistic needs a patriot some could think that\nBut knowing what he divided divisive time we're living if you're the president of the United states it is your obligation\nRaised us up on a more level and be absolutely careful and mindful of everywhere you chew\nWell I knew that and I and I'm\nSaying like on a nationalist go with I'm a patriot go with I support uh America First are being a great American so so in terms of being a moral monster I think the president doesn't put morals first and I think he doesn't put country stars\nNow okay now I don't want to put you in a in a corner I moral monster though is different I really reject the president's used an enemy that people because it's just all of his term that usually followed by a bullet to the back of the neck\nI really reject the politics of division I I reject a lot of stuff like that these done over the but he's not a moral monster he's a controversial damage on August\nAnd then it it it's if you don't want to if you if you don't if you care so much about the division and the divide pick any topic you don't pick the topic is the president of all monster that topic capitalize on division chicken new conversation you want to talk about that I'd love to talk about that\nBut that's a that's the topic from your show that's why I picked up that's otherwise they wouldn't throw it out you just don't ever show they\nKnow that something someone set on my show and then we moved on but if you choose to continue to capitalize on it you're capitalizing on decision\nI don't I don't know if it's capitalizing if it's if it happens like the Julia Ioffe thing and it becomes obvious story coming

S. as as the war were actually stopped Ninety percent of illegal\nOr sort of one and people say oh just bring a bigger ladder they don't really know what they're talking about because they work they

switched on your Mr German um you know I'm a huge supporter of the United States Navy and President Trump promised a three hundred and fifty five ship navy during the campaign\nHe reiterated it on the deck of the Ford his Senate many many times it's been two years and we have a plan for a three hundred and eight ship navy and sucker defense Madison center in the navy Spencer dodge the question again and again when are we going to get a plan on how to get the three fifty five 'cause that's what we need\nI Know it and every time I've heard you say that you have to remind myself to maybe get on the show and\nAnd let you know one of the reasons is falling behind a little bit first of all nobody out there were very few see if your listeners are different because they've heard it in it for me talking about they for others talked about it in terms of what the Obama due to the military\nNow I don't criticize Obama for this because he is and in the heart liberals who really you know you know where their priorities are and it's not as if any American but what we inherited from him uh we were in our army brigade combat unit as an example\nWe were down only thirty three percent of those could be deployed right because he has problems and all of that\nNow we rephrase that uh thirty three percent of the two percent so we're we're in the right direction\nNow this came as a result of our authorization bill and appropriations bill\nYou got to keep in mind we did a great school getting our offers Asians grew in record and then if procreation all of a sudden we now have our preparations no less than it real serious problem but this anyway that's resolved that problem I remember our army aviation brigade\nThey were down to twenty five percent at least twenty five percent to be deployed were up ... percent now other areas that I was single out is the the Marines used essay\nAnd we'll have thirty five percent of or after eight teams could fly in and so that was really serious problem we had along with the problem that was pointed out by the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff that is that we're out range and artillery in other areas\nSo so my point of view them\nI Know that you would like to prioritize and get started on this shift and I I think we can do it that's a long range programs that I wanted to stop the leading into areas that had is that as an immediate effect\nI got it and I understand it will take years but you know I have a young friend who's over at the front desk at the Senate Armed Services Committee Madison's barber and uh she's two college grad she's working her way up over the commission good friend of mine I ask her every time have you seen the plan that she laughs because\nI think there ought to be a piece of paper that says this is how we're going to go from this number ships\nTo that number of ships and here's what we're going to build and here's what we're going to build it\nAnd this is the year in which it's going to be done because it's what any rational business that had a metric to reach three fifty five\nWould produce now Jerry Hendricks is a retired navy captain got the front cover of National Review on how to get to three fifty five I Hope your your your committee will hold a hearing in December and say how do we get to three fifty five\nOkay I'll make you do make you deal you have Madison called me will be back in a week I guess we are ten days maybe you have a call me\nWill come and I do want to get the articles he referred to because I I'm I have not read it but I Know is there a nose is as well thought

specifically on that if you get a medicine and then what do you guys\n... you betcha I Will do that now let me ask you a very quickly political question how come you don't you feel were holding the majority I think is like a hundred percent but what you think what\nYou're talking about in the Senate yeah absolutely and the Senate we are I I I'm going to get on record right you know I was saying we're going to increase our majority or by four senators\nFrom what I agree a hundred percent and there's a chance it might be more if there's anything about it\nWhen I was there you've got to sleepers in there like James and you know of the people were talking about they were talking about New Jersey you know no reason\nWe could go next with James him and Bob hog and you're right you're
