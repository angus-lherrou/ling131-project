because we want hostilities with Iran but the opposite we want to be very clear about what our redlines are and I think the president's done that over and over again\nSpeaking of red lines a Chinese ship came with a hundred and thirty five feet than American warship these are American sailors if we're threatened well our sailors fire on Chinese ships\nLook at the rules of engagement for US Navy vessels worldwide but particularly and potentially dangerous areas like the south China Sea are clear the commanders have the authority we need we will not tolerate threats\nTo American service

economic policy and what should be a free trade environment and they've gone well beyond that they've violated rule after rule after rule and they've they've defied the production of those who advocated the ... to the WTO that if they came in international pressure\nWould make trying to conform to these\nRules and norms of behavior they've done the opposite they've gotten worse they steal our intellectual property so they're able to compete with us without the investment that's required and research and development they forced technology transfer from American and European companies they discriminate against us in terms of their domestic policies\nAre and and because of the economic growth that they've sustain\nNot only by abandoning their Marxist principles but basically by violating\nOr the international norms we expected them to comply with they've gained substantial economic strength\nAnd on the basis of that economic strength they built military strikes I think what the president's doing because of his business background\nA among other things things challenging them on the economic grounds and if they're put back in the proper place they would be if they weren't allowed to steal our technology or their military capabilities would be substantially reduced at a lot of the tensions we see caused by China would be reduced\nThey have a lot of business partners in the United states shouldn't Google should Facebook be helping the People's Republic of China develop tools of information filtering and basically control when this as a nation that has admitted that a million like ours in concentration camps\nYeah I think vice president Pence spoke very eloquently on that point or at his speech at the Hudson Institute last week and I think the biggest applause line

to threaten the White House there are reports that there are sleeper cells in the United states given those sorts of threats and those sorts of reports are Americans should we be alarmed about ... regions of the United states\nI think we should be I think the Iranian regime as an enemy of the United states uh we just had a within the past months the arrest of two Iranian agents in the United states uh scoping out Jewish and Israeli targets for possible attack uh we've seen France and other European countries arresting\nA agents of the Iranian intelligence service for planning an attack on a rally of dissident Iranians in Paris this summer\nWe've seen transfer example now impose sanctions against Iran because of this behavior\nSo we see Iran or not a conforming to western norms\nBecause of the Iran nuclear deal they've not done anything to try to modify are concerned about their continued support for terrorism around the world they are accelerating this this regime is a threat that's why the president\nUh got us out of the Iran nuclear deal that's why the economic sanctions or being re imposed that's why we're putting maximum pressure on the Iranian regime and just to be clear we are having a very significant effect you can hear the European governments talk about staying in the deal\nEuropean corporations and I mean the biggest one of the biggest oil companies the biggest

is a dangerous stayed in the region and dangerous state worldwide\nIn your mind or the response of this president to any Iranian ... on the United states territory or against American ships or ... you\nKnow I think he's been very clear on this not because we want hostilities with Iran but the opposite we want to be very clear about what our redlines are and I think the president's done that over and over again\nSpeaking of red lines a Chinese ship came with a hundred and thirty five feet of an American warship these are American sailors if we're threatened well our sailors fire on Chinese ships\nLook at the rules of engagement for US Navy vessels worldwide but particularly and potentially dangerous areas like the south China Sea are clear the commanders have the authority we

unnecessarily provocative for far too long\nThey got away with an awful lot under the Obama administration I Would say\nChina is one of the ... bills coming due that Obama ignored or mishandled badly\nPressures now and President Trump he's responded in a way that has the Chinese confused they'd never seen an American president this tough before a I think their behavior or needs to be adjusted in the trade area in the international military and political areas and a whole range of areas\nPerhaps we'll see at the G ... meeting in Argentina next month ... willing to come to talk turkey on some of these issues are but the president feels very strongly that China's taken advantage of the international order for far too long\nNot enough Americans have stood up to it now's the time to do in\nChina fears of weaponized the export of commercials technology in recent reports with Bloomberg and elsewhere was there an arms race which we were completely unaware of non participating we were\nBeing taken to the cleaners for decades ever since China came into the world Trade Organization\nOr they have pursued American to list the economic policy and what should be free trade environment a and they've gone well beyond that they've violated rule after rule after rule and they've they've defied the production of those who advocated the knitting shine to the WTO that if they came in international pressure would\nMake China conform to these\nRules and norms of behavior they've done the opposite they've gotten worse they steal our intellectual property so they're able to compete with us without the investments that is required and research and development they forced technology transfer is from American and European companies they discriminate against us in terms of their domestic policies\nAre and and because of the economic growth that they've sustain\nNot only by abandoning their Marxist principles but basically by violating or the international norms we expected them to comply with\nThey've gained substantial economic strength and on the basis of that economic strength they've built military strikes I think what the president's doing because of his business background a among other things she's challenging on the economic grounds\nAnd if they're put back in the proper place they would be if they weren't allowed to steal our technology\nOr their military capabilities with these substantially reduced and a lot of the tensions we see caused by China would be reduced\nSitting right there America when I come back I'll get to the conclusion

hold of it and they and I think they're playing with little because as I say about that thing how you going to how you gonna run the country if\nSomebody a stage allegations and you know I said there's no proof available well it's a little worse than that right because if you read that thing by the by the council for this to me that interviewed her the details of her story\nAre inconsistent and you and you know so there are some things that are verifiable\nThey're not as she said and she said more than one thing about things and some of ... that are actually lose it well I don't blame her for that these are old memories about something painful and uh but but the truth is to make that\nCause to disrupt this thing is failure of the rule of law\nNow in terms of the presumption of innocence and due process\nWhat a most astonished me about this is that so many people through and so quickly with the idea that an accusation without contemporaneous corroborating evidence can be vetted in public without damage not just to the accused but to the process\nI mean it is it is nowhere in our tradition in the common law or to allow someone to convict via accusation I mean that goes back before the country was founded\nIf and see adjust to contest a little bit right this is not a trial he thought nobody has brought charges against him this is a political event\nAnd it's certainly true that is right it's fine to raise charges against him and it's even find to rage wild ones but\nThe hopes that won't be effective but look what happened here he goes through\nA ... a set of exhausted\nHearing is investigated he interviews privacy\nWith every senator who was willing to talk to him and then the other thing is he has a long career this guy has a paper trail and he's not so young guy just out of the blocks right he's he's been so there's a huge amount of material and it's obvious that they're getting ready to vote for him\nAnd then this stuff is brought up and that is not the air or a good political maneuver and if she transferred that to what it would take to convict guy of something which is rightly a different standard than just making the argument about politics and this is crazy 'cause it would never go anywhere\nAnd everywhere we come back we're going to play for your um you the seminal exchange in the media John Dickerson and Mitch McConnell talking about judges and what people have to understand about the constitution and the structure of the constitution and why blocking that seat was right\nBecause the Republicans had the majority

Harry Reid changed him with regard to the Supreme Court justices and the fact of the matter is I don't\nI think we will we will if a God Forbid adjusted drop dead three weeks before the election\nOf a twenty twenty I think the Senate would come from a replacement [laughter]\n[laughter] I wouldn't be surprised at so first of all I remember what\nThe kind of did at the moment when he delayed Merrick Garland it looked like Hillary Clinton was going to win the election right and so\nHe wasn't he was actually making the authority of the people more telling or stronger in the process this is one of the things you get to choose when you vote for president\nSo the idea that he was trying to warn people he actually involved in more in the process and I'll say it's it's actually opposite because you know in the great you know the Amish it earlier the first time ...\nOpposition party throughout a governing party by a popular vote without violence was in Eighteen hundred in America and the federalist party which had built the country for goodness sake got hammered by Jefferson's party and Madison's party here at all so built and so what\nThey they have all these midnight appoint ask election ask they know they've got hammered and they just got days to go to a whole bunch of people in there\nAnd they don't get 'em all down and that's what gave rise to the great court case ... versus Madison but they were you know that was in the eleventh hour sane against a popular vote this is the opposite of that\nAnd you betcha it but they were ... it was both are legitimate and and what I Want to point out the rules are laid out this is not secret\nWe operate under a constitutional structure that was meant to be read by and was red and debated by farmers some of whom are not literate but who would listen closely and we over complicate this this is the Senate\nHas the right to not hold a hearing the Senate has a right to confirming one day the Senate whatever the majority of the Senate wants to do the Senate can do\nAnd the election and there's a link and soon right and so if they do anything\nThat people don't like the people can punish them\nRight now and that's what keeps dishonest you're right about that\nRight and and if you ah if ah well look liquid McConnell's darn and he's\nProud of himself right because the election\nWho would have predicted it All right at the presidential election when they win\nAnd the Harry Reid changed that rule I wished by the way that they would restore the filibuster generally two is nineteenth century and most of the twentieth century meaning and then they can pass a lot more laws and when the other guys get in the past a lot more laws and then the people get a chance to choose\nIt looks to me like Carlos has been\nManeuvering us toward a better position in regard to that\nHe's been doing he was an absolutely amazing leader and I know that some in our number on the right\nDo not like him for reasons I

the law in the United states has made this at that level and Mitch\nMcConnell with Donald Trump and Don McGahn who's the unsung hero here has worked a revolution\nThat's it well they were serious about it from the first minute and and remember this to a Donald Trump as a candidate announced a list\nOf the kinds of people he would hit in other words he has submitted his direction just like I
