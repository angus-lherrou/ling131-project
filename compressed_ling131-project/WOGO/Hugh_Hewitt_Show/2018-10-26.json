media who didn't see the enemy of the American people for example fake news I've asked do these violent tendencies at least in some people [noise]\nWhy I think that that's obvious I had been concerned about them for a long time I spoke about it like in the Senate starting in January about the president's rhetoric\nBut remember we have a president who has talked for a couple of years now about imprisoning his political rival and Hillary Clinton who is encouraged violence against the media or just last week talking about the assault on a reporter by congressman in Montana and saying that he that he his kind of guy\nIt's hard to see this outside of the contacts at the president's hostility hostility towards towards Mrs Clinton who tried to briefly speak towards unity towards Brock Obama towards George Soros\nThe president and his allies they need to dial down the the political rhetoric and they are making people laugh they they are making and sharing the last last day and they're making law enforcement officer is less safe but\nWe don't know who did this or we don't know what their motive\nRight but it's a very obvious thread and maybe it's meant as a ruse but there's an obvious threat the Obamas the Clintons John Brennan CNN I'm George\nObvious threat the Obamas the Clintons John Brennan CNN um George Soros\nThese are people and organizations that President Trump continually attack demonize is caused by if you look at who they've targeted so far it's almost like they're following Donald Trump's Twitter feed and starting with Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nNow the Czech certainly one question for the president one question for the White House is the rhetoric the intense rhetoric that he has been saying and his supporters have been giving out over these last several weeks leading into mid mid term elections and certainly even before that is that contributing to any of this\nSay I mean there are all people that Donald Trump paints they are all a people that he has used violent ugly incendiary rhetoric against a weather as journalists like CNN where the John Brennan letter was dressed or Hillary Hillary Clinton you know from the lock her up chants\nAnd you know I was in the next thing we find former colleagues to CNN and they're scared and one highly former colleagues said\nThis is what happened when the president calls the enemy of the people are tired and I thought my gosh you know it's it's a tone and coming from the top and now CNN has become a target journalists that are simply trying to get\nThree hours ago the president is

that's silly we don't know who to blame you\nKnow we we can by members of the bombs when we find that out in the FBI with ten or eleven packages are going to have it or if it wasn't so serious it

they're they're just very very firm original is they are um\n... committed texture listed the document as it was understood at the time of the framing\nRight but the world will disagree is that I think that the Heller decision which I picked because the decision is two thousand eight it's the one on the second amendment as you well know and um that the school is\nCalled that his masterpiece yes that therefore it's the the clearest articulation of originalism in a Supreme Court decision last far yes and\nAnd so when I look at it\nAnd look at the actual behavior and thinking of Madison and the spring of Seventeen eighty nine when he's writing the second amendment and the debate in both the house and then in the Senate Atlanta debate in the eleven states ratified\nWhat's going on there has nothing to do with owning a gun it has to do with whether or not a defense of the republic will be in the hands of state militias\nOr a federal army and their great fear of a federal army as big as a standing army not just a fear of what the British Army represented those that's primary even of the continental army\nYou're absolutely right that is that Justice Stevens descent and I think American dialogue exception expands on her way that he did not uh that might persuade young people are undecided on the other hand I I Am persuaded by the general understanding in the states at that time consuming firearms and frontier defense that even beyond the militia people of course\nHad the right to carry weapons in the steward discussion instead of what I wanted to get to what I really liked about American dialogue and I want everyone on my team the originalist team to go and get as you explain how James Madison came to\nBitterly at first sitting then I'm a resigned himself to and then maybe even a applied equal representation in the Senate as the necessary means of getting to where he wanted to get which was dual sovereign he didn't want to get to do sovereignty\nHe wanted more he's more Hamel Tony and then most people know and you lay it out there was no doubt in anyone's mind at the end that the states would forever have equal representation in the upper body correct\nYes though he regretted it I mean but he knew that it was absolutely essential if the constitutional first to pass and then be ratified because it was a gesture towards a state sovereignty us\nAnd that the the the makeup of the convention and then the make up the ratification conventions was a filled with people who were very dubious about\nAny federal government that created a consolidated power structure\nThat was the creation of the British leviathan they thought they were a scraping from and so if he had made that compromise um it would have never passed and he was as I was saying earlier committed to a a a making those kind of compromise decisions\nAnd he later said you know that was the only thing to do and but when he first\nLeft the convention in September of Seventeen eighty seven and they wrote to a Jefferson he said we failed\nUm because the Senate issue that you're describing you is still gives the states of a stronger\nI'm a subset of authority and power than we thought we we we could allow and that that will be a problem for us\nSo and it requires a unanimous consent of the states to amend that provision and therefore I don't think it ever will be I have one suggested reminds you and\nI agree with the big decision they made was Nineteen Thirteen to make the Senate elected not by the state legislatures but but by the people at large and he would have supported that too um but there does come to be a problem in the sense that let's say north and South Dakota have for representatives\nWith the total population that's less than half the size of Los Angeles\nBut if you look at Rhode Island versus Virginia the framing that sort of disparity in Vermont even worse in Vermont have the greatest disparity with Virginia at the frame\nThat's
