programs discounts and counties maintain and repair tens of thousands of miles of roads in our state [noise]\nEspecially the vast and growing international cartels have drugs in cyber crime and the gathering men is thousands of spies with new tools of astonishing capability we are a nation at risk\nTo know how to act in response to do so within the rule of law\nThe national security team around the president is at least the equal of any that has gathered in the post World War two air\nBut these officials neither cheap law enforcement officer among men who is there equal inability and intellect\nThe president should nominate him in dispatch health and Human Services secretary Alex days are by the way a former\nClerk or director of national tells Dan Coats who served as acting attorney general in the play the part that sessions until it gets confirmed and it said it doesn't move quickly used a recess appointment power justice can't wait\nTo that is over in the Washington Post on the front page of the post right now I encourage you to send it around people that's what we need then there is a David Brooks column\nAnd I don't usually do long read but this column is amazing [noise]\nEvery few years one research group or another produces a type policy of the electorate researchers conduct thousands of interviews and identify the different clusters American voters volunteer writes Brooks in this morning's New York times\nMore in common has just completed such a tight apology it's one of the best I've seen because it understand that American politics is no longer about what health care plan you support\nIt's about identity psychology moral foundation and the dynamics of tribal resentment\nThe report hitting tribes breaks American into seven groups from left or right with names like traditional liberals moderates politically disengaged and so on\nIt won't surprise you to learn that the most active groups are on the extremes progressive activists on the left eight percent of Americans and devoted conservatives on the right six percent I think that's me\nThese two groups are the richest of all the groups they are the white is a bit of both left and right\nThere members have among them the highest education levels and they report high levels of personal security\nWe sometimes think of this as a populist moment but that's not true my first big takeaway from hitting tribes he's our political conflict as primarily a rich white civil war it's between privileged progressive and privilege conservatives amen you could say that tribalism is the fruit of privilege\nPeople with more stressors in their life that's a fairly pay less attention to politics people with college degrees are more likely to describe their ideology is central to their identity\nThey are much more likely to derive moral meaning from their label more likely to fill it with a herd based on that label and more likely to vote the party line\nMy second big take away from the report and said ideas really do drive history progressive activists and devoted conservatives organize around coherent philosophical narratives these narratives our visions of adjusts society there the narratives of men is about who needs to be exercise from society [noise]\nDevoted concern to subscribe to a hobby in there and it the dangerous world life is nasty British some short\nWhen he'd strict values and strong authority to keep us safe David Brooks doesn't say so but also devoted conservatives believe there is a God in heaven who will indeed demand and accounting\nNinety percent devoted conservatives think immigration is bad so I'm part of the ten percent Ninety ... Ninety nine percent a progressive activists think it is good\nSeventy six percent of devoted conservatives think Islam is more violent than other religions only three percent of progressive activists agree I just got a mind boggling eighty six percent of devoted conservatives thinking is more important for children to be well behaved and creative holding Thirteen percent of progressive activists agree\nBecause well behaved children become well behaved adults and productive progressive activists on the other hand subscribe to the dark and ... world view\nPeople may be inherently good but the hierarchical structures of society or off all the structures of inequality and oppression and have to be dismantled\nNinety One percent of progressive activists say sexual harassment is common Rowley twelve percent of devoted conservatives agree Ninety two percent of progressive activists say people don't take racism seriously enough compared to six percent of devoted conservative eighty six percent of progressive activists say life outcomes are outside of people's control\nOnly two percent of devoted conservatives agree that's that's me man you're in charge of your life progressive activists are nearly three times as likely to say they are ashamed to be an American as the average voter while this philosophical disputed not do new Brooks continues\nThey've always been some people who thought that we need hierarchical structure to keep us safe and others who thought we need to be a mess debated from oppressive structure so we can be free\nWhat is new is ... ... this dispute has become\nThe researchers asked a wide variety of questions on everything from child rearing the national anthem protests\nIn many cases Ninety seven and nine nine percent of the progressive activists said one thing in Ninety three to Ninety five percent of dedicated considers said the opposite\nThere's little evidence that individual thought just cult conformity\nThe current situation really does begin to look like the religious wars that ripped through Europe after the invention of the printing press except our new religions where pig and political guard that's not true entirely\nThe good news is that once you get outside of these two elite group should find a lot more independent thinking and flexibility is not a fifty fifty nation only appears that way when disenchanted voters are forced to choose between two extreme cults\nRoughly two thirds of Americans across for political types fall into what the authors called the exhausted majority\nSixty one percent of and say we need to listen and compromise eighty percent said political correctness is a problem\nEighty two percent say the same thing about hate speech\nUnfortunately people in the exhausted majority have no narrative they have no coherent philosophical world view to organize their thinking and compel action yesterday it was called Christianity when they get one I suspect it will look totally I like the two dominant narrative today these narratives are threatened narratives but the people who make positive change usually focused on gifts not deficits\nThey will tell stories about the assets we have and how we can use them to gather agree\nI don't know what the next political paradigm what looked like but I bet it will be based on abundance not deficits gifts not fear hope not hatred\nI agree but part of this has to begin\nWith the absolute exiled from political authority the progressive laugh because it is so damn dangerous\nDo not vote for one Democrat at any level\nBecause it is just too dangerous to allow that narrative that power okay temporarily fact that I saw myself worked up here [noise] my really factor it's not a a ambrosia is simply to make sure I Move effortlessly through
