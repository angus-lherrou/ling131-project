us thanks for being here open bones or triple eight eight to five five two to five triple a eight to five\nFive two to five [noise]\nBrad starts off the hour in Phoenix, Arizona welcome to the Ramsey show bread what's up\n[noise] I think for taking my call there sure how can I help\nI have a question are we are my wife and I are just getting started and baby step to uh we've got about Ninety thousand in\nAnd we currently have a three vehicle two of them are mine that I use her work they're both paid off um I use a truck and then I also have come your car that I use regular\nUse a truck and then I also have a commuter car that I use regularly on most days of the week but the truck I have to use one per week to call a trailer\nCar she said uh it was about eleven thousand on and it's ... percent interest we could probably get by just sharing my two vehicles [noise] um\nBut we just didn't know since the car loan is is there a ... percent interest should we just sell it to you know get rid of\nSome of the dead or should we or should we keep it because it's ... percent of\nThe zero percent wouldn't enter into my decision it would just be whether or not I wanted to work hard enough to pay all the eleven thousand dollars in debt and how fast you can pay it off water all three of these cars worse\n[noise] um the truck is probably worth about Fifteen my car's probably also worth about Fifteen her car we think we can probably sell it for about ten\nOkay because one rule of thumb is you don't want vehicles things with motors in them total up being more than about half your annual income because then you've got too much stuff going down in value\nOK okay not violating that social were good or the second rule of thumb I use is can you be out of debt everything but your house in two years so what's your household income\nOr about a hundred and forty thousand\nGood and how much debt other than eleven thousand dollar car do you have not counting your mortgage\nOr we have about Ninety thousand okay\nBut not that includes the car the car\nIn what is the Ninety thousand on\n[noise] mostly student loans or we have some tax stuff a medical bills\nOkay so can you pay off forty five a year making one forty and be debt free in two years my answer would be yes yes\nAnd um that would mean that if you want to keep her car there's nothing out of line with keeping it but just right at all so I mean we're not going to keep a dad a regardless of the interest rate we're just going to get rid of it but you know show but if you told me you owe thirty thousand dollars on her car and I would sell it in a heartbeat\nOkay because when we were they wouldn't want it wouldn't fit neither one of these equations\nI mean you wouldn't be dead already in two years probably and on top of that uh of of course you'd have too much tied up in vehicles and so that would change my quakes and that's how I usually it's just a decision making paradigm that's all it is it gives you a critical thinking filter to look at this and say what are you doing there what are you doing\nI'm a I'm I'm Thirty years old I'm among baby stuff for I'm about Seventy thousand dollars cash mhm um I Know that other than my house\nUm which has about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars left on I'm On a third year mortgage and when I bought it I'd probably Ninety thousand dollars down on it so I have no equity in it\nUm and I have about fourteen thousand coming in as a gift for my one year old college fund um [noise] so I'm going to be putting that into a check five twenty nine I think for him and and kind of picking up some\nGrow stock mutual fund to I don't know see what goes from there okay um so my question is what are kind of my\nWhat do I deal with this kind of piled cash that I have um you know ideally I Want to keep my living expenses her for um you know every any given mom because about twenty\nSeven hundred dollars um my wife stays at home with her child so I'm pretty much the only income right now [laughter] um so I wanted to keep you know a good portion of that set aside and just cash and then kind of want to know what to do with the rats shut shut draw towards my how he owned a little bit every year or\nShould I put it someplace\nElse we teach trailer is a process we call the baby steps and it tells you what to do at different phases of your financial plan and as you lay the foundation than if you build a house and you put the roof on your financial plan it tells you each time what to do and what to do first second and so forth\nSo I'm baby steps one is spousal dollars you've done that too was dead free but the home you've done that three is an emergency fund\nOf three to six months of expenses um because that's going to be nine to Eighteen thousand dollars in your case\nAnd so uh twenty thousand dollar emergency fund is adequate as a just an emergency fund in cash okay then that brings us to baby steps four or five and six and we do those simultaneously for is putting Fifteen Percent of your income into your retirement plans\nNow or what do you make\n'em so I'm about Seventy here\nThere's the household income yeah okay All right and uh do you have a four one K. at work\nYou know I have a I had a pension um that I put a about a hundred and thirty dollars every three weeks into it um so I didn't know how that kind of played in the cards\nEvery two weeks into it um so I didn't know how that kind of played in the cards as well I'll tell you that mandatory\nOkay\nAll right I probably would not count that it's a fairly small amount of money and I probably still would put Fifteen Percent aside Fifteen Percent of Seventy thousands and thousand five hundred okay and that would be a around eight hundred and fifty bucks a month going into something do you have a four one K. available at work you don't\nKnow I have a I currently have just opened up a ... or re ... with a better man which is one of kind of a hundred for me I'm I'm familiar\nWith what I Would do instead is I Would use I'm a ... a\nPerson that as an advisor today a robo shortcoming they're they're they're doing pretty good but none of them are strong enough yet that I'm willing to go there I've not got any of my money in robocalls at this stage of the game there'll be a time in a place that those things evolve to the point that they're probably going to be a good thing to do\nWith some or you know in certain situations and so forth but what I Would just go to smart bastard Dave Ramsey dot com click on the smart vest or pro link and it'll drop down a list of people in your area that are that we recommend I'm not in the investment business so I don't care what you do okay in fact my income at all\nBut people have always ask me who do you recommend recommend people that have the heart of a teacher that will sit down with you\nYou and your argument you you're married\nMarried um and have a Thirteen month old\nOkay so you and your wife can do a fifty five hundred each unless you're over fifty years old and but that gets you there and fifty five hundred is eleven thousand then that'd be fully funded Roth IRAs and I would have those in gross stock mutual funds\nI spread Mayan personal investments across four types of growth stocks mutual funds and it's also what I recommend\nAnd I put a force in growth in income uh fourth and growth a fourth and aggressive growth and a fourth in international now once you're doing that and you know the monthly draft coming out of your checking account you shouldn't need any of the Seventy thousand dollars to do that with\nYou've already dumped a ton and your kids four five oh five twenty nine and you've got it in mutual funds that you're watching which is just fine\nOkay and just be watching that you could you could review that with a smart rest or pro and so you you know if they teach you anything that makes you want to move it but you may want to just leave it where it is that's fine there is no issue there um\nAnd then everything above that that's maybe step three is fit or babysit force Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement\nFive is address kids' college and it's different the ... in you know number ... how many kids how old they are and that kind of thing so we don't have a balance on that but you're addressing it\nAnd then once you're putting your to Roth IRAs and you're doing your Fifteen Percent above that everything I can find in my budget uh any extra money I come into I'll throw it at the house 'cause I'm going to get the house paid off that's baby steps six when the house is paid off that leads you to the last maybe step and that's max out all retirement\nAnd invest invest invest give give give and become very wealthy\nOr what you will do especially when you get rid of your house payments so all of that to say I'm probably only about fifty grand out of your Seventy at your house\nAnd then I'm going to set up those two Roth IRAs and any other money I'll find in my budget I'm going to skip junk and on that house you're probably going to the house paid off in three or four years at this right\nThat's what it sounds like to me and that's the direction I Would go Josh is with us in Arlington, Virginia Hi Josh how are you\nI Do I'm great how are you doing sir better than I deserve what's up\nAlready so I have a currently two hundred and twenty three thousand a hundred and Ninety three thousand it's pretty normal it's currently with U.S Department of treasury on it as a result of having been additional service academy or three years ago\nUm and that the remaining thirty ... like a pretty normal debt I'm obviously much smaller so my question is\nI'm I'm familiar with the baby steps I'm a I'm a huge fan of yours I told you for a while um should I continue\nPaying off the smallest at first or should I I'm just kind of start to save rapidly but a hundred and Ninety three thousand um reason I ask is I Believe it's going to go actually I Know for a fact that will eventually end up in a collection that count if I'm not able to pay the amount can fall um\nYeah um and what is your income now so\nIt varies um last year uh I I made a hundred and Ninety thousand um I I got married this year so combined income between me and my wife um should be this year at least a about a hundred ... a hundred and fifty thousand on it's gone down a little bit this year also\nWhile so you learn you guys are on the Internet um side and so what I'm going to just put this on line three and the debt snowball and knock it out as fast as I can 'cause you got wonderful income you'll be dead for\nTwo years it's not going to collections okay\nI mean you start to untie thirty thousand bucks this thing or it's going to go away really really fast you make a lot of money\nYou're gonna get a real tight budget and clean up the mess so I I Am never heard of this I'm curious about to learn something you went to a service academy one of the military academies got this enrolled and they charge you for all the tuition\nYes or so yeah a little known fact that you're just an old I'm pretty much under any circumstance following junior year you're either ask that serve through in the service or you're a sign\nThat the recruitment and death um and it goes to the defense finance and accounting service initially and if it if it's not paid it it goes over to the U.S treasury\nSo you have the option of serving\nAs an enlisted person if you get this enrolled for a period of time and it's for given\nA yes or however my case I was not afforded that option I I was given an honorable discharge half the pay back\nSo like West Point as an example you can get hammered with fish I did not know that you have to learn something while well the only good news in this story as you make a lot of money so you can clean up the mess quickly [noise]\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business\nYou have to be intentional with every decision you make as an example if you're a business owner and needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full\nOf resumes that aren't right for the position you're hiring the smart thing to do is to go to zip recruiter dot com slash Dave to hire the right person zip recruiter doesn't depend on candidates finding new\nIt finds them for you it's powerful matching technologies scans thousands of resumes identifies people with the right skills education and experience for your job\nAnd actively invites them do apply\nSo you get qualified candidates fast\nOh I Know I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago but\nThat never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nOr I I actually last January took myself you know\nOf her checking because\nHeart when I got ... more friends obviously not a bright boy show um\nHe was doing drugs you know and and so he wasn't in his right mind I rest\nMy case you got so [laughter] so bottom line is what I Would do if I'm her mom is I Want to\nParticipate in her healing financially emotionally getting back on track so that she can be a good mom to this baby and have a good life\nAnd make good decisions independent from drug addicts and independent from mom of eventually\nBut if you can get her ... I I don't want you to set up a checking account and you manage everything and that beep perpetual but to do that like run yeah I'd be out but to do that to get her back up and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of the seat until you learn to ride the bike and then we're going to let go of the seat again\nBut you like go to the seat last time not because she was healthy but because she was on a healthy\nYeah and I'd like to get her up and running in healthy you know we got the meds worked out we got the counseling it's for the rest of her life\nShe's got to balance that stuff but if she doesn't she going to hit the bridge every time man and be back in my office or in your home trashed again financially here we are again broke you know and it's just I'm\n... but the good news is I I hear a lot of hopelessness around bipolar because it's so frustrating\nFor the people that have it and those that love them but the good news is I have seen a innumerable number of people that with a quality spiritual walk quality counseling and the proper amount of medication some people over medicated some people say you don't need medication I don't believe in either one of\nThem now she only did he medicated that she does she's the type of person she goes nuts if she's not medicate\nWell there's you you don't want them just you know you know all the rest of their life\nIs I mean they add controlled or she has a ward of the state and we got her diagnosis when she was sixteen or as as a semi really mentally ill and she is she's not on a couple of different met\nHer ... her only shopping as what we're talking about but our goal is this girl to be forty four and all this to be a memory\nCan happen\nYeah and it happens to people all the time though what\nDid she say right now when they call her to\nShow you get nothing so she does take up the phone you know\nYou might as well but I wouldn't have long conversations with them 'cause you just you know because they're going to just I don't\nThink I should be talking ... telling them\nEither one of the American long conversation it's I got nothing you get nothing because all they're going to badger her and that's not ... the situation now once you've got a little money and some jobs going then we start negotiating in trying to work our way through the day right\nWell my husband thinks that if this goes on a year or two and they will eventually come back more than a negotiate\nAnd I aren't going to negotiate after two months oh really yeah okay\nI think it's been longer than that I think it's been at least six months how they're doing art\nPliable today but she's got no money and you're not giving or any you know so they get nothing\nThey get nothing today now\nSix months from now she's balanced on her meds taking care of the baby working still living under your roof and give her the emotional support you can put your arm around her and walk with her as she fights through dealing with these nasty people call collectors\nUntil let's say I mean she'll she'll a little bit here Thirteen entered their eight under their did she say look it can we work at a deal\nYeah or you know are they all your Thirteen hundred bucks you ever seen any money in two years I'm no backup and working again I got five hundred dollars if you'll take that in the settlement in full will\nDo it and get an in writing and no electronic access to your checking account because whatever these collector say you can tell they're lying if their mouth is moving it's a filthy industry\nAnd so you got a free somewhat rattlesnakes because they are\nYou got really tender covering person here\nWho's going into a rattlesnake then after she starts making some money\nYou got to warm weather emotionally on there\nBut you can you can give us surely you support the sheets without giving them money and I think you're right to do all of that\nThere's good news show she can make it out if she
