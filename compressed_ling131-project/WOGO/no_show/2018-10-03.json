[laughter] I heard of it out well I'm not gonna start buying bonds to offset the fact that you don't have insurance that's not you know that's what he's doing and that no thank you um\nI mean you you need to build up a big pile of money called wells and then you don't have to worry about life insurance and that's the general principle that you moved towards a or about\nHow South America and they don't have any that um\nAnd so you know I and the more wealth you have the less and less we need to worry about replacing your income for the good of your family\nMhm right if you're having a oils that your family is fine and you have no debt and your family's fine without your income then we don't worry about the subject anymore because you become self insured your family's mind 'cause the point is is the family major income to live\nRight on to the extent they don't need that to the extent you don't need life insurance now have you actually shopped or are you making an assumption that you can't get insurance\nI got denied about seven years ago I tried\nCalling me called calls vendor insurance and the market has changed dramatically\nBut I got another guy ... back in March that when I Lived a life insurance and stagnate says it um they basically said you'd get denied but I haven't tried Zander\nYeah try them I mean there's no it doesn't cost anything to ask mhm let's talk about it and found out that I don't I think you may be right I mean you you know you probably found some bowed research you're probably not insure all you know so the only question is just you know if your family only got a hundred grand instead of getting five hundred grand how old are you\nThirty eight\nAnd and uh the auto immune that you've got I mean how are you know you're a health care professional uh does do you have a real threat here of losing your life\nYou can't they can't agree that in mind mild but I um when they hit your record it kind of\nNon down by the actual fact you die and I am Lee is left without you what's the probability of that\nI don't know how they're going on and on and get help so I mean it could get worse ... how old are you thirty eight\nOkay so I mean in the next ten years a typical thirty eight year old would have very low probability short of an accident of passing away and yours is slightly greater resolve and it's not like to have a terminal cancer diagnosis right right okay so I'm not gonna worry about it I'm gonna take the job I Want\nAnd then use your fabulous income what you have to build wealth and to become debt free in the family but I mean if you're sitting there with a million dollars in mutual funds and your four one K. and mutual funds and everything's paid for house and everything and you passed away I think\nYour husband can struggled through yeah I think you know and that's what I mean by self insured by becoming wealthy ... about three hundred thousand in retirement you and your house is paying for him so and you get a hundred thousand and insurance so you know he is he gonna be okay yeah you'll be OK\nYeah plus I'm guessing he worked right hey we're here now so he's going to be okay so I'm taking the job\nOkay because the call Center for informational purposes and just double check your something's okay okay I Will thank you thank you Michael's with us from Charlotte Hi Michael how are you\nGood

anything except your home you lift your debt smallest the largest you attack that with a vengeance how much do you own your car\nOr Eighteen thousand on the car and I do have a mortgage also in how ... what's your household income [noise] sixty four fifty five other how fast you can pay off in Eighteen thousand dollar car pretty quick what's printing awake\nOr or right now I'm just making the normal ended up so\nFast to make like sixty thousand are you going to pay Eighteen thousand to do that math\nNine months\nYeah you have no life you get the car paid off or you sell the car and moved down more than two but you don't need to pay that much longer how old are you twenty four\nTwenty four and a [laughter] almost like I've done this before [laughter] okay yeah so you got to really expensive car and it's kicking you in the teeth show a payoff half because I thought oh my God it's really expensive car was worse\nAh I paid thirty and you make city it was it was my graduation present myself yeah I'm also a resident to yourself not a president turning my Brazil\nDo myself as I'm going to run my life you know no that's okay so you must get their stupid thing paid off for

the we got on the plan separately we've we've never gone through those dumb decisions\nUm we've never had to deal with those stupid purchases or we've never had to look at something that we've done as

you know\nI'm sure you're I'm sure you you're a fiend about term life insurance through with that now\nAs we were just listening to that [laughter] oh and the other thing for me is that when the Holy Spirit and not just you to do something and you don't have any debt you know what you do you do it\nTo the moon and I was talking about that the other day it's tough to serve two masters at her and uh when you don't have another master in your life you only have one it's a lot easier not try on Jesus talked about that\nShow will die on YouTube very very well done so proud of you I'm sure your

the or the light to speak to Karen housley don't\nNormally speak to candidates for some times to visit there is a race of such to me moral significance and political significance that I Do current house we as the Republican candidate for governor excuse me for senator sorry\nI just wishful thinking going on in my mind I Wish you were a candidate for both actually can you run for two things anyway for senator stranger things and they certainly true a senator of course\nStranger things have been done right\nCertainly true a set of golf course in Minnesota and a show me what are you so much to ask you are I mean I've been to Minnesota show many times I Love the state\nI live in a state of confusion I understand California where I live I don't understand Minnesota Minnesotans are known for niceness than they vote for a mean parties\n[noise] right right we we went to cell phones are really really nice people and they like they like balance and they like people that treat others with respect and we are we are a strange\nThing where we we cross ballot vote we don't vote we don't stay in our lane we we cross over to Democrat Republican and we like to vote for big names here we've had Jesse Ventura as governor a leader of Al Franken as US Senator so ... and and\nEven in the same year they voted the most conservative US Senator ride grant at the same time they go to the most liberal a senator and Paul Wellstone so we do we we vote on some some different things are different from from all of those across the country that I I I think I feel even worse for you in California than it\nWell you should [laughter] I mean you have you ever real chance now your opponent is campaigning with Keith Ellison she's almost ... is a is is this far left as we have in American politics\nAnd chief illness and of course has serious charges against him with regard to abuse of a woman and I'm not saying they're true I'm not saying they're not true but they're they're they're not from high school they're not one incident punish all the play offs\nAnd white uh I'm and I'm running actually for the hash tag knee to Al Franken sea\nSo there is a lot of responsibility in this heat and who represent Minnesota in the United States Senate and and to treat everybody equally when there is a charge of sexual harassment sexual abuse domestic abuse and\nThen Tina Smith my opponent is showing the complete hypocrisy of herself and the Democrat because\nThe Democrats are interested in speaking out on sexual assault or harassed and when it comes to their own party and Tina Smith is campaigning around the state with Keith Ellison and she had said because Keith categorically denied these accusations\nThen Keith Ellison therefore is innocent yet when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and the uh uh unsubstantiated allegations against a judge Kavanaugh\nA seat and he tore under oath that he didn't do it um she's calling for a full FBI an investigation and she's also said that Kavanaugh has committed sexual assault she said that in the video\nAnd and what ever happened to being innocent before proven guilty it's now all of a sudden that the proof is on those that are accused and that's it that's the sad wrote that the Democrats have gone down and it's going to get discouraged a lot of people from running for office and for voting for them because this is one issue\nThat is that it popped up that has really got a Republican and independents extremely extremely angry at the hypocrisy and the double standard that the Democrats are are showing right now\nWill take so that's a double standard issue what about the issue\nI have to believe that most Minnesotans on Americans who or anti terminal on on the grounds of sexual assault forgetting they're against them because they would be against any Republican nominee to the Supreme Court\nDo things have husbands brothers fall there is shown to the love I mean why use all the identification visas the the the alleged

can\nMake an accusation it becomes the uh you're\nThe land is a front page headlines and there are are guilty by a just public accusation and not having a fair hearing and not having any sort of private process to go through and and the Democrats will do anything they can to\nUh have an issue come up and attack Republicans and the the regular person out there Dennis I'm telling you it absolutely appalled that something like this\nUh comes up and and can be their son or their brother or their father and it's it's so deeply saddening that this is that the road that they've gone down\nSo ... is the issue you have to climb the Minnesota is simply now more or less liberal slash left\n[noise] uh no no no absolutely the the pill that Tina Smith has to climate is she's such a metro area liberal elite that uh this is not a DSL party Democrat farm labor here in Minnesota\nThat of my mother and father's area era it was mostly Democrat back in the day and it has the Democrat Party has left the Democrats\nAre in the last ten years and it has become the far left extreme liberal socialist party of Minneapolis and St Paul and that is not who\nMinnesota Democrats are so they are leaving the party in the eighth district up on the iron range which has all historically always voted Democrat we're going to have a Republican congressman up there down in southern Minnesota always voted Democrat that's going to be Republican\nSo Minnesota is not as Democrat as it used to be and we're ... we're seeing a real red wave here uh because they've gone so far to the left and they've left the people and that's not who we are here in Minnesota\nAre you I I just wanted to tell you what I see every Republican candidate for Senate for ... governor\nThat you're not only running I mean this is on solicited advice on our home bleach smell works best for\nYou you know every Republican is not only running against their opponents they're running against destructive left wing party as you just\nNoted and I I I salute you for doing that I think people would have to understand as nice as and and I don't know your opponent put as much as any Democrat individually might be they represent a destructive force in America the Democratic party\nThey really do and it and it is a a responsibility a on us as Republicans to make sure that the people know what that we really are the party of education and health care and freedom and they are the party of obstruction\nAnd that's exactly what my opponent Tina Smith has been doing can only been in office for nine months and at every single turn\nA Shia obstructing and blocking good things are happening here one judge cabin not to see a similar like medicine\nShould not come first and a woman's life I'm not saying they
