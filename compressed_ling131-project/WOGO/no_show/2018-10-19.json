going to just in talking to you I don't think you're that person you don't need to\nAct like your financial genius you don't need to act like you ah\nHave all the answers um you you know all you gotta do is be able to turn on the DVD player play me yeah about whatever the lesson on me up and about that night and then put shares in a circle and a lot of people and be yourself the other thing is always just talk about the times that you\nFailed or that you were unsure or that you goofed\nOr whether it was ten years ago or ten minutes ago um because that gives other people permission to not be perfect and there seems to be this illusion with people that everyone else has got their money act together but me I'm the only do for ...\nAnd it turns out we're all due for says\nThat makes sense ... chose to the primary barriers to people receiving financial teaching is guilt and shame\nAnd if you can remove those by just that's what I Do tell my story all the time you hear me telling if you've been listening a podcast that much how many times I've screwed up and you know I went broke I lost everything had to start over and all that and that's where all this came from this passion for helping other people came from\nThis idea that I hate that that's where it came from was for I've got a PHD in to you and be and so what that does it makes me approachable right and ah I'm not I'm not some guy drops his glasses on the end of his nose and looks down in the salaries that looks down his nose at you you know\n[noise] uh I got in a pretty bad motorcycle accident Mm how're you doing ah I Am I'm blessed to be here on actually\nYou're physically coming back\nUh yes um my body recover it great so I'm happy I can do this a little bit ah I'm a movement issue they my shoulder but ...\n... you got any future surgeries coming up a no okay well good well I'm Glad you're I'm Glad you're doing a good that's awesome okay same so uh what what are you are thinking of putting the money on [noise]\nSo me and my wife have agreed that we want to use this money to buy a house mhm but\nShe um [noise] we're we're we're we're not agreeing on is that she wants to put the majority of the money all the down payment and save about twenty thousand for emergencies ... and I ain't the perfect time to get rid of all like that and also have a good amount for a down payment on a house mhm\nAnd still have some leftover but she agrees with me with that and I just want to hear\nYour opinion on the way you think would be the better move\nOr if you're not agreeing with you I don't know why she would agree with me [laughter]\nBut anyway the uh uh we tell people not to buy a home unless your debt free how much debt do you have\nTo carry a we have about forty five thousand dollars and ...\nI Would pay that off and I would hold twenty bucks for emergency and put to rest as your down payment\nIf I were in your shoes I Would not buy a house with the still laying around I think that's dangerous you're asking for trouble\nAnd so uh so my vote is going on your side of this argument I'm afraid but I don't know I honestly I don't know why she would answer listened to makes now let me tell you this I Will tell you that I Would not do any of this unless you guys get on a budget and you agree to never borrow money again\nOkay yes that I have a track to talk to her about that I'm actually a new economic trying to get on board mhm she's not really to come about also having trouble getting her on board with the prime of his oil you know\nI can imagine so um\nI I highly recommend you don't do anything\nUntil you can come into agreement\nOkay because you're going to make a mistake when you Shannon I when we have an argument like this we we have to wear a rule we have to do nothing until we can come into agreement\nOn large purchases large gifts large decisions we decide nothing is the only thing we can do until we're in agreement\nAnd ah so I I recommend you do nothing until the two of you can get on the same page um do you think that she would go to financial piece university if I gave you a one year membership\nI honestly do think I've been talking to her mother trying to help me out just because she's so stubborn about this and her mother is on my side as well\nAs on what I asked what I asked was can you get your wife to go to financial piece university to the nine lessons and if I give you the one year membership\nYes sir you think so why she fresh Robert\nI think that it might mean her mind would sit down with her and explain to her um\nGo to the climate is free okay I'm going to give it to you but I'm only going to give it to you on the condition that she attends with you OK because if you go by yourself it will cause a divorce is you're going to get more\nOkay because if you go by yourself it'll cause a divorce does you're going to get more and more and more and more\nExcited about getting out of debt and living with a plan and you get it's going to drive a wedge further between you own I don't want to do that\nSo I just if you can talk her into just attending one or two glasses with you I think she'll go on and go to the others I'm pretty persuasive but ah but\nDon't go by yourself there it'll cause problems hold on I'll have to pick up I'll give you the attribution of rusty membership for a year and that includes the nine lessons that you can attend and you can watch them on line and everything else um but do not do this without her it's a it's contingent upon that my gift is\nAll right Dave is with us in Stockton, California Hi Dave how are you\nOh good afternoon Dave how you doing Jay better than I deserve what's up\nWell that that's good faith um both my wife and I are ... coordinators had were dead tree get free\nAnd we need your wisdom and guided or something where we also have a little disagreement um last year she and her son got very we give them money to help them out really knowing knowing that we would never probably see the money again okay um\nWhy would you do that you're ... ...\nYou know what that's a good question the question I maybe it's because I haven't talked for about a year I lost touch with ... with that aspect of it but um we volunteer to pay for true class which they did\nBut in the end they didn't discipline Metallica ... principles and or building a ... kind of al ... well after six months we decided to see what kind of make the U.S back\nAnything we kind of like no we weren't going it alone and be more money because they had made no effort to to reimburse anything of it and and there was no communication command educate me on her famous back\nWell you know life goes several months later they're only vehicle broke down\nAnd um and it could not be repaired and my son had no way to get to work this is where it gets sticky 'em knowing that my wife has a good picture of her parents trashed would be dispersed in five minutes to all their fisheries\nRecruiting him we both agreed to front about Ninety percent of what the what we see with the understanding that he would immediately pay us back when the checks and\nSort of a logical is it they were ... they were already ... her parents trash\nUm today we have not distributed that money but it's getting it's getting a little stick here here is going to be distributed next couple of weeks we wouldn't do what you do in the meantime they've they took out I'm a five or a eight thousand dollar loans to pay off for months of overdo rent\nThe otherwise they'd be evicted and I got her life just does not want to work to help out\nSo my angle is interested in ... mirrors and because they have not given history of the responsibility of taking back our loan I have strongly suggested ... and I think that's about as far as that goes way I'd\nGet my wife write the check to them having come over his side of the ... and we would write them a check for the balance of what they didn't ... how do we didn't we didn't find them and it seems simple and we know if we approach it that way that would be successful\nAnd lemonade the temptation that using the current unrest there might not ... agreed and be in my opinion be more proactive to solving this\nShow as much from a non thousand dollars\nRight the eight hundred right now what's your network out what's that what's your net worth\nA ... [noise] I don't know five hundred six hundred what's your household income uh who I'm\nThirty maybe okay right and let me just say oh you know here's my opinion this is all your fault my fault yeah OK you loan people money that\nWe're broke and don't handle money well and went against everything that you were supposed to have been taught by us which was you longer family money right you're the one might mess\nI okay I take your job or the now I Try to correct it they're not making it worse yeah and so I'm\nWondering you can do as you say forget it I don't pay me back forget it I'm an idiot I shouldn't be given your money I've never given you any more ever under any circumstances\nRight right it she she believes that that we should just be trusting meal the check to them and then hope they'll reimburse us\nEither ...\nOr ... that my ain't no they're not going to pass legally ridiculous assumption that is not gonna happen\nYou mail a check to them you're never going to see this money and then you have to decide if you're going to speak to your own children over money or not it's just the crap you get into when you're alone family members money all your fault\nSo maybe you want to if she wants to walk you through that that's fine but don't ever do this again\nAbsolutely ludicrous you're asking for all the trouble you cost you cause every bit of this [noise]\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family is the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't\nBig difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed\nPaying for the mortgage utilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement that's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting term life\nInsurance just go to Sandra insurance dot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two and see how inexpensive it really is the the family that takes those deliberate steps to be different and responsible it really does make you the hero of your story and they put you on course for better things ahead\nNot only that free but now to be millionaires and outrageously generous as you go along and you make good money you don't have a payment in the world you should be there for the soon well\nDone guys and looking at looking Lacey Grand Forks North Dakota a hundred and twenty thousand dollars paid off in thirty six months when I get eighty five to one ten Bybee touchdown counted down let's zero debt free scream\nThree [noise] [noise]\n\n\nWell over the past month our fall live events season has been going nonstop man we're going crazy record crowds sellouts on every event and when you leave one of these events is kind of like a pep rally forget your act together you know it's a pep rally for your family\nSo you when you when I say touchdown man I mean you scored they usually you're the hero of the game and you did it\nAnd it's pretty humbling we had six thousand puncture the smart conference last weekend and in um Kansas City I remember it well and San Francisco the week before we were doing of course all get another one of the smart money events there for about three thousand folks sellouts everywhere so\nAs we do every October\nAre you ready it's time to announce the spring smart money tour schedule bar or a drum roll please February the fast Kris Hogan Anthony O'Neill will be doing smart money in Raleigh North Carolina\nFebruary the twentieth Anthony O'Neill and I will be in Grand Rapids Michigan and February the twenty first of the next day Chris Hogan and Anthony oatmeal will be in Cincinnati, Ohio bone ...
