Hi Jim how are you\nI'm great Dave how are you today better than I deserve what's up [noise] well\nExcited that uh you know you and your lead my wife and I on a clear path to a much better situation not that we were in a really rough spot but it goes a lot better be where we are now I'm In um [noise] we are a very quickly approaching the end of baby step three in January will be\nSix months plus and so my uh my focus now is four or five and six and reading your book and going through the class is actually more than once\nMy focus now is four or five and six and reading your book and going through the class is actually more than once and um when I'm really faced with is our house we moved in and two thousand six\nAnd a we pay two fifty to a according to the low and you know casual conversation we're not we're not at the two fifty two so after you know twelve plus years were not back to our original self or you know purchase price [noise] um that's where you're\nAt it and all you know Phoenix got hit really hard by the housing bubble and\nWe ... really hard I'm Sorry I don't know how to\nPeople even across the street or are you know have doubled the price of the house they bought a couple of years after we did we bought on the right side on the downside of the top but we're still not back there even or you know I guess maybe it's our neighborhood worse than others but um so we're not there yet\nAs we approach four or five and six steps for five and six I'm you know I have two teenage sons were going to be faced with college here soon I'm very excited to get back into our a retirement planning which we put on hold back at the beginning and so now I'm just trying to figure out if we just\nForget the house would that not put anything will find\nThat are in order of priority for five six but done simultaneously so the way that might sound would be you start with Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement does by reason of period\nUnless you're in an emergency situation you you do that now I'm ... and then you move on to kids college you've got college looking down you're looking down the road we'll gone on college and so that's probably going to take everything above and beyond your Fifteen Percent going into retirement and your rights houses probably on hold for a little while\nThen you've got two teenagers and no college funds you got some catching up to do right\nYes sir you know so you're going to probably that's five is probably going to suck up all your extra money\nRight now because of the situation you're in the age of the kids um before you get ... so you're just gonna keep paying your house payment for now and get these kids through school and as quick as you get school quote unquote taken care of\nA meaning that you know you've got enough money for them to finish without that then you start reaching over and knocking extra on the house at that point\nAnd the value of the house or the ... or the ... the value that house increasing or decreasing during that time I Would just dictate whether I keep that house but it wouldn't dictate whether Russia which the baby steps\nI'm the deal frugal living will make your social loud cost you if you don't buy an expense of law and expensive cars and all of a status symbol mhm are you will be treated as a social loud Austin I'm came to understand what would be your take on that\n[laughter] oh I Love it or did your immigrated from\nA United Kingdom United Kingdom okay and where did you grow up um I was born in India I immigrated to the u._k. when I was Seventeen okay and you're how old a twenty nine okay and how long does your living and you cannot eleven years were you a social outcasts there um no [laughter]\nWell ah where did you live in the u._k. a city called ... off right pretty good size city it is it's it's a nice for a number legitimacy and you weren't a social outcasts there for being frugal no but um I was like oh what do you live in the United states um I live in San Diego\nThere it is [laughter]\nYou might be a social outcasts there now are getting okay there are people and certainly in San Diego that have common sense as\nWell so um I don't know what crowd you're running with was there but um it's different than the one you ran with an India or the one you ran with an ... for sure [noise] um because they have been bitten by the bug of consumerism but plenty of Americans um\nIn in a city or will not consider us show to allow cash for having good common sense values no ah that's assuming you're you know you if your clothes are not necessarily expensive or at least clean mhm and your watch um I'm I'm I'm worth\nWell over ten million dollars is buildings worth twenty million that you're standing in is paid for and that's my watch pretty on assuming I'm like it costs about a hundred and fifty bucks\nA problem is I don't care what you think and if you think I feel like I'm cool goes I have a watch I don't really think you're cool so um you know that's the thing you got to decide who you want to influence you\nUm and where you want to end up so what brought you to the United states why did you come here\nIt was um a childhood dream that I hunt mhm um I read somewhere that um\nBecause this country guarantee freedom to all people the Supreme Court ruled that no one can be false to a re signed a pledge of allegiance and told me I was about twelve years old and I try to apply that in my school of India's a get a naive I was ... I'm ... the American constitution doesn't apply in India\nAnd uh and I actually got um the pizza for me out to get in trouble yeah I did I listen to the principal and the fact that the principal one day when I make it to the United states you wouldn't be able to do this to me anymore\nSo freedom that is correct freedom okay and now people are trying to take your freedom from you with ah forcing you to conform\nFrom you with ah forcing you to conform\nTo something using a social pressure but not all okay and so I Would treat it exactly the same way as hard as you have fought through you know twenty nine years of your life to get to be standing here um I wouldn't surrender my freedom at a threat to stuff\nAre all in the name of someone being impressed generally speaking a here's a good rule of thumb people who are impressed by things that you have or aware or not impressive people\nWhen you get inside of their hearts and inside of their minds they're what we would call shallow and so um\nVery people you might attract by having some bling by having some jewelry or some watches the proper\nClothing are the people that you really don't want influencing your future and your character in your life you've paid a huge\nPrice to get to be here and enjoy the freedom and so you're a man of character and um the uh ... and the show the people that are telling you that are probably not people I Would want\n'em to be influencing me I might want to influence them and try to help them but if I were in your shoes I Would say that doesn't need to be your inner circle that are teaching you how to live mentor and you ... you and so forth um and so\nYou know check out a folks that have a little more depth of character in order to judging you based on what you drive now again it needs to be if you drive an old car um that's while you're trying to achieve a financial go or something what needs to be clean\nAnd maintained you don't take good care of it but um it doesn't it doesn't need to be dirty and doesn't need to be missing the same thing with your clothing or your hair or whatever else you take care of the things that you have been and managed them but most wealthy people or do not by\nA expensive things to impress other people\nAre a few do but most don't that's how they became more often now they do by some expensive things that I buy some expensive things but there for me\nAnd for my family and for my wife and that kind of thing and they're not for what someone thinks I'm I'm I've got a really nice home but I didn't buy it for somebody else are we live there you know and what you think about are\nGood or bad doesn't really matter to me\nAnd so I I don't know is that helpful is that helpful part of this year is that what you were looking answer I think I needed to hear that that'll come what are you doing for a living I'm looking IT IT okay what do you do a developer you're developing okay All right well you probably need to come to national work rush\n[laughter] sunny as an honor to meet you sir if you've got quite a story brother quite a story Weldon thanks for stopping by open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five and this was the day Ramsey show D is with us in Atlanta Hi Dee how are you\n[noise] Hi I'm well thank you for asking sure what's up\nI'm going to ask if I should say my tax come here and\nShe pointed out information on our than in Pakistan and India without being being charged that ten thousand dollars\nYou're being charge ten thousand dollars in penalties yeah mhm not taxes\nI Want to pay their taxes and penalties yeah okay I mean it sounds like a percentage on the information mhm well that\nFalse information she lied intentionally and you get rid of that\nYeah why would you do manage\nTo get back my money I don't know like frankly she claimed that we have a business that we don't own\nShe claimed that we're paying for cars that we don't own cheaply claims that we're paying 'em from mileage for their business again that we don't own\nThat's weird I mean does your husband have something to do with this\nI think he he you\nKnow I mean they just randomly\nOut of thin air she'd dreamed up a business that you don't have cars you don't have a knowledge that you don't have\nRight now we have a church but you know trickle down a path so there was no there's nothing in around the documentation and insured anything about the church they use our uh our number either they haven't won the number of them\nAre you are you doing a work outside the five oh one C. three as a venture lists that you're being paid uh outside of the church you know you're not you don't do speaking engagements and get paid for that on the side you know everything is through the church or a hundred percent\nYes and you know for they charge me don't make any money or they charge you could only have\nBoth work independently room and other companies\nAre saying you have your body vocational pastors okay yeah okay um well I\nI think if there are I don't know you need to see an attorney is the answer the question 'cause I don't know whether you have grounds to sue someone or not this is a very bizarre thing\nSomeone would do this just out of the blue ... it's not a mirror mistake I mean it's a complete fabrication and so um I mean this was ... it sounds like fraudulent activity on your behalf now you've signed the tax returns though\nDidn't you know and I think maybe it'll you know but you had to see the tax returns [noise]\nYou you you didn't allow someone to send in tax returns are due to see Shirley Hi age you may have trouble I don't know you need to see an attorney and ask them\nA hot my guess is the most you can help to get back will be the penalties the taxes you already ... and you still owe the penalties are due to them not being paid on time due to this um and I think that's the most you might get back I don't know [noise]\n\nDid you know that if you combine that data breaches that have occurred in the past twelve months almost every American has had their personal info compromised racked over fifty percent of our listeners and viewers tell us that they or someone in their family has been a victim\nAnd Seventy percent of those folks have had it happen more than once she this is unbelievable wants these get your info the risk never goes away and they can use it whenever and however they choose it truly has become an issue of not ...\nBut when that is why the only plant I've ever recommended is through Zander insurance I actually sat down with them and we put together a plan that\nI felt provided the best protection but didn't waste dollars on things you could easily do yourself or we're just gimmicks the key is getting protected before you're a victim and it's too late ... dot com or call eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two we're all at risk\nAnd about two or three o'clock in the morning I called my brother back\nHim what I've been doing and he said he would buy us F P U\n'em for Christmas and allow us to you know to the program at home we kind of within the middle of nowhere and then I told him that I Would text pets but not today to talk to him and I was a little nervous because of the car with kind of pets and I didn't think he\nGot you got some any man that's driving the tractor\n[laughter]\nHe's like I'm not driving the end but yeah but he I texted him and surprisingly he was like more of a sudden I told him about my spreadsheet that I made this nice color coded spreadsheet and I sent it to him and surprisingly he came back with let's do this\n... um and I I thought\nYou were you were ready to you are sick of this\nWhole absolutely you know and then you come home and you guys go to financial position or city\nBut we didn't end up going into what we did it um through the program at home home study I Gotcha yeah our church is an hour and a half away right right and\nNot know nowadays you can just watch it all on line but it was different then yeah very good you guys so key to getting into that you made already one thousand and they seem much more folks from Arkansas for\nAdults like in that they paid off the phone ten thousand and then we also got about an eight thousand dollar cash settlement on top of that\nOkay so you got twenty five of the eighty one was that one month yes All right and then what what is the key to getting out of debt than you did it in Eighteen months\n[noise] um\nI Would have to say for me it was communication close communication to where both of us know exactly what's going on with everything all the time rather than in the past where I had largely let her kind of control everything\nMhm which she she didn't have as good a job as I could possibly expect\nExactly what she was by herself\nBut she was by herself I didn't have a full understanding of what was going on right I was being done exactly where we were I knew small numbers I did not have the big picture and you know guys being visual creatures the spreadsheet gave me the big picture in color coded clarity\n[laughter] so it's definitely a huge last summer the control\nOne but not in law but you've gained um someone else's shoulders to help carry the load right\nYes yeah it became amazing actually what happened with pat with it was beyond flabbergasted me because\nHe got so on board that what and and got on if we had a huge impact on this because he was told there'd be no more extension and that was back like just a few months before we started at man I'm about to be about a year into it\nHe gets a call he he was home during one of his trips and he gets a call from work saying they just got back three weeks before but then when it needed him to come back a month early and he gets off\nThe phone and he's like or do I do and I'm like I don't know if you want to go back and he's like what what would you do with our debt and so I we were out of town and I don't even know how I got my spreadsheet their numbers if I just knew um but I sat down and he was sitting at my brother's house actually calculating and I'm like you know if you do this we can be out of debt in June\nUm instead of you know another year and a half and it was like\nWow he jumped on board and he actually told them that he would extend it for the month you know\nIf they would give him an extra two weeks on the end as well that would guarantee us to get it all paid off enough time\nFor congratulations you guys were so proud you said you've got a copy of course opens returns for books for you that is the next chapter in your story to be millionaires and outrageously generous as you're going on\nAnd go ahead and I say one other thing that you got to

quite a remarkable thing she\nDid use it they lived labeled her I just saw a or something from Harvard faculty listing from the Nineteen nineties she's listed as a Native American and that's the way in which it works\n\nThe American Indians the Native Americans have totally disavowed this even though they tend to be Democrats anyone with grievances tends to be a Democrat by the way and it was Americans have a half a legitimate historical grievances there's no question about it\nBut\nAre worried about the Native American issue it's a tragedy there's no real there's no other way to deal with the issue of what happened to Native Americans vague roaming around North America as free tribes\nIn other words not oppressed by outsiders they pressed each other I mean I'm reading a biography of Andrew Jackson now gigantic biography the guy is clearly of moral liberal bent as as most historians ought to find biography I'm not complaining\nBut even she or he when he mentioned the atrocities that Indians engaged in like ripping children out of their their mothers bellies\nAnd eating hearts and drinking blood and scalping and so on I mean I don't\nI think people find it hard to balance to fact that the Native American issues that American indian issue is a tragedy but don't\nRomanticize the American Indian they kept slaves that worked there was a tribe that Columbus discovered when he came to the Caribbean which is where he ... he never got to North America\nAnd uh he they they they literally literally eight people they were what was that ... with a camera that was the name Caribbean it's ironic the Caribbean is named after the most monstrous try that lived there\nThey other Indian tribes and the Caribbean feared them more than the white man they captured you fed youth to than slaughter you as if you were a lamb or a goat\nUnless they have lambs here it was with their lambs and North America before the Europeans\n\nAll right I mean well look you know it's it's a complement to you that I Would ask you you know the amount that I think of where their lambs here before the pie actually asked you about questioned ... with the with the serious tone anyway just ... so\nThat's a fact but the only solution so to speak would have been\nThe only solution would have been if no no one came to North America the first sheep arrived with Columbus they go they go\nWith that have been a better world this is what I asked people wouldn't have been a better world if no Europeans came to North America\nSo you you would have what would you have in North America today\n... ... or we honestly going to win visions that North America would have remained almost ... very minimally populated relatively speaking by American Indians\nWho repeated in each generation what they had lived in the past generation it was a cyclical view of life\nThe the European world as a result of the Bible lived a linear life the belief was that life moves forward there was something better to be a spy or two they failed off and put it but it did happen\n... ... every other culture in the world every non Bible based culture was cyclical\nI learned this from in a book that I read\nIn my twenties by Henry Bamford parks and New York university history professor that the Bible introduced a linear view of history every other culture on earth repeated in the next generation what it did in the previous\nThe idea of moral progress let alone scientific progress was only in the Judeo Christian world only\nSo mature as a mature person the person who doesn't like to feel good but actually no truth asked to ask what could have been done\nBar if the Indians could've would they have built should they have built a wall to keep Europeans out I'm sure people on the left would say yes\n\nSo the idea that we have we have we're conquering disease that we are giving women equal rights that we have created a functioning republic that there is free speech that there was a development of the human intellect\nIn each generation these would be apps and but it doesn't matter\nI did ask cowards in most famous of all of a left wing writers of his time real popular history of the United states I
