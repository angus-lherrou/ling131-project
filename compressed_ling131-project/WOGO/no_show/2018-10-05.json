butters\nI Know\nIt it it is really hard it really is and here's the thing I've observed in thirty plus years of doing this and having done it myself to Sharon and not having walk right where you're walking up any number one you're right it's hard\n\nNot number two is this is more this thing of a winning with money getting out of debt getting your emergency fund in place becoming wealthy increasing your generosity changing your family tree the whole process is hard\nIt is legitimately hard\n\nOne of the things that we looked at when we realized that\nWas we said this process is hard but show was being broke\n\nShows being mediocre mean normal sucks\nFinancially I mean deep in debt worried about every little thing for most hopeful I just didn't like normal I didn't want to stay there and so even though it's hard it's easier than normal\nIt's easier than mediocre live your whole\nLife and your best shot\nJust mediocre at heart so that's what gave me motivation as I said I don't I don't want to be sixty and working in McDonalds in St Thomas ... you know\nSteven as an Arizona says my wife and I are in baby step to those there'll be that I knew that means are getting out of debt everything but their house should be done in a year\nWe're entering what looks to be a lengthy and intense custody battle with my ex wife\nWe have to hire an attorney and it looks like he'll be expensive should pause baby step to to pay for this or should we hold our falling the paperwork until we have the debt paid off\n[noise] um\nWell the fact that you asked if you should hold off following the paperwork tells me that that is an option see I don't know what is going on with this custody battle\nAnd all kinds of different things can go on there if I thought my child was in danger if I thought there was a predator [noise] uh that my ex was marrying or I thought uh some real extreme saying then I'm going to cause the baby step\nAnd we're going to take care of the kid that's primary\nBut the fact that you mention in your email that we could wake tells me that this is more like you are aggravated with her\nWhich would be like college standard operating procedure right so um if if the child is not in danger and is not is not harmed\nBy you waiting a year yeah I'd get out of debt before I entered a lengthy custody battle because it'll put you in a stronger position to enter that battle you'll have the cash flow to just stay in the game 'cause most of the time when you get in something like that the first one that runs out of cash us we lose is not the first one is right\nAnd so you gotta yeah war chest man and um\nIf delaying it until your debt free one year from now is a is a reasonable option given the\nThinking about the good of the child than I Would because it'll be your best legal strategy to because you'll have the finances to keep pounding away and pounding away until the gates fall right but um\nOtherwise it's going to your ear you're fighting from a weekend position so you know I I don't know what's going on so I Can't tell whether that's a couple of different ways of looking at it Chris is with us in Jacksonville, Florida Hi Chris how are you\nKnow Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up good good to hear\nUm I have a quick question my brother and I are a part of the small business and I'm Around last year my

hadn't had any content with what we've got in some kind of weight on it until we saved up where\nI'm kinda interested when you shut down to do the taxes that night and you had a moment it was kind of that I've had a moment we're not living like this anymore I'm I've come to the end of this we're going to change can you describe what was happening is out of you or what was happening in your head or in your heart\nI felt like probably like everything I was dealing with kind of ... ...\nMean I kind of I wanted to be a stay at home mom but when you can kind that requires me to go back to work until we didn't go back to school and it wasn't making any different ... we wish telling that we were making any progress and everything that came in going right now\nYou know don't inviting feels like a

dead free in July\nSo his senior years the debt for a year ... hard when you started started out of school you know very\nGood we didn't want all just growing up years to be in that and we wanted him to to to learn from us and understand what it means to to get out of debt and we haven't taken a vacation in two years and\nYou know we're always gone to the beach every year and uh he was frustrated by he was you understood and every so often it was kinda cool because we would take these little sticky notes\nEvery month and we paid off with but what our new balance was free and we put that on the

[laughter] yeah [laughter] well I'm trying to avoid it by ear you're all you're doing the cooking it up it's going to be a bigger fight once it goes up [laughter] you might as well have a smaller fires quickly so here's the thing\nIf you're afraid to discuss with your spouse a purchase or a financial issues that you want to discuss that is not a financial problem that's a relationship problem\n\nNow I got to tell you there's times I I mean I I have a ton of money I'm a multi millionaires times though I think I Want to buy something and I'm also down talk show and hey I Want to buy this toy\nI Want to buy another gun she's like you don't mean not again you have too many guns already people already would think you were crazy if they know what I mean under and I collect guns by the way so\nYeah if it ever comes out you know they're they're gonna find out that I was like one of those crazy guys or something I'm not but I I collect okay I collect so you know you don't need another car you don't need another ... you don't need another inner tube to pull behind the bar actually collect those have got too much too many like toys right ah for the grandkids and for the kids to play on\nAnd so you know I I get ready to buy a toy and it's it's not it doesn't even show up on our\nBut I still have to have this moment and I go I I actually got to make sure I talked to she heard about this she gets ready to buy purses too expensive which is one of the few things that she buys this too expensive\nBut like she says one of those purses is equal to one\nOf those guns [laughter] uh well maybe maybe two guns [laughter] but uh you know isn't it funny how as adults that have the money\nEven where there is a lot of stress on the finances\nHave it a little bit of a dread about talking to each other so you really have to push yourself and make yourself and Rachel talks about this in her book love your life not there's one of the seven habits just talk about money even when it's hard and it's almost always hard\nTo talk about it keep it clean and\nIf your spouse is hiding money from you it generally does fall under one of three areas one is you've got a broken relationship and they are intimidated\nBy you to the spouse is an arrogant rebellious immature\nPrints are princes that just wants to do whatever they want to do with their lips stuck out and they don't like being told no spoiled child and the grownup body and goes and buys whatever they want to buy but know that it's wrong so they hide it from you\nMost often we find hidden that though it's the what the guy was on the last call\nOne of the spouses has been given all of the responsibility all of the weight of all of the decision making isn't doing the money handling well ends up running into debt because they're not doing a good job with it and now the shame is multiplied and it shame based hiding its guilty\nCondemnation based hiding so they're hiding it 'cause they don't they're they're ashamed that they haven't done a good job handling the money\nWhich case if that's your spouse you use\nShame that that they haven't done a good job handling the money in which case if that's your spouse you are partially responsible just like that guy said\nHe was he on that because he should have been more involved you shouldn't have dumped this on his wife and you shouldn't dump it all on your husband you shouldn't\nDump it all on either one of the both of you should be involved not whenever you again can carry the ministry of weight once all the decisions are made but everybody ought to know where every dollar is going\nPretty simple stuff\nSo you probably never heard the story but I actually was the guy who would almost been on Oprah more than anybody Oprah called like five six times their producers did and would tease us like we could get all I've been on every other show back in the day you know I've been on a sixty minutes I had been on\nLarry King remember on Larry King was on the air I'm Sally Jessie Raphael you remember her with a red glasses you know all that I've been on all these different shows\nYou know everything out there ... except I couldn't get on Oprah and they would call and teaser so finally they call and we get our Oprah parents and it was three different families on Oprah and I was supposed to advise them in their trouble on Oprah\nAnd the very first family\nOf course I knew what I was getting into and the families knew what they were getting into a sort of and um the very first couple I'm sitting up there are getting an argument with Oprah\nWhy would I Do that because Oprah was wrong [laughter] is what happened so here's the deal the wife had run up like Seventy thousand dollars worth of debt and her husband had no idea\nAnd uh I had told the producers I said what's partially his fault because he's not involved in his wife's life enough he's not loving his wife enough to even know what's going on in her life enough that she can run up Seventy eight thousand dollars if she unless she's just like a psychopath and her level of deception\nThis guy had and he he doesn't know what's going on under his own roof he's freaking clueless when his relationship\nAnd so Oprah's reading the script and she's like and Dave you say that it's partially spoiled and he ... or an apology I don't think I agree with that and I said well you would be wrong he does or an apology because he hasn't been walking with his wife to the point she runs up Seventy eight thousand all over the debt and he don't even know what the clips going on under his own roof\nAnd she's like well he delegated to her and said oh this is not a business you don't delegate stuff to your spouse\nAnd just dump it on them and even if you're delegated in business you would always inspect what you expect you would never just walk away and hope it happened you wouldn't know what's going on in business and besides that this is marriage is not a joint
