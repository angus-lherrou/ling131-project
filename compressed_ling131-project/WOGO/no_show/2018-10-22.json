thank you so much for taking my call sure what's up [noise] um\nI'm calling because my husband and I just started I'm really getting serious about the debt snowball we have approximately Seventy thousand dollars in debt mainly from my student loans and um we have fifty six hundred dollars in savings and my question is um\nWe have a baby coming\nYeah I Wonder if maybe to a um April nineteenth\nI mean and da da da da da da da da da\nDa da da da da da da da da to pay off fails yeah but now with the baby I didn't look I that's what I was wondering what how we should kind of attack that\nWhat I Would suggest you do is push paws on their total money make over\nOkay and pile up cash as big a pile as you can file between now and the time by becomes\nOkay and um and then whatever you are piled up and and then when mommy and baby come home from the hospital and everybody's fine in April was that event is than behind us in any worries are threats or anything we would have had about that is behind us right\nYeah um well I mean there's the whole thing of raising the baby but I you know eight eight years yeah there is now but I but basically the you know we want to make sure labor and delivery and everything goes and we don't have any hiccups and when we got money okay so let's say you save up what what's your household income\nRight now like about a Seventy seven thousand okay\nSo let's say you save up twenty five thousand dollars between now and then okay unit in twenty four thousand after you come home from the hospital and push play on your total money make over and take your account down to a thousand dollars and throw it at the at the uh student loan you will have lost no ground\nOkay unless you go baby spending crazy during the next few months\nWe had a lot of stuff that are actually our second child token you had a lot of stuff the only thing that would be a little bit different and the other day the boy because I have a lot of girls close you know\nWhen there's no but I mean other than you had all that well you know what I'm Talking about by by because you've had some friends do that or they just dropped twenty grand to get ready for\nYou know on a pound human being I mean they just go nuts and so if you'll just calm down and just you know manager budget like you were trying to get out of debt but instead of throwing it at the debt you keep everything tight you throw it in a pile of cash\nAnd then we don't spend it on baby a than is necessary for my survival and we uh throw it at the dead one by being mommy come home we push play again the pause comes off\nAnd we get out of debt as fast as we can but in the meantime we just created all your loses a little bit of interest on that money between now and the time the babies delivered that's all you lose it's not a big deal\nA block and turn about a week ago so I take that our financial advisor and could we immediately wanted to get rid of the term or sorry the permanent and just have term\nAnd he said Dave Ramsey is talking about the whole law permanent insurance not portfolio base permanent insurance which is what you do is it still bad shall we still didn't get the term\nI don't know he doesn't know much about Dave Ramsey [laughter] because they Ramsey does not ever invest I was real clear on the lesson you heard me\nYeah when I never tell you under any circumstances to use life insurance as an investment vehicle one hundred percent of the time it sucks\nSo when you say because what we told him we wanted to do it\nWhen I Would say more new financial advisor that's what I Would show you you don't have a financial advisor you have a life insurance salesman\nOkay the showing you insurance\nSo what we were thinking we should do is switch to four hundred thousand just the term H. and then that money where your because it was like three hundred dollars a month but I'll do a lot yeah um and just go ahead and open up our rah rah are IRA and start getting money into that\nIn bed with mutual funds okay that's exactly what you learn in class was ... yeah so you already knew what she said yeah he this language tells me one of those things either this guy's a liar or he's or ignored\nRight [laughter] he's a family friend who's in the um actually one of our friends did apparently gave them our number ... lay isn't for it as well\nYeah yeah okay so I I don't know which is I mean I don't know I don't know but but I Do know that I've never in my life\nTold someone to buy life insurance as an investment under any brand heading name or description ever\nRight and the last thing it on our term policy um on your class he said you know Twenty years Thirty years whatever was on ... and our term policy was until we were eighty with him\n[laughter]\nWhy don't you jump on land or insurance dot com and see what you can buy a twenty year level term policy for I think it's going to blow your mind how much this guy's overcharged you for everything you soldier\nOK okay and you're probably going to end up just canceling everything with him so this kind of really needs a good firing\nOkay that sounds like well Oregon that do 'em in the end of this like\nAll right thank you for calling in and when you ...\nYeah um and and make All right thank you for calling in and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about using life insurance as an investment vehicle\nAnd the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the financial ... never for some reason I heard a Ramsey talk about this\nCase someone else ever brings this up because it does come up periodically\nUm the people who sell investment based or\nWhole life or permanent life or portfolio or universal or anything where there is an investment going into insurance are not happy with me they don't like me\nAnd so they generally try to ignore me or lie about me or something else because I pretty much cost them all a bunch of business because they sell crap\nCrap in a bag that's what it is okay it's pretty simple so here's the thing\nWhen you use life insurance as an investment vehicle hey you get a bad right of return regardless of what they quote you after they take all of their fees which\nUsually in the first two years is one hundred per cent\n\nSometimes up to four years is one hundred percent of what should have gone to the investment goes out and fees even after that you're going to make three four five percent on your money and you should have been on a good mutual fund making ten eleven twelve percent on your money\nAnd that's where\nYou should be when you die\nWith cash value permanent portfolio universal indexed universal life insurance they pay only the face amount of the policy not the extra money that you put into the investment that money is gone\nSo you have a savings account that for the first several years I keep all your money after that they give you about ready to return and when you die they keep it all\nSo bad savings account bad investment program the pay the the\nLife insurance products that give you the opportunity to pay\nTwenty times more than you would pay for term insurance in order that you create an investment inside of the policy\nAre basically the payday lender the middle class their crap\nAnd that's what they Ramsey is always there for twenty five years here on the air upset it for twenty five years is all I have owned myself I have never\nOwned while this show was operating any kind of whole life or investment based life insurance of any kind\nEver not did get a horrible northwestern mutual whole life grotesque old school one of the worst of the worst of the whole lives when I was in my early twenties and it was the same way Brittany it was a guy my wife knew from college\nCame around selling right after\nWe got married and we bought this crap from him\nI had it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked the numbers for me and I about kicked my own but when I saw how bad it was and got rid of it and since then I have never owned it and since then I've never told anyone to buy anything\nOther than\nFifteen to twenty year\nTerm life insurance about ten to twelve times your income on you the best way to buy life insurance is through a broker the shops several companies the best way to buy insurance if any connoisseur a broker the shops several companies and get you the best possible deal\nWhether it's your car insurance for homeowners insurance your long term care insurance your life insurance your insurance of any kind\nLetter broke her shop among several companies and get you the best kinds of deals and that's why we've indoors for about Twenty years ... insurance\nJeff sander has become a personal friend of mine during that time and I buy my personal life insurance from Zander and I don't own Zander insurance on around any of it that show that while this always told about me\nI Would I Would have a whole lot more money if I did um Zander insurance goes Jeffers done rather well due to the day Ramsey endorsement but the reason they done well is he he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price on term life insurance and it takes about like Thirteen seconds\nAnd they don't sell your name the list of people when you go on there either so that's why I've endorsed him it's real simple and takes care of you guys you the listener and you need to get term life insurance has been cost that much\nSo just jump in there and do it so Brittany thank you for calling with that question given the opportunity to clarify on that yet again yet again yet again yet again yet again\nYes you need life insurance oh by the way a broker you know like even with your car insurance jump on the air with ... with the help they usually a north local providers for your ... what we call PNC property in casual you got your car in your home owner's insurance you can shop most people saved three to eight hundred dollars a year\nOn their car and homeowners when you're shopping among several companies instead of using what we call a captive agent in the business a captive agent can sell for one company like a state for a major foreign nation wide in Asia\nFor Peyton Manning and Brad Paisley can sing to you agent\nWas it nationwide that's nationwide and [noise] but um and they're both good guys I like both of them there's nothing to do with that what you're paying for those guys when you when you use that insurance it's ... it's built in and neither one of those guys worked cheap I'll just tell you this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nFocus is one of my favorite times of year the kids in school football season is here and people everywhere are preparing for the new routines well while you're in preparation mode think about this one was the last time you checked on your financial plant you heard me or do you even\nNamed country wide on my back bank of America on my back\nCan't even imagine it's been so long since I've had him that just just oh I think I Would probably like having anxiety attack it would be bad Carl is with us and Pennsylvania hey Karl welcome ...\nDave thanks for taking my call I appreciate it sure what's up hey I've got a good problem that I'm hoping you give me some advice on I'm forty eight years old would that free uh recently paid our house off yeah the way to go\nYeah we're happy about that a decided to sell off some investments just to do that people kind of said well why would you do that\nOh the people's money ... interest\nThat's right and I tell you what the peace of mind is great fun you know the good problem I have is we're able to\nSell some stock options and I've got about five or six hundred thousand dollar suit that I'm trying to figure out what to do with a few about about the same amount in four one K. which I have to be in the market\nUm I'm a little nervous about possibly also investing amount of money and the market and I'm\nWhite flip homes we for about ten home in the past and I'm thinking about using that money to buy a rental property you know outright mhm and ah and do that and maybe diversify a little more ... than I Want to hear what your thoughts were on that\nOkay um I think is excellent if you've got the stomach for real estate real estate gives you a better return than the stock market will give you but it's a higher hassle factor yup it is you know you put money mutual fund they don't bother you you know but you you put put a renter in a house they go out and you [laughter]\nAnd so there's a ... you know you got the hassle of buying it you got to pay the taxes you got to pay the insurance I mean they're dealing with managing real estate all the aspects of it is a national factor I've got a bunch of it I'm not by far I have more in real estate than I Do in the stock market I've got a lot in both\nBut a real estate will give you a better rate of return but it requires\nManagement by you or someone else and even if you have somebody else do you got to manage the manager you cannot ignore it and so my real estate with an internal right of return which is the tax benefit the the you know that appreciation schedule in other words\nThe actual cash on cash return the ... minus the expenses as a return on investment and the growth in value you put those three things together and real estate you get the actual return which is called the interim right of return the IRR\nOkay which you would compare to a mutual fund right of return to do apples to apples higher hassle factor but most of my real estate is Seventeen to twenty percent right of return I are are\nNot casual cash is about ten\nOkay or a little less and some of it okay\nBut uh I our our total with the increases in value and other stuff so I'm making more on that than I Am on the real estate on the other maybe double what on that I'm making a mutual fund but I've got a lot more hassle with it\nI mean it's um you know even though I don't management of my son in law runs our our real estate company and he manages to all of it and I don't I don't put up I don't personally\nDeal with a renter or something like that or anything or vacancy or a broken air conditioner all that he deals with all that stuff but but you know I went over all the ... this morning with him and to see how the properties are doing we check on them and he's telling me the stories of the drama he gets to deal with and such is real estate but I Love real state do\nYou have to ask if our question I'm sure they might play point was a hundred thousand dollar house so at five hundred thousand [laughter] I have I can get five home mhm I'm all in a hundred thousand each [laughter] now so I Am I on them out like all the rents minus expenses are free and clear or somebody else said why are you by three\nAnd four fifty percent yeah\nWell I don't ... you know I don't think I Know your answer there on a\nLeveraging I I'm not going to leveraging the I don't I ... I don't want the extra pain in the butt of dealing with a banker on top of this right and on top of that I got risk and it just takes all the joy out of this whole discussion um what's the average price point in your area nationwide it's a little over two hundred thousand\nYeah how about that I mean I can get a three bedroom one bath three but I mean that for about a hundred maybe a hundred and twenty ... single family home yeah\nI I'm probably gonna bump on up in the hundred and fifty range and you and do three\nThree one fifty one Seventy five right in there a rather than five ones and the only reason I'm telling you that is get a good by on whatever you by whatever it is not above Bonnie lies with the higher the class renter\nOr the more they pay in rent or they users are dealing with generally speaking as a general category it's not always true\nI mean there's some wonderful people that rented every\nYou know people like his own hours month [noise]\nYou know it's a different different types of folk that you're dealing with the lives of my\nFather and I both myself some muscle somebody shut up to me\nThat I'm just glad that you know the the [noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care if the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely\nLegally and forever is with time share exit team\nThey have offices all around the country where you can sit down face to face and review your ...\n... team they have offices all around the country where you can sit down face to face and review your contract to find a solution they've exploited thousands of timeshare owners this year alone there are the best in the business because they simply a more options for exit than anyone else it could be a long process\nBut there with you every step of the way in timeshare exit team is so confident in their acts of service that if they don't get you out you get a full\nRefund called eight for for nine nine nine ... and schedule a free consultation eight for for nine nine nine ... or timeshare exit team dot com [noise]\nSometimes Pato accidents aren't really accidents and all\nThey are stays deliberate crashes designed to make it look like it's your fault when in fact you were the innocent victims staged accidents can be dangerous even deadly but the criminals that are behind them are interested in and only one thing money from an insurance claim don't take advantage of the situation to claim excessive\nDamage and injuries for the driver and passengers and the other vehicle sometimes adding passengers who weren't even there the parents the injury claims if you think that accident was not really an accidental\nProtect yourself call the police and take pictures of the damage but people on the other vehicles but license plate licenses and registration tell your insurance company that this could have been staged accident and whenever you suspect frog call us at one eight hundred\nTell him I C B that's one eight hundred D.
