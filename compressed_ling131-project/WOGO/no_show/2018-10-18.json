I healthcare management now online\nAnd I don't think he graduated from there next year\nI think they're special master chef that like since I have all said I'll fix trying to figure out like what should\nBe my actual on all the other student loan to own a home run out 'cause you're back in school yeah how much student loan debt that you have [noise]\nAbout two hundred and ... in the corporate on Romney what's decent money\nOr she makes about one twenty and I make about eighty okay\nSo the question that I that I have faith that we have is um her mother and father passed away last year and she was in an American on that in ... and she has to take a certain amount of distribution every year for tax purposes my idea for\nThe inherited money or if you take one lump sum\nPayout all of our debt and then ... pay ourselves back off of that too and I are way I'm so that we don't have to worry about continue sleep paying the uh interests game if you will or a worry about that is that the um you know she can come of that rocket for that for our retirement\nUm my record good at it this year forty I'm thirty eight we've got a good amount of time to be putting into our I'm finding out you know I get my my question is should we go ahead and take the distribution help all of our debt about when I wander paying the um\nYou know the interest rate or should we go and\nPay the that down and we are a bit and it will be there for you were going through and a half years\nWe've been using for almost Thirty years a decision making paradigm a decision making structure that is based on the idea of what is the fastest way to wealth what is the shortest distance to wealth\nAnd I'm In the process what in other words what gives us the greatest returns and what give what gives us the least risk what what has a level of wisdom to it um and it's not just one sided it's not all investing mind of it's not all that mind it it's not anything it's just a process of financial planning process\nThat process has now been proven obviously doing it for twenty five years and many many people become millionaires and multi millionaires gradually not get rich quick using that process\nUm then the question becomes do you guys were you agree to use that process\nAnd if you're is so that the way I Would answer that question obviously may being me is I'm going to tell you use that process and that won't answer your question what to do with the money\nBut um but you've got a first decide do you want to do that or not I mean that's that's that's the core disagreement here what the process is based on the process was called the baby steps\nAnd what it's based on is a couple of things number one you're most powerful wealth building tool\nIs your income\nAnd freeing up your income and not having that not only lowers risk not only increases the ...\nYeah up your income and not having that not only lowers risk not only increases the peace and the quality of the relationship in the household but it also increases mathematically\nFreeze up all of your income just to make money with instead of giving it to banks and on and the second part of the things are driving the process is is that personal finance is eighty percent behavior only twenty percent hip knowledge stuff we're talking about smell really rocket science here\nThere's not a lot to the math it's it's about fourth or fifth grade math is really all it is\nSo having said that we say baby step one side of a thousand dollars you guys are obviously done that\nToo is to be debt free everything but your house you've not done that three years to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses I didn't hear that you've done that and then four she had that for start putting Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement so how much is in your emergency fund\nCurrently we have about twenty five or so in our savings account\nIf the inheritance was not on the table what we would teach you to do is take that down to twenty four through the uh or take twenty four of the twenty five and throw it at the vet and then clean up this debt very very quickly it is absurd for you to have Seventy five dollars in debt with a two hundred dollar household income is Janine right up\nOn your life or a couple of months ago and went on a on a knife in their nice wait a minute or no on him or probably the majority of\nOkay it's absurd that you make two hundred thousand dollars a year and you know trying to about ...\n... ... you know\nYou got to make enough money to have done this the right way you chose not to do with the right way so it's up to you guys but if you're going to do what we teach you know you would use this heritage immediately to become debt free shows that you take all those payments that you don't have any more and you use those to build wealth with you have a paid for home\nCorrect we we heard it when it's\nOkay All right and how much is in the inheritance in cash\nI I'm not quite a hunger go somewhere north of ... Seventy five a\nHundred and Seventy five thousand dollars correct okay and why she taking distribution says they're just taking it\nUm this is what her financial grant or told her that she had to get in a distributed to um [noise] a cover her tax uh over the fear factor that hard over at the most part because the way they collect money out of town\nYou know it's a bunch of crap um the\nUh okay because anytime you start making decisions based on taxes instead of based on economics you make bad decisions so I don't know what this money's invested in but I Want to get control of this money and getting invested\n... what would I Do I catch the whole thing out pay some taxes and I'm In a different financial advisor and uh I Would pay off all the debts and I'm going to invest the rest of it\nOr in something that I can see controlling know what it is in good mutual funds or in some paid for real estate or something like\nThat I honestly don't think that's what you all are going to do but that's what I Would do um because\nI think there's a lot of cooks in this kitchen\nThere's a lot of opinions flying around here and you guys have got to get inside this and as a couple decide what you're going to do and how you're going to handle money and then you start telling financial advisors what to do and show them telling you what to do and it's a different different situation so I think she inherited the financial advisor to\nI don't think you picked him and um and that's really a bad medicine\nAs well Ninety percent of the time are you guys need to pick 'em or you need to re picking and hiring again and this time he works for you but I think he's still works for grandpa even grandpa was dead and that's the way their stuff works usually bad bad medicine\nTravis what I Would do just catch the whole thing out pay off all my debts and invest the money with what's left that's what I Would do and I would take your wonderful two hundred thousand or income and become multi millionaires with it and that's what we've shown people how to do for almost three decades now\nHold on I'll send you guys are a couple a copy of the book the total money make over it'll walk you through not only what to do but why to do it and then you can decide intentionally whether you're going to use our system or someone else's doesn't matter to me [noise] Oscar's whether it's in

on ... on TALK cast and I'm just randomly doing everything that\nYou could do recover older but I Know I have if you have a partnership be university a couple of Barbie tickets on line so I can you

actually\nMove those count totally out of my main that we just don't want to remove the temptation of using if he's not a right way or\nAbsolutely ... absolutely need to close the accounts completely not just cut them up and that'll keep them from reporting activity on your credit bureau report and it'll keep someone from accidentally fraudulently you using them or are you from using them\nYeah I definitely would close the accounts as soon as I cut up the cards no doubt about it [noise] good to talk to you Oscar monitor have used a new listener hold on I'll send you a copy of the book the total moneymaker over and that'll get you started and give you the the framework from all these different pieces of information that are flying around me right now [noise]\nThis is the day Ramsey show

number one online retailer of custom window covering it get free samples free shipping and what the new promos they run every month you'll save even more use the promo code Ramsey to get the best possible deal\nQuestion comes from Laurie in Iowa I was interested in opening a five twenty nine plan for my daughter she has autism so I may open an ... account instead would depending on the ... um\nMy biggest concern is that I don't know what happens is the money to five twenty nine plan if she doesn't go to college can you tell me what happens to money not used for education\nOr it will be if you don't transfer it to a sibling um it'll be heavily taxed and penalize it'll be taxed and heavily penalize so um\nYou know the five twenty nine is not a good plan a for a child that you're not sure what's going to happen as far as their education\nIs going to be and we've got a special needs situation like this I Would usually able to count 'em and or I Would just use mutual fund\nJust blurted mutual funds and let it grow and then you can just take care of the child with that money you're just you're marking it for them for their future\nOr they may do a trade school they may do or they may be able to do a full for your academic run 'em they may do a lot of things I don't know how the severity of this I don't know exactly what you're facing\nBut you simply in just save money it's as simple invest money in your name and you're controlling it and then you can decide to help your child however you want to the only advantage of the table or the five twenty nine is just the tax advantage\nStill just an investment in a good mutual fund\nLike Washington says at our as it grows is going to be taxed\nThat's the only thing so it's a it's an advantage if you have a real high probability of them doing our education\nBut again where you've got a a a special needs situation most of the time I'm going to say just save it in a regular count saving the mutual fund if you want to use the cable that's fine that's what it's designed for do all kinds of stuff with that but it's a good plan but\nI probably would just keep it were and get my hands on it and I'm I'm not a big deal either way the the thing the reason we push of twenty nine just those two things uh ... in a traditional such a situation\nIt teaches you to brainwash your kid to go to college which is not a bad thing at all and the other thing is it allows that money to grow tax free and so it's ... that's a wonderful benefits but is that ... is that the only possible way you can care for your child no\nInterest in a more traditional situation\nIt's the best way the most um you know the least taxes on the thing which is generally what we want to do\nUm so we're letting it grow but in this situation I I'm not the tax benefit is not worth the pension you in the corner and actually hitting you harder later I'm making you wish you just pay the taxes\nAnd and that's the way to work out open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five ... on Twitter David I'm thinking about studying abroad next summer but the cost is at least five thousand dollars I really don't want to go into that\nUm but I'll be out of college soon and this was once in a lifetime opportunity what should I Do is that there is a hundred percent chance that they Ramsey is never going to tell you to borrow money\nFairly predictable I'm\nThirty years I've been doing this almost from its twenty seven years I've been here on there I never told people more money\n... if you want to go study abroad I suggest you get your motive job\nFive thousand dollars to do just worked your little tail off and then go and enjoy your study abroad experience from pay cash for it and that way and will follow you home\nThere is a point um be amazed what you can do if you're really really want to talk for instance if I told you that you were going to die if you didn't say five thousand dollars [noise]\nDo you go work for five thousand dollars to not die it's amazing what you can do when you really want to but I won't be a little lazy here and I'm going to borrow my way into a mess and I'm going to say well

you have you been in agriculture and renting before\nNo this'll be my first venture into it um\nSo why would a first venture into wrenching into it with a very narrow product line\nWell that is actually the second half of it I'm a first start I'll be starting with goats and I have a uh my I don't have all of the expertise myself it's a good friend of mine who does and we're gonna be working together [noise]\n[noise] um ... sixteen\nOkay All right cool well as long as you got more than five years I Would use a simple gross stock mutual fund\nOr a series of them for something like that I probably would just using the F and P index fund because\nIt will grow virtually without paying taxes on it until you pull it out I as a what's called a low turnover ratio which means the taxes aren't charge much on the growth until you cash it in and so I start to a group of ... five hundred fund an index fund\nAnd use that to grow for the next five ten years or so until you buy a house as long as you leave it alone as long as you plan to leave it alone at least five years you can survive the gyrations of the stock market and you should be fine\nIn that and that that's exactly what I Would do I do a similar things got in sometimes I've got some extra money and I'm just saving up for my next real estate purchase as an investment\nAnd um even if I don't have five years in that case I'll ride the market with it and I 'cause I can afford to go down if I mess up a little bit but yeah that that's the direction I Would go good question Robby is with us in Pittsburgh hey Robbie welcome to the\nDay Ramsey show hey Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOh thank you so much for taking my call yeah I had a quick question uh so I Am a nurse or by profession and my wife is a a nurse and that that I'm Wondering if I should go back to school again next year\nOr so my question is if they work for me to go to a call now I'm thirty two years old my wife is\nUh twenty nine we make a combined income right now of a two hundred and a two hundred and twenty thousand a year or so if I go to school it's going to cost me three years of not working on that tuition off around Ninety thousand dollars\nMhm uh but uh our gross income after I go to school and be successful uh together would be close to a three hundred thousand mhm\nSo uh but it's a ... year now right now run Seventy thousand\nOkay you're saying this is going to cost you a three hundred grand three years or three years of Seventy thousand missing plus nine out of pocket\nYeah okay can you catch ... out of pocket and can you live on her income while you're doing this\nI can live on her income for sure that's how we did it when she was in school um but I don't think I can cash anything right now because I and I also don't have a house mhm uh at the moment so I was you know planning on buying a house\nOr or putting at least they're putting a down payment for a house next year before I start school so that then\nYou need to wait until you can pay for school or whatever but you never in Thirty years or during the show recommended somebody borrow money to go to school okay you got the cash flow to do it it's just a matter when you do it and what you put first what you put second you might plenty of money to come up with not agreeing\nYeah plenty of money and you don't have to have the whole money up front you just got to see in your budget how you can cash flow would um I can see it pretty easily ... to take to go through the class again or go to Eric ... it's a three year program so thirty grand a year\nA thirty grand a year yeah and and she makes what\nAh thirty grand a year yeah and and she makes what she make a hundred and fifty thousand\nYou can't cash flow thirty grand out of a hundred and fifty\nA long not when I'm not in coal\nNo if you're in school she makes a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in ... thirty thousand over a hundred and fifty to go to school year for three years\nI I'm Sorry fifty dollars it's it's a it's going to be around a sixty thousand a year\nI thought you said it was Ninety thousand [noise] sorry I I got that wrong it's it's a sixty thousand a year\nSeems high\nYeah it it it is a it is an expensive program you know go to a less expensive program\nThat much cash flow it whenever you're going to pay for it figure out what to pay for the\nPies you go you don't necessarily have an all star stacked up ahead of time but you got to see where it's going to come from I Would not recommend you go get student loans because here's the thing everyone starts that program doesn't finish it but every one that takes out student loans just aren't that program has no student\nLoans whether they finish or not and then you've got what's known as a freaking mash and so I'm not suggesting you're dumber you can't pass the test or something like that my life happens do in the last thing you want the only time debt works as if everything works other than that that doesn't work and so we\nTell you to stay away from it thanks for the call open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Joshua is in Dallas texas Hi Joshua how are you\nI'm good how are you better than I deserve what's up\nSo basically I Am stuck in between whether I should or bankruptcy or just go ahead and start paying 'em all my at all a goalball basically all my debts except my car our aim collection so that's why that's the only reason I'm basically contemplating\nUm bankruptcy\nWhy are they only go actions\nUm they're like own medical bills um one is a is a car that guy I'm ... I lost my job and uh I think I think like a phone bill is America\nMhm okay so how much is the repo bill\n[noise] um [noise] that was actually only like a couple of grand ... it gets what I have on there is\nA Ninety five thousand\nFour hundred and forty five dollars from an old apartment Mm how long ago it was three and a half years ago okay and how ... how much how much money and when their medical data again\nI Would say about two thousand and one of the doubt if you've got the\nRest of it is like my ... or ... I think a phone bill and all the payday Lowe says well\nYou know so your your total that's less than twenty thousand dollars\nRight and then I have um my car which is a twelfth out mhm okay and what do you make it here I'm\nA little bit old for forty five I make a thousand a week I'm a independent contractor\nMhm and you're single or married you're married or\nI'm twenty eight on Saturday that\nHappy birthday does she work outside the home\nUm you know she stays at home and take care of her daughter\nOkay yeah right well\nLet me tell you what I'm hearing okay and I think I'm hearing maybe I'm wrong I'm a ... cat used to say that debt is not the problem is the symptom\nOf something else that's going on I'm right and it sounds like you guys have never told your money what to do you've never had any savings for emergencies so every time an emergency comes up you get thrown out of an apartment in your car gets re bowed and you end up with a mess\nYes they're so we've got to get you on a plan where you are telling your money what to do or you're going to be back here if I waved to want to ... go way which is what bankruptcy might do maybe I'm if it did that make you have zeroed out all of a sudden except your car\nIf you don't change the habits that causes this mess in the first place you'll be back right where you are someday do you agree\nYes there you know so we really need to get under that does bankruptcy doesn't solve that uh you got to solve that in the mirror you and your wife learning how to handle money I don't think you're bankrupt I think you're scared disorganized don't know what to do and have done nothing so far\nI think you can probably settle that old apartment that for three or four grand if you saved it up and offer them a lump sum settlement uh I\nI've actually called them a multiple times where I started listening to you that was like one of the first videos that I was looking up with is how to get that collect bears you know from under use\nIt don't it doesn't change my answer to whether it's nine thousand and three thousand new still not bankrupt\nIt's still about you getting control your money\nAnd when you do that then you're going to see your way through this bankruptcy is not a problem that you have your from Scott\n... is a total money make over both read that take an extra job shell everything in sight and let's get this message cleaned up I'll show you know\nI said listen\nThis is the day room she\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the

they weren't there to bother stronger drink\n\nThey wouldn't be able to drink right if you weren't there and buy to buy her her drinks she wouldn't be getting drunk\nRight\nWhen you finance firm misbehavior you ensure it is going to continue\nOkay is that makes sense I don't want her to die or something I'm trying to get this was things cancers and it's going to cause or hand or something but it sounds like this woman lives from one crisis doing other than their own self created\n[laughter] you know back in time\nAnd I thought I was reading it in the mail but I wasn't sure so I'm Glad I understand and I'm not trying to be lacking compassion I Want to be compassionate but continuing to assist her in this behavior line that has been destructive to her is not compassionate\nOkay country like\nA minute I have to tell you what I don't know I mean you got to sit down and figure out how you're going to do this in layers but maybe you maybe you assist her partially in return for her engaging in behavior that you know she's supposed to be doing\nOK but so far she has refused all help that has to do with Hirsch lightening up yeah I was a little kid my dad used to say straighten up

her and you don't want to see her in pain and she refuses to do the things she calls the pain to go away\nMhm okay\nAnd you're more concerned about her behavior than she is\nSo I ... I think I just sit down and tell her all that say you know I Love you know somebody say when you do all that she's going to get pissed off injuries\nAnd here she feels entitled to your money back and you know that's weird ... boundary violation and looked around and she was she is titled or your money so she was supposed to take care of your mom\nCigarette hanging out of your lives in iron lungs laws I mean come on\nSerious momma\nThis is the Ramsey show [noise]\nI get asked all the time about what people need to do to improve their families money situation to the most overlooked things are term life insurance and disability insurance both plans make sure that you have income to pay bills\nAnd take care of yourself and your family if something were to happen for term life you need to carry ten to twelve times your income and I recommend Fifteen or twenty year plans for most families stay away from cash value or return a premium plans\nThere just a rip off disability insurance is justice critical how are you going to pay your bills you if you're unable to work\nDisability is the leading cause of bankruptcies foreclosures\nThat's why I send you to Zander insurance they've been helping my listeners find the right plans at the lowest cost for almost Twenty years call eight hundred three five six Seventeen Ninety or visit sander dot com and compare online\nThat's eight hundred three five six Seventeen eighty or Zander dot com\nOkay forest animals day the new day kids are coming to the forest and it's up to us to make a visit a good one sparrow yeah have you practice the most popular bird songs for the year\n[noise]\nDo you practice the most popular bird songs for the year\n[noise]\nHigh like OK river ... tells the temperature to refreshing fifty two degrees and perfect for a little riverside shoelace relaxation\nLocked good how are you here called ...
