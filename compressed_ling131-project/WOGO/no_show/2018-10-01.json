Arabs to show Mitch\nHow're you doing better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] well they have um I got a question for you about a whole life insurance policy [noise]\nMy wife has a whole life insurance policy that her parents got her you know twenty some years ago and they don't hang it and now they're transferring ownership over to\nA we're wondering if that would be a wise thing to maybe cash that out yes or [laughter] okay um we're in baby step too so I didn't\nYes or [laughter] okay um we're in baby steps to so I didn't know if it'd be why they kept it out orders to let it grow\nNo it's not growing but about one percent a year one point two percent is the average cash value gross\nI don't say it's sucks as an investment of success in insurance product so are you you should get I uh ten to twelve times a year income on you tend to twelve times her income on her in term life insurance Fifteen to twenty or level term and then cash this stuff out and\nUse the cash value towards your baby step to\nOff um we already have the term life insurance in place for both of us so good cautious moms are income you know then there's time and it would be it would take about their care of the rest of our debt which is about Thirteen thousand in the cash value right now is about Seventeen great every taxes with it\nNo probably not the basis in your whole life policy for tax purposes calculation is your ... as if what you paid for it is the total but her parents paid in over all those years\nWhich is probably a whole lot more than Seventeen thousand oh okay and yeah it was as long as that's the case there is no gain if they paid in Fifteen thousand if a total of all the premiums they ever paid was Fifteen thousand and you pull out Seventeen the game would be two thousand\nGotcha yeah there is actually be ordinary income is not again because it's not actually an investment\nShow are but um yeah I Ninety eight percent a whole lot policy particularly these horrible childhood policies like this when I Do not you don't even get back what you put in it that's how bad the rate of return is you see what I'm saying is that have been the actual fun it'd be a hundred thousand and says I haven't seen\nGotcha that's what that's what I worry about it and then well that'll help us get done what they've said to my perfect\nMan get after it says in Indianapolis I says welcome to Dave Ramsey show\nThings day thanks for having me sure what's up\nSo I Am unfortunately only meant you about a year ago and I took a lease out on a car two years ago for a three year lease about twenty thousand dollar car\nSo I still in pain moving till next July or this coming July ... about eleven thousand dollar buyout on a car after that I was trying to see it there is like what the best option for me to do now to get out of it early ... cheaper car\nPrioritize investing and starting early relative to kind of piling cash for a first time\nUm I think you can do both\nUm there there's no rush to buy their first home I'm generally speaking from Eighteen to twenty five there's a lot of transition in\nYour life or there's a lot of moving around um things that happened new jobs a finishing are going to college possibly getting married a lot of stuff happens in that Eighteen to twenty five range\nAnd so and every one of those things may precipitate living in a different place and so like if you bought a house at Eighteen and let's just you know I don't know your situation but let's just pretend you then or or or Nineteen and then you\nFinished college and got married there's a real high percentage chance that housing cutting it you're moving somewhere else so you probably should have just rent it during that time uh and piled up cash so it's not a rushed into things kind of subtle out in your life and you know what the groove is\nNow you can settle in the groove at Eighteen that's fine you say I graduated I Know what I'm doing this is what I'm doing and\nThere's not going to be any big changes going forward um then that's fine but um you know the if you are in college\nOne hundred percent I Want you to focus on college not on saving for a house and not on investing because of the best right of return is education assuming you're studying something that's usable in the marketplace\nI'm not getting a degree and left handed puppetry or something like that show\nBut yeah that's the best return 'cause you make more money on that then you do on a mutual fund or on purchasing a house and so but it all depends on your situation is more stable and predictable the less transition that is in your future\nThe more you would lean towards may be buying a house but I'm just not the her either a love real estate I Want you to own real estate real estate's a good place to have money it's a good thing to own to have a part of your life going forward but um but it's it's not necessary\nThat you get in a hurry on it to just just to you

Republican plate right in ... I'm In one week extension\nAs you know that the the FBI doesn't draw conclusions all the Trump ... at a press conference and he just said they they can ask whatever\nInclusions all the Trump better at a press conference and he just said they they can mask whatever questions they want to go where he wants to go but the FBI is not supposed to draw conclusions I understand your point who told me already set that person but I I don't think it's going to happen again not that I'm In love with the president is a director\nI don't know where they get these people from the same thing with Jeff Sessions very disappointed in both of them that the you know they don't understand what they're dealing with they have to be aggressive they have to be strong so\nThey're both pretty uh disappointing to me let's go to Steven in Pensacola, Florida Steven you're on was marked\nMargot you real well how are you doing I'm good and I\nDidn't want to learn something really bad to the border the conversation you know giving testimony she was very confused and I don't mean confused about cats Molly regarding God with all the first thing that she was that you know\nShe said was my lab some ... nobody asked for joining the caffeine do I got the tea I'm spoiled so why cup of coffee which comes many different ways I mean you just\nCome in law and order or I'd like some gap thing you tell the person what you want yeah she also got to remember those polling got mastered the greens\nAnd the ph said what does that mean to you understand that they really want to bars you regarding the choice to the ... the\nPilot a ... bar graph um she also didn't understand the term on your behalf regarding anyone speak to vote to Congress after she'd say like test well that one and she doesn't understand the turtle\nEggs global daily evidence\nYeah the one on on your first thing you said about the coffee I I don't hold that against what actually that makes her look sympathetic in some ways bought to the thing I remember you're right when she said what does that mean on your behalf that kind of surprised me a little bit um\nBut I mean you should not only not only did they ask for a blood drive to the boss Peter tried to explain it to work and she didn't get it\nYeah well you you make a point which is that there are a lot of things that are surprising but again as the other side which is if you micromanage anything uh a lot of us will look that good right\nI I think it is key the only thing that the the interviewer or that's what I Want to say she didn't seem like a prosecutor from each you know the ones that were what was her name the one the Republicans Mitchell yeah\nUh you know I was going to go somewhere with the whole thing you know very gently do everything and then in kind of shows she got her and all she got I guess the flights\nYou know that he or she said that she didn't want to come to Washington because she's afraid of flying or whatever it wasn't here she took all these flights so I thought she was going to pile on all these inconsistencies and I thought they were going to have you with them to see like what I expect which probably is why she wasn't there and the second half right\nYou guys all have great calls are are most you yeah let's go to a sure in Minnesota sure your own was marked\nBy mark Hi how are you well good I'm Out of a couple of things I'm the last caller was talking about her um her inconsistencies and her behavior um\nI look at like two different types she was so confused when they asked her to stand up and later Arnold looked like she never heard of Africa or what I Do and I mean you know she just and\nThen she had those hurt I don't know if anyone else don't fit but those glasses looked like they are either that or she never clean them and it almost gave her this little sad confused kind of look\nAbout are actually the one hand yeah I I I actually\nHeard that you hadn't cleaned the glasses for thirty five years\n[laughter] get on the other hand she got two master's and I'm sure it and she teaches in two different colleges\nWait wait wait wait wait wait wait I Do oh you telling me you respect ... degrees master's degree you know I'm\nJust saying I'm just saying there's a huge did that um this threat maybe that's not the right word no but I I had a huge\nDifference says the other thing that I I Want to mention is and I've not heard anyone say that um when they asked her about her friendly when and if she would cut from that um she she talked about the present well she's got some health issues and I'm going to respect your health issues\nI'm thinking about this as a former fourteen year old girl even before cell phone thing next we'll end what I call her and said well you know what happened you know she I remembering eight miles from home\nWell I don't think she'd get home one of my you know I didn't\nLike it and she tell her that she was leading or at least give her a call and say you know what happened after I left or any of those kind of things that get very little holes in her testimony that I Wish someone had jumped on\nYeah were you disappointed in the a prosecutor also asking those questions I didn't you think like I did this going to reach a climax and\nI did and I kept thinking yeah I mean you know when it came to the new drink and then she was done my heart thing because I thought boy oh boy this is how the rest of your day go you know you were done for and I was\nSo proud of Brett Kavanaugh when he came in guns blazing and and anybody that you know make fun of him for crying or for bringing up ticket daughter pray I guess ... ... what would you not do\nYou were accused of something\nSo horrific well yeah but you can't prove a negative well of\nCourse

can't win with them that that's the point you did it will ... thanks you recall shirts\nYou you can't win with them how could you win was um it doesn't matter what you say it doesn't matter what the

psychologist you have to be licensed psychologist\nAnd you have to perform three thousand hours\nA postdoctoral professionally experience and pass rigorous exams to get that license\nAnd she she she is not licensed the only thing that's\nThe only thing that bothers me and all of you were doing this they're there and if you throw in things that may or may not you know be things that are so serious that anybody could have made that kind of mistake then it looks like you're looking for lots of stuff and you know you have a chance to be a Monday morning quarterback\nI see you've got to be careful miss as you try to build up your case I Know why because Mitchell was so bad and building up anything now this is interesting I Wonder if they live in the same household 'cause we have Carol in Florida and sundry in Florida\nAnd they both why one's a little different before planned her testimony or let's go to that first the other one says red testimonial paper maybe there in the same household Carlton slug you run with mark\nHi Hi Kara Kara Hi Hi\nNo I doubt if I'm In ... park and the fact that characterize the court has now that are going to have black worked on a show and I am ex totally against is lying horrible woman\nBecause he had to lie after lie after lie anger out number one she took off her social media and plan for it that I did after he had nothing to hide why did you remove all of it\nHe removed every drop that had to do with her since she finally in our past\nSecond according to their parents their money from the ... that she and her husband went to the rent the they were having marital problems and end the notes counsellors he had this episode that she describes occurring during the last ... to ... percent for men wearing pop\nSo she used her quest set it on my own economic at very perfect Nineteen eighty through and catch Kavanaugh so that's another lie\nLeather why was she was flying out there with her for a while and well that's ridiculous she and her husband fly all over the world but that was another lie another language hide the fact that her brother\nHas their relationship with Peter Struck\nUm\nIt's a little bit right now but only three people were low\nSo I think that that needs to be investigated as well you know an awful lot about the woman that was very emotional I felt that women really relate and emotional pets no money mhm and they find it hard to get back away from it but it was not backed\nOff did you hear about actual question for not gotten\n... did you hear the code ice a ton of paraphrase what Thomas duck Thomas all said that you can't confuse the motion with facts right she was really good on that emotional level right\nAnd and a lot of women especially but others related to that but you just said it but that has nothing to do necessarily with it being factual and Carolyn go go to your job now okay\nI Will go but his shoulders are saying to me that people are so\nAffected by this or even if

and such big numbers\nThat it it makes a huge difference is not enough just it it's great that you know we give me a chance to express your feelings about what we we can't let these people get away with it and since I mentioned Sondra in Florida\nGo ahead sundry your honor was mark and I'll just scratch a radio on so that's the delays you there's something okay I got to chew on hold because it's

was at the beginning of the question\nOf Dr Ford she was asked how she found out about the party and she said that there was a pool boy aren't attendant or a friend that was at the pool told her about it and and she ended up uh you know going from that information she was asked who that person was\nAnd she said she wanted to keep that person anonymous well I think that's a key point from the fact that there is an individual out there who can tell who held the party and we're the party was because that person told", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Hallie", "day": "01"}
