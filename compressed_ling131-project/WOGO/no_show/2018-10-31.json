I. fan and twenty thousand dollars in cash and I just started\nFantastic and twenty thousand dollars in cash and I just started um Iraq IRA I'm right now and they have about five thousand dollars and you will not thank you\nSo I just that within the past couple of months here and listening to you I'm credit and fixed that me and the one thing that\nI haven't prioritize and actually I'm paying off my student loans [laughter]\nI'm Still an hour I think you and find your baby I am I'm I decided to go ahead and take fat twenty thousand dollars um wire Eighteen thousand dollars ... next year that mount\nCalm right now I have about Eighteen thousand dollars less and get up on a ... which I'm trying to actively attack\nI'm the one thing now is that um\nOh and then I also stopped I Am a hundred and twelve percent of my income into my ... and I cut in half and six percent\nI'm the one thing now in federal started talking to my friends about what I'm feeling and mayor archer air like are you crazy and you're a single woman how could you only have two thousand dollars in the wire you\nYou know trying to attack their student loans are only federal loans that they're not proud of and I've even heard some of my friends say that you know at first comes toward you can move out of the country and not pay your dad or\nOr your friends multimillionaires\n\nNow that crap what they think about money\nYou're going to take so much from broke people [laughter] ... dumb\nI Know I Know it's it's crazy to some of the things that they said like moving out of the country\nAnd ... they're broke yeah\nBut I'm Wondering like saying that's like saying I'm overweight and I'm going to lose weight and I'm actually doing it and all my overweight friends were making fun of my plan that's kinda dumb yeah\nYeah\nYeah I mean who cares what they think are even I wouldn't even discuss it with them like somebody's been married sixteen times and they're going to help you with your marriage problem\nWhat what I tell folks is that you need to put Fifteen Percent and most of the time and a pension plan you're not\nPutting in anything and\nYou don't have any control over what happens with the pension plans you don't choose the investments you don't get to um you know if the ... municipality in your case is poorly run they could break the pension plan it's happened before doesn't happen very much\nBut um no I think you need to be voting Fifteen Percent of your income away in\n... four one K. is whatever you got to do along those lines\nAnd and that's the thing I Would tell you that the reason is is that what you've got that's money you choose where it invested and if somebody mishandled something at work it doesn't mess up your four one K. it doesn't mess up your Roth IRA you are controlling your destiny are not waiting on someone else\nThe people you work for it affects your life\nThat's a big deal Johns in Pittsburgh hey John welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHow are you today better than I deserve what's up\nI'm Greg I'm reason I'm calling is here's my question or my wife is sixty five I'm sixty two versions now into getting on the on the snowball we have a ... saved up mhm [noise]\nAnd now we're looking for a new place to live the house was rent right now is just way too big for my wife and I both got bad knees bad backs mhm up and down the stairs of the pain than about all the time okay um my question is\nUm the rentals around this area now are skyrocketing because there's new cracker plant going am so people are coming in from out of state sucking all those up but I found a couple of houses that I could purchase\nAnd the migrant right now eight Seventy five a month or my payment would drop to about two hundred thirty dollars from up mhm [noise]\nUm the other part of it is a when I retired from the post office I rolled Meyer a push savings plan into an IRA and good but I can borrow enough from right now with that I already just be able to put towards ... percent down on the house so I wouldn't have to pay the ...\n... you know just like you and your ... I don't go down to ... percent no you're you're Iraq Tareq your two broke to buy a house you're in day out here you're in debt you get your\nBorrowing against your retirement I mean you're straining at every corner to pull this off okay um and besides that you if you're moving from an eight Seventy five rental to six hundred dollar payment you're moving down in house substantially so we're going to move down and house substantially moved down to\nOr payment you're moving down in house substantially so we're going to move down and house substantially moved down to a different rental and let me tell you if the rental market is squeezed because of a plant that has come in the buying market is squeezed as well\nSo what you're telling me is not logical you're using this as a rationalization by out of order I if I were you when you call me and I ask what you should do I would rent something else move out of that rental moved to a cheaper rental that'd be fine\nAh for a short period of time that while you clean up your debt your debt free you build your emergency fund up three to six months of expense was then you have a good down payment and you can do all of that in a few years if you're careful and watch what you're doing and then make your purchased\nBut uh when you buy a house in your broke you're asking for trouble I mean a Murphy will move in your spare bedroom bring his three cousins broke desperate and stupid owning a home when you're broke and be a financial curse\nRather than a blessing\nSteven as in Virginia Beach Hi Stephen how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nI don't want to know what would be smarter to do right now I have a higher rate and my name and I know you can only put five thousand five hundred into a year ago I had actually me and my wife only at\nThat mountain a mouth that amount of money five thousand five hundred to go towards investing whether it be smarter to put all of it into my rock hire a act is for sure like open up a rock for my in my wife's name and then split the five thousand five hundred and put two thousand seven hundred and fifty in each of them and watch or go that way what's your household\nIncome a household income and fifty thousand okay Mm\nSo Fifteen Percent of that going in it baby step forward into retirement\nIs more like a ten thousand no it would be more than a five hundred okay um [noise]\nOkay so you wouldn't fully fund to but you could put some it it doesn't matter uh which one you do mathematically let's say you chose the exact same mutual fund and you put\nThree thousand in more than three thousand another okay one in one Roth IRA and your name on earth I earned her name or or um you put six thousand in the same mutual fund it's going to grow exactly the same so it really doesn't matter\nUh so I even have like a thousand dollars I can I could open up won five hundred and five hundred her you know the guy that\nExactly it doesn't it doesn't have you any mathematical advantage whatsoever the only advantage is just a relational\nIn that if she feels like that you know you're fully funding mirrors and she's not got anything for retirement which is not true because if you ever got divorced or died or anything else she's going to get half of that money even if it isn't your name\nOkay okay so it's not true but sometimes people just you know like she just want some and her name that's okay so you can do half and half as you want you need to get to the point you're putting Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement that's maybe step for and that would be after you were out of debt and after you had your emergency fund them ...\nWhich may be why\nYou don't have the money right now\nThat's why we put baby step for after getting out of that and after having emergency of and we do folks temporarily not to save for retirement till you clear your dad's that way you have the money to put Fifteen Percent of way\nAnd a Fifteen Percent is more than one Roth IRA for you guys but conceptually if you just even if you did Seventy five hundred thirty seven hundred fifty bucks each\nAh that'd be fine or if you did fifty five hundred and two thousand and the other name that's fine if they're in the same mutual fund you're going to get the exact same results whether you split it or not doesn't change a thing James is with us from Fort Smith Arkansas Hi James how are you\nGood thank you for taking my call sure what's up my wife and I are planted the home next year and have a little trouble deciding or for agreeing on the house would not want to get in kind of outline and towards getting a fixer upper\nThere'll be a cheaper house with lower mortgage payment ... and that gives me the opportunity to learn\nHow to do those our parents myself mhm and she wants to get moving around ... ...\n... ...\nAnd uh be your first home\nThey are second all we've had a house in a while ago and then we moved in with rent painting or well over a year now you know\nThe other home that you had was at a fixer upper\nIt was not it was ...\n... ... and um so what is her fear\nOr just for a ticket you know and it's kind of a hassle to her house mhm I didn't want anything major just out this a minor cosmetic type stuff\nBut I couldn't you do it for you moved in\nAh financially I think we'd be able to afford rent and a mortgage\nNo I'm saying oh yeah okay I see what you're saying that you use a fixer upper would take a few months maybe and you wouldn't\nHave gotten them to do that I got you\nI'm a part time real estate agent so I live in a house for two years and then turn around and sell it\nI can sell it tax free\n... showed anyway about on my dog shelter for anyone\nTo be a real estate actually show house facts where you first residents would be living in two years' tax free growth on that anyone for anybody [noise]\nI don't think there's a I don't think there's a right or wrong answer to this is just a question of what you guys want to endure it is your home we are homeless topsy turvy because being renovated all the time I get to some valid point on her you're not going to make as much money on it to your point so it's a valid argument [noise]\nIdentity theft has become an epidemic data breaches or being reported every day and hundreds of millions of people have had their identity stolen sometimes multiple times that's crazy now I've seen first hand when people are stressed and freaked\nOut when they become an identity theft victim and those who have credit or id monitoring plans to find out really quick how unprotected they are in so many ways that's why ... id theft\nPlant to our benefit package was such a smart move the Sanders plan covers all types of ID theft takes over all the work and even coverage or bank account if it gets act I know my team is getting the broadest protection a bay level and can focus on their\nFamily and there are other priorities instead of being freaked out whether you're a family or a company looking to help out your team you need to check out the Sanders plant in a quick easy quote at ... dot com or call eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two\nIn good shape\nAnd you can probably do it this way um\nI Can't jump up and down and say you're in great shape\n\nYour ear in a way above average shape I'm In good shape is is is way above normal 'cause normal just sucks okay you got to weigh rather than most people but I'm living on forty thousand dollars a year for the rest of your life for the next forty years is going to get old\nAnd you don't really have any income coming other than that because your investments are big enough to create it and so I\nWould you know how you can do it you can do it but I think you need to have in the back of your head you may be going back to work at some point\nI'm considered that I thought about it for health insurance and um [noise] um and I've heard of these men to share programs do you\nRemember what it was not driving this for me for what's driving it for me is you know how much money\nRight and you got the pension but understand you know think about what what are you know forty thousand dollars is going to buy in forty years when you are Ninety\nNothing\nYeah nothing\nThat's the problem I've got here so it doesn't have a good long term prognosis of you guys just being able to live and we can figure out how you could live in other words if you had a million dollars or mutual funds just becomes like a no brainer\nInstead you're not like a hundred and fifty two hundred thousand maybe even a scrape everything together after the failed around properties and you know the farms got value but it's not producing any money so what might what I'm thinking as an ... and again you can do whatever you want to I'm just talking it through with you OK\nI'm not saying you're you're you're you're wrong or you're bad or something but that's my concern of what I'm hearing\nIs and so I probably would think about what we always called an encore career and say what could you do that would be really fun\nThat you could make fifty grand or a hundred grand doing for the next five or six seven years and you enjoy doing it start a business you'd have fun doing it and make some bank\nAnd bank all of it and health insurance as part of the day I don't care if you're working for somebody else you start a business but just do something what you're doing out and make you smile anymore so you need to get out of there\n[laughter] you picked up on that her\nYeah and so you know but I but I mean when you're you're young you have a lot of uh a lot of\nService to humanity left inside of you that you could get paid for\nIdeas concepts things you could do I don't know what it is but something that just I mean I I'm just a little bit older than you I'm fifty seven and do not plan on work and it's not 'cause I Need money I don't have the money I got money coming our mayors but I'm working because I have a blast\nYeah I don't find something like that and then you can work and hunt and fish and worked in hunting fishing farming\nKnow but but you know I'd like to see your bank another five or six hundred grand and the next eight years and have fun doing it that's what I'm saying that's a that's the only challenge I've got is I think there's God's got something inside of you there is something you could do more than hunting and fishing that\nNot that bad table or bad is not you've earned the right to do that and you should get out of the place you're getting outta but what's your encore career you take a bow and you come back out on the stage for the encore that's what the encore careers and a lot of people in like a lot of money on that Richard\nShow and and it's not that money's everything but I I just want you to have a little more pad between you and Murphy than this scenario gives me here\nAnd I think there's some magic left inside of you\nThat we all need still that's what I'm saying and it might be you take a year and you do nothing behind fresh and farm and then usually at the end of that year I'm going to go do X and that's okay but but ... for for the next four years now you're going to get tired of fishing [laughter]\nYou know that's a lot of fishing [laughter]\nSo find something makes you smile again there that's all I'm saying so uh I'm gonna send you a copy of a book then again George called start because you're starting a fresh chapter I don't think you'll enjoy the thank you for calling him to talk to a sharp [laughter]\nIs is
