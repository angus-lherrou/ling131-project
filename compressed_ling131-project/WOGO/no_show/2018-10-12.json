was supposed to call and she was very upset\nLike the world is coming to an end her mom and I are trying to quit laughing so we can walk in and comfort her [laughter]\nNow why are we used to and in the hall outside her bedroom laughing and why is she in their\nHopeless well\nWe've got perspective we see things that she doesn't see because we've been pleasure she hasn't been on and have experience was that she doesn't have right so in other words we've been to our twenty year class reunion we know she'll be glad he didn't call\n[laughter] that's what we're giggling about standing and All right so we have perspective and so we you know when you don't have ... when you cannot see the other side you're standing in poop up to your knees but you can't see the other side of it\nThen you know it's not fertilizer at that point it's just poop but when you can see the other side of it then it's fertilizer and it it's going to grow some things in your future\nYou know when you're walking through garbage in other words you're going to you that there's some good is going to come out of the garbage that you're in but but when it gets right down on you and your vision is just the end of your nose and not the end of your life\nWhen you look out ten years you see stuff different than when you look out ten seconds and\nThe amount of just talking to an end folks that have dealt with an homeless situations is one of the problem was the the desperation just to eat and not be cold\nCauses you to have ten second increments of thought instead of ten year increments of thought ...\nTen second increments of thought instead of ten year increments just thought gee I can stand back from that sitting here warm\nAnd with a full belly in my studio several thousand miles away and look at him and go to just go work more\nBut he can't see you couldn't see that you don't care that he wasn't getting it\nLike go go go deliver pizzas go blow leaves go walk dogs go shovel something somewhere you know go do something do you know work all the time but as soon as you do that money comes from work is where it comes from I Can't get enough hours woven work someplace else work more\nWork all the time but by 'cause I've done that kind of stuff and I'm the other side of it and I've seen what it does mean out when we were going broke two babies and wife houses in foreclosure were that close to almost ourselves\nSo how we get out of it ... off and well you know you\nCan't work your way out everything that I didn't work my way out I went bankrupt but I didn't lose the house\nAnd if I had lost the house on a pound someplace living out of work my way into their own apartment and we lived in that well you know ... and it's not that I'm Better is not that I'm smarter only thing is just perspective it's like I didn't grow up rich but I had a friend that grew up rich\nAnd\nBecause he grew up in a wealthy home he had the perception that everything was going to work out considered always worked out and I had the perspective that ain't gonna work out [laughter]\nIt's gonna be awful\nAnd and but because he thought everything was always going to work out you don't want it all worked out a lot because I didn't think it was going to work out sometimes it didn't work out you say you set yourself in these traction these rockets with this thing\nBut when you can see the other side of it it's easy to work through it\nIt's when you can't see the other side of it that you don't want to work through it 'cause you don't believe it's going to work that's called hopelessness the situation is exactly the same they only different issue is your perspective and some challenge and some of your another think you're stuck you think you're stuck in a career you think you're stuck in this\nMarriage it's bad it's always going to be that way you think you're stuck with whatever behavior you're stuck with you think you're stuck with your money you think you're stuck in that you're not stuck\n\nYou're not stuck life is not a snapshot it's a film script you're going to turn the page and something else is going to happen better or worse tomorrow it is not going to stay the same you are not stuck\nSo look the other side of it look out there five years look out there three years look out their ten months and say what am I got to do what's got to be true that is not true right now for me to never be here again that's a question he was asking but he was having trouble emotionally buying it\nAnd I don't think I helped him I was kind of bothered me that's why I Want to talk about a minute I'm not sure he heard me\nBut if I woke up in his shoes tomorrow if you took my wallet away where everything I have been through I had no identity no I ... you know my driver's license was gone I didn't have a car and you just dumped me on the street I wouldn't be there long\nBecause they don't believe that about me and my future and I know if I Do this this and this that\nI'll be out and I work my way right out of it I don't I don't know how long will take but I Would get there I pushed my way through it and um and I haven't always been that way there's been times that I was so scared so beat up and so hopeless that I couldn't breathe and I couldn't see\nWhat I'm Talking about here is that is his vision site\nThat gives you hope when you lose your site when you can't see the other side of it\nThen then there's no you know that it's hard to take action it\nIt's hard to fix it and the problem is there's not a magic wand there is a series of things you've got to do a series of steps you got to take to become unstuck wherever it is you are stuck wherever it is I'm stuck\nI think that guy's got to be okay I really do I think he's going to be better off than he thinks he's going to be I think it's going to work out\nGreat book to read if you already called pizza tiger the guy that started um dominos pizza Monaghan came out of the army made some bad mistakes and ended up living in a homeless shelter\n\nAnd then he ends up owning dominos pizza\nSo it's going to be All right [noise]\nYeah it can be [noise]\nYou can choose for it to be\nAll right ... and it's not magic and it's not positive thinking and it's not easy [noise]\nIt's hard [noise]\nAnd and it's one of the reasons I read biographies of successful people is he lets me know that they went

I think it's somewhat of an American idiosyncrasies I think it's nice but I was just curious well\nOne of the reasons we love the Americans\nKnow [laughter] exactly [laughter] if you're ever feel the ... school of American radio station\n[laughter] if you're feeling vowed just going over the barricade review station exactly\nThe prime minister has written a book out this week right here right now he's one of the more storms full of people as I said in international politics so were you surprised that Donald Trump won why don't you feel on election day twenty sixteen us election day\nSo I tell people I was surprised I was less surprised than most I had\nConcluded mostly through what I had been told anecdotally by a large number of Canadians who have been going back and forth to us than my own experiences going back and forth that\nA lot of Canadians had been down there and the final weeks had told me they thought Donald Trump was going to win so I gave him a a low but nevertheless ... chance of winning\nUh so I was I I must admit I Would still a surprise but I was not shocked a as a shock to some observers not only were but still clearly are\nSo back to Canada is there a chance to conservatives can come back to power\nOh I think absolutely we've got a chance um\nYou know we've been uh at the polls go back and forth we've been uh you know within the margin of error and a lot of them um the the uh our fundraising is far exceeds the government's I think the issues are on our side of the bay area we face in Canada Dennis I don't mind telling you is that\nUm you know we have very little in the way of conventional conservative media television every network is MSNBC in Canada um is really amazing when you look at places like Ontario and Quebec if you were to see the election coverage especially in the province Ontario you would not imagine that concert party is going to get any votes at all\nAnd yet they won the election and want it handily so I'm a I'm optimistic but it's a book I leave a I leave the day to day have Canadian politics the my successor whose name is Andrew share and go I think will make a great and thoughtful and intelligent informed prime minister which really badly need\nI Want to underscore from our listeners what you just said because whenever I speak to consider conservatives in Europe\nThis comes up\nAnd sometimes they say if only we had a talk radio in Europe and why isn't there in Canada\nI think I Know the answer but I'd rather have you explain why isn't there something like talk radio and kind of\nTalk radio does exist in ...\nWell I mean conservative talk radio forgive me okay\nYeah no no ... ... talk radio does exist a dentist and conservative talk radio does exist it's just much smaller and unfortunately a lot of our best conservative talk radio host not all of them but a lot of our best ones are have been kind of at the stage where they're retiring in recent years\nBut look it's an area where there really is a deficiency\nGenerally and what's interesting a dentist about this is generally a conservative talk radio hosts will do well\nIn terms of audience likewise conservative media to the extent that exists generally find that audience because there's a lot of median conservatives who are craving outlets but the fact is that the dying media continues to cater to all cater to a left wing audience\nThere was a powerful you said earlier I did not pass over me at all all of our beauty or MSNBC I Hope my list school up that one that I look a well aware of that\nSo there is however I frequently read at the national post\nYeah yeah the national post um was founded as a Twenty years ago\nAs a more distinctly conservative newspaper and it has maintained a fairly conservative editorial line unfortunately a lot of its day to day reporting and columnists are simply not that bad and in terms of federal\nFederal politics ... which I I Would not today considered the national posed the conservative paper\nIn terms of its day to day coverage in federal politics but its editorial rely line remains relatively consider the more conservative papers are actually what's called the sun chain their tabloids but they are quite um quite consistently conservative\nSo where what an American goal for thoughtful Canadian conservative news coverage nowhere\nI it's tough yeah you have you know a while you have you have\nTo you have to look um you have to really find individual journalists um\nUm and and I would also say that you know that there's a huge market and particularly the phenomenon you have in the United states will pod cast um you know I think there's a big market candidate for that kind of thing to take off what as I said there is a\nYou know thirty percent of Canadians will always vote right of center at least thirty percent bottom as kind of the ... the low number\nAnd so that that audiences in my judgment if I were an entrepreneur and the media business I'd be trying to figure out how to get to that audience which for the most part has very little in the way of of outlet servicing them\nWhat about young people or let me put it let me actually before we get to the young people you said something that's very important to me that the polarization in the United states left and right doesn't exist in Canada\nIs that the caller lean to the same basic
