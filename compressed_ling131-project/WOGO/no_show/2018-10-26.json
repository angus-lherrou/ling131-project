to five five two to five triple eight eight to five five two to five is the number would love to have you on we started off with Caitlin\nTwo to five is the number would love to have you\nOn we started off with Caitlin who's on the line in Charlotte Caitlin how can I\nCan um I I started my own business for\nChildren and I guess I Am I'm ... and I know I Want to do something on or near um but I didn't have to figure out what that is I Want to do you mean something I'm Talking about\nAnd I have that in ... here helping that sounded as I went out of it related to your heart but I haven't come up with anything in Kashmir and is currently trying helping you might need 'em out [laughter] okay\nWell that's very interesting so obviously you love cars is that right is that what I'm getting out of this can you tell me about that what specifically do you love about cars\n[noise] I I um I mean one can drive down by all can get\nI think that there are unique in a way that they're um designed and built and trying to gather 'em I enjoy feeling different one ... um you're kind of got learning more about that and\nHer ... okay so the ideas you thought if I go sell cars I'm going to come up with an idea for a business to do with cars and you have yet to come up with that inspiration so let's let's look at what you enjoy doing besides cars what kind of work\nA function task do you find yourself really enjoying\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] maybe I mean how can people see I don't know I get the LA but but I what I Want to\nDo is find a pattern here I Want to see a threat if you will uh so you're you're thinking too hard I Want you to just reveal rattle off when you had your own business you're very entrepreneurial what are those functions in a day\nOr what are the roles that you have played thus far you're only twenty three but what do you enjoy what what's functions do you enjoy there's something that gives you a burst of energy when you're engaged in what is it\n\n... up All right let's go another direction I'm going to show you how you do this let's talk about what you do best this is what people compliments you on\nCan a thank you for taking my call so I'm about five years and she my career field and I cheat and cyber security and um\nI currently make a hundred and five thousand a year I'm I've completed all of these baby stops I don't have a wife or a cat and\nAh and then they have all yes I've been given an opportunity to take a job that is less stable\nThan a full time and it pays a approximately three hundred thousand a year cyber care to control thing and uh I've I've been raised with\nYou know try to keep a stable job um you know you'd be on five days a week and make sure you know you get your paycheck and um but\nI I think sometime pretty young and I don't really have you know I Do not support a family or anything I was just curious what your thoughts were on a either staying at my job or taken this position\nWell let's start with how excited are you forget the stability issue which I'll get to momentarily how excited are you about this opportunity\nIt it's pretty awesome on the field itself I I enjoy doing it um I don't consider going to a job but like a chore or anything like that I I and I enjoy it so yeah OK opportunity here to take the other one is pretty exciting\nYeah okay that's great that's that's one question the other question is when you say stability you said you're going to make three hundred thousand dollars that's a massive that's over half\nOkay two times what you're making OK so where's the stability she meaning that you're not going to have normal hours but you're still going to make three hundred K. that I understand you correctly\nYeah so um I I ... I basically work it out for like a twenty hour work week and I multiply that by the hourly rate so and consulting so I you know I can have worked for three weeks and then I can be I'll have no work for you know months on end\nYeah but you're going to make three hundred K. that's pretty clear correct\nAlthough that's given if I get twenty or twenty hours a week okay got it on the earth All right\nBut is there some question as to whether or not that's going to be consistent is that a moderate goal or can a conservative goal or an aggressive goal the twenty hours a week\nOr not that's pretty moderate um kept I I've spoken with some of the other people that work in my position and um and they they say that that's about average um yeah OK yet but they may have some months or they they get a paycheck and\nBut ... this is a no brainer because you're completely debt free you've already gone all the way through baby step seven you have no wife and kids I mean you're in great shape to take this opportunity and here's ...\nYou have no wife and kids I mean you're in great shape\nTo take this opportunity and and here's the other thing you've probably planned for it what is your uh three to six month emergency fund look like how big is\nIt an empowering\nYeah I mean juice out a little bit how long would it take you to get up to thirty or fifty you know uh what\nWhat are our position\nYeah or just in this new position because you're in such good because you're such good shape you you know just taking a new position you can stack up some money and take you know my point is is let's say you're gonna miss new role which you really want to take and I'm telling you to take it\nBut let's say your gut feeling that the first three much live on way less you already can anyway so the new job is actually going to allow you to maybe put six months away\nSo you got no risk at all because you can jump back in the cyber security I think it's a no brainer I think you're over thinking it because it's not the forty hour week buddy you did all the hard work to get to the point where you can take a job like this you don't have to work forty hours a week\n[laughter] you got me yeah\nSo I may be uh celebrate tonight my goodness don't overseeing this I mean half of half of the ... love to be worked ... right now [laughter] I mean buddy this is the kind of smart risk you know because you put yourself in a great financial situation to be able to go after this there's really hardly any risk at all um\nMan and and here's the deal you're saying that you all you have to do is get twenty hours a week\nAnd that would put your three hundred K. if you only do ten you're still going to be making about the same it's not even a little bit more of course you'll be making more so again go go go oh that is fun stuff triple eight eight to five five two to five just as a career seem out on the day Ramsey show I'm Ken Coleman city in for day to go to Rachel is on line and Madison, Wisconsin right talking about\nHow campaigns like hockey nature I'm I'm twenty four years old and right here and we're working in the legal industry and I know lawyer my role and they're catching

interviewed your co workers and your leaders what would they told me that Rachel does very well right now go\nUm I Would have found it on and ... and then\nProbably our collaboration or one of my big wrong very big jogger could trigger out on who's doing what program and then on the other side of a national and who is doing something similar and then kind of match them together and figure out how to get the borrowing and vulture action\nYeah uh everybody in America as well so that going wow that is extremely valuable who doesn't want somebody you can do that [laughter] pick the industry I mean think about how valuable you are and again I Want to remind you something Rachel I told my audience this almost on a daily basis here's where we sit right now in two thousand eighty\nSeven million jobs available in the United states seven million\nIt's historically there are more jobs available than there are people who are unemployed and you just told me you're really great at systems and

common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have to be intentional with every decision you make\nAs an example if you're a business owner and needing to hire a new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full of resumes that aren't right for the position you're hiring the smart thing to do is to go to zip recruiter dog ... have to hire the right person zip recruiter doesn't depend on candidates finding new\nIt finds them for you it's powerful\nMatching technologies scams thousands of resumes

who else do I need to ... do you have any relationships you know of any open jobs this is a very simple conversation it's going to yield something positive\nAnd so this is proximity and didn't even if there's not a fulltime job available ... and this is the this is the part that I Want people to get that are in your similar situation let's say you do all of that and there's not a position that is right for you at the time\nIt doesn't mean you throw your hands in the air and take your ball and go home what it means is you say All right I'm going to practice proximity in a in a non paid situation so I'm going to go volunteer or or I'm going to say can I just shadow you for a day\nI'm going to get in places where some type of audio video production is happening and when you get in those places you will continue to meet new people\nIn those new people will help you get in the right places are going to open up the doors for you so you're on the right track the first step is just talking to your body that's just the first step and that's how you ... practice proximity is people in places\nSo again folks if you're in a similar situation let's apply Nelson situation to you he needs to simply asked today and then start to ride it out and find the answers when he goes and looks on line or wherever and he makes a list who are the people that are doing audio video production in my area\nWhere the places what companies are doing this and that's what he's looking to connect to it's not difficult it's going to take some intention alley and some hustle that's all it takes

all you do thank you so I'm I'm looking at it I I I'm kind of continues you know what I'm Wondering if if what I got as a hobby\nOr district career so just a little bit of a back story that's a good paying job that extra benefit to pursue at that with my action I take about ... percent pay cut to make the switch\nAnd and I went to this new profession you know I'm I'm quickly right in that I don't know could write a faith I mean I think I might have jumped the gun I just want to get in fact I mean\nWell tell me what the profession is that you just jumped to\nFinancial diving what is it a financial diving\nOkay so you jumped into financial devising specifically what are you doing day to day give me the quick rundown\nA day to\nDay ah basically just knock out those stores ... who I Am what I Do and you know trying to get them to show that I can help them with a retirement plan and education\nSo are you working for a local firmer geo open up your own shop\nNo it's it's a it's a national phone\nOkay so they're not providing any leads it's all on you to go out and knock on doors like you're doing\nExactly they provide zero lead\nOkay why did you jumped into that I mean I I think there's a question you may have jumped too soon 'cause in playing financially but your question was is this hobby level you know is this the right thing for me and and and I you know there's a little bit more to it than that I think I have a hunch on it but quickly\nWhy did you jump for this why financial\nPlanning\nSo you know the life of the day for the last ten years crowded and you know

did when we were looking at things like that was we would if we found one thing like that that we were going to not cut to hit our debt free go we had to find something else where we're going to cut deeper\nOkay so like that means that if you are going to cheat and go out to eat once a month now you're not\nOr the if you thought you were going to do X now you're not and it's hot chocolate instead we're doing select soccer um and\nYou're not an inside jak instead we're doing select soccer um and how many kids do you have three okay and is he the oldest or the youngest or he sold the oldest okay\nAll right and um well I mean you get yourself out of debt and the other kids as they come up and do you can do whatever you want to do with them in terms of uh you know activities in sports and stuff you can afford to do all of that the\nThing that we decided was that all of this is for fun\nBecause um I mean Daniel my son played ice hockey all the way up through high school we knew at six years old he was not going to play in the journal right we we're pretty sure at that point you know and uh so we made decisions to invest in ice hockey to have fun\nRight not because we were trying to create a future career for him rain and that's\nWhy we went with the ... there are a couple of different options and the one we put ... minutes left and a half the cost of the others yeah\nYou know and you know so parents go bananas on the stuff is my point and uh some of 'em you know they spend ten thousand bucks on whatever and you know in a sport that the kid is never going to go pro probably not even going to get a scholarship\nBrain and all your donors burn up the kid and a half your budget but seven hundred and fifty bucks is not the case that you're fine you know you just got to be but you do need to get what it does is it makes you stop and pause enough you called me that's pretty cool\nYeah he paused and he went crap I can think about this and so you know just try to find you a trade off to innocence pay for it\nMom I moved in with us [noise] so um she couldn't make it on her own so we just kind of combine our income um our monthly income with three of us combined is thirty four hundred and forty two dollars\nI've done the everyday dollar budget and we're like forty seven dollars I'm not over budget as things stand now\nUm\nWe had back in January we had some identity theft going on in our account and that it is almost twelve to Fifteen hundred dollars in a row\nThat the bank to far overdraft this to so that good\nI mean why why did the bank charge you\nAnything if there was a deputy sheriff\nAnd be well it was a thing that was charged to our account\nI Know but if it's identity theft of banks shouldn't be charging you anything\nWell they did and they said there was nothing they can do about it\nA rock and change banks\nYeah we did okay wait we actually closed banking and we just have a debit card debt I'm just like one of those little Walmart orange you know so we don't even go through the banks anymore it's just a debit card but um they charge us\nLike nearby six hundred dollars and overdraft mhm and they wouldn't take them back mhm mhm\nBut I'm here in that time because that was going on a weekend behind\nOn our house payment and I'm ... thanks for the smaller than we had well without the smaller nice but we're still have a hand on our house I've got to the house and loan people and they're working with us\nBut we're having to pay extra amount on our mortgage payment\nSure how old are you guys\nFifty nine so I'm fifty nine and a thick the mom Seventy nine so\nAre you guys on some kind of a fixed income for some reason\nYes it's a disability out three of it and none of you were able to work you know I Do a little side business with crafts and things like that\nWhat is the nature of your disability\nUm is a hip displacement what's wrong with him um he had um a as a and broke his back uh-huh and he has a um\nA sense the bone and close to his nerves back mhm then he also had a triple bypass surgery a few years ago when he had the defending later and mhm so he's got like twenty five percent of his heart beating so\nMhm okay um\nWell what what you guys have more than anything else is an income crush right due to the fixed income and that's why I was exploring the question that does sound like you've got some pretty serious limitations um but what I'm going to do if I'm In your shoes and what you've kind of started doing there with the crowd\nAnd even in his shoes are obviously none of you all are going to be involved in physical labor of any kind right on crime but if there was something that you could\nDo like I talked to a lady the other day who was just going to garage sales and she was buying clothing for a quarter and a nickel showing it on ... for a dollar and two dollars and she had done that like ten thousand times are made like ten thousand dollars\nMhm okay\nAnd that doesn't involve any heavy lifting obviously involve the keystrokes on the computer to set up an ... account and shelves\nThe lifting obviously it involves a keystrokes on the computer to set up an ... account and sell some stuff on ... but I'm not saying that's what you do I'm just saying that something like that that is\nThat that that is in the line with the limitations that you guys have because if we can add a thousand dollars a month only your world it would change your life\nWouldn't it it will be dramatic and how old is mom Seventy nine\nAnd how much of this thirty four forty two comes from her\nEleven forty seven yeah she passes away you don't got a real problem\nSo we've got to solve some of the income issue one way or another here um and how much is your house payment\nI'm Seventy eight and I think right\nNow but that's that's that's just your taxes and insurance going\nUp ... uh-huh yeah OK and what's the home worth\nIt for a ride out of hundreds and hundreds of ... way only I only\nWant to go to you know I sure would be good when you know\nSo I think more than anything the the the magic wand here is some kind of an idea\nFor you to create some income and I don't know what that is but I Want the three of you to sit around and talk about what you could do a ... you're obviously not going to do anything this physical I get that you got some serious limitations\nI understand that and I'm not picking on you know I'm just trying to help you uh but it man a thousand dollars a month would change your whole life\nThousand dollars a month for a year and you pay that house off\nAnd that'd be rid of that payment and then when mom passes you're not in a problem and right now you being a serious problem two thousand dollars a month income change\nYou feel like you were rich like you were multi millionaires or something it would change your life that much\nAnd so and is that possible yes that is possible it's very possible but you need some income ideas some things you can do jump and it's probably something you jump on the computer and sell something or\nWhatever and again it doesn't I don't want to put a bunch of strain on you physically but um you know I'm having an intelligent conversation where the over the phone so you can have an intelligent conversation was on my own sell them something\nRight and that that's possible thing you can do um the you know and it doesn't cause you to\nWork forty hours a week necessarily but if you could do anything that creates a thousand dollars a month it would change your world and that's that's really what I Would work on rather than try to solve the forty seven dollar problem\nThat you've got what that is a symptomatic of the fact that you're struggling with income and legitimately ... you're struggling it's my pleasure lazy or something like that but it just hand\nIf you could come up with any kind of a small business idea that your husband than you could do together um and just get them to get the needle to move a little bit here\nMan it would change everything for you I thank you for the call open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Benjamin is in Oklahoma City Hi Benjamin how are you\nAt Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so my wife and I graduated college about a little over a year ago and we got a good job good and bought a house good and I'm Wondering in your eyes are definitely getting on to what are we paid it off about half the boy and I'm\nWondering in your eyes or your parents\nOr a from a financial perspective is a good time to start thinking about having kids 'cause she likes getting kind of pushy and that it I'm sure mhm ah so I just wanted to get your thoughts on it\nNow I was actually the one on a kids' faster than sharing a shot of several she won but I'm\nA I I don't think that there's a financial manager other than just being completely crazy like if you don't want to sixteen kids if you're broke that stupid okay that was crazy but you guys are in great shape your sharp young couple whenever you're ... whenever you're emotionally in relation to ready to have kids in God's says is okay to have kids\nGo have kids I I don't I don't tell people they need to be out of debt and have their emergency when there's not a baby step for kids\nUm you know you don't have to be in a certain place you're going to be fine a child is not to destroy your life financially or as a matter of fact you probably won't even hardly notice\nEverybody talks about oh children ... five hundred and sixty two thousand dollars to raise you out really not really they eat the same broccoli you eat after a certain point\nThere in the same warm house you're already in after a certain point and so the actual cost of a kid is just not\nThat it's not devastating\nBut again you don't want to just load up a whole house full of them if you're broke and that that will cause a problem but to decide to have your first couple of children\nI mean it's that's not something that's between you and God and your wife and you guys are in good shape financially smart you're already moving in the right direction you want to start now it doesn't bother me at all this is the day Ramsey show\nDid you know that if you combined the data breaches that have occurred in the past twelve months almost every American has had their personal

Single man so\nOh I thought you said your babies\nI Do a little slap over there but are you going to have you had a child I Love my kids to death so bad I mean the mother aren't together\nThey're all okay All right and so are you paying child support on kids more than what\nI mean do you know I'm not that I'm as they\nAre through the court system and you know fifty fifty it's all even but it's pretty good so\nOkay so you have joint custody correct and that that keeps the the the child support also deal OK and that'll be true of the new baby as well yes okay so this is your second child or a third show\nA second and how old are you\nOh I'm twenty five years old\nOkay All right I'm buying a house was not a bad thing or your first goal is you know when you're working on it is to get clear the death the second goal is to have your emergency fund of three to six months of expenses\nAnd then yeah and then above that you save your down payment and uh we always recommend you put enough down and you buy a home that you can do on a Fifteen year fixed rate and where the payment is no more than a force of your take home pay\nNow my guess is that is going to be pretty limiting on the house that you buy with your income\nYeah it's a hobby I guess I get paid you know it's hard to ever having a ... every other week and my take on you know without overtime or anything like that around eight hundred bucks or so [noise]\nUm for a week or a burial only watch them\nOn yeah so about sixteen hundred a ... right\nYeah and I have a I have actually I have a I matched uh their retirement Hyman

the big examples biggest constant examples is that she said that Santa Claus is white\n\nNow let me say for the record that I Love seeing black Santa clauses and Asian Santa Claus is I Love it I think it I think that is truly the spirit of Christmas\nTo see a the idea of that Santa Claus can only be wiped out would be that would be racist I think what\nIs Santa Claus the ... the legend of Santa Claus coming from Europe\nAnd coming and and the\nYou know for kids another disease from the north pole the people in the north well I guess really north I guess you might be a more of a nobody think of it am Eskimo\nBut anyway it's an it's an odd charge that if if if you hang your hat on she said Santa Claus is white\n\nOr it doesn't strike me that that is evidence that the person thinks that blacks should be mistreated\nOr is it they are inherently inferior in some way I but tell me I'm very I really am curious 'cause I I'm not I'm not up on my triggers here\n\nNow that's an interesting
