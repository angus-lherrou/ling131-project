five five two to five\nJordan is in Indianapolis Hi Jordan welcome to the day Ramsey show hey how's it going better than I deserve what's up\nSo I the last week I completed my free during your by over four years out of her four thousand a hundred and Seventy five dollars\nAnd um well I'm trying to figure out now in terms of buying a house what is the best way to kind of saying I'm going to accept and thinking about just pocketing the money but also invest them to maybe get a better rate of return by doing that way what what are your thoughts on that\nRight job great job so I'm not sure you're going to say\nThat way what what are your thoughts on that\nRight job great job much are you going to say\nWell as of right now my monthly expenses are only about eleven hundred show out of my salary try to say about twenty two twenty three hundred and if I really buckle down about twenty six hundred\nA month correct for how long will depend on the at the house I'm looking at like a twenty percent on a down payment on a hundred and fifty probably about at least\nTen months there minimum that play around fifty percent if I did a year should be able to get that if you include bonuses in tax return and such\nOkay well twelve months will be thirty thousand bucks and if you invested started ... years what you're doing it today but if you were an investor thirty thousand dollars and it made ten percent in one year you would make three thousand dollars correct\nOkay I'm now we don't have to ... already thousand dollar so it's like over the course of that year you'd have more like an average or Fifteen thousand dollars invested\nAnd so if you make ... percent you'd make about Fifteen hundred dollars [noise] okay and so if you have thirty thousand dollars at the end of one year to put down on a house or you have thirty one thousand five hundred dollars to put down on the house doesn't matter much\nFall um Iraq the point as independent as huge saving money on the short term as aggressively as you have the ability to save money um is the secret sauce not the investment\n\nBroker during this year Jordan is worth thirty grand mutual fund Fifteen hundred Jordan is the answer to our equation\nOkay that makes sense yes or no\nUterus to your budget saved an extra hundred bucks a month you would have made more doing that then you would have on the investment\nYeah so you are the secret sauce do\nYou figure that out now when you start investing over the long term we're talking about twenty or investment to thirty or investment whether you Ross IRA mutual funds for your kid's college or something like that where you got Twenty years that's when the right of return it starts to be very very important but where are you a short window like this\nMedical school good law most

okay so you're you're you don't get to live like a doctor because you're a broke Dr yeah you're going to live like a college student okay help you out and start buying crap\nCan't answer that have you started buying crap bought bought one thing if one what the car what'd you buy\nA A R I got yeah yeah uh now do you know what'd you pay for about a thousand okay\nYou're a three hundred and eighty thousand dollars and you can never do that again\nI don't plan to\nCan never do anything like that again you're not going on vacation you're not buying a house you're a broke doctor\nHere's the thing you have this absolutely fabulous income and you are going to destroy your wealth building ability with that income if you don't clears that up and treat it like it's cancer or going to hit it with chemo and everything we got\nAnd show that I Am not a band aid off slowly guy that crap does not work and so what I Would do if I woke up in your shoes I Would live on fifty thousand dollars a year or less\nWhich would make me debt free in under three years\nOkay and then I Would start my life the great news is you have the ability to delay pleasure for a greater outcome we know that because you have gone to school your whole freaking life ... and you're very smart academically\nOr you wouldn't be where you are okay you have the\nMark academically or you wouldn't be where you are\nOkay you have the ability to delay pleasure which is a sign of emotional maturity and you have a great intellect let you use those two things and apply them to this mess that you are in called deeply in debt now you can do it the other way but I'll tell you that\nYour colleagues are walking around out there with three hundred four hundred two hundred thousand dollars worth of medical school debt for a decade because they play with it and they never kill the disease\nThe only way you kill it is extreme treatment\nRadical and that's the only way it goes away it's going to stay with you forever otherwise\nSo that's what I Would do if I woke up in your shoes I Would treat it like I Am I broke doctor because I'm a broke doctor and broke doctors don't by fifty thousand dollar cars are going to develop vacations\nSo you're not doing that crap anymore you get on a tight budget beans and rice rice and beans and clean up this mess 'cause if you take the three year old older than you are now you and go forward with a three or four hundred thousand lower income and no debt you're going to be so wealthy it's going to be blinding\nIf you watch what you're doing\nBut if you just screw around with this thing and keep it like it's a pet it's going to be a problem for you Laurie is with us in Boise idaho Hi Laurie how are you\nGay and taking my call\nSure what's up\nI'm at a plant where I could be giving and you can't fight now ladder and my mom has been ...\nAnd I moved here at the town of and if she is very very small ram and a large one man and I was wondering when that he had heard of him\nTo help get her ... her hair my path that ran and help pay for her ...\nTrue unless somebody giving 'em would it be typing no but it would be giving yes um I don't I mean I don't know what you mean by giving but um you have the money to do this or you broke or what\nYou know I happen many pecan okay and you're you're out of debt yeah\nOkay and you have or how much money in your nest egg\nThree hundred and how old are you having good very good okay what's your income about Ninety thousand to your single\n... single and what are you talking about spending it will cost me about a thousand dollars a month\nOkay for twelve ran out of Ninety and you can keep saving doing that 'cause you don't have any that you can keep investing so you retire with dignity and you can take care of yourself\nWhen you're in the exact same situation later right that's what I Want to be on the Cape you where you don't put yourself exposed to the elements so to speak by helping someone else but I think it's wonderful you have the money you've done a great job you're out of debt and you're in a position you want to give twelve thousand dollars a year towards your mom\nSure no problem with that OK absolutely what do they\nWant to be the right thing in the end it like you said about giving it was I just wanted to make sure I was going to write and found\nI think you are just wonderful gift and uh your your time to her and you know what a wonderful\nYou know act of love towards your mom and and and again you put yourself in a position you have the money to do that without bringing harm to yourself and that's that's what we're talking about live like no one else so later you can live ...\n... it was very very cool Tony is with us Tony is in a Washington Hi Tony how are you\nI'm well how can I help\nI was curious why you advocate a money market accounts are low yield accounts for like are murky coupon\nBecause your emergency phone is not an investment it's insurance okay it's there the principal has to be there and accessible and liquid\nBecause if you're transmission goes out or you lose your job you get your hands on it\nThe right of return is irrelevant it's insurance they protects the things that does make you money\nTo see what happens is people don't have an emergency fund act accessible and they got to shut up in something where they get penalized if it comes out as a liquid and then they they have an emergency you know what they do the bar owner four one K. long\nWas like a four one K. lowering the bar all goes for for one kind of the cash it out worse yet and they create a mess\nBecause they got to do that to save their house 'cause they didn't have money there was a liquid they got stuck because there were all worried about trying to make an extra point or two on the money instead of Kurt creating get insurance insurance is ... is an expense\nMoney tied up at one percent you would agree is an expense 'cause it sucks it's a horrible right of return\nIt could be invested in making more\nBut that portion that five or ten or twenty thousand dollars or whatever it is is just sitting there just as a barrier\nBetween you and the life\nAnd that's all it's for it's not an investment it's insurance investments make money insurance costs you money to protect the things that make you money and this is insurance some good question though
