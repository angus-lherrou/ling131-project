AAA eight to five five two to five is the phone numbers that is how it started to take the step today triple eight eight to five five two to five let's go to Eric who's on the line and Kansas City Eric how can we help\n[noise] hey how's it going good how are you sir\nGood um so I have two options I'm a registered nurse and I'm not going to grad school either nurse practitioner scores see aren't a school we owe a hundred K. honor housework is free otherwise um we have a four month old and we're looking at having a second baby in the next year\nI'm In the school like a cash flow and worked full time through the school would be a little bit longer it's about a five year program in totality a which is a prerequisite and and I could not work two to three years\nAnd the dead of that would be Ninety thousand dollars at the end of it\nAnd so I mean the payouts are different obviously in ... make a hundred K. give or take a journeys make fifty one Seventy five\nWhich do you really want if all those money things weren't an issue and you had the responsibility of a wife and the children in the house and all that which one would you want if you could snap your fingers\n[noise] [laughter] it's hard for me to personally answer just because there's the managers and disadvantages to um I don't think I Would take away a yarn anymore right okay but I mean I Would be happy as empty as well\nOkay so the question becomes a can you take that next step uh what do you call it in the ...\nNurse practitioner\nOkay ill okay in ... and so if you do that can you over time work your way into the other role\nNot without going back to that through your program enjoy fame prerequisites\nLight but my point is let's say you're in ... for five to seven years you've got no debt you may even pay your house off in that time and so you cash flow your way through that as you move up the ladder how old are you\nTwenty nine yeah\nI just wonder can you do it just logistically can you do if you go into the in the situation you're going to casual that so no additional debt can you overtime save enough money to casual your way through that ultimate role\n\nI'm really know what are you making now the\nOkay so you'd have a forty grand bump basically a year with that and how much does that skull caustic and he said that you the cash flow\nOr that one would be forty K total and the other one is nine thousand yeah\nCorrect oh you could do it just for a bumper salary honestly and go and do that is forty can invest that but you're gonna make forty came back in a year the Atkins right if you do that I Know ... and then go back to school yeah you may not be able to do than the other school right now like you said that you don't the cash for it so now don't go into student loan debt for that\nBut go ahead and go through the school get an upgraded job upgrade basically and you enjoy other woman in a sense that's for an increase of anytime that leaf\nAnd yeah and then move into the school and a few years and ...\nYou know that ... I just want you to have that idea in your head I think well you pause you're sitting there trying to run the numbers and I think what I'm trying to do is make sure that you see that there's a ladder to that ultimate goal might it take you seven or eight years yes but guess what eight years maggots thirty seven [noise] you can\nCash flow your way so I think it's both fans that's what I say because both of them are what you want to do both of them or something that you're good at\nArt folks more of your calls about your life your career your money you're on the day ran to show don't go anywhere [noise]\nAre you one of the millions of empty nesters are look around their house and just see unused space it might be time to downsize but when you raised a family and I have a lot of emotion is tied to your home it can be tough to separate the facts\nFrom the feelings and that's where an experts advise comes in handy Anna in Portland, Oregon knew she needed a real estate agents help when she decided to sell\nI had lived in my own for twenty five years and it was overwhelming to think where again your E. L. P. helped me determine everything that needed to be done and was patient and put things into perspective with is help we at twenty beards in\nThree days folks there is no simple formula for determining when to sell your house\nBut partnering with the pro you can trust to provide honest advice will help you do what's best for you and your budget our real estate EL bees are great agents who can guide you in the direction that is right for you\nAnd the plant or because I think you can be a financial planner and make that money a lot faster and it's still a coach me Dave says all the time\nWe go sit down with Jeff do bonds and his team that's that's our one of our local guys if I sit down with Jeff and I we want to know these got the heart of a teacher all that's on Yahoo right so I Do think you got to do some specific research there Chris to be able to determine what does it look like day to day what do I want to be doing day to day that fulfills me\nAnd and at twenty eight yeah plenty of time to get there are but in the meantime while you're pursuing the plan I Can't say this enough\nYou're not being dishonest you're not being a ... in the current job so let go of some of that guilt um and and then I think you're going to be fine I just would not let that way on you\nTriple eight eight to five five two to five is the number Ken Coleman Rachel crew sitting in for Dave Ramsey this hour let's go to Kimberly who's on the line and nodding home Pennsylvania Kimberley how can we do\n[noise] I can um I Am fifty five years old I had been teaching in public school and the health care for 'em Thirty years\nOn and I just found in the last few years that on\nA concrete or something else I'm On the back of last year really then I'm drawn to real estate I looked into it um yeah I can collect my retirement um retire with a little bit of a penalty\nOn as opposed to going all thirty five years my only on\nA challenge or block is convincing my hunch is that a good idea\nBecause you have a different than here I was about twenty five thousand dollars in salary but I Know that I can\nMake that um I I really get excited thinking on helping people find homes and property and on I find that really interesting okay what I Love my teacher in Concord\nI get it I got good news I got good news for you and your husband okay [laughter] so for you to become a realtor successful realtor it's going to take you a little bit of time\nAnd I think the fact that you just reveal to us and our audience that you're still enjoy teaching there is no big hurry you're not calling in a completely burned out and so I Would not take the penalty either I how many more years just for fun real quick how many more years would you have to stay in the role\nOf teacher before he retired without penalty\nFor five years\nOkay I just want to throw scenario of what is over the next five years you built your real estate business showing homes at night and on the weekends\nI think that's extremely doable anybody that's ever been successful in real real estate knows you're going to build a pipeline your husband's only real concern sounds like to me rituals that he doesn't want you to lose that twenty five thousand dollars that's a that's a scary thing certainly your age\nWhat if you kept the teacher salary for maybe three years still take a little bit of penalty but I'd like to see you go all the way build that real estate business\nOver five year period is going to be here before you know it you step into retirement full benefits and by that time you should have easily replaced if not\nMaybe another extra you know twenty five thirty percent above and beyond what you make you I think you can just absolutely double your income while still being a teacher I think that's the thing that I'd want you to consider Rachel\nWhile they're saying that great situation to be an because real estate usually agents show how this when people aren't working for that means it is night than it is we get that thought what the busiest time and it's how\nTo say hey I'm going to commit for maybe when you and your husband and decide that a year two years three years old can even go to five years if you can whatever it is that we're in commit the amount of time and if you start to see yourself like well I'm really good at it 'cause you sound very enthusiastic about it you sound like a people person which means you're gonna be a great residents in Asia because most people do great when they\nHave great people ... sounds like you to get really so\nEven though you're enthusiastic you still may not be great at it you can kind of get some things on your belt while you're learning for again a year or two\nMaybe three years whatever your husband decide\nAh and it kind of step into it yeah I wouldn't go cold turkey by any means but I think that this could be excellent because having a great real estate agent ... that are I think about it is it still commission base that you get to decide what you make basically like how much you work how many have you sell super fun versus going from where he learned that salary as a teacher\nTo do something like that can be very incredible for you personally and you may find that you're really good at it and maybe in a year inside\nThe church and I think once you show the hubby replaces the twenty five right I Want to

years old no question so [laughter] habilis automobile really is a it typically is going to be a car though by someone who has a um a really really good income and the Fifteen hundred dollars\nTo keep it running every year is a minor part of their world instead of like a hundred percent of your income you know it's a Fifteen hundred ... is a big part of your world a year it's not a hundred percent of your income but I mean it's a big part of your world is sixteen years old and a you know I'm more concerned about that on doing maintenance cost of this thing that I Am an actual purchased\nUm well I I I did the math and I make about [noise] uh you know Eighteen thousand a year and now that really doesn't change it they ... the yeah\nIt doesn't change and I mean a Fifteen hundred dollar maintenance fee for you know to keep a car running and that's if everything goes pretty good you can drop five grand and it pretty quick on the beamer\nAnd again the car you're talking about a beast of a car it's a wonderful Laura my car guy I get why you'd want it the ... and if you wanna spend Fifteen dollars on car and you worked and saved up Fifteen thousand dollars and you do it I\nYou know I might say well might spend tan and keep vibe in the bank that kind of runs through my head but uh but aside from that that doesn't bother me near as much as you're signing up for\nA problem child as far as maintenance guy which I mean that's what you're signing up for that bothers me so as long as you know what you're getting into and you're willing to take it on a but you may look up one day and go I Wish I had known this car and which time you sell the car\nA divorce and a bankruptcy so um we are ... dollars in debt and last year remain thirty five pounds of them are dead breaks down to twenty five and car penance tune known and Fifteen and credit card and I'm just not sure where to go [laughter]\nOkay and um [noise] so ah what do you make\nRight now I Am not working I recently moved back ah with family\nSo you're separated [noise] okay and family is in Los Angeles yeah okay and\nUm do you have children now so I'm I'm guessing based on that separation that the divorce rate is going ahead or not\nTo say it will be okay right\nWell whether you agree on filing for bankruptcy or not is irrelevant um he decides what he's going to do and you decide what you're going to do if you're not married\nAnd even if you are married technically because you don't file bankruptcy as a married couple um in other words when I filed I could have filed insurance not filed except that she had sons from the papers or she got the file to [noise] but um and we had to follow him all the different corporations mellow sees that we had at the time that was Thirty years ago\nUm show or in this case he could file and you not file\nThat's possible whose whose name is the student loan in\nMine okay so that doesn't affect him anymore\nThat's your during one either way whose name or the credit cards and all her evenly are all our you're both on all of them were both on all of them okay\nWere he to file and you not to file you would be left last man standing and get to pay them\nOkay okay that's how that would work whose name was the car in Baltimore who's got the car\nThey're two different cars and we're both on them and he has run an eye on the other\nOh it's so twenty five is cars and where the breakdown of the twenty five work it out for me\nAh Fifteen in ten\nOr ... okay okay the rule on a an asset that has um\n... that has a leaning against it is this you cannot get rid of the debt and keep the asset\nOkay so you could you could or he could file bankruptcy and you can clear off the credit card debt student loan debt is not bankrupt the ball it's not going away you've got your student loan back that's done okay the cars then you cannot keep the car unless you keep the bat\nYou can ... from the debt\nOkay you're following me but the only way you keep the car and so some people don't understand bankruptcy and they think oh I can just get rid of the debt and the ... in the corner of the debt off and they give me the car free and clear no that's not how it works is why they lean on the car\nOkay so they either get the car and wipe off whatever difference there is or was a I'm\nA ... or in the event of a bankruptcy you resign for the whole debt and you keep the guard show which of the cars is yours the Fifteen of the town\nFifteen okay and what does that car worse do you have an idea I'd say about ten okay All right\nSo you've got the ten thousand dollars in student loan debt you're going to get\nTen okay All right and so you've got the ten thousand dollars in student loan that you're going to get that either way no matter what happens here the Fifteen thousand dollars in credit card debt you understand if he files and you don't you've got that\nAnd then they got the other car now in the event of a divorced what I Would demand is that if he's going to keep a car that he refinancing and get your name off of it\nOr if he's filing bankruptcy um I guess he turns it in in the bankruptcy or gives it to you to sell or whatever the car that he's driving is it worth at least what's vote on it\nSay about that okay so you could just sell that car and break even but I you know if you can work that out in this deal so this is a mess is what it is and you already knew that okay so the scenarios are\nThat um you know what will you be making what kind of an income do you think you'll land into\nUm I'm In veterinary medicine so I Would say about Thirteen an hour and working full time\nAre you a D.
