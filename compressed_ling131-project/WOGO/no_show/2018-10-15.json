I think of a Home Depot credit card mhm and my mom and I don't remember\nOkay here's for I start um I I start with the premise\nThat somewhere down inside of you all but it's not there all the time my premises is the shortest way to become wealthy is to have no payments\nAnd use your assets and your income to invest and grow things that have no payments I'm In the show the shortest way is not to borrow because if the shortest way was to borrow you'd go to this deal like Tom's ten you do ten more of these right\nAnd what we've only got about ... who I think a lot to do because we have our mortgage oil three rental property but we\nAre mortgages on and and the two and a half years we've had a little graduate high school either college ... about how the today show he's taking out loans other half and\nI stopped contributing to a four one K. and if I got a beginner babies to say but I just feel like I I'm not sure what to do next I feel like I'm doing everything I could do for my family right now\nWhat's your household income about a hundred thousand okay show can the two of you you and him a cash flow the school and stop the studios\nBut if we don't if we're not as aggressive on these federal property as we in the past couple of years okay if you um\nI mean it it's a matter of choice for you I I personally wouldn't put my kid into that I Would rather get them through school debt free and then work on the Reynolds is there are ways in plan doesn't sound good\nNo it it does but I just I guess I just needed to hear a because he's got two younger brothers that are going to be going to college to hear the next two years old yeah\nWell ... maybe stumps four or five and six are simultaneous for is Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement five is kids college which you are cash flowing in this case\nAnd a six is payoffs mortgages how rentals in the house and so forth but really um you know in your case you're going to really is you're going to lay working on six much in order to fund these colleges or in a sense you're borrowing on student loan debt to pay on your mortgage is\nYeah which is in an indirect way that's what's occurring you follow me\nSo I think for all of our Confederate that we should just have a a a a three maybe four month emerged to find them then yeah\nAnd then and then let's let them stop taking out student loans and clear 'em out and then do the same with the other two and then but if you can find cash flow above\nTaking care of these college issues between the three kids if there's money above that then we start throwing it at your either your mortgage or your rentals\nOne of the two but it sounds like a rentals are tiny\nThey're not you know there are about sixty Seventy thousand dollars apiece they're not huge but they're they're still there\nIn a house this time but then and then around your house mortgage must be small\nIt's about about fifty sixty Seventy thousand hippies\nOkay or immoral fifty 'cause you said through Fifteen\nYeah yeah and for what is the only one only twenty five dollars and write them a check like a year from now when I was going to feel good and my son is still either take out a loan\nYeah that that's that's and that's the ...\nBut if you do good and my son as do other pick out a low\nYeah that that's that's and that's the little rental okay I Know there was one in there somewhere to make the math work All right uh yeah still I'm just going to plink along on those minimum\nAnd take her college without that first once we got college without that then we find money we throw it up at the probably go knock out little twenty five one out and then among next knocked my house out 'cause it's pretty even with the other one's\nAbout first we're getting back in the world when Kay or not\nSo I'll get back in the four one K. a Fifteen Percent now\nWell okay yeah well no so did you get your emergency fund right yeah emergency fund his baby step three and then by bishops forest Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement then we'll take care of college and then if we find some more money will keep while we're doing those are the two things will start throwing it up the rentals in the house\nThat your order of attack by bishops four five six in order\nActually three four five six cars you're finishing up the emergency fund in order right but it's not like about four or five or six or all simultaneous Fifteen Percent were taking care of college and then if it was money left we keep going down the list and the next thing on the list as mortgages is that so there's still a prioritization even though it simultaneously that logical\nYeah I guess I'll just try to jump ahead before them ... or two and three I guess technically\nYou're given five or ...\nYeah yeah yeah and you and your skip three to yeah [laughter] yeah\nSo yeah you wouldn't know what you're back in order that's all we did you can do it good plan man thanks for calling in a lease is with us in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Hi Lisa how are you\nI think it's an honor I talk to you how can I don't buy them for you [laughter] okay um\nWe had our house currently on the market right now we live

heads on line [noise] um [noise] what we're struggling here we paid one fifty for the house [noise] the average stays on the market in my area as three hundred and sixty nine [laughter] good\nLord what is wrong on the area\nWell it sort of a weird situation it's rural um Pennsylvania we have like an elite area about Fifteen miles from us and the houses are selling for about a half a million [noise] um\nAnd then ... and that that occasion 'cause it's on lake we're on water on on extreme but um our military than at our house is kind of out of the local market so we're waiting on a vacation or\nYou know you're not in our in Harrisburg proper them\nNo no I'm In like northeast yesterday a nearly or border but\nYour biggest problem is you have a very limited market yes the dummy three sixty nine days on the market is unbelievably long in this current environment that we're in\nI mean and all that says as you're in a very rural setting um and it's not true resort it's sort of adjacent to resort stuff right and\nYou just have a limited market I don't know what to do your other than\nA is there anyone in the resort area if you drive up in the area that is true resort and you're like fringe resort\nIs or is or a a real her up in that area that's moving a bunch of that property that usually there are signs everywhere the kind of specializes in that so that if they had a client that really didn't want to quite pony up for that area but one of the house stepped down they knew you were there\nI mean they're they're reaching out to our relatives or that just not not purchasing\nI'm Talking about your the real estate agent in that area is or someone who dominates that resort area\nThe higher and stuff\nUm [noise] not really honestly I mean we kind of stepped out to our nearest town they get a kind of a high ... I mean we had a professional photographer [noise] ... look gorgeous on line it's not you know these ... it's so rural it's kinda like everybody's second job [laughter]\nSo why are you moving [noise]

they're not they're not clients are lurking they just like the picture flip through and they when they realize where it was I walked away there were not client's\nLocation killed him it was not the house and it was not surprised\nBecause our neighbor's house I mean the closest neighbor I'm saying that others are as his hold for one eighty nine half the size of our house but double the lot you know\nBut he found a buyer square miles to I mean you just don't have any potential buyers much and that's what I'm trying to do is fix the marketing side of this this is a this is a really tough one I mean do I pick another well yes\nAnd that's what I was trying to get your dues to go up there and look at the resort area who's moving those half million dollar houses that when someone going to look at that ... million dollar house and she says gulp I really can't afford it but I Love this area they go oh I got this place down there in the fringe\nAt under two hundred and it's the sweetest little house and you got to see it and that's who your sexual yourself through your realtor is the\nPerson that can do that this that the people that are gathering the leads in the upper area and they can funnel I'm Down to you for the people that don't want to spend enough to be in the other area\nAnd and that's your best shot you just need more potential buyers you're not a good potential buyers
