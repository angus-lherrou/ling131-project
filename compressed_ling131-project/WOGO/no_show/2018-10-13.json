which to me I I kinda hate to have to talk about it but I have to and that's the fact that uh the this difficulty we have today\nWith actually being able to understand labeling on a product and what it means when they say that it is a full synthetic or that it is a a blend of synthetic and petroleum and so forth and here's here's the thing\nIf I was listeners out there listening carefully to this I'm going to condense it the best I can so that doesn't eat up too much time but it's very important because I was doing research for a customer this past week\nAnd I went to a very\nHighly reputable companies website and check out some technical information on one of their transmission fluids\nAnd the science fiction food is labeled as full\nSynthetic transmission fluid and all the bells and whistles are supposed to be that that's all good as it is full synthetic correct so\nI did something that a lot of companies don't make this available anymore but they happened to have it so I checked was called the\nMaterial safety data sheets on this particular product now for our listeners out there that may not know what that is that\nSomething required by the federal government that you have to have in case you build this stuff or somebody a drinks it or does it get it on them or whatever to to tell whatever type of a hazard it is so that you would know the corrective action to take for example most of the time if it's on your outside scan that's to wash it off with soap and water\nIn order not to leave it in long term contact because uh it can cause some harm over time long term contact so that's an example of how they would tell you if you build it if you spell it into waterways that you have to contact the government that's not biodegradable and all that kind of stuff\nBut

you think of one thing and you pay for it and you find out you got something entirely different I don't consider that to be a mutually beneficial transaction which is what business should all be about\nAnd when I look at this I think that Mr ... mobile company here dog\nThis I think that this is what\n... mobile company huge oil company worn this national advertising board about when they made the decision that they would accept the fact that\nA synthetic was just going to be a marketing term because it's not a marketing term it has a direct definition both in chemistry and to the layman it doesn't mean that it's\nJust a marketing term like very good or you know this is the blue bell blue bonnet or whatever you know that's not what it is it actually means something to people or at least they think it means something but what they don't realize is that some of these manufactures know that they can\nThey can do about what they want with it once that decision was made that they will never be sued or never find for false advertising because if you say that synthetic is just an advertising a term it's a marketing term\nThen it doesn't have to mean the things that people think it means you know so that'd be like saying\nThat cut Corvette is a marketing term and the fact that you saw somebody a year ago and the label put Corvette on it that that's all legal because Corvettes just stay marketing term by the way so it doesn't matter\nOr if you did that with tires and he said well radio really is just a marketing term what people think that radio means\nA different type of constructed tire so if you made that decision on tired you run around labeling a bunch of biased by tires radios and selling people an inferior product that they'd be paying a Supreme price for that to me is just\nHow do we live in in this country where we are supposed to have you know consumer protection agencies and all the kinds of things that you have in the states and the federal government and we pay out lots of taxes and these people are supposed to be run around protecting the consumer\nAnd they would allow this kind of a bait and switch misnomer misunderstanding that take place at the end winds that takes place follow the money trail for the largest amount of profit if I can sell you a quarter of oil\nAnd tell you that it's a full synthetic in charge you eight nine ten dollars this little synthetic\nQuarter of oil of which is actually a almost just glorified petroleum and the bottle and it doesn't cost me much more to make that than it did to make that quarter patrolling sitting next to the south for four dollars and fifty cents look at the increased profit\nThat I've made off of doing this sleight of hand\nAnd so it just irks me and that's why I wanted to talk about uh tonight to let our our consumers know now I'm going to tell you something else that I Know and it's absolutely true\nI think you get real synthetic\nOr you can get those from mobile oil company you can get those from ... probably all you're going to get from\nRed line is truth synthetic because they just make high performance products\nAnd uh after that I I don't know what you'll find an owl I can do the consumer is\nYou need to uh the all these these companies have call lines and they have Web sites where you can ask questions you know where you go on the attack on the question is supposed to answer it you just need to ask them point blank\nHow much of this product that I'm buying is\nSynthetic and how much of it is a trolley and\nIf it is synthetic then\nOn another time when we have more time we're going to answer some questions none of the time I was kind of try to explain to people\nWhat that really is because um it's\nNot as complicated as one might think but they can tell you it's synthetic just like these guys I looked up on the Internet\nAnd and be trying to claim that glorified petroleum of synthetic 'cause they just say that it's a marketing term so I guess you'd have to ask the question how much of this is chemically synthetic and how much of it is petroleum based act maybe you'd get an honest answer most of the time they would tell you that proprietary information they're not going to answer that question so\nYou know but when you go in and you find an adult product I just want to tell you right now\nYou look on the label that Amazon products and if it says one hundred percent synthetic\nLegally binding it has to be\nOne hundred percent real synthetic oil that's why you the ... oldest\nVirtually the only company the labels the product with one hundred percent synthetic they don't use any of these turnpike full partial a blend in as they put on there one hundred percent synthetic and that means by law it better be one hundred percent synthetic\nOr else they incur a huge fine from the government for fraud but the I think that these guys that say that it's full synthetic and you find that half of it as petroleum that they ought to be guilty of fraud\nAnd so by or be where\nYou're not getting the protection from the consumer organizations that you think you are do not believe because they couldn't put it on the label unless it was true\nOkay because when they put on the label but it's full of synthetic and you think that means one thing and to them it means entirely a different thing and that's where the disconnect comes then they're counting on the ignorance of the buying\nPopulation not to know that difference while they basically march all the way that the bank with the extra profits they make\nFrom doing this so I

uh\nAny kind that in the marine application anytime the boat is moving the engines under loud sound like a car or truck or you can coasts downhill\nYou're moving you you're pushing against that
