your money and as I recall from eight to five five two to five that's AAA eight to five five two to five [noise]\nJason's with us in Detroit Michigan Jason welcome to the day Ramsey show\nDave how're you doing today better than I deserve what's up\nUh we'll just wanted to give you all back story my uh my wife and I just moved from Illinois to Michigan a kind of be closer to all her family up here you have a place for that kind of getting used to everything\nBut uh uh I'm currently unemployed I was just like go up in the past couple of months and I'm looking for a job now I'm an accountant and my wife is a teacher teaches special education I'm so she currently has a job\nAnd my life as a teacher she teaches special education [noise] um so she currently has a job um my question is we're living with her parents [noise] um for the time being until\nProbably maybe next summer so until we can buy our own house um we've got about eleven thousand dollars of student debt left between both of us and we've got about that that much in our bank account right now\nI'm I wasn't here obviously once they find a job\nIf the best strategy would be to try to knock that get out as soon as possible and then from there started to save for a house or what my wife kind of want to do is just put everything we can toward a down payment to try to you know\nHopefully not pay PM mind get close to that twenty percent of course I didn't know what your take was in I mean it seems like we should still be able to have some sort of a decent downpayment either way I just didn't know how you would feel about that\nOkay I don't recommend that people buy a home when they're broke\nBecause it'll make you broker that's why they call a mortgage brokers\nHome is not a blessing when you're broke its curse and when you have debt and do not have an emergency fund you're broke\nBy definition so um my advice to folks has always been and it's not real popular advice and your wife's not gonna like it so you all may not do it but my my strong advice to you is to pay off the debt\nAnd saving emergency phone up three to six months of expenses above that save your down payment and then by you know when you buy a home and when you move in the house and there's ten thousand dollar stealing your emergency fund after you move in and you have no payments but the house payment that houses a blessing\nWhen you buy a home where he got eleven thousand dollars in debt and you have no money left in your savings account cause you cleaned it out trying to beat the in mind you move in a house broken in debt Murphy will move in your spare bedroom and bring his cousins Sallie Mae and they will set up housekeeping and broke desperate stupid in your house will start looking like a country song\nOh that's what happens in the house is not a blessing it's a curse when you bought as broke so you guys need to slow down and do this right because you've been through some hard times here do\nI mean you've been on a piano and had to move to a different city you're living with your inlaws for God's sakes has an ... right\nTo the point that they they cross the line or a few years ago and contacted Sharon and her husband and said oh now the premium that you're paying one hundred percent of it won't cover the insurance costs\nSo now if you want to keep the insurance not only is zero going to investments but now even more has to be paid to keep the insurance active and that's how far we got in the discussion is what I just shut all correction\nYeah yeah okay and what is going to face amount of this policy eighty thousand eighty thousand dollars and how much money do you all have\nHow much money that we have from\nYou how much you and your ... and you know\nWe we did have retirement account on my own they'd say total eighty four thousand ...\nUm\nWe have a ten thousand dollar emergency find we aren't that prayer or how to pay for good so kind of like\nSo you don't have much cash value is in this\nHouse right now about okay so and you have a pension plans as well yeah okay\nAnd so you're living on Social Security and eighty thousand dollars worth of for my husband\nStill works his guy um have thirty six thousand in income and they bring in Twenty one out and touch with parity okay and that's all I I don't what\nGot you in the face amount of this policy you said was eighty thousand dollar\nCar and we did look into term insurance for him but number one it's really a lot more sensitive to fade but number two he has battled cancer a couple of times yeah non Hodgkin's lymphoma and so basically you know but they were like yeah very difficult\nVery difficult but we don't know we we can lower for the death ...\nSo what is the premium how much of the year if ever I don't know how much evidence having a month yeah OK\nSo eight hundred a year and you make thirty six thousand dollars a year\n[noise]\nUm well here's here's the equation here's the way it works in your mind okay the purpose of this is to give you an extra eighty thousand dollars\nIf he dies before you do okay and so is that worth eight hundred bucks at this stage it's there is no investment value whatsoever so we're not the only question is you know you you don't have a huge nest egg\nA guy you you've got a small mistake and the show to double it basically if he were to die would be very helpful mhm and so keeping the insurance sounds really good with that in mind\nIf they would only last another three or four years anyway and they sent me wonder if that makes it\nOkay and they're going to make you stop anyway they're going to pull the plug on yeah oh yeah okay and at that point you\nOkay and they're going to make you stop anyway they're going to pull the plug on yeah oh yeah okay and at that point you catch it out and whatever cash value isn't there a\nVan and [laughter] I haven't been would like to get it out now\nYou know one way to get it out no way to get out now as close a policy down\nRight which\nWhich which means that you would you know if he passes away you'd have the four oh one K. money paid for how somebody living on Social Security right yeah but you probably can make it 'cause I gotta feeling you guys were frugal people\nOh yeah and she probably could make it on that but it's not going to be a dream come true um [noise] so they have given you notice that at I'm\nSixty two are are are I'm sure are Seventy three or whatever Seventy years old they're going to shut the policy down regardless\nYeah well I Know I guess if we can say hey you know that it would be over two hundred a month I think we could keep a guy if I\nCan write or we we could lower than that benefit and and keep it going I don't know if we could do that because what I wanted to go I went to the cash it out of them are we doing nothing\nYeah there there's not a great answer OK I asked him and hauling a little bit I'm trying to think through it um\nUh my tendency is an eight hundred bucks a year right now to keep it for a while okay I'm Seventy seven dollars a month even if you use the cash value you can have the cash value is beginning to pay the premium\n... and ... you know it's going to do is going to use up some about eight thousand dollars I'm probably going to do that and let the eight thousand dollars pay the premiums starting today and I'm probably going to leave it in place a couple of years when it starts being two hundred a month instead of Seventy seven months at that point I'm probably going to join his tribe and say let's cash it out\nAnd close it down\nBut I don't think it's going to make sense to keep this long for a long long time we're probably gonna keep a couple more years houses health\nBut then how is his health\nHow am I the first time we went to a cancer free for five years and that kind of faith and cancer free for two years good\nSo I mean you could go and get a head and every every six months to make sure it's not coming back of a\nGood good I'm Glad to hear that ... ... ... ... I'm gonna I'm gonna let the a cash value pay the premiums for the next two years and keep it open if a ... and I'm going to check on his health at that time let's say that he's got another episode with cancer going of that time\nThen you pay the premium no matter what uh gosh okay and you keep it open if he if he's being used for cancers come back at any stage right you can't you keep putting open at that point but if he's doing really really good and everything's clean and two years from now you haven't seen a spot and nothing's no problems anywhere I'm I'm probably drop and at that point\nOkay so that makes sense to me it wouldn't it wouldn't be insured so\nYeah you know but um but but you're also not paying you know three thousand two thousand dollars a year which is what it's going to be at that point yeah which is starting to be ridiculous with that kind of money you could throw money into investments and start having some money\nAnd um but but at this stage I I'm I'm hesitant to cancel it it's\nIt's obviously a bad policy so I'll be going head thing but it's your only option you're stuck with a fish now that makes it hard to discuss it hard to think about but I'm going to hold it two years let the cash value pay it at the end of that time if he's healthy or instill cancer free I'm dropping it\nOtherwise I'm going to keep it if it's if it's got a health issue at that time so good question thank you for calling in and I'm Sorry you had this problem\nFolks you hear me yell and scream about cash value life insurance whole life life insurance universal library but life is rip off you just\nExperienced it your six parents the back end\nWhat happens if you buy one of those pieces of crap policy\nAnd you're sixty eight years old this is what happens is because the money they put into that stupid but policy will be three hundred grand right now in mutual funds if you put it into that in a good investment instead of getting ripped off by the insurance company\nAnd if she was sitting there with three hundred grand plus the other four one K. they'd have about four hundred thousand bucks plus\nTheir house is paid for she wouldn't even called me\nBut instead guess who spat sassy instead of her the insurance company\nSo when your whole life agent says I don't really agree with Dave Ramsey because your whole life I just trying to rip you off\nThat's why your whole life agency and that and there's only two kinds of whole life agents ignorant and crooked does if you understand these numbers and that story right there and then you still sell this stuff that makes you crooked\nYou ought to be ashamed of yourself if you don't understand these numbers and you're still showing that stuff that makes you ignorant\nAnd you shouldn't be selling this stuff and by the way folks in case you didn't know you'll get screwed up way more often by an enthusiast enthusiastic ignoramus than you will by a con artist\nSo most of people out there selling this crap are enthusiastic ignoramus as they're not actual con artist smoke ... Charlie so with Israelis and enthusiastic ignoramus\nThat's all uncle Charlie we just nailed him right there\nDoes he's probably not a crook if he'd actually sat down and looked and realize that sharing your if your friend if Sharon's brand sold her that [noise]\nHe's not afraid of my friends like that you don't need enemy [noise]\nYou know good at three hundred grand and mutual funds easy for them what they dumped into this\nProduct [noise] all live life insurance the payday lender or the middle class by aggravates me this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nHey folks let's talk about finding a ride home for your family the amount of new homes built continues to trend aboard year after year\nWhile this can be a great option it's not that simple you're just not picking up paint colors in an open floor plan there are many potential pitfalls you could run into is the process is not approached with expertise in caution\nThe builder has an agent representing their best interest not necessarily yours\nThis is why it's crucial to have a real estate professional guiding you through the process who's on your team\nOur endorsed local providers are in the top ten percent of agents in their area who know how to spot a quality builder or E.

I Want something or I like stuff so [laughter] I always like the most expensive thing\nAnd then you don't want to put up the biggest fuss about waiting or you know being patient artist thing\nNo well

question about the movement tree the final parts of the baby step we currently are added that um\n[noise] we are we in our emergency fund that fully funded or currently cash flowing to kids in college and um so it's about retirement versus are how the pathway currently oh about I'm Seventy eight dollars an hour is on our home\nGood and what's your household income\nUh just under two hundred thousand a year so nominal and how much is college on our kids are about forty thousand dollars a year right now for the two of them okay good\nGood help for doing that so my question as they currently have about seven hundred and twenty thousand dollars and our retirement account [laughter] my husband's company doesn't match that we do Fifteen Percent not a problem mhm\nMy company I'm very blessed with 'em I invest diaper than they give me ten mhm [noise] so that's the fifteenth so my question is do I find a different way to win that that are there are Fifteen Percent or the other ten percent to make mine are Fifteen or do we put that extra it's about\nThree hundred and eighty dollars a month towards our mortgage\nIt's four thousand dollars a year doing much better\nWhen I saw that sure well I mean you you you know your act like that makes a dent in your mortgage it doesn't\nAnd it would make it much better day in my retirement account\nYou know so I I Want you to put a baby step for Fifteen Percent of your household income you put Fifteen Percent of your household into I'm into retirement it\nDoesn't sound to me like you're doing that right now\nNo I haven't been ... and then you know wearing I think that a little product as I put in my ... and they put in a timely amazing match you\nKnow wonderful man to love the Macs were not going to lose the match we're going to do ten percent somewhere else like you said and robbed by razor you can do it during the ... have you got good options if it's raw for one day particularly do that but I I I Would be putting Fifteen Percent of mine come away in return to the point is you're going to pay off his house\nAnyway right and really the exact same speed\nBecause for a thousand dollars is what's going to get

squeeze some money out of your budget but it does three hundred dollar deal here is not\nThat that doesn't move the needle towards getting house paid off the house is going to get paid off 'cause you buys you guys have been concentrating and focusing\nIn probably what's going to happen is when the kids would get kids off\nA role you probably just go vision of the house and like that year a cause that forty you'll be down to about forty by then and then that year you'll just knock it out so um you're fine you're doing really good obviously I mean you're doing really really good overall
