question because there are there are engine flushes out there that are made from\nReally strong sort of ... caustic solution high a try sodium phosphate type things I'm most like you'd a credit clean your ... or something okay but these things are\nVery aggressive and they will definitely clean out you know slugging varnish but they're not\nAnd they will definitely clean out\nYou know sludge and varnish but they're not easy on the seals and\nThat's one of the things that you have to be careful about because yeah you you want to get the engine cleaned up with the flies but you don't want to create so many path for oil leak that now you you have to have all your field replaced so you've got to be careful and\nUm make sure when you're looking on the labels on these products that you read and that they\nHave something in there where they're they're saying that they are compatible and and a lot of harm seals or any of these kinds of things because you just have to be careful\nAnd uh you probably have to actually\nPay for something that's decent in other words you might be able to find a cheap camouflage but it might be the most expensive cheap camouflage you ever use yeah when it causes damage now one from the company that I you know I'm associated with ands or do they have a\nA motor flush a that is not made from the stuff a lot of the good ones or some combination of the type of an asteroid bass player so that they\nLoosen up and strip this stuff out and you want to be careful to follow the instructions that are on these things and there's not any of them true engine flush it that you should be driving your vehicle around once you put this stuff and sometimes they call for\nTen Fifteen twenty thirty minutes of letting the engine run at a high idle\nAnd you usually put the the flush and with the old oil and let it do its thing and then you drain it all out\nAnd uh come in with new stuff and let it drip a little extra there you know don't just let it was just start to empty and they still kind of grew up in that and you decide to plug back and let a trip for a couple of extra minutes so that the drip most of that stuff out\nPigeon fly so we'll probably be completely neutralized by new putting in New oil but\nFor me I like to make sure that drips out completely before you go again and there are times folks on an engine flush is called for because\nLet me give you a perfect example and we'll we'll move on to another question\nI get calls sometimes Mikkel they say my car has started to use oil I don't know why it wasn't using it I got a hundred and forty thousand miles on the car and up to a hundred and thirty thousand miles it never used my now starting to use oil and I'm concerned that\nI have a big problem here is ... probably is going on\nThere are some stuck rings on the pistons\nAnd when those rings stick that if they're supposed to free float so that the piston has a little bit of movement lateral movement as it goes up and down the cylinder and those rings free float and maintain good good\nUm feel all the way up and down to you get good compression and above the pissed and then nothing gets passed that know blow by blow in a ring starts to Dick overtime because the oil inside the\nThe ring groove begins to finally uh become gooey and then finally solid and stick to that ring it doesn't free floating anymore so it's actually skipping a little bit from side to side and losing its rings the you now that come that high\nCompression up into cylinder blows past that stuck bring into the crank cases the engine and it's pressurized as the crank case\nI remember that term it pressure rises to crank out a lot a couple of times but here's the thing you've got in your car a P. C. V. vows that stands for mother to\nCrank case ventilation so once you create a positive pressure and the current case that PCB vow opens a path\nTo relieve that pressure and it puts it right into this section\nOf the engine which would be the intake and you burn whatever\nOil papers in that because it puts it right into the and take with the suction or the air the ... coming in\nTo all of a sudden you go from little if any oil use it to all of a sudden you're you're cranking out tomorrow consumption and you don't see much of it because it's taking it at such a light vapor and burning it that you don't have any real\nHeavy smoke coming out behind your but you're starting to consume oil well here's a place where on your next door change if you use a good quality engine slash\nYou can pre those rings back up and I would highly suggested to come back in that good quality synthetic engine oil that something like the\nAmazon signature series that is not going to stick the rings because it's just not going to break down of those situations but in any event that's a place where you use an ancient slush and if it worked in the fried those ranks and your ... and went back down and go wow my engine wasn't worn out after all so there are places\nWhere they the floods can be useful but there are also\nA lot of time to flush is being used for no good reason whatsoever so just you don't pay attention to the thing and if you have questions on other things of course you can contact me in the loop H. dot com bust our next question Rob\nThe next question comes as long as I can still off and the gentleman his shock and\nHe has a question in the question is what is the difference in my twenties helped to use fifty and size that he's thirty oils I think twenty Wu fifty years more protection\nSo why should not run it in all my cars and this is a\nA question that is not uncommon news a lot of confusion above the new weight was yeah [noise]\nWell I think I'm going to have to answer that we come back from the break [noise] yeah\nThat sounds good this is on the world on ...\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nMost of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S when if I told you for just fifty four Ninety five a month you could fight against heart disease naturally at heart and body extract we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier\nHard don't just take my word for word check out all of the success stories at H.
