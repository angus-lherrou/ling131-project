your host of this is your show on the phone number here's AAA eight to five five to too\nMany years ago I discovered that there are thirty one proper ...\nYou read the book of wisdom in the Bible written by Solomon there's thirty one of them which makes it fairly easy to read one a day so if you don't do anything else in your spiritual walk or in your search for wisdom you can read one proverb a day\nAnd if you do that over and over and over twelve times you would have read that book in one year right and I'm Thirty years later I have read it a bunch of times and you know ... book wisdom and I you know what if you actually understand the stuff you will get wiser\nIsn't that interesting you know and here's what happens when you get wiser\nIsn't that interesting you know and here's what happens when you get wiser your life gets better\n'cause he quit doing stupid stuff you know I haven't figured out the less stupid stuff I have a better life I have\nYou know it's fairly simple isn't it you kind of get back what you put out you ... what you do if you plant corn corn grows if you plant stupid you grow broken desperate you know you're gonna get a crop of something in your life what your crop gonna look like right\nFor instance proverbs tens as a slack hand causes poverty\nBut the hands of the diligent makes rich translation lazy will make you poor and you work and you don't have money\nIt's not hard translation is it a slack hands causes poverty but the handle the diligent makes rich interesting diligent was diligence diligence as excellence\nOvertime\nContinued action was not one moment of excellence but continued excellence and ordinary things when you do ordinary things with a level of excellence that's called diligence and by the way that makes one rich\nInteresting isn't it the hand of the diligent what's the hand hand of the diligent makes one rich so here's one of the things I\nFigured out I read this study years ago and now the observed it in all the millionaires we meet with and talk with and and it showed up again in this millionaire study that Chris Hogan and the team just did for the everyday millionaire project you know we interviewed ten thousand millionaires among the things we found there and one of the things we found in this study before that that I read years ago was\nPeople who have wealth and keep wealth and build wealth have a long term planning window\nWhen they're making a decision about an action a purchase something they're going to do they think to themselves house is going to affect me five or ten or Fifteen Years from now\nAnd they make decisions based on that they buy a car based on that rather than based on okay people who are broke\nBut I'm sure I'll be on the path and Ninety Days after that my question is I've been looking into refinancing in my house because I have an essay ... pm I\nAnd I when I Do the math\nLike the six thousand dollars and closing costs versus a hundred and eighty seven month ends up being in three years plus my interest rate is going to go up so I'm not sure if that's the smart thing to do\nOkay if you're gonna stay in the home longer than three years that's the only way you're going to end up getting gravy on that biscuit right\nYeah for sure so um that's how you analyze it um that's that's kinda borderline that's the tipping point is much longer than three years I probably on your break even analysis I probably would not\nBut if you're you know Ninety percent sure you're going to be there longer than three years you're going to pass the break even point start making money even at a higher interest rate is what you're telling me right\nOn well I'll get out of having to pay the hundred and eighty seven\nYeah but where your interest rates go up and offset that\nHe well he acts like a three point seven five now and everything I'm getting crowded about like for\nYou know so you're not going to make any money\n[laughter] so is it better than I hate to\nSound like you're gonna be able to watch that you're probably gonna be four seven five on a Fifteen year right now uh today and so that's like a one percent spread 'em and so what is your a loan them out\n[noise] this one is a hundred and sixty six thousand\nOkay and so one in three years I've already paid off ten thousand him about one\nPercent on a hundred and sixty six thousand increase is sixteen hundred dollars a year\nOkay and you're only saving Eighteen hundred or a hundred and eighty dollars a month which is about two thousand dollars a year so no I wouldn't do this if that's the only if that's the numbers yeah I'm here basically breaking even to refinance and I wouldn't do that I pay the loan off\n[noise] and then add one other question I guess joined ... and in my area everybody is already in session but some of them have only done one class\nJumping I still don't even go in yeah jumping you'll be okay All right\nYeah the first classes on savings and you're already ahead of the game on that you're you're in Michigan and and go back and watch it on with your online because you've got a one year membership and you can watch or listen to everything on line for a year okay so yeah you go and watch the lesson one and then when you go in Iraq whatsoever zone listen to your right in sync okay yeah no troubles are you doing\nGreat way to go dawn you killed a ghetto Christina ... with us in Boise idaho\nDawn you killed a ghetto Christine ... with us in Boise idaho I Christina how're you\nDoing well thank you Dave I'm we haven't had a great situation for our family that I'm not quite sure how to proceed we I'm told her home in California and walked away with a lot of equity and had steak moved to Boise how much weight\nOn the table that how much equity about two hundred and forty thousand boom boom love it\nYeah I'm Still we're here it gets renting while we kind of figure out you know if we want to build or buying 'em but I'm not quite sure because he had our our savings we have our retirement we have all that\nOut of debt that we get go yeah we don't have any debt good but it we just go and maybe take cash for a house yeah surely what we want or do we have what we wanted we want where\nWe were you know we want something that can cost more than what we talk I Will put on small mortgage on it paid off real flash okay the only the only game I mean well I mean what's your household income\nOr about a hundred and fifty\nOkay and what what would you be talking about building or buying what price range\nOh ... between four and six\nOkay and you have to forty in the bank okay so if we should for forty as an example you have a two hundred thousand dollar mortgage right All right how 'bout you compare that all five years true babbling yet you know I mean just knock it out how old are you that\nI'm I'm forty five and my husband if\nYou have any money in savings were investments to this not in a retirement account\nYeah there's all kinds of it [laughter] All right\nWell my role is almost never take out a mortgage that is on more than a Fifteen year mortgage and the pay much more than a fourth of your take home pay you're not even going to approach\nThat right away and then you'll be close to that and so if you take out a two hundred\nTwo hundred fifty dollar mortgage you don't really find house in Boise idaho for half a million dollars and it's a long ... wonderful property and what\nWe're hoping more property that in a big house\nIt's a whole different world though obviously from where you came from rights and so I'm mean your bang for buck is huge in Boise compared to\nYou know a big City California so um yeah you you're going to make a huge progress here and you know you just about whatever if you take a small mortgage or out in a small relative to your situation in other words I'm not going to yell at you know I don't borrow money so ... we'd be buying a two hundred fifty thousand dollar house\nAnd then we'd be saving money and we'd move up later and that's how we would do because I mean we don't borrow money for any reason ever\nBut if it's only thing I don't yell at you for borrowing on on the show and in your case though just how the different mindset\nThat the mortgage is more like a car loan\nAnd we're just going to knock it out real fast I mean like other people's rate a car loan like five years or something you know let's just put on there and\nHow fast can we knock this thing in the head and let's get after it and that's how I Want to think about it it's a really good question thanks for joining U.S Open phones or triple eight eight to five five two to five Sarah is in California Hi Sarah welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] and I was wondering if I should tell my car worrying about eight to ... ... pay off my about four thousand dollars worth of debt and start my emergency fund like hard paid off\nWhat is your household income\nAbout thirty thousand a year\nYou should not have ... you have too much tied up happening is going down in value when you're out on your car or things with motors wheels of any kind added up equals more than half your annual income how did you end up with an Eighteen dollar paid for car making thirty grand\nAnd I was married and we refinanced our house and included the car in the mortgage\nAnd then he got and and then we\nGot a divorce and we sold the house and the car with paid off\nGot it okay and I got a car and\nSo what is your um what is your income prospects\nMeaning you're thirty now where will you be in a year where were you being three years\nRan around thirty thirty tail so you don't see looking at you know she just doubling them no okay why I haven't gotten to a school yet okay and I'm a single mother and fiber and so yeah\nYou you need the money more than you need that car don't you\nYeah you know I in the cars going down their value quick so yes Charlotte pay off your dad put your emergency phone in place you can get you an inexpensive car that you pay cash for probably in the five thousand dollar range okay maybe seven something like that there's something reliable and you can get lots of car for five to seven thousand dollars right now\nIn your debt free and you got a good emergency fund and then put you in a much better position but as a rule of thumb cars are the largest thing that we all by the goes down in value anything on wheels or motors for that matter if it's got wheeler motor\nIt it's going down and values and when you have all of that stuff I had it together you don't want too much of your life financially too much of the math on the wrong way\nAnd you get when you have more than half your annual income tied up and things going down in value then that makes it real tough to prosper in your case you're going to change or into I'm not going to school and things don't change later\nBut for right now I'm with you yeah I Would show that cost this was the day for him to show [noise]\n\nIt's time to take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and making sure you're not leaving any money on the table one of the biggest expenses as your mortgage payment I recommend a quick Churchill checkup then just five minutes our friends at Churchill mortgage\nCan tell you if you could save some cash each month they've helped thousands upon thousands of my listeners keep more cash in their pockets through smarter mortgage\nI Want you to call Churchill for your check up and see if you can lower your monthly payment or better yet she how you can pay off your house early think about it what could you do with your money if you didn't have a mortgage\nCalled Churchill a triple a loan to hundred AAA alone two hundred or visit Churchill mortgage dot com for your Churchill checkup that's AAA loan two hundred or Churchill mortgage\nYou start making different purchase decisions you start having different levels of enjoyment with your money your relationship with your spouse talks to have a different depths because there's a level of security in your overall life that there wasn't before and those things are really hard to put on paper so what I figured out is I'm going to live a hundred percent debt free\nAnd I'm going to invest like crazy the rest of the money that I have in cash that comes in\nAnd I've ended up with a ton of money doing that because I don't have any risk and I'm just investing real money not borrowed money shut all that to say if I woke up in your shoes I pay off your mortgage today\nAnd if you ... if this discussion bit sour on you and you think they ran she's crazy a year from now just get you into the mortgage\n[noise] no I I I I completely agree I mean I for one thing that he ... he is just if it's a lot of money I'd go you know I just go back and get paid off but my mind sort of just wrestle back and forth for\n... ... what I'm trying to point out is is that your the your gut is not intellectually wrong your mind is your minds using an incomplete permitted formula\nGot it\nThat's what I'm pointing out that makes sense completely yeah after you got this thanks for the call open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five shoot your heart's where he's not really you got to shrink heart your heart's where you measure risk\nMarch telling me pay off my house my hands telling me I could make more money ... money\nBut your heads missions from stuff it's missing risk\nAnd um it's kind of a fun thing to I was doing this with a clash of MBAs speaking to them and uh 'cause MBAs or all talk you know masters in business they're all taught strategic thought and they're all taught to borrow money\nAnd uh I guess the answer you'll start to borrow money my ... finance professor used to teachers to borrow money and so um you know it it's broke finance professor at like a shop teacher would missing fingers right people so think about this rise by ... ... you just can't think that way and you have a different way of looking at things show\nUm but as you can really do a very sophisticated\nMathematical application of this it would just take a lot of time too much time really in the radio to walk through the whole thing but\nWhat happens is is think about this how many of you if you had zero debt and you looked over in your four one K. and there's three hundred thousand dollars and you had forty thousand bucks in the bank for emergency fund would make different career decisions\nWay too many readers said yes meaning I Would leave this jerk but I work for it and I would go do dot dot dot\nUnless I go in business for yourself necessarily might just have a different career you might go on a completely different direction that thing you've always wanted to do why are you waiting\nYou know and here's the weird thing is that saying you've always wanted to do is probably where you make the most money you've ever made in your life if you're wise about how you do it this idea that if you're a liberal passion you make half the money no you make twice the money\nYou make more money when you and something you're good at 'cause you work harder at your creative you think about all the time you can't keep yourself from moving because you love it\nYou don't think I Love what I Do I Can't keep myself from sitting at my laptop writing a blog article I Can't keep myself from doing it I Can't keep myself from coming down there and doing this radio show when I'm In town I was ...\nAnd I'm really good at it as a consequence incomes once I get paid a lot a lot of money on a shame middling I'm a capitalist pig baby I love this [noise] I'm here baby that's how I don't want that for you see that's what set\nYou up to be how many of you if you didn't have any payments would tell your boss who's a jerk stick it\nTake this job and shut it I mean we would do

it's even find things that I have\n... to to you over many years together [noise] why I Believe there will be violence from the left especially if they lose the congressional electric votes possible even if they win that will further the problem\nAnd that is the connection between high self esteem which the left has more than the right I don't mean every single individual\nBut\nSelf esteem is I Am better I better not my ideas I Am better than all those I differ with and I am\nThen\nAll of those I differ with and I am a I Am better\nIn that and this is more important than normal middle class

psychological journal and it's all over the place\nHigher self esteem\nBetween two groups of high self esteem and less self esteem to hire self esteem it'd be more violent these are all psychologist and I'm In a serious academic journal you can find that also where as well it makes perfect sense how can you hurt somebody unless you think\nYou're better than them you don't hurt people you think your worst than right the murderer thinks you know who are you a me I could murder you who are you on me I can rape you who are you I couldn't you know you're nothing\nThat's why they're there are very offended when they're arrested there just offended I Can't believe who the hell are you to arrest me\n\nAll right now Julie Julie are you in Alaska\nAnd\nAh right so we got a teacher or screaming or that eight caves Alaska a are is Arkansas okay\nI thought well [noise] I don't know I learned to pay more professional [noise] All right\n[noise] no no no no don't be sorry it's a it's a tough call whether the screener deserved the living martyr does not think uh she deserved to see in this case I don't know it was great yeah we we are truly egalitarian and whom we punish okay go ahead I'm Sorry Julie\nJulie are you there [laughter]\nLike\nWhat happened maybe she was offended that never happened\nJulie when you hear me yeah oh what happened okay I don't know about I have\nI guess I I guess I'm having trouble with the ... where how we caught our children to have\nSelf esteem knowing that that you are comfortable on the line in fact that like I said almost every day to them remember meaning to different things meaning you're a child a God and\nYou are part of the family so um I guess we have very high fell asleep and I always hard and found someone for greener yelling at me or not agreeing with me\nIf it's truly something that I ran a doesn't really bother me now I never thought of myself that I wrote in any way that I can guarantee you I have a lot of self esteem so I guess\nI Want to let me show you know it's an important subject what do you think of giving trophies to kids run losing teams\nIt's ridiculous\nOK so you okay so I have two theories about your notion of self esteem which would be hard with mine one is\nThat there is when you said I Want you to know your child with God I couldn't agree with you more that's not the self esteem to the psychologist to talking about with regard to rapists and murderers and the like\nNot that they they don't walk around thinking I Am a child of God I promise you know okay so I agree with you in that\nWe are all in God's image this gives us a certain ... that is unique to every one of us I I I learned that as a child in my religious school and I believe it the self esteem they're talking about is I Am terrific\nI don't think you told your children you are terrific\nAnd ... you know okay do you even laughing at that so that that proves right point so they're at the other is you believe I Am I won't put any words in your mouth I'll tell you say I Believe I Believe in\nEr into self esteem I totally believe if you have done well and you have done good then you should think a highly or or well a viewer cheap and that's a very that's a totally healthy thing\nYeah okay so I think on board on that\nThe self esteem movement wanted you to feel good about yourself no matter how you behaved irrespective of religion ... grew up Catholic got very angry at his Catholic upbringing rejected it this is a secular self esteem yours is religious self esteem\nI think there's a big difference I don't see evangelical Christians going out there\nAnd screaming at the at the legislature tours more pro choice then stopping their dinner [noise] they the more likely to ah to pray for them than they
