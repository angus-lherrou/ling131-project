thirty five years ago they used to tell us the hardest year of marriage was the first year\nAnd that's the reason you're trying to combine everything ... doing whatever you want your he's doing

few months ago and he's done a pretty big contract but they even built into work and like it and critical thing by\n[noise] and so we're trying to hire anybody but we're not\nHaving a hard time finding a good ... and the industry because it usually read the need to hire for how can little gadgets hoping I can bring certainly the one way that we can actively fight reliable and get people to be a part of this law candidates at\n...\nYou don't know any painters that are good and a lot of\nPeople we do know painters um\nThat are good I mean people\nLook at it a part of that there hasn't been reliable\nYou don't know any painters that are good and reliable people\nOh well we do know that they have their own business it as well\nMhm so the only painters that you know that are good and reliable people already have their own businesses\n[noise] for the most part yeah OK they were were trained like we we put 'em on ... and like nobody responding to it and so I just we just don't know where to look in order to get\nWell most of the turnout would rely people run around with good reliable people yeah\nAnd most of the time to pushes run around with due to ... so usually when I'm looking good reliable people I look around other good reliable people not could be that you look in some of the other trades and you're going to Illinois electrician that's a good person or a trim carpenter that's a good person and you start asking them who do they know that's a great\nPainter that you could bring on to the job\nA part of the problem ... very very hot construction market in Denver and so every body's got work even do fishes\n\nYour has your husband's got my working hand on maintenance so that that you've got a bit of a labor shortage ah when you've got a construction but I'm always in the city and that's what you're facing a little bit of but the way I have found like you know and it is an apple in our world it wouldn't be a painter but in our world it might be someone that's in technology\nSomeone that has a a great Rubio unreal developer as an example there's a shortage of technology and Web developer is out there right now\nIn most cities including Nashville in Nashville is actually a tech hub but um you know there's a shortage so where do we find those well we you know we go on like you've done website you go on Craig's list but we get in technology groups and associations and but mainly great developers no other great developers great painter isn't or the great\nAnd but mainly great developers no other great developers great painters nor the great painters or somebody is not a developer but has other influence in and other knowledge of the tech industry there's a great person will know so much great developer and send them our way and of course you're going to pay them\nAnd pay them well and I'm a but paying a dupe doesn't make them anything shut the well paid ... so\nYou you want to pay people well but you that that's not the part of the only part of the equation as you've already discovered so the only way I don't know how to find them would be to find other people in other trades that are excellent and people in the\nPainting world that are excellent and try to move them onto your team once you get a couple of excellent people they will have a tendency to help you find the other excellent people uh sixty four percent of people to join our team last year were internal referrals someone already working here\nThat was a thoroughbred wanted new in thoroughbred that wouldn't wanting to work here in another area now we have the advantage of being a little bit larger and having a faster rate of jobs not just a single job available but but that's how I've always done it I've I've found thoroughbreds Roma thoroughbreds and donkeys run with donkeys\nAnd so you know you just got to find out find your thoroughbreds and and people out in the community or bridge and I do or steak dinner in it for you guys send you a good guy you send him a steak dinner you send him much sooner ... him and his wife through scripts or something because it's worth it\nTo get somebody on there and you know being big good that way and I'll tell you I'm going to send you a copy of a book that is one of my favorite hiring books that have written the last two years and it's from a friend pat Lynch you don't it's called the ideal team player and the ideal team player is three things hungry\nHumble and smart hungry humbling smart\nAnd that's what you're looking for in any position in any organization and every trade and every organization has some people to qualify other high quality people every single one\nAnd if you can put them together in a trade that by and large is not that kind of people then you really a brand differentiated yourself from the other people in your marketplace\nSo hold on I'll have Kelly pick up and we will send that to you open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five

thousand dollars of my money how much money was in there [noise] it wasn't that much actually with only around Eighteen thousand dollars\nI don't I'm not aware of a mutual fund that has a forfeiture fee\nThan looking I Am it's a ... eight different finance and then it says forfeit shirts and then have the pension negative and it adds up to almost thirty one hundred dollars that sucks yeah ... especially when it was only you know a small ... to begin with\nYou know really um did you roll it with his mar vista pro\nI wrote it ever into previously on another IRA dad already banned\nSo you don't have an advisor I don't okay\nUm\nI Am sorry I Do not know the answer your question I've never ran into the uh the only thing I can guess is is that you bought a ... that your company or former company the mutual funds or coffee mutual funds or some gun\nThat have got some kind of gotcha and they're obviously okay but I don't know what they are go ahead and get in touch with one of the more of us are pros and your area and just see if they will answer that question for you okay maybe they can tell you exactly what happened at least you'll have the mystery solved since Dave Ramsey too stupid to answer the question is I just don't know the answer\nThat I just don't ...

traditional PBS clan or should I jump on board but it's high deductible plans\nAnd how much is a premium on the ...\nThe premium only eighty two per pay period and they calculate to about\nTwenty one hundred a year and what about the other one the other one will be around thirty four hundred a year okay thirty\nFour hundred and Twenty one hundred she'll Thirteen hundred dollar spread and cry and how much is the doctor will only\nPay they won the ... it'll be four hundred per individual or the ... and for the high deductible Thirteen fifty per individual that there is twenty seven hundred for

I'll say like light as of right now we just hit that adaptable and one of our family members emerging that hit in the years have I'd say it's\nOkay so here's the thing you just compare your Thirteen hundred savings versus the risk taking were fairly healthy we don't usually run through the ... so the hottest a lower premium makes a lot of sense for us and that's how you look at it\n\n\nI get asked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance was not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family has debt and not enough savings to provide for their financial neat that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where you are and your baby steps it's a necessity\nNot a choice this includes working husbands and wives as well as stay at home parents it's pretty expensive to replace a stay at home parent responsibilities I only recommend ... life insurance since is the most affordable way to get the right amount of coverage and not break your budget go to ...\nDot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two these are the guys I personally use the term life insurance is inexpensive and your family\nAnd I I Would add to that or the giving them the ties in um was really court I mean where when we started I\nUsed to routinely saying click while we're driving in

fifty or you go down to a hundred or when was that you went and Jon we're really doing this\nBut I think it was last year I I went back to work for one year and it all of my income went towards the mortgage because it was about fifty fifty thousand laps ... and we just just piled on every month it was like you just kept counting it down month by month we're going to make it and it was\nIt was off maybe you won't have even going back to work if you didn't already have those numbers calculate knew it was just for a year\nNow they're talking to this year we're done by them so I'm In for a

expert at Stanford has the answer and the newest video from ... university seat at ... dot com where we teach what is the phone\nBy the way I proposed that\nWhat you just heard\nFor ... for for profit rule\nWas giving a preview video they'll come out in about two weeks on immigration and it's terrific\nTucker Carlson is my guest he has written just now what has come out to ship fools am it's about how the elites are hurting the United states and and that goes just across the\nBoard ... let me let me give you a headline from today and I would like you to tell me if if that is related to your thesis okay a ... year it is okay so here it is half of us births\nAre out of wedlock now for ... over forty percent up from ten percent in Nineteen Seventy does this have anything to do with the elites\nBut at the core of it I mean by the way\nIs a disaster not simply on a moral level though I think it is but on a practical one narrow range of social science that make the indisputable point children particularly boys raised in a single parent homes by their mothers are much more likely to balance\nA parent homes by their mothers are much more likely to fail in school and to fail in life to develop addictions to wind up in prison they make less than we're likely to be ... or ... or have out of wedlock children themselves I mean there's there's no upside to this at all\nAnd so if you're running the country and you have an actual interest that long term success for very concerned about this and you're going to do whatever you can to make it better\nOur lead the Republican Party so focused on marginal tax rate they don't feel that sort of the province of ... they can't get involved you know you don't want to sound like Jerry Falwell so don't say anything about it\nAnd on the Democratic side single mothers are the core of their base single mothers are much more dependent on government of course they tend to be overwhelmingly Democrat and so the last thing you want to do in the last thing they do do is is suggests that single motherhood is\nLess preferable um then\nAh raising children two parent biological household so I'm both sides are kind of a lie it unintentionally in downplaying or ignoring this problem meanwhile he's got the country how did you say one other thing\nThere is no single Parenthood in my neighborhood I live in an affluent neighborhood maybe you do too and he's someone for your listeners do and you know that it's like Nineteen fifty five and our neighborhood nobody gets divorced there no single moms on my street of course not because the ruling class understands that marriage\nIs the key to prosperity and happiness\nAnd said they don't practice this themselves their children's own practice it to really like divorce rates among rich people are very low middle of the country it's the former middle class\nThat isn't in social disarray and this is a huge problem I'm not attacking anybody I'm saying if you really cared about the middle class you would be doing whatever you could to make it easier for people to stay married and raise children intact\nSo okay there was a vice president Dan Quayle you may recall and he spoke out about Murphy Brown the TV character who had a child out of wedlock and he was buried by the national media by academia et cetera so I think\nThat Republicans incorrectly but I think Republicans got burned and they realized hey we talk about social issues we're doomed\n[noise] but ... but then you wake up one morning you're exactly right that is what happened I was in the from that moment until now so I can confirm you just said that that's the conclusion they through but then you wake up one morning and you realize you know tax rates are actually I'm a lower tax or keep our taxes but\nThey're relatively easy to change you just need a majority vote in the Congress and the president willing to sign it was very hard to change the culture and the structure of the family and if that's destroyed you know it takes\nYou know generations to fix it if it can be fixed up their civilization will collapse so Republicans kind of missed the actual story which is social issues are the issues you're in the army and you're a civil society\nGrow out of the kind of life you weren't living that's what they should have been focused on and because they're dumb and cowardly and they listen to the advice of a couple of overpaid and unwise consultants they didn't do that and I think the smart ones regret it now\nThe smart ones or what they regret it now\nI don't really know what what leads you to one lead you to think that\nWell because I mean you look around Washington and you know most conservatives in DC work at nonprofit think tanks and there are a lot of really great people and nice people who work at the same tax but they've consumed billions of dollars in contributions over the past forty years and America has not become more conservative\nAnd the smart ones are asking well where did we go wrong and it's not that they're not smart or they didn't try hard or they didn't have the best intentions they did it the best intentions but they were focused on the wrong thing\nOnce you should care about is the way people with the family is the very center it's the Adams in matters the court building block of everything and when that collapses there's no hope of doing anything positive so and they ignored that and I think they know that now\nWhere I ... I feel for me asking you this but it's it's truly meant of curiosity 'cause I saw respect you where do you stand on President Trump\nI think that um well I mean just as an overview I agree with you know the the majority strong with the overwhelming majority of what Trump said\nUm I think Trump's genius I think you need to understand some credit for Trump's genius is not in affecting policy change I don't think he\nHas control over the executive branch his portion of government I don't think he understands how it works I don't think he's going to learn I don't think he's good at getting his program through Congress I don't think Congress wants to get his program into law so on that level trumpet is a frustrating president to watch\nI think that Trump's value ingenious is in raising the question that no one else was willing to raise ... think about as a kind of clarity\nVery simple clear he so he will say things like well wait a second you know we had NATO which was this great force for forty years but it existed in order to keep the Soviets were invading Western Europe Cillizza longer exist so why do we still have NATO\nWell I don't know what the answer is that's a totally fair question and one that we all should have been asking\nSince Nineteen Ninety One when the Soviet Union collapsed or why we start Afghanistan Seventeen years later or why are we allowing\nThe south Koreans cheat in this trade deal or why don't we build the wall like what's the answer speak slowly so I can understand\nThat's his genius being brave enough and clear enough to raise the core questions that we ought to be debating long after Trump's gone those questions will hang in the air and my hope is that someone will answer them and solve those problems but first you need to\nDo you need to define what the problems are and I think the Trump has been really good at that\nAll right a final question because I Know I Know your time is limited so you have on guests who signed intellectually morally intolerable which is which\nIs fine [laughter] okay\nSo I just want to know where you see their name as listed on your program notes boosters who will have um do you think oh my God I Can't believe this or I read this or you know what that's what I Do for a living and what the hell\nWhy put their names on that list so I'm I'm responsible for that and I just filed like literally a minute before I got on the show our story outline for tonight's show and so I'm involved I'm there no surprises to me because I'm involved from the beginning to the end by\nThe purpose in doing that is ... ... grows out of my belief that you need to hear the whole argument yes and you do got great\nYeah I Try All right Dr bless you great to be with you and folks whose ...
