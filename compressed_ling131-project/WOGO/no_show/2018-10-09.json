I was just in San Francisco this week and we're doing the event we should ... or ... the audience were three thousand people there how many of your work when you were in college I mean it's like Ninety percent of the audience raise their hand now maybe the people that didn't work when they're in college and listen to my show I don't know but\nIt appears that most people work when they're in college that's what it looks like I'm so I'm I I think if I'm you I'm going to continue that route good question thank you for joining us ... ... is with us in Houston Hi Lucia how are you\nI Am doing well thank you for asking um I if I get back on here and my husband and I were in baby steps you getting at it that now we\nAre and what you call the dream team and they will or down payment on or how much be finance chair I think that we're looking right now at about and [noise] and her thing about them I call frequent down um our household income for\nUm sonics back only about one twenty five an actor about negative effect both out one thirty two and so I'm trying to make sure that I like them about like how much how by and that we are understanding the am\nI I I think you recommend and I forgive your take home pay exactly at okay perfect and thought I wanted to make sure that like right now we're faced with a million markets calculators and right now we're kind of a cat a funny one hundred\nAnd ... and ... ... um and come up like a reasonable comfortable amount town ... at it like a big number against their little you know and it was a big no\nIt's a lot better than you're paying now but if that's the address ... a fourth of your take home pay or less and your debt free with your emergency front and blows you have the math spread to prosper if you continue to budget and stay on track but again that's not what you should do that's the most you should do\nSo you can do less if you wanted 'em or you could put on a shorter term if you want to\nAnd you know I'm about less house at Twenty one hundred and paid off in ten years there's nothing wrong with ... on five years I don't care I mean you can do a lot of stuff but the most I Would ever tell you to do and I I don't even do that 'cause I don't borrow money at all for anything ever\nIs a Fifteen year fixed rate\nWhere the payment is no more than a force of your take home pay Luke is one of those in Dallas Hi Luke welcome to the day Ramsey show\nID very better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nSo um my wife and I have a written to you for many years actually my dad got me let's see what I was a young kid and um stupidly I did not take her by her and I have to be alone and um [noise] we are considering taking a cash out refinance our house\nTo knock out the high interest you know ... and then start paying the debt off on the house because it that much lower interest rate [noise]\nAnd how much they want to do it ... the you know she can read it forty eight thousand strength and what's your household income\n[noise] getting actually between takeover forty to sixty shall I own my own business so last year we did sixty five this year we're looking at probably doing I'm probably going to bring on culture to forty two\nOkay I I don't know what you've been listening to on the show but in a twenty six years I've never told someone to do a refinance actually take care of to pay off their debt ever except to avoid bankruptcy or a foreclosure and you're facing neither\n... and so on now I I've never told him I Do that\nOkay and the reason was very simple you make enough money to pay this debt off in a couple of years calm you worked like a maniac and you're going to have to have no life but then you're going to be dead free except your house\nAnd then you can work on paying off your house I'm from there and of course start working on your retirement and the other baby steps that we won't be groups but you can't borrow your way out of that\nAnd on and if you pay this off within two years the interest rate on this becomes mathematically irrelevant\nAnd it also fast it's like you're keeping it for Thirty years it's a two year thing and and really is not forty eight thousand for two years or twenty thousand for two years because halfway through you're going to be halfway through\nAnd and so yeah you guys need to get on a budget really really tight budget very careful where Donald in\nTouch your lifestyle to nothing do everything you can with your business to increase your income because you need to clean up a student loan debt I agree with you on that part but no I don't I don't tell people to borrow to get out of debt you can't borrow your way out to dinner and work to get big your way out of a whole\nDigging out of a whole is a an oxymoron excitement that we all might which I'm digging a hole you're not digging out of hope you dig out the bottom of a whole it's deeper\nShe can't dig out of a hole to fill in the whole you know to climb out of a whole maybe but you don't dig out of a home\nUnless you dig into China to work so no you can't you can't you can't borrow your way out of that and that's the same exact situation so you got to stop that you have to break that cycle little on the sand and say well now borrowing money\nEver ever ever ever\nThis or that Iran's you show [noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I\nDon't care of the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible\nThey never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely legally and forever is with time share exit team they have offices all around the country where you can sit down face to face and review your contract to find a solution they've accepted thousands\nOf timeshare owners this year alone\nThey're the best in the business because they simply a more options for exit than anyone else it could be a long process\nBut there with you every step of the way and timeshare exit teams so confident in their extra service that if they don't get you out you get a full\nUh we had about ten thousand and so that was hard for a nerd was it was\nA check out and clean up as soon as the ... takes your breath away so Veronica spend or go to class you go to class but then you get in there and there had to be a moment where you go oh sure I like this well\nIt wasn't so much\nThat I didn't like it I just I felt like\nI Need it like I said strategies to help me because I I didn't want to be in that either I just felt like there is just a huge cloud over as all the time and what was your\nBiggest takeaway ban where you went oh I see that now\nEverything about it was awesome honestly and I think it was realizing our roles\nAnd and within the same thing or that he is and then me and just coming to my senses and saying you know is this\nIs this material things something that I really need to have men are\nUsing the ... system really helped me and now is how our budget and this is the amount of money we need to pay for our groceries and this is\nYou know this is how much we we can get in the church and this is how much we can give people forget and what not and so I just needed to lay out and once we implemented the stats\nYou know we're just like\nA little bit like Rachel ritual group is that a budget is permission to spend\nI Love your daughter permission to spin okay yeah yeah that's exactly what it is I never sometimes when I just felt like\nWe didn't have any money that's the mindset I had to get myself letting okay we don't have money for this but you know it's there and we want it ... you know when I'm In control budget\nBut once

money in marriage last week and we were listen to a lot of the other couples mhm and none of them have gone through the financial peace but they've gone through a lot of seminars mhm and I think if they had gone through a seminar or the financial peace university they would really get on the same page\nAnd it was just really explode once I get through that and and follow the ... the steps yeah
