right now um [noise] what do you want to know\nWhat his upcoming student loan debt\nUm what do you want to know when you own is what his upcoming student loan debt\nAlright so uh [noise] four years ago to get a promotion at work I decided to go back to school and it didn't pay off I landed the promotional two years ago and now the loans are kicking and and if I were to got a hold of your show earlier I Would have been paying off sooner but\nI Will I Am get free or two years ago we had our first child and we you\nKnow your your student loan debt you al ... case August I'm not a free now my student loans that they are\nEager and coming up and Seventeen months I got to start paying for\nA nice not coming up it's there it's just whether you've got to pay it when you have to pay it so what's your household income\nUh it went from only twenty five when we were both working to Seventy five now my full income\nAnd how much of a promotion did you get in return for going into bet fifty grand\n[noise] well I was getting a lotta overtime in the past so it was kind of a lateral move but it was it showed on paper thirty percent increase my base\nIt didn't show on the paper called your check\nNot yet not yet\nWell are you I mean so so far you've got nothing for your fifty grand\nTrue true and I both I've always felt I'm\nPretty smart with money so I have a positive net worth right now four hundred thousand between my four oh one big assets and I'm home equity so I'm not I'm not terrible but I just want to know what\nKind of way gas that's do you have that are not home equity or for one\nI have a hundred thousand and vehicle fifth wheel toys like larger items worth more than ten Fifteen thousand dollars\nThat are all going down in value okay yeah okay and you may have cells in dollars a year\nYeah yeah but I I'm thirty one I I okay yeah I'm scared about what you're going to say about my house but\nYeah so what is your a house payment\nPayment Thirteen fifty it's got a a balance of two thirty\nAnd then what's your take on\nA take home pay about thirty four hundred a month\nThat must be after four O. one K. contributions or something\nWe do we have a question about um insurance as it relates to a nonprofit attrition I have about two and a half years to go\nThen we're going to retire from our jobs and laugh in Alaska relocate to Missouri and set up a law enforcement retreat camp for officers that are just need a place to go in and reconnect with their family but we're wondering is what kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential liability\nThe camp will be a uh the the operations\nOf the camp will be done by the nonprofit the land that had his own own own will be rented or own\nWe currently own property currently on that property and we'll be living on it also\nIn time and um I Would suggest you keep that separate from the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent from you for a dollar or whatever and then you would carry law journal liability on your land or in case something happened with the rent or\nWhich happens to be your non profit and then the nonprofit you would sit down and talk about what kind of a\nYou know you need to get with an insurance broker and what kind of insurance is appropriate then\nFor a a a camp setting a lot building will be the main thing I Will be concerned about that if somebody fell and hurt themselves or something like that who are they going to say well they could sue the landlord or they could sell the tenant they could sell the the nonprofit or you either one and so\nOn a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm probably more concerned about that and then ... if the structures on the property\nOr they they would be owned by you individually or are you in a company separate from the nonprofit that company would carry or that individual would carry the insurance on the structures more like homeowners insurance or if you're on the farm or something and and you keep that because I rent or can't insure\n'em\nThings that they don't own you don't have an ... interest and I I I really would not put the land in the name of the nonprofit or I Would keep it separate from a risk standpoint and you know in case something changes with the nonprofit you're not\nYou know you're you're not stuck with land in a non profit that can get real sticky if you want to do so well let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land you know you got mess on your hands up the land is owned by the nonprofit usually what I'm saying yeah they keep that separates a infiltrate the you know the landlord heck can only ensure the buildings\nThe business so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liabilities right with that and any of the things that the\nUh if you're a tenet for instance in a house you can get confidence insurance you ensure your stuff that's in that landlords house\nOh she can get confidence insurance you ensure your stuff that's in that landlords house you see what I'm saying is a treat these things separately and your mind that way but an insurance broker can walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the types of uh of interests people to shop several different companies to get you the best deal and for instance I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay\nAnd so you don't go to State Farm and get an airplane insurance okay they don't sell it they might but you wouldn't want by there even if they did so you you said you would go to insurance broker and they shot five different companies that Ruy airplane insurance\nAnd then they come back and tell you how that how the liability works on that and how the different you know and the the if there's a crash what would happen in the same kind of thing here they would find five different companies that ride camp insurance\nFor for families are adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would make a market that means in insurance where they find somebody that writes your policy\nOr two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing and it costs this much and this cover company covers the same stuff accepted doesn't have that one thing and it caused this much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually the individual part will be a lot cleaner\n'cause it's basically a insurance on a farm or or insurance on the foreign plus a few cabins you know almost like a\nThat kind of stuff so you're covering the structure that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff you just get somebody that that can\nYou know go into that little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for if I were in your shoes\nIs but the main thing you want to ... do do hold harmless agreements or carry any weight in any of this I'm\nNo ... yeah they carry weight but I'm\n... and\nThere are no agreements that keep someone from you cannot contract away liability okay so let's say that a floor was right and then one of the cabins guy and um\nThat's a liability that your fault regardless of if they sign to hold harmless you you are liable for that uh you're standing in my building\nIf you slip and fall and uh because we didn't you know properly install the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something then we're liable for that regardless of if we had you sign a Harley Varmus before he walked in here\nYou know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff separate an ownership like we were talking about anyway those are called that's those moves or risk management moves you're you're managing your risk but I hold harmless is\nIt what that does is it it's like a lot of contracts that keeps honest people honest\nRight it's like do you know you are you are walking across that employee fell on your face 'cause you've tripped you know and you're trying to hold harmless agreement\nAnd you know then you're going to call him out just on his honor you know if he doesn't have any of the insurance companies lawyers gonna call him out on his on her and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case they're not after writing a check\nBut you need the backup in case you were to lose that\nUh and it'd be proven that you are liable regardless of the whole harmless but I I I Would have um signed them in those cases for sure as you know when you register to you're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and having attorney draw up a little simple one page thing but\nYou know if if you're on a four wheeler a expedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles you know you sound these two page documents that are all find Brenda about how if you die you're not ... they're not liable they're still awful\n[laughter] they'll still loose [laughter] so yeah I mean ... they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you hey thanks for the call and you're ... you're joining U.S Open phones at triple eight eight to five five at two to five you're jumping we'll talk about your life and your money\nAnd a\nJump in and we'll talk triple eight eight to five five two to\nFive All right Lindsay is with us in Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Lindsay how are you\nI'm game how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um okay I have a ... fan and a new holiday that this is something that you've touched on our website and find new to the baby fat and I know that number wind and the ads and dollar an American the fine\nMy question is do you ever think saving\nMore than that and and the reason I asked my husband works and oil and gas industry and getting laid off isn't really an uncommon thing happen mhm I stay at home I Can't ... funding and how do you think we should prepare\nGenerally I Do not suggest more than that until you get back to baby step three but here's what I Would do okay he's in an honest stable environment with his job is what you're saying and I agree with you\nOK but um\nThat's one level of quote worry I'm not going to raise it based on that level of Henri but what I Would do is stop the baby steps and pile up cash if we get wind that he's really going to get laid off\nHow much notice did they usually give him if he's laid off\nUm [noise] I don't it's never he's only been working for three years owner never happened to act really lucky we haven't been laid off and when you go in and they get home ... I mean within a couple\nOf weeks she don't couple of weeks to do something ... going to find something to do when he comes home if they did get laid off so uh [noise] you know if he looks up at five of his buddies were laid off last week I was pushed pause and almost all the money make a little baby step thing and this pile of cash\nBut just generally worried about it you know generally worried about is what we all have and that's why we get out of that [noise]\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth\nThat will save you tons of money in the long run\nTo help I recommend all my listeners check out one dental dot com it's not dental insurance one dental as a dental discount program that functions like a membership club think of it like Costco you join for a small yearly fee and you say big every time you use it\nOn talking discounts on all procedures from routine cleaning to root canals in fact two of my team members of saved over a thousand dollars with the one dental plan\nAnd this is not just for you and your family there are group rates for your business church or association available fulltime part time and contract employees volunteers and members joined the Fifteen million people across the country who are already saving with these plans to get a special discounts from my listeners\nOh I'm not sure that if you got\nTo cars I'm at credit card debt but I paid pretty much about Fifteen thousand in the last I Would say three or four months\nYou got your your debt free but two cars and the two houses right okay how much do you own your cars\nI'm a thousand on both\nEach total on both total okay wow and what's your household income uh one thirty\nOkay you know a lot of car and um so what do you own your primary and what are you all on the rental\nMy primary I Will to fix the and it's worth about five fifty\nMhm\nAnd the rental and now my my rental Ohio one fix the and it's worth about I Would say or thirty Philip has worked with the but I if I'm at a little bit less\nOkay so I mean the two ways to do it is usually income to clear up the mess or use the rental to clean up the mess right [noise] right\nAnd so on you know if we take take and say I'm you know I'm going to start paying I'm going to live on beans and rice and until I get these cars paid off and so they're going to be paid off and well under a year\nAnd then once they're paid off a then I'm going to decide I'm going to pay all the the little house or the rental first probably go and pay off the rental um my pay off the house first I don't know either one's fine but um you know you start doing more forty fifty grand a year and that\nStuff let's see here we got three four uh four twenty so you got about five to ten you got about seven to ten years to clean up those two things after the Europe paying off your car um Oregon show the rental now and be done\nRight I mean that's why I really had him classroom whether to to do that and and pay off most of the party much taller rent on pay off pretty much all my dad on it but I also have in mind that for that like I have a son who's about to well I Would say in in two years she's going to go to college\nI don't have a house payment you can cash flow that right okay you know debt now the only way this makes sense is if you don't borrow money anymore right now my credit card check that out there and that turned me Gary by a car\nYou pay cash for it I'm All right you never grow money again on anything if you do this because otherwise it doesn't make sense\nRight that's that's the planet you can to get on track\nYeah you can't shorter ride this out of debt horse it doesn't work can't shorter ride him you gotta ride him or not\nAnd so if you're gonna ride him it makes a lot of sense and I think it makes sense I Would sell the rental and pay off everything cash flow college than I Would say about my mission whether rentals with cash or go along out there into the future and I think ten years from today you'll be in a better place by having done that\nIf you stay on budget and you don't keep you know you don't spend money that you don't have to go back out there and borrow money and all that kind of stuff but you got to stop it\nYou got to break the cycle and if you've broken the cycle then yeah I don't the rental and pay off the cars and pay off the house um\nAnd it does look like you've got enough to do both I'm barely close very close but you need to be a hundred percent that free a slap build your emergency fund and then start building George junior college fund and then once you've got junior college covered um by just don't want to start in a savings account was a junior college junior colleges do it in their\nBuild it up build it up build it up build it up\nAnd work your way right through it and then um\nThen once that's done then you just start saving up paying cash for rentals or doing other kinds of investing along the way but we're working the baby step share the only thing is we're just short short getting everything by the ... I Would I Love rental property but I Love being there for a more\nAnd so I don't borrow money in life is good when I don't have any payments any where life is good it's awesome\nI thanks for the call

atmosphere if not worse to encourage acts like it would be bomber\nNone of them like to see what Michael Moore suggested this last weekend as a quote the threat of right wing violence against figures on the American left is not new is not an aberration it is not a violation of norms it is the norm watch this river Murdoch's Fox News channel and right wing radio there we are\nHave preyed upon those who've seen their American Dream go up in smoke and they have helped to create a generation of angry and that's what you guys are angry and violin conspiracy theorists who believe any lie this perpetuated on those airwaves\nThese angry right wing manned oh it's really focusing [laughter] have been openly or hopefully encouraged to act on those lies I guess he meant openly encourage people to act on those lives even as late as this very morning when Trump was tweeting his doubts that the bombs were real\nSo that's just one example that the president tweeted the bombs may not be real since no one was killed I gotta admit it but thought crossed my mind too that maybe you know the bomber didn't want to kill anybody who knows the bombs may have been threatened but it's not an outrageous says he wants to make it\nAnd why what's he do that while conspiracies on the right did you name some real ones of course not they never named him and how about left wing conspiracy dawned on me perpetuated by left wing channels what about that nine eleven never happened and that George Bush created it or this this is one you may be familiar with\nPresident Trump colluded with the Russians you spent two years in that one and as far as I Know it's still call\nAnd President Trump was guilty of inciting the pipe bomber right that's the reason one or yeah as we said I Believe it or not in the horrific attack on the Jewish temple\nAnd their unchallenged even on right wing Fox so here he's picking on Fox not that I Want to defend them was former Obama official claim yeah that's what I looted to the President Trump's rhetorical help lead to an environment in which the temple murder operate I think it was an assistant sector state I wasn't anybody famous\nOf course the president create an anti Semite or encourage them to create a tax or violence even though his grandchildren are Orthodox Jews and the murder made it clear he was anti Trump\nThe media will never give up on their agenda to blame him for everything bad that occurs and that the president's attacks on the media would not only fostering such a climate but\nWe're unjustified see at Fox News hosts like Shepard Smith well you know what side he's on an even Chris Wallace in some ways joining that course and what some of them site is proof the chance of lock her up\nThe phrase fake media Oregon worse for them the enemy of the people so let me address these issues by by the way to tell me in the crowd that crop first\nBecause it's a legitimate conversation to decide whether or not Hillary Clinton is above the law and should be charged and tried for the crimes she committed\nIn fact when I suggested on another national show where I was filling in for the week that I'd be willing to give her a pass I felt this way I'll give her a pass on jail if she in bill would agree to go away and leave us alone\nWhich obviously they would never do that [laughter] I was being facetious I Would be willing so to speak to let sleeping dogs live so one called challenged me and said I I Can't believe you mark I agree with everything you're saying as usually you often get that but you're suggesting that Hillary's above the law and she should get away with her crimes\nAnd I had to admit his challenge was more than fair and I couldn't really answer me except for what I'm kind of thought of afterwards it might be good\nFor the sake of the country not to put everyone through such a trial can you imagine the outcry and the further device on this if that's even possible mature that might bring to the country but that doesn't change the fact that it's a ... a legitimate discussion to have about\nWhether she should be tried for crimes especially since you got a free pass and we've now found out through the corruption at the highest levels of the state department and the FBI\nSo she really was never held accountable for actions and the cries to lock her up represent the Irish people feel that she was given a pass and appears to be above the law\nNot unlike her husband who didn't go to jail for lying under oath of course the press doesn't do that they made it into you know he had this affair with an intern so because of sex that's why people want them to go to jail no he lied under oath you don't have a system in in court if you can get away with lying under oath\nAnd the idea that as one set of rules for the Clintons and another set for the rest of us so lock her up is not by any means and incitement to violence the other charge that President Trump calls the media the fake media and they get especially in order to what the charge that they are the enemy that people\nThere'd be on the media is beyond outrage they really get on their high horse for that one and they were beyond offended\nBut it's also legitimate\nThe press not infrequently comes out with stores that are not true the latest example did you hear this one NBC was hiding ... story evidence in reference to the charges by Julie sweat Nick and her sleazy porn lawyer\nThat's Tucker Carlson is named for him and it's just one it's a good one [noise]\nIt seems NBC knew that you didn't even support her lawyers characterization of his claims that you saw Kavanaugh spike drinks or engaging gang rape you didn't hear that John I think I got something on Shawn he didn't hear that bit of news yeah\nThis so called serious offense is not outraged if you examine it from President Trump's respective or many of his supporters\nThe media is huge power to influence the course of events and the public's perception of events so if they're no longer object the reporters and apart a sense of the left which they have become\nThey will influence the people in a way that profoundly affect public policy\nTo the detriment of the truth so for example and I'll talk about and the next our legal immigration debate with the media showing heart wrenching stories of children being ripped away from their mother\nNever mentioned the fact that none of this would happen if the mothers didn't bring them here in the first place you never hear that or the more salient fact perhaps that whenever someone who's guilty of a crime catch though is that children are also so called ripped away from them when their parents go to jail\nThe children as far as I Know never go to jail along with their mother or father [noise]\nHow come that hardly ever reporter by the mainstream media so it can be put in perspective by the viewer or listener\nSo the media shape the debate even in their use of the term undocumented when she was on Fox News even though he more picked on them and saw at all it's all they lack the proper documents to come to this country or your house or take your bank accounts they just don't have the right documents\nSo of course many people never hear the other side of issues if the press barely reports them so in that sense they're an enemy of the people because they're denying all the facts to the people and not allowing them to make their own\nDecisions let me know what you think I think this is a big part of the issue he's right let me know what you're saying one a predator seven seven
