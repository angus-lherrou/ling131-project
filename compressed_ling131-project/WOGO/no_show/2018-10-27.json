I. dot Gov paid for by the Wisconsin department of justice\nWhat that means is that it just blows up what you're looking for it to do is rapidly burn you say well what's the difference well it's a lot of different when you're actually looking at it from a ... standpoint\nBut not just because it's coming up and seeing that mixture of gasoline and air and that muggy night\nIt sets off the gasoline to react with the oxygen in that air too actually\nSets off the gasoline to react with the oxygen in that air\nTo actually burn now if they could do it all in one instance let's say one micro second that's one maybe in a second if it could\nAll do it that fast than I Would have a maximum pressure Paul piston would start down\nAnd it would immediately immediately the\nPressure would be dropping off rapidly on the other hand if I could get that\nBurned to laugh from Millie seconds which would be one thousandth of a second instead of one millionth of a second I Would have an ex banding pressure gradient for enough time that the piston\nWould have already started down and as the bargain was expanding inside the cylinder\nThe\nFuel mixture would still be pushing it down okay so that's one aspect that\nNow the other aspect is that I got to get the fuel to at least a\nBurn and burn efficiently so I Can't have an octane rating is so high that I don't even burn all the fuel so the point as I got to find a sweet spot I gotta have\nOctane at a level which will give me a good expansive burn and yet ah the school will be call it ignite a bold enough that it will burn it all in Burnet thoroughly give me all the power out of that fuel so you know the guys that manufacture the engines\nThey perfect this stuff and for you motor heads out there it has to do obviously with the timing\nBecause when I said that a volume off will make a lot of different in a how well the fuel burned now when I have a\nLower octane and a lot of cases that tend to retard the timing meaning that I might actually set the mixture off after pistons already reached the top and it's already starting to go down\nA lot of times with higher octane like Ninety three\nNinety five Ninety seven octane I Will advance the timing so that the spark plug is is going off before I read the top top of this so this gets complicated and there's there's just terrific guys out there that messed with this but the octane rating\nIs designed into your car\nThere's what they call it knock censor that sends a car and it's looking for a certain knock that takes place in the engine which means that then that'll happen because you're running a lower octane fuel like eighty seven or eighty five if that knocked fence or doesn't hear that knock than the computer gets kind of crazy looking for it can cause all kinds of\nUnknown or adjustments in your fuel air and make sure that you're not interested in so it's important to run the correct octane now it is true\nThat some engines will run a\nBetter on a slightly higher octane than what they came rated in their man no end to tell you the truth a lot of that is because sometimes the octane rating some pomp depends on how you write that you may not\nYou may be within a couple of points but it may be on the low side so when you go up to the next one all of a sudden you're really at the octane that the designers made your car for so you can figure that out based on how well your car runs on the gasoline in your area and that particular station that you buy it from and that kinda stuff but\nThe octane is a measure of how slow\nThe few will\nBurn the higher the octane the slower the birds are right now we move over to the tank\nGod Knows that if it wasn't for these terms it never get confused and fame but [noise] taking confuses the thing in diesel\nIs the opposite and in a diesel engine I Am bringing my piston up and I'm reaching very high pressure well under high pressure air gets extremely hot\nSo what happens is I bring that pissed and that may be within twenty to one compression Eighteen twenty five whatever the designer had\nAnd then at that very high compression my injector in jak at a very high pressure it injects diesel end of that hot air mixture\nWas gonna it's gonna burn question is how quickly will burn the pain is just the opposite of octane it says hey ah when we have this situation even ... ... what it will just leave me set off of that hot air would you squirt it in there when you was\nInjected fires have been there and the pain tells us\nHow quickly or how well it will ignite almost like and the mission a measurement of the lower the the pain the poor the performance of the few okay so it's it's different than gasoline and it's important because\nAll of these I'm very high performance turbo diesel and things that you can buy now uh they had to get a good uh uh the teen writing somewhere around forty five\nAnd unfortunately in some places especially down here Bob in in Florida in the dead of winter sometimes a few companies\nStart ... them lower quality diesel down south because\nThey won't do real cold weather\nSo anyway I'll finish it up quickly when we come back to the break\nWe'll be right

... eighty\nAnd an eighty coolant or anti freeze that stands for organic acids techno wow we've defined it big term [laughter] what does it mean it's not all that crazy what it means but what it what is important to understand is that the chemistry there\nAnd then a organic acid is special ... and so it means that almost all the new car have some type\nOf organic acids technology anniversary the days of the old good press thing I mean\nUh I can say that\nPress downright yeah press on anti freeze it was green and that was a south by type a fluid meaning that its\nPrimary constituent of anti corrosion and keeping everything good was it's a sulfur based additives that did that\nThose were not organic acids technology\nSo the important thing to remember is that if you have a very old vehicle\nIt would be best if you're going to go with one of these new antifreeze is to flush that old vehicles completely out get it all cleaned out then you could come in with an organic acids technology\nBut if you're running a car already that requires and one of these days then you gotta make sure that when you buy anniversaries to put in it that it's compatible now\nThere is the term
