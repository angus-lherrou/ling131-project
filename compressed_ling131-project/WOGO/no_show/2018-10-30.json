the research proves the number one social justice imperative is\nMarriage\nI don't have time to go through the whole article but this is just really intriguing research just just Seventy years ago social mobility and protection from poverty\nWere largely a factor of employment those who had full time work of any kind were sold them poor fifty years ago education marked the Gulf separating the haves and the have nots\nFor the last Twenty years or more though marital status has increasingly become the central factor in whether our neighbors and their children rise above remain or descend into poverty the research is astounding\nIn Nineteen sixty the poorly and moderately educated we're only ten percent less likely to be married then the college educated with both numbers quite high eighty four Ninety four percent respectively that parity largely held until the late Nineteen seventies\nI eat the sexual revolution by the way professor Bill Galston president of Clinton's a President Clinton's domestic policy advisor and now he's senior fellow at Brookings explained that in the early Nineteen nineties that an American need only to do three things to avoid living in poverty\nGraduate from high school\nMarry before having a child\nAnd have that child after age twenty\nOnly eight percent of the people who do so we were born in will be poor while\nSeventy nine percent who do who fail to do those all three will be poor if you fail to do that wait until after twenty to have kids white to have kids until after you're married and graduate from high school you're Seventy nine percent more likely to be in poverty only eight percent who follow the sequence\nArm poverty you want to do away with poverty\nGet it in the right order that's what the data shows graduate from high school get married have a kid after you're married after twenty those are the only thing she got to do\nOkay a separate from your husband or your jaw haired\nYeah sorry about yes\nMy husband okay and um\nShow or you're preparing for separation how long have you been married\nI'm about twenty two years\nOh my goodness it must be ...\nIt it just that we are are just not on the same\nPage anymore um and ah what other things but ah with money as well and it's just um it's just a thing I just I don't want to go on land\nMhm have you guys missing emerge customer\nThat something is not going to have you gone yeah\nOK please do that for you even if he won't go oh okay I think it will give you good I'm emotional information twenty\nTwo years in a long time and you need to have somebody walk with you who's not in the fog if you go through this and or give you some and maybe maybe give you some information to give him a little bit of a wake up call as well but back to your original question\nI have a friend of mine that teachers divorce recovery recovery after a divorce and um I remember many years ago hearing her say divorced turns on marriage into a business transaction\nAnd the show it it comes it's a real quickly the emotions are carved often shut over to one side and the actual technical legal financial details are on the other side\nAnd it becomes very transactional kind of thing at that point does that make sense\nYes and so a here here's a couple of things to look at your student loans or your student loans they're going to go with you unless you know you may or may not get alimony child support or somebody else but your student loans are going to go with you um and you're gonna have to pay them so what is your personal income\nOr\nA ... they took out\nOkay right and so what you start doing is if this is a a direction that you you know after seeing a counselor and doing everything you can to save a twenty two year investment uh him with all the help you can get a you start preparing for living on your own for fifty thousand bucks a year\nAnd you you look at treated and loan so much to learn that if you go\nOh you better Kim I'm Sorry sixty thousand oh my lord okay [noise]\nWell how would let them know that this was going on hardship difference\nOkay\nWell how would let them know that this was going on hardship to furrow until you get past ah what else whatever else was going on here okay now do you own a home\nYeah what's it worth\nA try your it out what showed on it a high tech savvy Abby\nOkay so no equity there to amount to anything or is your car\nPaid for yeah as his car by four yeah OK is your name on that loan yeah good okay are there any credit cards that have both of your names on them\nAnd there is one that I care to let him ... I'm Sorry\nYou refused to let him you know better than that closed that account today just completely closed the credit card if he has the number he can use it if he's one of the users on the car [laughter] period\nAnd if things go sideways emotionally inside your house I have run into situations in Thirty years of doing this where somebody takes an Mexico drip puts it on the guard\n\nAnd you don't want to pay for five thousand dollar cruise for somebody else you know and it'll end up on this card so close the account today just completely shut it down to zero balance\nYeah good closing okay the does your checking account both names on it yeah\nOkay sure your money separated by march is there any other debt or debt instrument that's open that as both of your names on it\nYeah yeah\nOkay I don't accept her mortgage probably as both are names on okay so here's what happens you can't afford to keep the south\nYou can't stay there yeah um so the house that needs to either be refinanced to get your name off of the mortgage or sold you cannot stay on the mortgage and give him the house that would be dumb\nAnd people often do that in a divorce they often do that but just\nYou know the negotiation is the cars in his name he keeps his car your cars and your name you keep your car you're checking accounts are already separated there's no other debt you get your student loan debt I'm ... does he have any big savings or investments or to you and for one case\n[noise] I'm not big now how much am I Am I Am a\nTen thousand ... four one K. and I'm not sure what he had um but I was thinking about five or six thousand not much at all okay as far as what answers income\nIt's around Ninety thousand\nOkay in most states your attorney would have to advise you but in most states you would be do some alimony after twenty two years\nAnd that will going with your fifty thousand is how you will reset your life and stay out of debt and start working your way through these student loans that are outrageous and we're going to take some time to work through\n'em but you're going to be working extra job you're going to be doing everything else taking any any money you can squeeze out of your budget and you are not going to Mexico you gotta mess on your hands [laughter]\nOkay no I'm not here\nSo I'm unless it's to escape no just kidding [laughter] ah but the ... so you know you're going to be on beans and rice rice and beans you're going to get the cheapest department you can get you going to stay debt free and address these student loans as soon as you can get stabilize the\nAfter the separation which will lead to divorce unless it leads to you all getting back together okay\nBut you pro care for separation the same way financially you would prepare for a divorce and that puts you in a position of strength\nTo negotiate in the divorce financially um and that's something that you'll have to do and your attorney and you get representation and you'd be ready to pay them pile up money for deposits and for paying them don't pay extra on the student loans until you get the other side of this\nAnd I'll just put 'em on ... and pay nothing right now\nBut let's get the other side has but my hope is is that you guys you can see a counselor who can give you some words to say some tools to give ... wake up call maybe the two you sit down with a coach or counselor and walk you through turning the corner on all of this before you get so far around the corner we can't get you back\nAnd may be you can save this thing I I that would be best for everybody involved I'm\nAssuming the issues that you have that are causing you such concern or addressed and I'm sure that I'm sort of like a pretty long list but I'm just I don't address them ... see a counselor for your sake call your pastor say who can I sit down with can walk me through\n'em\nIn the right questions to ask myself the right questions to ask him um 'cause he may think you're kidding oh he may think you're bluffing and when you actually move out it may it may wake him up and he may be willing to work on that list at that point I don't know\nBut those kinds of things are best guided by a really good marriage counselor\nThat's really experienced in wise and a DOD Lee council a will help you in that situation and I sure hope you guys can turn that around that would be my hope for you\nIt'd be better for all of you are financially as well as everything else so good question thank you for joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five you jump and we'll talk about your life and your money\nInteresting data that just came out on the article I read on the air about marriage\nAnd um [noise] the men who are married and make more on average about

you like as frequently as about three years ago and started doing the same way uh we ended up going out to get out of debt I'm from New York teaching a my father died about five years ago on a motorcycle act and and um\nThere were a bunch of life insurance policy that went through our personal financial adviser has been advising my mother ... ban 'em and the question that I have and he put her in any new lady about um\nFive years ago whenever my dad died a three hundred thousand dollars and the immunity um and then the other end up in Egypt and back then and they've been growing a little bit here and there um but the question is the annuity recently with a five year mark\nAnd advising to pull the money I turned ... which I think in a good idea however the question is is that\nShe should have should have had that money impacted initially at the beginning of the ah Carnegie Mellon upbringing putting in ... she brings home about thirty five hundred dollars a month and retirement and Social Security but he doesn't need the wrong man unity at all you know and he knew the beginning of the time\nYou know well yeah you're right I that makes me question and other things that are going on that I don't know what they are from you I'm but I I\nI Am I personally would have put all of it and the good investments at the time um\nYou know it is the home paid off\nAlmost paid off one hundred percent Carter paid off she has the wrote that he wrote\nGood good okay and how much is investments total there's three hundred plus I'm\nYeah we're looking at probably about four hundred and twenty four hundred and fifty thousand a total with all the investment to how another fifty to sixty Honda really honored their\nOld is she\nUh she ... she just turned sixty okay cool and then she didn't write out because you know like on an old ... year old on her way out I think right now [laughter]\nGood I'm feeling better fifty seven to hear you say that so um [laughter] uh I'm not on my way out that I either a anyway or at least ... to my knowledge anyway so yeah I I'm probably gonna collection and all of that I mean it's um\nIt's not it's not like you put her in whole life policy which will be like a deal breaker or something silly like that I mean it just the annuity is is you know got a lot more fees to it a lot more commission to it and if it was a variable annuity in the money was in good mutual funds are probably performed okay\nUh they're okay um but it's not my favorite thing to do but it's not to the point that I like question his entire competency I just really want to know if it wasn't right for her ... if it's not right for her now why wasn't right for her then that's a good question in your mind Mr advisor\nAnd um I think you've got the right to ask that question and talk it through with them and if you can't get a comfort level or if he goes up on you and starts having an attitude and that's when you know it's time to move to anyway so you do that with any financial people or people that are advise you on technical\nMatters when they start getting like like you have to owe them an explanation instead of vice versa it's time to move on\nInsurance lady gets the attitude is Tom move on ride your state plan or\nIs too smart to sit down and explain something to you\nIn this town to move on so you know you just you gotta get folk in
