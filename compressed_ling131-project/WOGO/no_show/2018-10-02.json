from\nUm from twenty four years old I just graduated a community college about a year ago um and I might prefer it in and out um however I said to myself wait wait and get back here [noise] um I don't know why did he have to consider the amount of money that I make 'em so if you\nUm how much we can get fat I said I'm like OK or pay check 'em can move out and everything that I Want to say that I Am fortunate to have parents kind enough to let you have like free\nThat's for sure okay what do you make um monthly I thought about the history and is that and that's after graduating okay what is your degree\nIt's actually a couple of colleges but um I actually got a job with the teachers to help 'em my career\nSo when ... year career kicking in\n[noise] um I'm I'm actually\nTaking ... while I'm On I'm going to get money to fight them educational take up the car so I say about that like to about a year\nOkay well at eleven hundred a month we're talking about a little over Thirteen thousand dollars a year that's you're not going to you're going to make it on that in Raleigh out on your own okay you're not making enough to do that so we've got to get your income up that's why I was asking and so um yeah we need to double your income\nYou know pretty quick here as fast as you have and when you can double your income and then I Would go get a you know an inexpensive apartment maybe a roommate or whatever and just get started on your own and the main thing there is make sure you have no bad do you have any general\n[noise] um who had about at a very down our twelve thousand dollars a day I'm which my parents um I count up to 'em that they're taking care of that so\nI just thought that I can establish more credit\nWhere do you mean they're taking care of that so they can take the money and they offered to pay a whole lot loan officer [laughter] okay\nThat you know we don't need you to establish any more credit you don't need any that you you don't make enough money to breathe hardly okay so when you were one hundred percent that free\nMe and then you build an emergency fund of three to six months of expense for the show like five thousand dollars or set aside for emergencies then you would start saving towards your home and by then you are also in your first apartment and you just start saving as fast as you can and you won't put down as much as you can possibly\nDepartment and you just start saving as fast as you can and you won't put down as much as you can possibly put down how old are you you said you're twenty four\nOkay go ahead or you got a good plan so hopefully in the next twelve to Eighteen months you can see that income spike up as you start using your cosmetology degree\nAnd um because you know when you were Thirteen thousand and when you get your twenty six thousand quick as we can this doubling that's still not a lot of money but that'll at least get you out there and get your moving in and get your career to start to build\nSo hey thanks for the call we appreciate you listening Ian is with us from prince Edward Hi Ian how are you\n[laughter] I Do thanks for taking my call\nSure what's up\nMy wife and I we've got five boys five kids and we just moved into our dream on a three years ago or ten twelve acres a locked room could it could turn around but the last few months we just started your plan and we're in baby steps you\nAnd Georgia thinking um I mean we've got thirty five thousand and besides the house and we're just not sure if we want and we need to sell the house just to be free or which is ... through the next ten Fifteen Years and just make it happen\nTen to Fifteen Years remain pay my house and everything\nYeah like ... where you know we have Twenty years left my mortgage\nMhm so what's your house you can come\nIt's about Seventy care take home pay\nTake home but All right yeah and um then what is your house payment\n[noise] it is around twelve hundred a month and a\nHouse payments not on the line here that's fine you know but you got a lot of ... you got a lot of kids and you're not used to living on a limited budget and you're going to start that\nWere egg yeah\nBecause you've got thirty five ... got thirty five hours to clean up I mean you really need to clean that up it's probably going to take a year and a half two years but something like that you need no longer than two years you need to have this debt cleaned up\nRight what is the thirty five thousand in debt what kind of that\nA ... or the long run or parents and part of it is my credits twenty five on a credit and kind of ground to learn from our parents\nOkay she'll just a line of credit what'd you bond with a line of credit\nOh it's just been life has just been there about a piano a few years ago [noise] or just miscellaneous things\nOkay and that's over right yeah not doing that anymore right\nNo no no we were like we are just sick and tired we just wanna be free\nYou know we love the place would my I don't think I don't think you need to sell the house houses knocking on your twelve hundred bucks out of a fifty eight hundred dollar take home pay is not on the line\nYou're oh you're okay on our house but you do have to get your written budget get on every dollar you're written budget and get that going as quick as you can ever dollar dot com and I'm starting to you know using the app on your phone\nAnd you guys need to squeeze every dollar so that you clear there's thirty five 'cause if you can quarter the thirty five you're going to have pretty good room in this budget even with five kids and you can clear and it's just going to take a year and a half two years just a year and a half two years or Seventeen five a year out of Seventy thousand take home that's doable\nYou can do that as a lay down and you can do that a thirty five thousand dollar Seventy thousand with five kids that means one year I don't think you're going to do that so somewhere between the one in the two and that's on landing on Eighteen months Richard is with us Richards in Salt Lake City Hi Richard how are you\nGoing great got how can I help [noise]\nSo I'm Wondering about emerging thick until we have a fully funded a merging onto it out of three to six months [noise] good\nTo have about Fifteen thousand in there [laughter] I'm at my job offer H up they account and they match up to Fifteen hundred dollars a year great um should should I fully fund the account and should account that\nTowards any of our emergency Fonda\nHolly funded to get that match that's wonderful and the ... of course you can only be used for one kind of an emergency and that's medical bills it will lots of other kinds of emergencies pop up and so um do you do you do both of you work in this house for as a single income\nYou know single income okay and what's your household income of around sixty and what do you do er nurse\nYou're a nurse okay very very stable career meaning that if you were to lose a job you can get another one in twenty minutes\nNursing is just a fabulous career field so in terms of ah accessibility even add hours anytime you want to add hours you can buy at all you can change direction all kinds of stuff you just really and landed in a sweet spot there so very very good on that given that you've got that type of a career that should not\nSo specialized that it might take you six months to find a job if you'll often or something like your six minutes um then given that that's the situation I Would back and do you fully fund you're the one that I just say between the three to six months of expenses range I Would back down to the three months\nOkay and so that's kind of like partially leaning on the ... say as part of your emergency fun but it's certainly not we're not really counting it because I mean you can have lots of emergencies that have nothing to do with medical on your life\nWhen you can get you again you could lose a job you could um have the death of a relative and you had to pay for the funeral or wanted to pay for the funeral you can have all kinds of different things happen transmission blow out the car and all kinds of things\nCan happen that aren't medical and you can't use the ages I Dream of medical [noise]\nSo I don't generally counted in the emergency fund but I'm looking at your career stability and the fact you got a big fat I just said with a big fat match only interest is wonderful both of them then that makes me very comfortable being on the three months side of the three to six months [noise] rain for your emergency [noise]\n\n\n\n\nOne question I get asked all the time is do I need life insurance listen the whole point of life insurance was to replace your income for someone who counts on you so if you have a spouse or you have kids yes you need term life insurance is\nThe only way to protect them until you're out of debt and build up your ... your only digging a deeper hole if you waste money on cash value plans says it robs you of their ability to make real progress\nAnd that's why I send you to the sand or insurance and I have for Twenty years that's where I get all my insurance and they only offer the plans I recommend it is not expensive it's not complicated\n... will be there as your guide to every step of the way visit Sandra dot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two you need to get this taken care of I can give you the advice and I can tell you where to go but it's really up to you to take an important step to get your family protected\nUm and then obviously the plan that you guys set forth um and then you have to be real with yourself and I think not not live the entitled lifestyle that you're going to borrow other people's money to lose I mean\nYou know we talked about this and if you make thirty thousand dollars in this country are more blessing probably Ninety nine percent of people in the world and I think you just kind of have to square your shoulders and say hey this is what I Want and it wasn't fun you know she was she was working three literally three job she had three different jobs really I got credentialed at another university and I would go in because I have a lot of time off with my job and I\nI didn't want to I didn't want to drive three hours and stay the night on my days off in ... at a University in and work extra but\nYou know seeing them in the rearview mirror made me want to do with that much more and just get it done and\nIt's you know I I mean what did you make it that gang for my average income is probably you know without working extra is probably one Seventy five um up how much on that extra\nProbably another ten or Fifteen just in a short period of time and then and then I started getting more opportunities at my at my institution um and you know I got the only lease it I think he would approve of\nThis is a day ran the least um when I sold my truck I was going on Craig's list and I was going to buy a beat her for a thousand bucks and my dad's got more cars and he knows what to do with and I said hey I'll give you a thousand dollars if you let me drive the Pontiac for the next year and\nIt's an old beat up Pontiac and I'm driving two miles to work and um you said yeah don't shop salute Lee so\nUm you know at least at least ... at least it from him for a year [laughter]\nSo
