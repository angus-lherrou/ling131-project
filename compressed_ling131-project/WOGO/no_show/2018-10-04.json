and I'm thrilled\nTo be joined in Studio by the best selling author of business boutique Christie writes perceived to be with you hey this is\nTalk about that you you always have a really good that we haven't got caught and we're going to be talking about career and\nBusiness they are many times one in the same as what Christie and I are dedicated to wear excited take your calls so for this hour you've got a career questions you got a business question something you always dreamed\nOf starting maybe just started maybe haven't started yet oh my goodness Christie right can help you out we're going to have big fun if you get some confusion you're dealing with in your career maybe you're scared you know exactly what you want to do what you're just terrified well there's no shame in that we all face those\nYou know exactly what you want to do what you just terrified well there's no shame in that we all face those fears and we've got to step into those fears and maybe you're just stuck you're stuck in a job where it's just sucking the life out of you\nAnd you can't wait to get the friday afternoon if that is due to day is your day make the call we're here to help triple eight eight to five\nFive two to five triple eight eight to five five two to five will started off with Katie who's on the line in Ogden, Utah Katie how can we help\nI think are taking my call Cher I'm well I'm I'm feeling really confused about um life right now I'm a little background about five years ago I stopped going to school when my husband and I found out that I was pregnant and since then I've worked all kinds of our job to pay for him to finish\nAnd he recently finished you got a great job now and we're starting to kick our debt but they ran out um which is difficult\nUm to help out I've been applying to places that I don't really want truck out just because you know we need that money and I don't know how you know much else going on for\nMe and I'm twenty six I've got two kids I'd like to stay home um but I Know I Want to work and I want to help out and I feel like I locked myself and I have no idea where to even start to find my interests are my strength yeah\nWell I understand that you feel that way but that is an absolute wiser you have to acknowledge the fact that that's just a lack of confidence there's some self doubt it's creeping because you've been at home for a while\nAnd here's another reality reality is that right now to Katie in America we have more jobs that are available than there are people who were unemployed it is a fantastic job market even for stay at home moms meaning you want to stay home but work from the home\nAnd so what you have to first do is get very very clear you're in that first stage and that is the stage of discovery so you've really got to get clear on what you do best and if you're struggling with the confidence on that I Want you to sit down with two or three people in your life and the next two or three days I mean right away make this urging\nPeople who will tell you the truth and I want you to say to them what do I do best of all the things I Do well what do I do best and then the second question is\nThey didn't take long eleven has um I'd love to go to that function as a wellness center so off or to God but financial colds and other things to ... or physical mental and oil shale health\nBut I think about that one in my house buying and he'll play you know where I live up here and there will be the sensor might consider it that is that\nWhat they're doing some sort of liability\nWell go ahead you\nKnow like if someone wants to get hurt a lot I Know that could apply for the in the ... so that will go after the fitness but if I Lived in the same thing\nWith that there but I don't know I'm Wondering if that would be an issue\nYou've got a couple of things going on here put chicken I Want to own a a been a little bit how each of them first of all um that's probably going to be state specific so you definitely need to look at the laws and your state in any type of regulations\nI'm you're going to have liabilities regardless whether it's a stand alone studio or it's where you live so you're you're going to have liability if someone gets hurt and you need to know what those are and to protect yourself with insurance um professional insurance products based insurance if you have a product that type of things do you want to look into that\nBut I Do just want to challenge you and one thing for ... I Love your idea I Love the idea of a wellness center I Love the idea that you're helping people but here that are traditionally encourage people to do\nBecause you don't currently have a yoga studio and you don't have the idea of validated\nI Want to challenge you to start a little bit smaller and a little sooner so I'll give you an example\nWhere is there a wellness center community center yoga studio ... studio somewhere where you could start your business sublease third base and they're off hours build your brand build the demand you have no risk no overhead no upfront cost\nAnd you're able to validate your idea until the business justify you getting your own space be that a duplex that you live above or your own standard on space I'll give an example there are a lot of churches\nThat will operate when they're getting started out of like elementary school the elementary school right next door household they don't have school on Sundays so they rented out to a church that use it on Sunday\nAnd it's just great deal to win when it's additional revenue for the school the church has a place to go without having to afford a whole building seven days a week when they can't justify it and I've seen a lot of businesses do that so\nI don't think your idea is a bad idea I Would just challenge you to start smaller and sooner on a lower risk level lower cost level and validate your idea and build those relationships build your brand in your demand\nGet that going and then when you're ready to have your own studio it's the next logical step it doesn't feel like a terrifying\nAnd then when you're ready to have your own studio it's the next logical step it doesn't feel like a terrifyingly so you don't really want to look into laws and regulations for liability but also when you think about your space before you make that big commitment [noise]\nPatricia are you a lot of phone are you working full time right now\nRight and I work full time and I went to Iran are on I was planning on going back but let's share and that way um I said I'll be I'll be making more money but it'll help them find like I said well\nYeah I well I ... you can I just wanted to know that fact because this this that piece of information please beautifully knew what you're saying\nShe's going to have to do this on the side anyway she's not in a position to open up anything I don't think you were trying to go round open it right um I I just want to see maybe do a little bit of yoga for some people maybe two or three moms when I see if you can get a small group to pay you\nBecause it's everything you just said but it allows you to tip toe into it or the nurse practitioner thing that's going to school to get that will make more money I Love that too could allow her to cash flow have more cash piled on when it's time to to operate so I mean ... you nailed it there I I just think ... you know don't rush into the\nWell and the other thing I Want to call out for anyone listening right now that has a service based business and like a yoga studio you have a tendency to think that the studio is the business it's not it's you know and what you can go anywhere you can go to people's houses you can go to the park outside\nThey're coming and paying for you don't feel like you have to have a location\nBefore you can start your business because you are the business so you can start to market to get out of your living room if you want to or the ... down the street and by the way you should go ahead totally yeah yeah don't wait for the studio studio is not the business you are the business point people don't care I Know they don't ... enjoy it to come in for you they're not counting for the building\nTriple eight eight to five five two to five triple eight to five five two to five ... ran to the shower take your calls about your business your business idea or a career career change career question let's go to bill is on the line and Detroit Michigan bill how can we\nGo out and get attacked you good luck on how can we do well\nI've been on the chief field for about Twenty years and\nTo this point it really hasn't ban I haven't progressive far like clear as I originally hoped and wished I had\nA long story short is I'm back in January was that I went through a pie view and as we're about to a baby steps Romney's stuff too right now\nGoing through some of our stuff together grabs they'll go on a became and choose old home movie a fish from stuff that she had gotten from bad um when he had died um and\n\nAll the things we found you know we had a lot of old eight millimeters old VHS law stuff and it's like okay we have a lot of stuff [noise]\nUm I started converting it and I really found a passion for that that I haven't had in the future part of the aisle and I'm thinking okay this sounds like something I could turn into a great business I Love doing going forward\nA slick at this point bill and\nBill let me interrupt what is the bit to get right to what is the business with the military or what is the business\nI'm converting legacy format like even though Mader VHS wide so low that uh could digital content and properly preserve them\nOkay and so what's your question for us then\nUm we bought a question I have is just um\nHow\nTo get started um I definitely want to get started and I just want to make sure I'm stepping throw it a properly and the um\n... or tell you what Bill crushed that\nBill ... he's ready to go she can because we only have a little bit of time here I Want to be able to get to your your solution\nWe want to make sure we might help yeah here's the thing about the great news dance\nOr when you were entering a space where there's already people doing what you want to do it means the ideas prevent so you're not doing something that's never been done before there are actually businesses have similar type services what you didn't know is yes you're solving a problem and if you're solving a problem it's a viable business idea\nYou just have to find people that have that problem that had the eight millimeters they want to preserve them and you're going to learn how who that person is you're going to go after them and build a business for them so you're going to price them you're going to create marketing language that speak to them right where they are the best part about this bill as you know the idea is valid because it's been done before what you're going to do\nIs you're going to build your business and you're going to get better and you're going to serve your customers and they're gonna want to come to you because you make a unique space for yourself in that market a bill I Know my book is for women but I'm going to send it to you men read it all the time to business principles are the same and it gives you plan to take that idea to market to help it helps we'll get we'll send that to you or women's rights\nGreat plans will follow it and and here's this thing a ... a lot of bills out there he said something that's interesting he finds these old things and you realize way I don't have to have this\nAnd and you were giving him the steps the book is going to walk into it but I Want to just had when they try it just tested almost all of that last call here's why some passion should be hobby\nIt changes things when you turn it into the lengths that what you made a great point other people are doing this he just got to find people that are willing to pay him to do it\nAnd keep paying him into others have you need this done me tell you about bill he's got to start really small but start right away stop thinking about it stopped getting landing just you know in the water just do a triple eight eight to five\nFive to two by coming up more of your questions about career starting a business [noise] don't go anywhere\nYou've heard me talk about ideas for years and how it's only a matter of time before you become a victim but I run across some numbers that even surprised me and shows the real nightmare the people go through when they become a victim of the sixteen million victims of identity theft last year yes sixteen million\nTwenty six percent of them have to borrow money from family or friends\nTwenty two percent of them lost even more money by taking time off work and nine hundred thousand victims took out payday loans\nThis stuff is a freaking nightmare\nThat's why the only plant on him from my family and my entire team is through Zander insurance the sander takes over all the work to solve these problems in more along with the system to reduce your risk and protect your money if your accounts get hacked\nPerfect I mean they don't pay that salary yeah\nThe the reason I'm asking because when you go out on your own even if it's just getting that first client or two that can be the scariest part to validate can I Do it on my own and can I make the sale and can run this whole thing without having a boss that kind of back me\nAnd you're already doing it and that's why I'm so excited in Haiti because you're just going to do more of what you're already doing a little bit and just like Ken that\nYou've got this light at the end of the tunnel when you're going to start to increase your family household income in other ways to your husband\nBut in the meantime if you want to spend the next two to three months building up the demand to clients the relationship even just taking people to coffee starting to gather interests of other independent projects you could run on your own that could run through just new architecture firm that you're going to run as an independent person then\nYou're building it up and of course it will be crazy first season because you're getting more and more demand but then\nWhen you decide to leave your full time job it the next logical step where the business can support you the income is they are of course that's only going to help and your husband had income\nSo you're all ready I Would say twenty to thirty percent down the path and doing this you're not starting from scratch or not like I have full time job and I want to do this totally different thing how do I started out\nYou're already doing it you already have clients you're working with I just want you to do more of that and then the next few months as you build that up that will start to ramp up as your husband's income comes in and it looks like first year he probably should be able to comfortably leisure Labor Day job\nAnd it comes down to a formula you gotta work days maybe step stays baby steps fund the dream so when you put enough money aside plus decide businesses there and then that's how you get to that number where you can step aside into Christie's point does not have to be a ... jump right it should be a nice move and it just takes a little bit of time and patience lays on her way\nThe light at the end of the tunnels and important point can cause so many people still like how can I sustain this well you're not until January when you ... you know this is the first season him to put my head down for a season them and had the rewards ... worth of things right\nAll right let's go to ray real quick in Orlando, Florida re how can we help\n[noise] hey how you doing guys um okay so I've been in the field for the past Eighteen years and ah I Love the field the past six years I've been doing the security um which I Love even more\nUm I feel I feel though where I'm at I'm store to the next level to go off it'd be manager\nLevel and I

moved to your house\nI'm I reach of ... my wife also works um as a um [noise] she has a good job gotcha I I just looking at possibly start something on the side and see if I Would like to take that I

always tell me I'm going to fail\nIf I Move out and I'm not going to make it on my own so I just kind of a lot because you know I have adult one year old son so\nI'm really scared and kind of make that move and I don't know if I can do it and kept my dad and pay off his car now\nAnd how much do you own a car\nUm [noise] I it's not in my name and my mom's name but it almost six hundred dollars a month\nRight um what are they saying are they saying it's about I Do\nUm well I mean she's helping they pay them\n\nUm well I mean she's helping they pay them you know they should I say hey all of it\nUm you know I could get a car and mining and she's like a card that we had a car even leave before and it was ... it was almost paid off out of the co signed on it and she I reach out and I had no choice because um I was in college you\nKnow you have a lot of eight or ... you just made a bad choice\nBecause you can't afford how could you can't afford a ... dollar car payment yeah and I can see that just insanity and yeah you need to sell the car the car is her name it didn't hurt I Am right and so once you get the cargo\nYes we had a heart previously and when I got pregnant she felt like okay I'm going to get her a\nNew car she thought she was doing a favor for any you know um because of all I had ... and ... and now she hoped it I was in my head I ... and\n... and his heart and yeah\nIt's not holding over your head it's a burden you guys do the ... thing together and it's costing both of you so she's right about all of that um what's\nThat I tell her to get a car yeah you did what's the car worse\nUm what I don't know how much it wet but she had three or ... she got and I hear the ... the pay a dollar a month for me I okay what do you make I make an\nA\nPredator weighing the job I have I make like twenty two three year uh me and my wife of nine thousand three hundred and forty\nTwo dollars and mhm what do you do with their care professional you're a what\nA direct care so I take care of people who are ah developmentally disabled and work on behavioral stuff\nAnd you make twenty two thousand dollars a year ... okay\nSo ah\nBasically I have an opportunity to locate from where I Am in Montana back to Boston which is where I'm from\n... and the single job would double my income mhm [noise]\nIn doing so I Would not be bringing my family with me at first I had the opportunity stay free with my father and work\nMhm why would why would have family there are with you um affordability\nI Can't afford to move them I mean we're girl even have a foundation to arouse knowledge to start paying offered to I mean right now I'm dealing with like negative cash flow\nRight does your wife work outside the home\n[noise] uh no she target for your for kids okay yeah right and do you own a home you know Iraq okay\nAnd so basically you get a loan your furniture and or a U Haul and pull it across the country and be in Boston and get an apartment right\n[noise] um well I'm a long haul yes but short term I Would try a plane ticket why not load your wife up and go\nOut and have the money to put them a little apartment mhm okay\nSo uh where you're going to be making twice as much though so how quickly would you be moving them\nOr or she's pregnant with her to show the thought process would be in the summer probably August after birth\nOh I'm not doing their\nI'm leaving my pregnant wife and four kids halfway around the dead gum world and go live with your ... not a chance I'm Alone in her up and moving to measure what can you can have your family help you a little bit I mean it won't cost much to get moved maybe the employer would give the new employer will give you an advance to get your moved into your new apartment\nUm there's a possibility with the\nYeah you need a load up your family and get out of there but you know not being with your pregnant wife while she's carrying what your fifth child you're in Boston and she's in Montana dude that is not okay [laughter] I mean\nNot in the military you're not you're not required to be separated like that you're just making bad choices\nNow you need you need a scrape together a few dollars and go deliver some pizzas or something in a for a month and and ... you know thousand Fifteen hundred bucks and get you a U Haul and get your button gear and enroll low on over to a Boston and take the job\nOr move in with your dad for a month with the whole dead gum crew over there if you can something like that\nMoving with your dad for a month with the whole dead gum crew over there if you can something like that I mean you need to find a different way but this idea you're going to lay bringing your whole family\nAnd while your wife is ... no no no that's not going to work out for you that's going to end poorly aren't going to share your bag thanks for calling in men is one of those bands in Colorado Springs I ban how are you\nYeah you do better than I deserve what's up\nThere I Am self employed I'm a real estate agent and we've got the thousand dollars for your baby steps one and our [noise] but they were were\nKind of a crossroads on how to how to go up to about going on with the next babysit I'm of the opinion which isn't in your plan\nBut you know because I'm self employed and money is always there I Need to have oh you know two two months or so of income to fall back on in ... to be able to make the budget\nThat does your wife work she does not she's a stay at home mother and so you're not make any money in the real estate business\nI mean I'm making a hundred thousand a hundred and ten thousand a year\nSomewhere in there they are not having you know the role months\nIf not they need zero month or during the winter in Colorado there's um a month or slower than others where you know making the making the budget the would be tight tighter him where we're at right\nNow I don't I don't I never expand the baby step on emergency fund what I Would do is if your income is truly vulnerable and I think yours is not as volatiles your acting like it is you might get a hundred grand and your whining about running out of money I mean really\nYou really need to stop and think about what you just said but anyway if you're going to go to zero in December because nobody's buying a house in Colorado Springs in December you don't want to have zero money I'll go along with that part but I don't think that's what's really happening you might get eight thousand dollars a month average\nSo I'm a five hundred to ten thousand a month whatever so anyway set some aside but we're not going to call it an emergency fund and we're not going to add to the thousand dollar account we call it a hill in the valley account the hill and valley is the volatility of your income\nThe hill is when they come as good the valley is when it's bad and so if you want to say that a couple of ground over there in that in addition to the thousand two separate accounts wanted for emergencies and one is for if you run out of money because you don't make any money in a month\nBut dude I don't think you're really doing that I think you need to go back and actually look at your cash flow analyze your revenue streams for however long you been in the business and go how many times have are really run out of money\nI mean you can make money and so um I don't I don't think it's happening if you told me you might forty thousand dollars in real estate business I can imagine you having some zero much but you're not you know it's not what you're telling me you're making money\nA year just afraid of the volatility and you know that's reasonable so go back and track your revenues and charge revenues and if they truly are dipping down below what it takes to exist in your house\nIn giving in certain months over in a long period of time you can go back go you know every January and February I'm always screwed this is where we are then okay set some money aside to cover that so that you do that but I don't think it's as bad as your emotions are telling you it is\nAnd uh but no we're not changing the emergency fund we might have a hill and valley account if you truly have\nA volatile income Mark's with us in Seattle Highmark welcome to the day Ramsey show\nYeah thank Dave hey it's a great honor to talk with [noise] [noise] yeah I Know you had a great impact on changed my life five years ago um do you think you\nAre currently I I I got a ... question I'm In baby steps eggs are the only thing right now I'm paying off my um do you\nGet a net worth of a half million dollars uh [noise]\nWhat happened was this five years ago I I left a small company with a great a company culture when I hear you talk about your company that the company I was working for a very similar culture I was making an average salary for what I did I went to a competitor I with much more of you making\nUm I was making a eighty thousand dollars a year what do you make now\nI make a hundred and forty thousand dollars a year\nOn your question is what I make my question is I really miss that small company culture and um I have an opportunity to go back to a smaller company of about a hundred people start up [noise] um I think it would be a really\nReally interesting to get back into that culture um I just kind of lost my passion for my work\nAnd um you know I should have to work every day I get great reviews um\nI'd probably go back but I Want some equity or I Want some indication that I can earn my way back up to what you're actually worse in the marketplace\nThis idea that in order to have a good work environment you have to make less [noise]\nIs not necessary is not necessarily an assumption I'm going with\nSo maybe that particular company can't pay you but if you want you could probably find somebody whether these are soldiers and pay you what your worst\nThis is the day Ramsey\nDid you know statistically when it comes to life insurance in protecting your family that women are more likely to be uninsured or under insured than men this doesn't make any sense women make up half the workforce contributes mightily to family incomes\nAnd in many cases are the breadwinners and take care of their families twenty four hours a day this is one of the most overlooked areas when it comes to financial planning maybe it's a relic of the past but a loss of income or the need to replace family care\nIs equally important for women\nAs it is for men single moms working moms and stay at home moms all need term life insurance rates are actually lower for women which is why I send your designed or insurance they shop the top term life companies to find the lowest rates available you can compare rates on line at ... dot com or call eight hundred three five six\nAnd you know so I Do not understand why anyone would do business with people like Wells Fargo or bank of America it's beyond me\nThey treat you like crap and they over charge you for most of the services and this day and time their online offerings of their Web banking systems are not any more sophisticated\nOr not that good they're not good at anything\nSo I I just don't get it so that that's why we endorse credit unions you hear me in some of your city is endorsing a local credit union or a local small town community type bank\nAnd I'm just a a huge fan of using that for your ah your banking service needs and it's what I did\nEverything I endorse on the show is stuff that that I personally do or what do you know in your situation I kind of a thing I don't have anything is inconsistent like I'm too big or too good to do that I I'm not I don't have a need for some of the things that we tell ya get but\nYou know ... you know in most cases I'm a customer personally Ted is with us Ted's in York, Pennsylvania Hi Jen how are you\nI'm doing better than I deserve how're you doing\nJust the same how can I help\nAll right well thank you and your staff right you're doing it's a blessing thank you um how will be meeting our lifestyle saving operation about ten to Fifteen Years if I don't get hit by a bus [laughter]\nAnd I want to know if I a fight continue funding NHL say with my employer contributing a couple of hundred bucks a year or should I just put that extra money into a Roth IRA or four one K.\nWas or just a couple of hundred bucks a year a company I don't know if she\nCan put you come out they're matching a couple of hundred bucks a year and more okay show the the nature of ... what kind of life saving operation if you're going to happen to him years what is it\nI think it'll ever ooh I got home yes the so yeah fortunately if you can't live without\nYeah I've heard that you know our Sean ... ... it's a it's a slow a slow progression then\nYeah it is they they asked a mate that you know Seventeen years out south okay yeah I got to figure to right around the time I'm going to retire so I'm trying to you know retiring early you know if I can\nYou know I think the thing is the uh what you're gonna want is a ... you you you got to have the cash in your age as saying or somewhere else in an investment to cover what's going to come out of your pocket I assume you're talking to health insurance is going to cover a large portion of this correct\nYeah that if I don't retire um and I'll be on um either ... or some other type of insurance policy\nYeah I think I'd be on cobra or or I wouldn't retire because this is a guessing this is a multi hundred thousand dollar event isn't it\nProbably half\nNow and so I'm thinking we're going to term retirement around this a little bit um or and or cobra one of the two if you want to retire early you're just going to have to pony up for the cupboard with cover only last about two years or something [noise]\nUm I don't know you can keep that in definitely so I I think that's number one I Want to make sure you got health insurance to cover the vast majority of this I don't want to\nTime that poorly ah but then how much if you got coming out of pocket a over ten years you could put five thousand dollars a year end of that age essay or whatever your big the duck double is what's your ducked double\n[noise] um [noise] ... yeah you\nOr whatever that adoptable is on the age of say a year\nOh now the age I say that health insurance I Know of fun\nYou know the edge essays are health savings account that is attached to a health and a chess a health insurance policy that has a high dollar ... policy\nIt it depends uh depends on a policy I picked it either six to nine nine thousand\nDollars is what I'm Talking about you can put up to that amount per year into that savings account\nThat would be six thousand half the other side really fun that yes and I don't touch it until I you know pretty dire yes\nAnd here's why so when you're when you need the money out of pocket to cover the whatever comes out of pocket on on the liver surgery a and you\nKeep your health insurance in place then you've got this big juicy health savings accounts sitting there in and use mutual funds in it and I let it grow over the next ten years be as big as a ... there's no downside of that whatever you don't need for the liver\nTransplant or liver trans whatever the processors they're whatever you don't need you can pull out\nAnd just pay taxes on no penalties at sixty five and

Saddam of National Review melting pot or civil war a brief cogent book ... review in City Journal\nThat's a very that's a great title melting pot or civil war that's exactly exactly right so\nHis parents ... parents came from Bangladesh\nAnd we're talking about this a very important to you taught me something it's a very important distinction not all immigrants\nContrary to what I had implied not all immigrants from the end of the nineteenth century went to their own enclosed communities in the United states so what changed in the Nineteen twenties\nFor what changed in the Nineteen twenties is that when you put in place immigration restriction legislation it really changed the landscape for the immigrants were already in the country they face less competition from newcomers\nAnd so it was somewhat easier for them declined the economic ladder that's not to say that that restriction was motivated by the purists motives in every case\nBut the upshot is that it gave some breathing room particularly to those working class immigrants so they could enter the American middle class\nAnd also their kids wind up living in the suburbs\nThey wound up forming these more integrated communities and embracing an American identity they might still uh you know clean to some aspects of their older ethnic identity\nBut it was more symbolic rather than a live the experience that separated them from other Americans and I think that that's a big important part of the story of why you wound up having more unified more cohesive\nAmerican middle class culture and those years\nVent it specifically that there were limitations on immigration in other words that I Want to know if I'm summarizing your point accurately\nBack is much more likely to ensure a melting pot than separation if there are restrictions on immigration is that correct summary\nYes I Do believe that having control having some limits\nAs opposed to having an uncontrolled policy can make a big difference it makes that melting pot more likely to happen that doesn't mean I'm saying we should go back to the policies of the Nineteen twenties but it does mean when you need to be mindful of the context\nIn which immigrants arriving to us All right you're looking into are rising in a in a context of racial division in which you're of identity politics and identity politics extremism it's going to be a very different\nOkay back so I was just going to say that's the second part of your title you made the case on the melting pot but your title is melting pot or civil war question mark so the civil war comes when everybody has their own identities\nExactly when you have a situation in which you have people who are fighting over not just class differences but also over ethnic differences\nThe danger is that you might get some kind of group that sees itself as a marginalized excluded underclass and that ethnic dimension to that and then you get demagogue politicians\nWho are claiming that hey wait a second the reason you're in this position is because of the other people with their wealth\nAnd with their power that's why you need to tear down the system that's what I fear is going to happen in the years to come you're going to get this kind of getting a dog or eat it does identity politics will become even more extreme and you'll get even more\nSocialist politicians will and grace this kind of identity extremely him\nSo I the reason I ask you earlier about what language was in your home was I I Do not at all oppose impact I'm for", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Hallie", "day": "04"}
