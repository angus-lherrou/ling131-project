I Hope that all of them lose this time they want all lose because we have a two party system in this country but the point about this is it there's a difference between evil\nAnd foolishness or even

us to resolve\nOur differences peacefully\nWe must recognize that we are all Americans and we are stronger and healthier when we are United\nOkay I think it's tough to disagree with that and particularly in the context of what I began by talking about which is the case of a Christian Woman whose name as a C a bb she's illiterate but then a lot of people in Pakistan are particularly women\nAnd by the way that's not an anti woman comment that's a pro woman comment I mean one of the things that is deeply dysfunctional about a lot of the Islamic countries in the world is that uh

the way I Do think militant uncompromising secularism has become something of religion in the United states where joined about Saudi Arabia\nTurkey hockey's done well how bout Decatur, Georgia there's a case in Decatur, Georgia that is just\nUnbelievable as an assault not only on religious faith but on the common sense\nAnd it's one of those cases that I think should convince you about why you have to get involved the alliance defending freedom\nBecause they're standing up for people who are victimized by this kind of insanity and one of the people who is doing the most to stand up to this kind of insanity is our guest his name is Matt Sharp\nHe is a senior counsel for the ATF the alliance defending freedom a man thanks very much for joining us thank you for having me okay we've played tape before on this show of Pasha Thomas maybe you can explain who she is\nAnd what happened to her five year old daughter\nAnd uh what happened\nTo her five year old daughter\nBack a less than a year ago in two thousand Seventeen go ahead\nThat's right so cautious daughter\nOr is it a school that had with little notice the parents adopted a transgender bathroom policy with essentially said boys if they identify as a girl\nCan use the girl facilities can use the girls restroom showers et cetera um and so what ultimately happened is one day ... daughter in the hour we'll environmental to protect her privacy something the school didn't do here\nWas excuse to go to the restroom a and a boy in her class that identifies as ginger fluid was also excused and while Pashtuns daughter was using the restroom devoid came in\nAgain allowed under this policy and sexually assaulted posh his daughter\nA ... that evening I learned about her daughter telling her what happened and was shocked as any parent would be the here that this happened to her daughter and she talks to the school officials and finds out that this happened because the schools transgender policy\nSpecifically allowed this boy to use the girl facilities\nOkay is there a is their policy is the schools just basically ... any restroom you want to go to that it is it's fairly fairly easy for a boy to go into the girls restroom\nThat's right it all it takes us for a student to assert that their gender fluid or identify as the opposite gender and they are allowed by the school to use these facilities a play on sports teams whatever they want to that embraces that gender identity that's different than their biological\nSay okay I assume that when you say that the little girl five years old was molested she was touched was more than just a her feeling uncomfortable\nThat's exactly right that this was a um touching in a private area I won't go into a lot of the ... hills but um and it's something\nThat we would all ... of of course with the pollen anybody who has children or grandchildren is going to be appalled by the so so what happened Pasha went to the school authorities are looking obviously for some justice and probably looking to correct this policy what the school authorities said or\nYet no justice was given you would think the school with the very least would reconsider this policy um they refused to do so you would think the school might at least say well let's\nTransfer the boy to another classroom because remember they share the same classroom the school refused to do that as well so Pasca was left with no choice but to do with any parent would they would take her doubt daughter away from the harmful situation and that's when she reached out to us and and we've been involved in helping or seek the justice at the school district refused to offer her daughter\nOkay now let me make clear we're not talking about Portland, Oregon or\nBennington, Vermont vicious Decatur, Georgia wouldn't you think that there would be more upholding of a traditional commonsense values\nThat you would think so schools everywhere have a constitutional duty to protect the privacy and safety of their students and it's just common sense that\nGirls go into girls restrooms voice go into a voice and if you've got a student that's struggling with issues you can accommodate that you can allow him to use a teacher's restroom a single use their facility but you never allow them into facilities at the opposite sex and this demonstrates why but this common sense even in places like Georgia is being thrown out the window\nBecause of this gender identity ideology being forced on our school kids\nOkay and so Pasha Thomas who by the way as African American not that it matters but uh and it's usually you things that people on the left would have sympathy for an African American mother who's doing a beautiful job trying to raise their children\nUm what what happens next year ... alliance defending freedom you've taken this to the education department is that right\nThat's exactly right so ah the school district was relying on a an old guidance issued under the Obama department of education that has since been rescinded and we brought this to the attention of the department of education and they have now launched an investigation that were encouraged by that we're glad to see the federal government taking this seriously\nLooking into whether the school district has violated federal law as a result of this dangerous transgender bathroom policy\nOkay and so a ... in the best case\nScenario or what happens next what happens to address the concerns of this brave mother indicator Georgia\nI think first we're hoping the department finds that the school was violated federal law and holds them accountable for that and to the school has to revoke this policy this is not working it is causing harm like what happened to ... daughter there are better solutions\nBut the common sense solution should be never allow a boy into the girls restrooms or vice versa those are supposed to be private intimate places that are reserved for students that designated sex they're better solution than what the ... Decatur school district did hear\nOkay I'm speaking to match they matched sharp who is a senior counsel for the alliance defending freedom and he's one of those terrific attorneys that I've told you about who um I give heart and soul to this cause now not everybody is in a position to give heart and soul and legal skill to this cause but everybody's in a\nPosition to give a donation and it's really important because right now even with a much more sympathetic administration in Washington D. C. religious liberty is still under a song and it's under a song um by\nBureaucrats by local officials by school boards\nIn many many different areas and right now you're on something of a winning streak over the ATF orange you\nWe have we've had some incredible wins from the Baker jak Philips to defending pregnancy care centers and most recently chief Cochran also in Atlanta getting a one

and the seven divorce is one of the best movies\nEver made period is a great film I think the same is true ... or maybe fantasia\nOkay ... ... they these are amazing artistic achievements they're just amazing film and they have everything going for them and the idea that they are now being criticized now\nLet me just say\nThere are aspects of these films that are badly dated where political correctness has actually lead to some corrections I've I'll give you an example a lot of people may not know this but I've actually seen the original form of fantasia\nAnd fantasia for those who don't know it's a movie made by the Disney people in ... was very personally involved because he loved classical music and he loves his film\nAnd this film took great classical pieces of the boss prelude and few can D minor and these driven ski rite of spring and Beethoven's passed around symphony and it created sort of\nCartoon animated\nUh bringing the film bringing the music to life and it's quite interesting in the past around symphony section or they went to ancient Greece and they are dealing with guns and goddesses\nAnd ... and ... centers are Half Men half wars and they had one really offensive little scent or who was black and ... and was act and\nI honestly I'm not making this up this was in the original movie and at the time I guess it was considered funny but it's profoundly offensive and racist and you'll pardon me I'm not endorsing it I think they did the right thing to take it out of the film but they had this little black scent or shining the lives of the\nOf the

what she said her favorite Disney film was on Allen's show can you guess Greg ... of course because Elon is Dorrie she's the voice of dory\nSo um she said a\nChair and I didn't like Cinderella that's banned in her home she says she has a three year old daughter\nShe says um because you know Cinderella weights around for a rich guy to rescue her don't rescue yourself obviously and she added this is the one I'm quite annoyed about because I really liked the film but Little Mermaid I mean the songs are great but do not give up your voice\nFor a man hello\n... okay I I agree there are some and I've written about this I mean I think that that part of what I found problematic and live a Little Mermaid which is a wonderful film\nWas a the idea of the kids know best which is a very regular theme in in a lot of films for children that parents are daughter ring and foolish and ridiculous and should be taken for granted but okay ... kids can still love the movie\nAnd I don't think we should have a problem with it nor do I think that suggesting that people might take\nNames that can be comfortably written now that don't have to be spelled and sounded down look one of a tough things about the

if you if you don't think about telling people to get people\nAnd get a restaurant which I think Iraq we led to the shooting of that guy at the baseball field you don't make that evil and the question that said that is an evil\nOkay well you know as a Tim you're totally distorting things obviously the shooting at the at the baseball field was evil Maxine Waters made that comment about getting in people's faces months after that happened and after the shootout or\nThey add that philosophy all along anyway I don't I don't have a liberal for years okay haven't admitted it kind of like OK sort of hard liquor admitted\nYou don't cut me off on this I have a lot to say that little girl in the bathroom you don't think about what happened that little girl that comes from politicians politicians are currently eagle gods now you know God's now\nYou know God's Nell as evil but does now is a killer and and he actually went to prison for being a killer look or Tim the the idea of equating one thing and another\nIs is simply wrong and I I Do believe that one of the terrible things have politicians do is sometimes they don't take evil seriously enough and I think that's true with our whole criminal justice system we had here in the state of Washington\nA a terrible Supreme Court decision where the Washington state Supreme Court\nAh basically said that ah they couldn't give life imprisonment to people who had committed murder before the age of Eighteen no it's a life in prison and that's the more reason they not only struck down the death penalty for people who are convicted of murders as adults\nBut for people convicted of murder as adults who are convicted for crimes committed before they're Eighteen you can't give life imprisonment anymore\nNow that is a manner of coddling evil and then you hear some of the stories of this then I think it's profoundly wrong but cheap we we lose the battle to him if we lose the language\nAnd evil loses all of its meaning if you're talking about silly stupid are irresponsible Maxine Waters\nAnd equating her with a these people in Pakistan who were\nLiterally committing murder and wanting to execute a woman because she said that ah Jesus died for the sins of humanity and the profit didn't\nUm okay\nYou get to argue with her and that's fine but the idea of putting someone in jail and are threatening to execute her and then murdering politicians want to defend her that it seems to me is a very different matter and this is also one of the problems that that people had an and there were people of this nature\nA

in\nNineteen Seventy eight it was called Halloween\nAnd that was a debut film for Jamie Lee Curtis she played a teenage babysitter who together with other teenage babysitters is managed by a an evil mysterious psycho he's supposed to be Twenty one at the time of the first film forty years ago named Michael Meyers\nAnd there's all kinds of stuff in movie history that's connected with the first Halloween and we will get to that with this fanfare from highly aware\nAnd yes Holly weird it is pretty weird that a film like this in today's dollars made about two hundred and fifty million dollars a and cost they estimate maybe two million dollars to make at the time\nSo that film the original Halloween was called the minimalist classic well now John Carpenter the director producer writer and film composer that first film is back\nWith this sequel is not the first sequels Halloween it's not the second sequel to Halloween\n... with all the way this is the tens sequel or been eleven of these

tonight happy Halloween Michael\nOkay happy Halloween to everybody by the way there's no ... or ... there is an implication in this film that Michael could be the Boogie Man but basically he uh he has a psycho with a back story in the back stories alluded to here also which is that he murdered his sister and the first film when\nHe was six years old so it was a troubled guy um look if you like this kind of movie at all this is a\nTerrifically well done what's interesting is John ... is one of the producers but the real guiding force is younger director named David Gordon Green has direct a bunch

you're thinking about wait a minute what's lurking behind that door that's been left a jar but the brilliance of the film is it is minimalist filmmaking this is not a body count movie there aren't that many people who get murdered and you don't see blood gushing forth with the big\n... blood it's subtle one of the most disturbing images in the film\nAt one point you don't know what's happened

that John forte handle it very well he lost his temper he body slammed reporter he knocked off his glasses\nThere were charges brought against him he pleaded guilty he apologized lavishly he made a

little bit today but generally the economy is coming along and there has been a great deal of good news uh there's more good news when you pick up the brand new book\nIt it literally is just going to be arriving in stores if you ever use stores are right now it's a book called Trump's ... inside the America First plan to revive our economy\nOf the book is by my friend Stephen Moore and by professor Arthur Laffer a Steve congratulations on the book and it's very well time\nUm Iraq over like thanks so much for the nice guy working out a lot of fun writing it you know with with my buddy laugh or it was really just kind of first hand account of when we started working with Donald Trump back in the early ... thousand sixteen ...\nAnd and I do think a lot of people including me a reading some of your personal descriptions of coming into Trump's office in the way he interact with people\nIt's reassuring it's it's sort of different portrayal than what you get in mainstream media yesterday everybody in the in the press and you of course have been one of President Trump's economic advisors since the campaign\nBut uh people are fixated on this alleged shouting match between John Bolton and and um and John Kelly the White House chief of staff and\nAre they all these stories a White House chaos that's not what you see at least that's what you indicating the book\nBut Trump is a person who likes to actually have different views at the table and also we used to have arguments all the time I mean I liked them I mean I like Donald Trump a lot personally is or is it fun person to be around he's actually can very gracious these very charming and\nOr offensive or he would like to put two or three people on the table and district ... disagreeing physicians you know we do get out and then he he sort of make up his mind which I think is a good thing that's what a businessman does\nAh so you know so what if they're just shouting at each other you know he wants to have a ... he doesn't want to be surrounded by a bunch of yes not and I think that's a that's a good thing\nAbout Donald Trump but you know I'll correct you on just one thing is that like when you said that I kind of it's coming along that I that I think your understanding this I this is a full fledged boom or on right now you know as you know I was out in Seattle what about a month ago when I was in your studio and I was in you know by the river from Portland, Oregon Portland Maine in ... in between\nAnd everywhere I go all I see is you know I saw this in Seattle I saw when I see it San Francisco I see it you know Nashville, Tennessee in Denver, Colorado and\nUh you know Austin, Texas everywhere just\nFriends everywhere buildings going up skyscrapers factories warehouses biggest construction boom in the history of this country is going\nScrapers factories warehouses biggest construction boom in the history of this country is going on right now everybody's so bullish on America they want to build a lot of it as foreign investment money that's coming in to the United states uh we have what you know every time I Do your show I like the you know I'm really cite another statistic uh first of all we got the\nIndustrial production numbers came out there like the highest ever and then we they the seven point one million you know the statistics seven point one million more jobs than Americans to fill them that's amazing\nAnd that's part of the problem we have right now with all of these people streaming toward the border and that caravan I'd let me let me go to one of the oil and I just interrupt you for one sure\nIt's interesting you brought that up I was watching CNN Today and they were saying um that the number of people crossing the border illegally has actually increased in under Donald Trump\nAlly ally ... and I you know and they and they were showing the statistics and by the way the number of people cross the border under Obama what way way way way out but you know what that why that was right\nYeah because people didn't get jobs evaporated or don't have a ... year yeah so the\nThe real reliable cure to illegal immigration is basically a lousy economy\nExactly you know actually when we had the terrible recession more people left the United states that came in the United states so\nYou know this was almost a sign of prosperity that people from around the world want to come here because there's a lot of economic opportunity but they never connected the dots on CNN on that you know uh but they but there's a sign that the environmental Dolly you and I agree on this we need a lot more legal immigrants in this country we need more\nPeople in the farm farm workers and we need more service workers and we knew him reading more technology workers and and I used to tell Donald Trump I've told you this you know it and it's in the book we used to say if you're going to build that wall battle make sure it has big gate so people can come in legally\nAh the book is called Trump's ... inside of the America First plan to revive our economy but you don't believe that President Trump should allow this a ... a caravan from Honduras which is marching forward with Honduran flags by the way that they should allow the caravan into the country do\nYou know I'm actually watching on the on the screen I'm watching CNN as we talk a and I'm I'm watching all these people are you know look no there has to be out there has to be some orderly\nAbsolutely right yeah yeah I mean we we are absolutely agree on that let me let me go back to to one thing that the Democrats have been lying about and they literally lie about this every day and the media never call them on it\nThey claim that the tax cuts that you helped to write and help to design the those tax cuts that have been passed have caused this exploding budget deficit because they've reduced revenues that's just a flat on line isn't it\nYeah red revenues are actually out this year so we passed the biggest tax cuts and three years and we actually have a slight increase is not what I Would like to see revenues higher and I think by the way as we get you know as we continue to see this economy\nUh continue to grow you you know the best way to get tax revenues and it put people at work at ... businesses profitable businesses back to the United states which is happening uh but yeah like the problem is spending and you know people always say oh you're just a robbery Republican I'm not a rubber Republican the Republicans\nAnd Democrats this bipartisan spending spree that's going on my caller both parties deserve a lot of blame for that\nYou like a President Trump's a idea a vast along every department to cut five percent yes\nI Love that you know that's what businesses do\nYou know that that's the thing if you're running a business\nAnd you don't have enough money coming in and your expenditures are too high you got to go to your agents and this is what businesses did during the recession they talked in their stomach\nThey tighten their belts they got rid of an efficient workers and inefficient services and things they didn't need and they save money and they became profitable getting we never do that in government and by the way I Would like to hear one listener\nOf your show Paul endear show and tell me you can't say five cents on the dollar\nThat right it well
