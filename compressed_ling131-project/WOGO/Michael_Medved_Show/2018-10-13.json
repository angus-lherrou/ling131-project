arms limiting the amount of people\nThat are all I mean you've seen the pictures in aging stems day I'm surprised that more people did not get hurt though during when you start looking at the idea that storm and where it hit how close it hit it could have had to like a major metropolitan area and it wasn't\nJust twenty miles or twenty miles per hour from being a category five storm I mean this is a huge hurricane\nYeah my brother lives near Panama City and how's he doing re okay uh his house survived good ah but we're all you know thinking I kept telling him like you know you you should go evacuate I think you should leave and\nYou know did you tell them to evacuate only two days before him and he did in the morning of the hurricane yeah Russian government aren't we yes um but you know he lives right on the water on and he built a house that's like twelve or you know like twelve feet above the ground and he said the water was four feet up\nOK so who told me was a smart choices but you know it's so funny that you know think about this though so if your house is twelve feet off\nThe ground right every time that you pull into your driveway\nYou're getting your steps and you're

has been affected by that hurricane especially as it continues just to keep moving on\nUp the coast um so I understand you have a question about the smart a speakers once you get the power and once you get your Internet back\nRight yeah yeah I mean I just heard a lot about you know everybody getting them it was a thing that everyone should have and I'm like do I really need one and what would I use it for\nYou know it's a really good question because it's one of these gadgets that initially when you get it you go wow that's really cool I mean so you can say you know tell me what the weather is tell me what the traffic's going to look like order\nA more toilet paper paper towels or whatever it may be and then you start moving up the actual long so then you say turn on the light and you can also say goodnight and when you say goodnight is that the alarm system will set the front door will lock\nThe lights will go into night mode and then suddenly on the smart speaker next year end

X. I. F. data in\nYou're going to have to use the photo editing program to strip all that out right\nSure ah because a lot of people don't realize and if you're like what the heck are these two people talking about is that if I put in a picture up on the Internet and I pulled it down is that I can open up the hidden data\nAnd then pretty much see where that photo was taken what type of camera et cetera I just on Google Map and so we want to make sure want to take all that stuff out a couple of thoughts you might want to consider I mean you've you have Google you out of school photos number one\nUh you put them up there there's Yahoo Photos but one of the things that that came to mind when I was listening to your call is that if you go to say for example a photo sharing site like shut her fly okay\nShutter fly will allow you to create not just photo albums but a particular website if you will that contains all the photos\nAnd so if they had and you'd have to figure out the best way to get the grandparents the the Web address but if they had the Web address they could just keep going back there to refresh it uh say once a week or once a month and so they can start seeing and then in addition to that you get a record of\nThem going to see it as well\n[noise] okay uh so\nJust in order to shutter fly and then sign up for an account and again you're going to be some options when you do this that you really looking for your own unique website\nAnd then once you do that whoever knows that address that there'll be able to access all those photos and again aside from just the medical data is make sure that there is no identical characteristics with the kids\nAs far as any type of school logos or anything else that might show where they're actually physically located at any of those shots of course you can always use any photo editing program it just kind of race that stuff in the back and\n[noise] All right let's talk about one of our great sponsors there are works relieve their works relief\nLike many of us do you suffer from muscle cramps and your legs in your feet well to experience relieve do what I Do you want to use their works relieve\nFast acting phone get their or works relief today it's into the pain relief file at your local pharmacy or at their worst relief once again dot com\nOr before the back of your phone calls I got to tell you about a phone scam that's offering phony Amazon dot com jobs because especially this time of year as a matter of fact we just did a pod cast command on demand about the whole gig economy different ways that you could earn some quick cash just in time for Christmas\nIs that job scams good claiming to be from Amazon or totally on the rise\nAnd here's how the scam works listen up you get a voice mail inviting you to apply for a job at Amazon it sounds like a pretty sweet set up I mean you can earn anywhere from twenty dollars an hour to maybe even as much as six thousand dollars a month catfish you're working from home [noise]\nUsually those are websites with fictitious names like a Amazon cash Amazon cash website ... jobs you name it\nBut here's the catch when you go to fill out the online application you were asked to purchase a two hundred dollar enrollment kid and then once you make the payment poof\nCameras gone all your money your dream of\nTelecommuting and earning cash and your bunny slippers so any job that issue for some sort of a front payment should should set off warning bells and if you are looking for\nLegitimate ways to earn extra cash maybe you want to be an online tutor a virtual assistant or maybe you want to even watch TV and take surveys yes you can make money doing that\nLook no further than the official homepage I became commando show which is of course ...

to all of your fantastic phone calls this show or some more interesting items that current cross my desk and screen that you need to know about first to which\nThe state of California is banning week pass for it that's right\nIt's a new law the state of California you know all those Internet connected devices all around your home you have cameras in thermostats routers garage doors the smart light bulb the\nSmart crock pot for some reason well most of them come with these ridiculously easy to crack passwords for example many routers and Web cams ever default admin password like admitting or password so the idea that when you set up your new gadget you should always changed the default pass for\nMe get something strong that the cameras won't be able to crack\nBut that doesn't always happen so too many people are just leaving the default password in place making themselves targets for criminals and hackers in scammers alright so lawmakers in California you're trying to make that stop they just passed a law that goes into effect the beginning of twenty twenty it makes it illegal for companies\nJust said leak default passwords on devices but here's the gab yet made in the state\nThe problem is it looks to those Internet connected devices I just mentioned they're made in China so the new law is going to require manufacturers just said complex unique passwords for all the devices they have to maybe come up with a startup procedure in place but ... forces the user\nTo change the password I mean this is a long time coming when you think about it I mean but how effective is it really going to be ... probably not so much because as I mentioned everything's made in China\nBe ... probably not so much because as I mentioned everything's made in China\nOr a Google was in the news again this past week not just because they announced a whole slew new pixel phones or because they had a major security breach\nWell they said it was a bug well that's what they always say it's a bug actually nobody was paying attention they expose the private information of about a half a million people for about three years thank you Google Google has its own social media site called Google Plus they announced between twenty Fifteen and march with twenty Eighteen\nKnown was paying attention a security flaw as they like to say lifted personal information of five hundred thousand people up for grabs email addresses gender occupation you get the draft so four hundred and thirty different applications had access to that data\nThey want you to instill the former update so if you don't know about this update then you're sitting there just fat dumb and happy watching TV and actors can be doing whatever they want getting onto your TV and then on to the network so that's coming up and just a few moments but first\nThe phone lines are open one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty for once again is the way to join us and as always there's Andrew but been skiing the Kim commando show man gay but before we talk about the call\nYes that are coming in here it's third our this this weekend show\nUm I\nAm still wearing my apple watch no you might recall it was probably what was it eight or nine months ago when I was really excited about having an apple watch and you got for three right I had a serious threat\nAnd you know both you and Mike or like my brother's right okay so you've seen me embrace technology and throw it away\nOver the years so I was really super excited about having an apple watch and the first time I ward YouTube took that\nHow long were you aware of what we had the over under going yeah yeah okay and so ... what was that that I think it was two and a half we spent two weeks [laughter] and and then after two weeks that would be like I don't need that it was stupid thing right so I took me under that you would not last two weeks which would be you know to ... shows\nRight to ... and you'll be you'll be to buy a mile I think you ward maybe seven eight shows in a row\nAnd then it disappeared\nThen it tapered off a little bit right okay um because what was happening is that I was getting like too much like like what am I stepped [noise] what is my ... pm you know 'cause I can\nBe a little obsessive compulsive what little seedy ... who who would dare say that about I mean we were just upstairs\nAnd I am I I'm a little hungry sure and so we went up to the break room and what did I Do Michael's\nHere for the pizza [noise] but ah you I thought you were I thought holy cow Kim is going to eat pizza [laughter] and I was going to be higher and she was here it is it's you open the box that she was just showing somebody where the pizza off\nSo I went to my house and then I got an apple\nBlame ah I Know\nAnd it's really funny because I had to go get my annual check up\nThis past week and so I was with my mail dock and I'm like oh look at my ... pm and this this and that is right there is showing them the app on your phone yeah your doctor yes okay\nAnd I'm like look like sometimes you know it's forty for a good resting heart rate [laughter] what did you say it's a she always ours and she says she goes that is like an excellent rest resting heart rate\nAnd she said you know what your cholesterol is right now\nDo you know what your cholesterol no idea okay Mike do you know years is no idea how can you really need it let me take you guys need to know what your clothes\nAnd Scott Hi so uh we're good how do you know a high because my doctor tells me I'll pick Herschel medication everyone's high give me bills right well you have to have everything on your online portal oh yeah okay\nOkay so that you can sign and you can see that stuff [noise] so anyway so my cholesterol and I don't take anything like was like one twenty started well\nTwo hundred is like good okay so yeah so and that's because I can afford to have one piece of pizza you know but I Can't do it I Can't you know what I couldn't even do it it's it's it's a curse is what I'm telling you still do it so the apple watch for\nThat I have right now that was the one where it'll tell people if you fall slip or slide I saw the presentation\nYes and then it will get you know has an excel or Ahmed earning gyroscope they'll try to\nAnd so that you can hit a button which I think is fabulous you know that you can hit a button and the and then but it will also do an east Fiji which is kind of like an EKG OK okay\nBut you ... where you're going to put bill to put your finger on the dial and so you'll be able to get it in east Fiji have your own you know because it doesn't work yet it hasn't been ruled out\nAnd so that's kinda lame I think of apple that white white tease it and not damage that they tell you if you buy the new one out you're going to happen and ISI Jay so I was talking to my mail doctor about this and I'm saying look it's going to do an easy chi chi lose me schedules rush 'cause oh what are we going to do with that she goes we are going to have every every thirty five year old\nOh what are we going to do with that she goes we are going to have every every thirty five year old\nCome into the Mayo Clinic watched ... daughter has six actually and all they were doing was watching a football game that was it [laughter] so um so what's your favorite part about having to watch because you you were anti watch because you don't even ...\nMy mom I mean I Know what she's even my favorite part is the the face because I have a pre loaded Fifteen photos of my children in my apple watch out for
