a statement that Santa Claus was white which was highly controversial\nBut a ... ... can you think of other statements were Megan Kelly has gotten in trouble I mean she got in trouble with President

because I think when people that are in power\nOr you disagree with that you tend to to look and see what they're doing and be paying more attention and so I think that the best way to express my feelings are about the situation and my lot in life is to vote and voting on the local level and the state is the best way to do that\nNo good federal you as one way or the other but\nThey're no good good for you are I can I ask are you voting for a Sherrod Brown where are you voting for congressman or when I see\nA ... at this point I haven't looked over their platform as listen to all the governor debates are that's far and I'll I'll be voting for Cordray for governor um\n... that's interesting why um I agree with issue one\nUh mostly um I I thought he did better in the debate I feel like the viewpoint wind up um ... it's just that that that's kind of how I took away when I took away from it\nWell I Know what's fascinating is you know Ohio carry big time big league for President Trump won Ohio by nine points\nAnd right now uh I Know the the governor's race is close a Sherrod Brown the very very liberal senator who really should be voted out but it looks like he is going to win and what this shows is the American people are not doctrinaire they're not automatic\nAbout their voting but I salute you Josh what you're saying about voting to express yourself to get

take me on on issues where you think I'm flat out wrong one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six to Dave in West plains Missouri you're on the Michael met that show\nFor taking my call I just wanted to say that Martin Luther king was for universal health care and free education for everyone is important that\nWhen you say free education or I'm not\nHe supported that\nWhen you say free education or I'm not sure he took the position of free education through college he certainly was in favor of re education for everyone when you get high school\nWhen you accepted the Nobel Prize in Nineteen sixty three or Ninety sixty four he went to wash leading in Norway right and he praised or socialistic system up there a free education and universal healthcare\nOkay I don't I don't believe that for ... of of Sweden and Norway at that time had a free college education\nUh I I I Believe they do now but at that time a not so much look so you're absolutely correct I mean Martin Luther king believed in a\n... she was he was a political liberal at the time that he was alive and he believed in\nGovernment guarantees of medical care by the way so did Theodore Roosevelt when he ran for president Nineteen twelve as a progressive sodas Harry Truman actually introduced a bill\nThere there's a really terrific piece by I'm John Steele Gordon that appeared this month in prime is a fine publication of Hillsdale College and it it's a piece about how we got into this healthcare mess that we're in\nAnd look there are things that we can do is they can fix American health care without totally dismantling the entire structure\nBut they're also reasons why America has led to the world in that time since Martin Luther king was assassinated in Nineteen sixty eight why America's lead the world and medical discoveries I ... I was just I'm\nA realizing that uh the the other day I had the opportunity to see this new movie about um a rock star Freddy Mercury of queen ... next week but uh he died of aids\nAnd quickly relatively quickly after a couple of years yeah but the point is that today the life expectancy because of medical advances people who get aids it's not a death sentence every time\nIt's changed and simply look I'm a Magic Johnson is still very much alive and um I don't know how his Dodgers and I'm not sure there that much alive but that's different\nUh at the point about this is there are reasons and I think the reasons have to do with these free market and the power of the free market\n[noise] that America really has led the world in a ... medical discoveries and improving the science of medicine\nOver the last fifty years and yes I Do think that the profit motive has something to do with it for the companies and and the medical institutions that are developing this material and these cures let's go quickly to Romney\nIn Beverly Hills California Ronnie you're on the map that show\nBlack Americans are laughing at you and corporate America for this type of a thing about the black right I mean like people are not upset about this you know people talking about this or individuals like yourself for example\nA NBC itself was using this black race thing to get out of a contract by being like a professional basketball corporations using the N. word and things like that you get out of our contract using dog a get out of a\nA multi million dollar contract with Michael Vick for example a black people are tired or the the\nWay way way way of a hold on hold on hold on for a moment do you think that um that that they put Michael Vick in prison only because they wanted to get out of a contract\nAbsolutely they were no evidence or I mean let's go oh come on things that go back\nTo the company he he's even acknowledge that he was guilty and when he was charged with and he went to prison for I think almost two years maybe more than they were\nThere were there was no evidence there but I Want to argue with you ... your ... your basic point is look I'm mission higher editor like before being used it is my ... my basic point by people like yourself\nHow am I using black people here out how am I I'm not responsible for ...\nOr other professional to you you do that on a daily basis\nOkay tell me how how\nDo you use the energy of black people this thing is not a racist issue most\nPeople I agree with you and I've had that consistently but ...

don't know\nBut we'll find out because we're having the great opportunity is speaking to a James are Fitzgerald is a retired FBI supervisory special agent criminal profile or and forensic linguist and he was one of the guys who are relatively help to track down the Unabomber\nA first of all a uh it's always great to speak to you Mr Fitzgerald and Michael hey up by and by the way a Jim Fitzgerald is the author of journey to the center of the mind\nA which is available on Amazon dot com we've also linked to information about his book at our website at Michael midday dot com\nThe the\nConsensus seems to be that this is not going to take the months and months and years and years that the Unabomber investigation took that they should be able to bring someone in fairly quickly do you agree with that consensus\nYeah Michael I think this is going to be more of a I'm Mark how you did like a investigation and that's the uh Austin bomber from earlier this year yeah Nate Ted Kaczynski bombing investigation\nOf course we didn't know his name we knew him as the Unabomber I I think this is a very good possibility of being resolved in the next few days to a week\nUm and if not well known that perhaps the offender or offenders\nI Would I Would stick with one for now what if it's not solving a week or so I think we have a may have a little more sophistication here than we originally thought\nBut what we're not there yet and uh you know the law enforcement investigators know the level of investigation of sophistication on multiple levels we are sorry we're not quite sure what that is yet so we're still trying to learn\nUh-huh uh do you have some indication because I it's tough to get a straight answer on this uh where are these bombs for real could they've actually damaged or killed people or was this just a basically gangs\n[noise] well I'm ... we don't know yet I don't have any insight sources I wouldn't do that my my brothers and sisters in law enforcement I mean I'm just really following what's in the media but I Do know from experience having work these case\nTypes of cases in my FBI days that are are there are a individuals who are just as happy putting a fake bomb out there one that looks\nUh individuals who are just as happy putting a fake bomb out there one that looks very much authentic\nWhen it goes to the bomb techs they look at it and they would tell me this happened at least three or four times in my career boy this thing is ready to go if only the person actually put a battery in it you know for the power so that they only had some sort of combustible material or explosive material this thing was ready to go this would work\nSo uh in our case so far of the ... improvised explosive devices that we've seen so far this week\nUh none of them have detonated and that's a good thing um and whether that's intentional on the part of the uh of the bomb maker or you know accidental and he really wish that they would have detonated we don't know that get his purpose was and that's where I put on my behavioral behavior was tied my profiling I\nHis purpose was to send a message\nA about our political system it's two weeks before a big big election oh that's not a coincidence I can assure you and quite frankly the message has gotten out there and the question is I'm\nA widow the message the question is who is the message center and what is their true objective behind the placing an apparent mailing of these uh I eat these\nOkay when you say what is the message what messages he's trying to sense because I'm not sure I understand\nYeah the message is clear that uh you know we we Republicans who can't even spell right or the name you know a show on the representative ah Debbie Wasserman Schultz as well as\nUm rent 'em an honors aimed at the end missing\nFrom that to the you know we're not that bright and we hate these dams at the top of the food chain so much we're going to put this out and we'll show you what we really think\nSo there's of course this person if that's really who he is a you know a magnet wearing hats should against some semi detached garage somewhere building these at least I don't know for up to nine or ten devices that this ... towers over\nThe last few months and that's who he is or\nIs this something from a complete different perspective and this is actually somebody who has the um with her shirt on or something like that and I'm not talking about anybody high level this is somebody you know who just on his own decided to do something like this and make it look like\nA Republican was behind it because of course by default since all the devices are going to democratic either politicians\nA media sources or other people related to them an actor with deniro that's the that's the message that being said\nThat you know we don't like your way of thinking we don't like your brand of politics so of course\nWho's going to Senate Republicans but it could be Michael I false flag type situation where it's actually like set up to make it look like it's a bad guy on one side of the political aisle when actually get somebody on that same side who doesn't really want to hurt\nThe people who are getting these devices because quite frankly none of them have detonated but that up but they're getting their point across as look how bad this other side is so please vote for us in two weeks I Can't tell you Michael which one is that it is but I work cases in the past\nNot always bombs or sometimes just letters and and then saying certain things and other political ah um incidence in another elections where\nOne side as there are people write to 'em you know the opponent but pretending they're on his er or get to the opponent pretending they're on his side sort of a mini fall sly type situation and let me just throw in your Michael the last thing\nSince we had ... outside source forces as in the Russians and some others a mess with the two thousands sixteen election or at least try to I Can't completely rule out any very simplistic and\nAlmost unsophisticated way that there is some parties such as that are involved in this whole thing just to throw a wrench in the works of our upcoming election and just confused and confound the people involved and cause a little bit of mayhem and quite\nFrankly I'm getting makes America look bad and they I I and that's my aunt my wife is a clinical psychologist is convinced that it's the Russians who knows we'll see\nBut her her idea is that this kind of thing on not only makes Republicans look bad because everyone's assuming it's a Republican\nBut it makes our country look bad because uh if if you're having a very prominent people whose safety is being threatened in this way by bombs that aren't even that will made it looks like a banana republic\nUm do you think it's likely that we will have a PRP or before the election I was twelve days from now\n[noise] I I I lost one word on you there but I think if you set a resolution and the next twelve days\nOr so I sent a perp a perpetrator\nOh yeah okay same thing um I think there's a very good possibility and I mean they there's a task\nForce with at least a hundred people on
