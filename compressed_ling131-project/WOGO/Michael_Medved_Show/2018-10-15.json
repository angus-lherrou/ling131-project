defending freedom of talks about the origins of this organization\nOr it was started by people like James Dobson and Marlin Maddox and it was really just a response as these gentlemen and others like them looked out and saw there were a lot of challenges to religious freedom and they didn't see anyone out there to defend it so they said we're going to address this problem by putting together this

phone number again they're operator standing by nice folks it's called a phone number is eight six six nine five four three three eight eight\nA President Trump\nI and I I'm sure he came out of this I'm annoyed and probably annoy you agreed to do it because what is so peculiar about this and and honestly you can go back and you can look at every single interview the bronco bum and did very much including the interviews the bronco bum and did to his credit with Bill O'Reilly\nAny did and Bill O'Reilly was not a fan of President Obama he ripped him up and down and sideways but when he spoke to Obama he was eager to be in the president's good graces and I think they have a lot of a relationship\nThat wasn't so much true with Lesley Stahl of sixty minutes who who clearly made it very clear while she was speaking to him she didn't respect President Trump\nAnd uh I look I I\n... is this the end of the world the fact that President Trump has a bad relationship with CBS\nI I think it's it's it's not necessarily the end of the world but uh they got into discussing the future of Jeff Sessions which suddenly is a matter of grave concern to establish a media all over the country\nWhat about\nThe attorney general Jeff Sessions well we'll see what happens to come to terms but [noise] but everybody thinks\nHe was appointed that reaches some self and many people like I was right and that was very disappointed why should have recused themselves very disappointed I literally was and I assume he's gone you know you can sort of\nLike well you [noise] um [noise]\nWell you slash\nYou will not shut down the Mueller investigation I don't play any size\nBut I Will tell you I have no intention of doing that I think it's a very unfair investigation because there was no collusion of any kind but in ... [noise] I don't want to pledge why should I pledge to you if I pledge legit enough to play she was like wow I have no attention\nOkay look it's it's a reasonable distinction and and by the way of course it would be a tremendous disaster iffy shut down the cellar investigation\nBut he's right to say I'm not going to pledge not to shut it down as a possible the lower ... step over the line at some point so clearly that would be exposed at some point so clearly\nThat he would have a a justification to stop the investigation it's very unlikely because Bob Mueller is their own professional and I think patriotic\nBut ah is is there something wrong with President Trump's answer\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six chat and Chester, Pennsylvania you're on the ... that show\nUh yeah I just think it's a little hypocritical of the media it's a really kind of go after ... after Trump and accused him\nA accused at least the Russia's meddling in the election I mean it's naive to think that the United states has not had an added toppling of any government in the past or even having a lot of influence through the intelligence agencies just to try to sway elections or to influence power in one way or another\nYou know so I mean in other words the United states is a a world power\nThat has wide ranging global interests and we certainly have played a role in toppling of some very evil foreign governments including a foreign government uh in in Chile or under a Salvador Allende\nWhich actually I think we were justified in and taking some role and I know that very controversial but what does that have to do this in other words if the United states is looking after our own interests uh we we oppose\nRussia's meddling in our election not because it is profoundly wrong and some kind of cosmic sense but because it hurts the United states it's a hostile act and we want to stop it\n[noise] so what's what's wrong with it\nI don't think there's I don't think there's anything really entirely wrong with us trying to question or a morality in uh in our current role in the world today but just to just to think that there are not governments that are trying to influence our our because we aren't one of the most powerful countries\nNone of course there are governments that are trying to do it but uh and we are we are right to call them out on it and to try to oppose it and then again I think people are right when when a country acts abroad as apparently Saudi Arabia did\nWhich is why do think that what people are talking about about this being some kind of rogue operation that went wrong that they were actually they're not to kill his show gay and chop them up into little pieces in Istanbul which they did a but to actually just apprehend them and take him back to Saudi\nI I think that as relevant as well and yes there's a difference appreciate your call I'm\nPresident Trump inevitably was asked about the border by Leslie stall there was this
