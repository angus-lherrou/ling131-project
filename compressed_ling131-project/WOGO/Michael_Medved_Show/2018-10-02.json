I Know I Know sometimes I Know people by what they say and what they do and that gives me a pretty good um\nRadar as to how to feel about them there is a rampant and very appropriate cynicism about Jeff Flake in view of his antics of lake of late\nBut his friend John ... says look I Know Jeff and if there's not a any disqualifying crazy new thing and the FBI report that ah that Jeff uh will not screw us here\nSo I'm going to be momentarily comforted by that's going to defer to Mr funds familiarity with the subject at hand uh but can I be forgiven if my bottom line position is I'll believe it when I see it\nMuch funds testimony also is that the real problem could be Lisa Murkowski\nFat does that does resonate this is an interesting woman a Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins these are these pro choice women Republicans were always an interesting uh uh uh ... and ...\nEllen's these are these pro choice women Republicans were always an interesting uh uh an interesting ... of ah of political a political life\nI've noticed something\nSusan Collins a lot more vocal you see her you know getting badgered at the airport a lot more often than actually talking to reporters and I think there is a shred of of decency and decorum to Susan Collins and that doesn't mean that I Know Jeff Flake lacks that or that I Know Lisa Murkowski lax yet\nBut I'm I feel pretty good at it Susan Collins was willing to vote for him before\nAll of this came about was leaning in telegraphing voting for him before all of this smear campaign began\nSo I just find no reason for her to change your vote there's really no reason for anybody to change a vote but ... you know that doesn't mean that everybody uses biologic or that everybody is a scene things through a a clear left or if Lisa Murkowski you know has some bug working somewhere of it that some\nSome stripe that that does not allow her to to see her way forward to do what the vast majority of Republican voters in Alaska want\nIf she's just in the mood to to flip the bird to them uh then then maybe she'll do it now here's the thing if John Fund is right about Jeff Flake and if Susan Collins my gut\nIs right about Susan Collins than ms Murkowski can go do what ever she wishes because we don't need her\nBecause we can lose precisely one Republican one\nBecause if we just fifty one forty nine if we lose one that's fifty fifty and then uh then Mike Pence becomes my favorite vice president ever and that's pretty tall order 'cause right now in the clubhouse leaders Dick Cheney so anyway this could all go into a wide variety of ways\nUm but the issue is somehow in complete without having Hillary Clinton way in [laughter] I Know that's just\nProvable he falls everybody said mark ... why the world is Hillary Clinton me to weigh in on anything anymore I've seen her favorability rating according to Gallup it remains an all time low of thirty six percent\nOh my gosh sixty percent had an unfavorable opinion and four percent had no opinion who those people I'd like to talk to someone who has no opinion about Hillary Clinton [laughter]\nCurrently living on Mars or something I don't know a ... at the Gallup has polled Hillary's favorability going all the way back\nTo Nineteen Ninety two and now it's at thirty six percent that's an all time low where was it on the eve of the twenty sixteen election you may ask forty three so it's\nIt's been a rough couple of years it's been a rough couple of years so hey let's get let's let's give the woman some radio time so she is at this thing called via ... festival I don't even know where that is and there was a moderator and they're talking to her and the subject a ride is where Brett Kavanaugh\nIn in his um moment before the is long overdue for the Senate Judiciary committee talked about how the the the torment that he was experiencing\nHad to carry the dint of ... of just long standing Democrat grudges so years Hillary having a good cackle about that rural it\nBrett Kavanaugh a said that the quote political his job and quote a directed at him a was being done on behalf\nOf the Clintons among other people your response [laughter]\n\nReally yeah deserves a lot of laughter um I wasn't watching when he said that I was having to be somewhere else and away from a TV a and even my phone and so I heard about it later and you know look\nI thought it was just part of the whole of his very defensive\nAh and on a [noise]\nYou know unconvincing presentation on [noise] and I I told someone later boy I'll tell you they give us a lot of credit\nThirty six years ago I\nWe started this again I guess I mean it is back at Yale that yeah well even before in high school apparently um [noise] so I I I don't you know look I Want the FBI to conduct as a thorough investigation as they possibly can within whatever restraints are imposed upon\nThem um but I think\nFor anyone who believe there's such a thing as a judicial temperament and that we want judges particularly those on our highest court to approach issues approach plaintiffs in defendants with um a sense of fairness that there's a lot to be concerned about where I\nDo tell I think that a judge Kavanaugh displayed exactly the right kind of radar for fairness because fairness ... exude from his every judicial pour\nIt it radiates from every ruling he has a very strong sense of fairness basic fairness basic decency so that when those concepts\nAre dashed against the rocks when those concepts are ex bloated\nRiding a vehicle of character assassination from the left\nIt is exactly his sense of fairness that infused his personality they're under questioning from those Democrats his Democrat tour mentors and it is exactly that righteous indignation that human instinct that anyone

wanted to have worried about that as well\nAnd I want to ask you about these developments we found out overnight if police documents that show that Brett Kavanaugh through ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college do you feel that that is in any way just qualify for some would have been a Supreme Court systems\nLightly yeah investigation because there are a lot of allegations and parts of LA are about how he behaves plenty is truck\nSo that is very relevant and the trail\nOf himself as practically choir boy or is there much contradicted by his his roommate for example in

embarrassment\nSomebody after the stupid ice questions like well that's why we needed FBI investigation this is ... elephant oh and by the way that goes back to to the moral precept of that I wanted to touch on it in the last hour and this really is important because it's all about you know the constitution Supreme Court and\nJudge Kavanaugh and in the smear campaign against him and et cetera et

paid to Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski and we're all kind of waiting right we're waiting for the week to pass\nAnd reasonable rational people will be expected the Republican Party to go ahead and vote for judge Kavanaugh is nothing disqualifying is found Mazie Hirono as different expert expectations for her sister senators\nIt's not just what the FBI is looking into although I Hope that the FBI investigation will reveal various inconsistency and ... that Kavanaugh testify tail and all of the people that I went that's again but what\nThey need to look at it in my view is his record a and his

who knows\nWhat's in it I'm catching it a tailor too that Mitch McConnell and Dianne Feinstein are both saying that the FBI results will be shared\nOnly with senators and not with the public\nThat's not good I mean let's let's have the ah let's let's\nLet's let's brainstorm is together Sally I understand of the concern of of invasion of privacy I mean that's how we got into this large mass\nUh is is the notion that ah the doctor Ford wanted privacy and the Democrats invading their privacy blah blah blah [noise] hey can I offer adjustable advice to anybody who has a charge to bring up\nWhether it's something that happened to your last night or three and a half decades ago if you're going to bring it up and you're charged the charge that you're about to level carries the weaponized a strength to destroy someone's life\nYeah you're not going to have anonymity okay you're not going to be able to do that confidentially\nNor should you be able to nor should\nAnyone be able to if somebody is coming out with a charge that is aimed directly at your heart and directly at your life directly at your livelihood directly at your family you're going to be able to face your accuser the rest of us are going to be able to evaluate that accuser that's what we've been able to do he can you imagine if we had\nNo idea the doc Ford was then the charge came out anyway and the ... it's like well we have this charge who who's a problem I don't know I Can't say can't say that how do we evaluate its believability\nAs it is we have evaluated it's believability and it has been found ... which is what bolsters my confidence in my support of judge Kavanaugh but but so here's an additional question for you or any if indeed the early word on this FBI result\nIs that it will be shared only with senators and not with the public is that hey understandable good idea because there are privacy concerns or be outrageous we've been dragged through the entire thing it's all out there now one in the world else\nCould come out I think I'd lean toward be myself just saying\n[noise] um meanwhile uh apparently just few minutes ago Lindsey Graham popped out so as as it came out of a policy lunch plus nothing is tasty is the policy lunch or any of the here's a quote\nTaking cabin on down would unleash forces from the darkest side of politics in perpetuity and if you think only one side is capable of doing this you're mistaken\nRule\nThat is from um Elizabeth landers congressional corresponded at a at CNN [noise] who've\nOkay Paul on most of the cable news channels um today we had some audio President Trump's he's getting ready to\nHead off as I got they got a plane or\nFired up in the background and and the president had some overarching comments about what this week has punctuated about what what it is like there's been an enormous amount of attention and\nAlways properly so about women and women being able to come forward and come forth and speak truth and be able to come out and make accusations and be heard and to be believed if their stories stand up to scrutiny right it's a big gift a lot of people forget that oh believe all women guess what no\nSo let's take all stories at face value and see what we think of them and there's been a lot of attention very properly so about\nWomen and accusations and et cetera et cetera\nWell some folks have dared to step forward a lot of them have been women who said what about my husband is the next what about my son is somebody going to Savage his reputation with was um a an sourced uncorroborated charge you know from from the orbit of Jupiter and President Trump had a little something to say about that said that this is I'm\nA scary time for guys here's the president\n\nIs very scary time for young men in America when you can be a guilty of something that you may not be guilty or you could be somebody that was perfect here is higher life as somebody hears\nYou of stuff that doesn't necessarily have to be a woman as everybody say what somebody could accuse you of something\nAs you're automatically guilty but is it well you are certainly hills the silk roses that that's one of the very very bad things is that gave light\nAs the president and and it is it's still an how 'bout concern for everybody that women stepping forward to the accusations are should be evaluated fairly openly\nAnd and guys being falsely are baseless Lee accused of it can we harbor some some empathy for them as well\nWe're in Tacoma, Washington let them getting some phone action Elaine hey Mark Davis in from Michael how are you\nFrom

seven seven six we've been talking about a ... what what did it look like and what the real fear of the left is and why we're even involved in this entire\nYou know crazy mess with a a judge Kavanaugh's because the left fears of ... with a with every fiber of it's being a constitution list on the Supreme Court and so what would that look like what kind of rulings would you have in many many things like roe v Wade which established a phony abortion rights\nAre over ... versus Hodges which established a phony obligation for all states to have a gay marriage equality that would be a state by state patchwork vats what honoring the constitution looks like a with a question that we had to yellow city or in San Antonio Ron Hi Mark Davis in for Michael how are you\nOh great great I I guess I Need a little better for her face and on the state's deciding on a state by state basis\nHow's that work because I started back in or when you had in a race for America would be illegal on factor but illegal in Oklahoma or legal or in Arkansas but all illegal in Alabama or\nOn the train your eye\nRight here's here's here's here's here's exactly here's exactly how it would work marriage one oh one\nIf two people get married there are three levels of marriage marriages religious which means something as a a a promise they make before God but the couple does before God second it is social uh meaning does your do your people around you your family your friends consider you\nTo be married to him in there so that certainly has the vibe of being married and the third is government recognition of yet that's the only one that's everybody's business the other to the social and the religious or none of anybody's business a gay couple can get married today\nAnywhere they wish anytime the only question is will the state's recognize that marriage there's no such thing as a marriage ban nobody will ever bang on the church you go for\nYou you you guys getting married in there they they absolutely can get married the only question is will the state recognizing that institution is odd and whatnot are almost out almost on almost on almost done when the constitution has offered some states will recognize those gay marriages and some will not go ahead\nOkay so I ... in traveling across the country that they're in a state that I could recognize them and they got to recognize it I don't know what kind of ... even if you go on abortion first state to state one\nOh no no no one went back out and buy a lot and I came back up to marriage back back up to marriage because let's say a couple is married in\nConnecticut or to do to marry in Connecticut and their marriages recognized\nOr you just talking about there vacationing there driving across country or they suddenly not married as they pass through Kansas [laughter] no of course they are but the state of Kansas doesn't recognize it but it doesn't matter because they don't live there and the only thing that marriage the government recognition of marriage only extends to", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "city": "Hallie", "day": "02"}
