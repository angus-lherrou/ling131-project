George W Bush's attacks drone attacks special forces in international law of federal starts\nYou toppled the Libyan regime which granted incredible cash to this six African countries uh what's the ... war overrode secretary of Defense Gates who was opposed toppled Gadhafi who's playing started to play with western countries contracts companies\nAnd then you're a tribal society you're going to get more [noise] and that's what happened\nAnd of course he didn't really get out of Afghanistan the wind\nAnd of course you didn't really get us out of Afghanistan the way you said he wanted to\nAnd he brought to the military budget and put any and I think back in repairing America back home which he promised to do all these politicians you know they talk a good game Clinton talked a good game but he set the stage for the horrible personal behavior misbehave or of Trump versus women\nOr he got away with Clinton\nAnd so you know Trump is watching this he's watching all those he's watching what these presidents are getting away with and he's an expert in getting away with everything and he said hey I can run for president and win\nOkay what uh what about a ... you basically charging the book that you think that both Obama and Clinton not to mention President Bush and President Trump or in the pocket of Wall Street would that be saying it too harshly\nHuh yeah well once we get more money to President Obama in two thousand eight than any Republican candidate has ever see\nRight they gave them a lot more to a bomber than to Mitt Romney or or or to John McCain yeah so\nThe Democrats were soft on Wall street they talked to a good game but\nYou know nobody wanted for two thousand two thousand nine I mean this tiny ... savings and loan Twenty years earlier that eight hundred businesspeople are prosecuted and convicted and sent to jail so you can see where the trend is you know I'd give people hope because in pre twenty five to forty eight oh\nMichael I have the summons of the citizenry\nBringing a centers and represent back to the citizens on town meeting where the citizens own agenda and the public auditorium like a school auditorium and I write it all out in this book to ramp parts\nAnd I don't care if you're a liberal conservative when you're working and my brain and ranching our family back home you're on a lot of the same thing you want safe health care and your wants clean air and clean water you want decent school do you want decent public facilities you you want food properly labeled\nAnd that's where it can get next month if you vote your conscience pneumonia party you want your beliefs\nFor better or America as it relates to you\nWe're getting we're working ranch your family regardless of conservative or liberal or label\nOkay ... you are also big advocate for abolishing the electoral college and the reason that will never happen and you know this is because you need the approval of three quarters of the state legislatures\nRight now we have sixteen states in the country that has five electoral votes or less\nThose are states that will never ever be visited um if a if you make it a population only the popular vote only so where are you going to get states like Idaho on the one hand or Hawaii on the other hand\nTo vote from limiting their own influence and their own safety though and electing a president\nCan educate Michael ... it's not a constitutional amendment rights are aren't they going to cost ... electoral votes\nBut under the constitution the states have the authority to set the rules of the election\nAnd what's going on now is what's called national popular vote dot com refund by a businessman steam Silverstein the San Francisco he hired a few years ago six full time lobbyist went out around the country and they've already gotten California Marilyn kinetic\nPark Illinois or any interstate compact and he's up to a hundred and Seventy two electoral votes ... if the guts to two hundred and Seventy van\nBrunt of the electoral college votes to whoever wins the national popular vote as a presidential candidate\nAnd he's up to a hundred and Seventy two now and then from Democrats who've lost two presidential elections two thousand two thousand sixteen when they won the popular twice and lost the electoral college vote or not even support in\nWell I I I understand what people are talking about here was the electoral compact and I am aware of it but part of what that means is that\nThe ah the states the various states to sign onto it\nOr would be pledge to actually give all the electoral votes in their states to not to the person who wins the popular vote in the state but the person who wins the national popular vote so suddenly make the electoral college would still exist I guess but it will become irrelevant which\nMakes us better being naturalized\nOkay I Do you know I I Do think there are people who are already preparing legal challenges to that compact idea plus right now all the states you mentioned are very very blue stage very liberal state do you see any support for this compact idea from some of the more conservative states\nYou know the next time the Republicans won the popular vote for president and lose the electoral college will get the rest of the states in a landslide\nBy the way you know that's never happened the only popular vote losers who I've ever been elected I'm actually are a Republican or and John only had\nTwo thousand and four because if they carry it got sixty thousand more votes in order to carry Ohio and won the electoral college battle or even though we're got more votes popularly\nSo that's true that's true is a danger I I liked the idea Ralph and I've talked about on the air before of everybody going to the Nebraska main system that you break it down by congressional district but in order to do that you would have to really make it a nonpartisan not gerrymandered\nA portion of congressional districts what do you think about that that's\nA step forward it doesn't go as far as the national popular vote dot com yeah that is a step forward I mean it's ridiculous when you come in second in the popular vote in America and you're losing ... ... and you're winning the presidency ... what country does\nOkay well our our country does and it's actually historically it's worked out a okay I mean and president Hayes was into disaster some of the sitting President Bush wasn't a disaster\nAnd are certainly hope that President Trump will continue to enjoy some of the success he's enjoyed so far Ralph Nader's enjoyed great success with his literary\nLegal and even some political endeavors his new book is called to\nThe rampart how Bush and Obama paved the way for the Trump presidency and why it's too late to reverse course we're going to not reverse course but change course the Supreme Court in one state just declared that all of the people\nWho are on death row cannot be executed why not we'll get to that with
