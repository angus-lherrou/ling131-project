this in Decatur, Georgia there was a a case where parents were actually stripped of their right to even protest on this transgender bathroom issue listen to this one Decatur parent\nWhen you send your

it\nSeems to me the the overreaction that stunned reaction to a President Trump using the word nationalist look I I Will always a acknowledge there's a possibility that President Trump wasn't planning anything he didn't wasn't trying to do anything\nBut I think this comes down to a pretty well thought out and I think inappropriate and smart strategy for including the election campaign let me tell you why\nBecause right now he sees that the best chance for Republicans holding the house and gaining in the Senate\nBoth of which are goals is to emphasize how far out of touch the Democrats have become that's why I think the Kavanaugh hearings were so important\nWhether Kavanaugh hearing\nShowed was that even for people who might have some doubts about President Trump and some of his character and his personality and this and that\nWhat you saw from the Democrats was just so infinitely worse and more hostile and more out of touch and showed such contempt for basic American Standards of of decency and due process and everything else I think that a a great core of people on the Republican side said\nNot that no and we have to come together and fight it and that's\nWhy this rhetoric about jobs not moms and that's also why the rhetoric about nationalism it seems to me I don't think there are many conservatives who are troubled by the idea of being a nationalist and let me explain to there's a new book about nationalism by an Israeli writer named ...\nAnd it's it's worth considering because one of the points he makes is that nationalism goes pretty directly\nWith the idea of democracy because if you're talking about a nation state is your real try than the ideas and that's been very much the way it is in America is what patriotism means is that I find myself as an American\nAnd going back to Theodore Roosevelt again in the new nationalism the whole idea was if you are an immigrant you drop the idea of carrying the flag of your former country you carry the American flag and your nationalism your tribal affiliation which you care about what about you and give your heart to\nIs our nation NATO race not an ethnicity and the fact that\nThat there are so many people out there in the commentary it and so many Democrats who don't get that who are offended by the term nationalism\nI honestly don't think that's helping the Democratic side I think if anything it helps\nOn the conservative and Republican side by the way if you're one of those people just offended by the word nationalism\nGive me a call and tell me why\nOne eight hundred nine five

risk their lives and in many cases to give their lives or twenty five thousand people who died in the revolution\nGive their lives for the cause of a ... a nation nonsense not a school board of the

memorial\nHas to be literally blown up I mean literally blown up by the Taliban style because it has across on it\nThat was a war memorial for World War one\nOkay you want to fight that kind of insanity this is the kind of fight in which the ATF has engaged\nTo Michael ... dot com click on the banner for the alliance defending freedom or call them toll free eight six six nine five four three three eight eight that's eight six six nine five four three three a day back with John Fund a John is the national affairs columnist for national\nEight eight back with John Fund a John is the national affairs columnist for\nNational Review he worked for more than Twenty years for Wall Street journal and a is also a contributor at Fox News we're talking about the the upcoming elections ... one of those things and and again you made this observation before John\nWe're both admitted political junkies follow this stuff a lot ah but the house races with four hundred and thirty five of them\nAre so confusing to most people mind strong gas is that most Americans most Americans and I think probably an overwhelming majority could not identify who their representative in the house of representatives actually is couldn't even name\nSo what do we do about that or just basically live with that and try to break through somehow into people's consciousness on these house races\nWell incumbents have an advantage when Ninety percent of the time because they do a lot of constituent work\nFor their people and they also get around the communities shake hands and become well known\nSo while not everyone knows who their congressmen is a lot of people in the middle the independent voters or if they've met their congressmen or there's got their mothers Social Security check taking care of the congressman's office they liked the congressman\nThe the the job of a congressman is two fold if to represent the people and also of course vote their conscience that it's a challenging act and ultimately voters have to decide what's important to them sadly the vast majority of people don't vote ... about half the people will not vote in the selection\nOf those who do vote a lot of people will vote by party down the line but you will have some people will say well even though I disagree with my congressman or woman\nLike what they're doing and they have integrity and they're honest person\nI yeah and uh whether it's it's the same kind of thing if you ask people in general do things that Congress is honest and legit it's usually very very low approval rating people don't trust Congress as an institution\nBut then you ask people what about your own congressman congressman Smith I I happen to have a congressman Smith whose ... are representing my district as as it happens so what about ... and they say oh my congressman he's the exception he's really a good guy\nIt says the normal way people feel and they talk about public schools are are medical care anything else\nIs that I'm the only one who's fortunate [laughter] in an island of dysfunction and the wealthy and his numbers in public\nAnd keep the house it may be in part because at the last minute people who are really mad at Donald Trump will say\nYeah but I'm I'm really so mad at him that I Want to get rid of the guy that I've liked or met and shit or shaking his hand or help me out and that's why in general you'd never bet against incumbents so some of these Republican incumbents me in the end when because they've built up goodwill over the years\nBut the real problem is the forty empty seats right there were forty Republicans ... or more\nSeats than in decades and that's why I think the Democrats do have to be favored to take back the house because at an open seat a basically you're much more able to vote party strict party line\nSo I'm In in terms of I Know that the Republicans have good chances of knocking off some democratic seats I Know there is a district in Minnesota where the Republicans actually now favored by the cook Political Report\nTo win a democratic seat um ... where do you think Republicans should place the emphasis in these last two weeks in the campaign in order to try to hold on to the house\nWhile I think that they have to emphasize three things one is you know even though there are problems in the world were peace\nAnd frankly we are more respected now than we were two years ago\nThat's number one to the economy is really good and that's not an accident or ... or ... about his policies having a delayed reaction if you want higher taxes and want to take a risk with picking the economy backwards vote for the Democrats to take over Congress and the third is\nYou know are there some basic things the Democrats don't seem to care about one of the rule of law is proven by Kavanaugh\nAnd to why are they saying nothing about this caravan this mob whatever you want to call it\nThat moving up from Mexico as the wall Street Journal reported today which is very pro immigration this is outrageous that we have these people encouraged to move to the United states that influence our election and at the same time the Democrats are completely silent a fundamental issue of national sovereignty\nAnd apparently this is the work of a former president of Honduras and his henchmen a which the wall Street Journal is written about in the Daily Beast is written about that this really started uh as as basically a means of undermining the currents center right president of Honduras\nAnd to hold the American people hostage to the vagaries of Honduran\nDirty tricks campaigning\nDoesn't seem a good idea\nJon or of the Democrats need to step forward and say this is wrong and I hear crickets cricket\nWell exactly what they have nothing to say because again they would much prefer to a run on the the as the ... the family separation issue which they tried to make a great deal of apparently sixty two percent of all democratic ads\nOf each or health care isn't that a mistake don't you think\nWell it's putting lots of eggs in one basket and you know I think preexisting conditions are important I don't think they're that important to that many Americans\nOkay and the Republicans have been very emphatic that we are not going to endanger people with preexisting conditions at those guarantees will remain a we are speaking with John John
