single day and I heard that a lot from some of the people who are out last night for the Patriot am twelve avian Twin Cities in Minnesota\nAnd I\nI was very encouraged or to be there in uh in Minnesota because Minnesota could be a very very good state believe it or not for Republicans and conservatives in this election\nAnd I'm I'm\nOld friendly acquaintances with a missing his friend would be too much\nBut certainly I've seen him and worked with him over the years Jason Lewis who's a former talk show host a very popular talk show host in Minneapolis St Paul\nHas been elected to Congress and he's a terrific congressman he works very very hard he has a conservative team player and he has respect of his colleagues he came to our event last night I was there was a my friends and colleagues Larry Elder and Dennis Prager\nAnd it was just an inspiring event there were nearly eight hundred people there and it was just jam packed and it was not a a ... one of those\nType cast conservative crowns where everybody is old and white or not\nConservative crowds where\nEverybody is old and white or not that there's anything wrong with being old and white there's nothing wrong with it but this was people lots of younger people in fact the best question we got all night was an audience question\nFrom a to newlyweds who were hoping to have children and they asked Dennis and me and Larry Elder our our colleagues\nUh they asked what our advice would be the most important points of advice\nFor uh people raising a child and raising a child the right way and I thought that was provocative and it was interesting it's not all politics and yes we talked about the bombing situation the suspect apprehended after the event so we can talk about that\nBut one of the points where\nI'm actually some of the people in the audience came and they said they were somewhat surprised where we were unanimous had to do with the caravan\nBecause uh even though I Would have disagreements on some issues of immigration policy with a President Trump certainly and uh with um Larry and Dennis\nThis caravan thing is just so clear\nAnd I I Do think one of the important things in talking about this as we come up to the election and we're only twelve days away from the election\nIs\nCaptured in a very fine Columbine Megan\nMcCarthy dull who uh is a now in Washington Post columnist she used to be with Bloomberg but she wrote a piece about the caravan called the immigration conversation we need to have in the most important point that she takes away from it is that conservatives\nNeed to be very clear that yes we\nFeel compassion for the people in the care of and no they're not all middle Easterners and terrorists and gang members and no they're not invaders and no they're not coming here to destroy America\nMostly desperate very poor people a lot of them mothers with children\nAnd\nThey're not a Trojan Horse but they but at\nThe same time they simply cannot be just admitted to this country that cannot happen because they've already started another\nCaravan down in Guatemala and there will be no end\nTo this and there has to be compassion but there has to\nBe rule of law and for the left the left has also oh\nPoor babies are these ... these these people they are suffering so much and I think that's admirable is fine feel compassion for them\nBut then what is it they expect how\nWere you you solving a long term problem for our country or for these people by saying oh I'm In the United states\nAnd then and then be dependent\nUpon other people helping you hear in the United states rather than people helping you at home\nHere zone what Megan McCarthy has sent her column she says Trump is of course wrong to cast fact free aspersions on desperate people seeking a better life\nBoth the left is wrong if it thinks that making that observation ends the argument because even a caravan of nothing but decent hardworking people would raise big questions there are billions of decent hardworking people living in the world\nDo all of them have a right to migrate to the United states merely because doing so would make them better off\nAnd\nUh then then she writes but on the micro scale where you can see the human faces reasonable immigration restriction starts looking different she says\nThose hunter migrants lying under a tarp\nAnd how ... Mexico aren't any less deserving than you are of clean drinking water safe streets in a warm dry a boat\nThey just failed to hit the pick six in the birthplace lottery by what moral right do we tell them to go back to to ... its capital of Honduras and hope that their local I must Thirteen chapter decides to prey on somebody else\nThis is my one problem with her column I'll tell you by what right you say that these people\nWe benefit from the great decision of our parents or grandparents or great great grandparents to come to this country and we benefit and we inherited this yes it is inherited if you're born in the United states the chances are very large\nThat you have at least one generation maybe two maybe three maybe ten generations of people who work very hard for this country\nAnd that gives you more of a right than people born abroad to enjoy the blessings\nOf this country\nIsn't that basic isn't that sensible\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nAnd then Megan McCarthy concedes\nA truly open borders policy has no constituency in the American electorate\nBut it's the implicit philosophical framing of most news media stories on immigration which tend to focus on the Mike Rowe problems of the individual not the macro problem of just how many of those individuals the country can admit\nShe says this\nIs easy to say no of course we can't let in every single person who wants to come because doing so would transform this country\nInto one that few Americans any political persuasion would want to live in the United states would be vastly more unequal and income and opportunity migrants would languishing the kind of squalid poverty\nThat the United states hasn't seen for a century in numbers a doubling of the U.S population is probably a conservative estimate that would defeat any conceivable tax and transfer program\nOkay\nThis is the core argument simply allowing people in is a disaster for the country and it's not a I'm blessing for the people who are allowed in because\nBy encouraging more and more and more and more immigration with\nNo limit what you're doing is undermining undermining the vitality and prosperity and

racist names and fake news about Democrats popular targets include Islam\nWhich he calls the barbaric evil cold\nAnd Hillary Clinton\nAnd in September two thousand sixteen he wrote this about Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton health decline and headed to a graveyard where she has had so many executed the lord delivering death and America will celebrate\nI I don't really believe that if any

we're justice work social justice work\nAnyway I've never I've never heard CNN describe antifa as doing social justice work and Florida describes themselves as social justice warriors and that your job or their sucks\nBut I've never heard I've never heard CNN or MSNBC or any major mainstream media source save antifa was good guys\nWell at least the the point that I'm trying to make is they're not out clearly making them out to be the bad guy and the people who are the the voice that they have on their network at least hold them to a higher regard and they're not sending that down and and I totally understand that but\nThat that you look I think what you're saying is true I think there is profound biased throughout media news at its it's very very biased and they they certainly treat neo

hope so because this is such a pro military movie okay I'll I'll say it from the outset\nThere's actually a good piece we have in our newsletter that we sent out a concerning the director\nYoung director for this movie it's called hunter killer director's name as Donovan marsh and he actually spent four days on board a U.S nuclear sub ... hunter killer submarine like the one that is depicted in the film the basic set up with the film is this\nIs the movie begins with a terrible terrible\nAccident or is it an accident involving an American submarine\nAnd its American submarine that because of the heightened tensions with the movie recognizes between us and Russia is up near a Russian naval base\nAnd so then the uh the leaders of the U.S military including Gary Oldman who plays the head of the joint chiefs of staff\nRecruit a an extraordinary but inexperienced captain played by Gerard Butler who has to come run a secret mission to try to see if\nHe can figure out what has happened to this missing sub and oh yeah incidentally rescue the Russian President the movie sounds like this\nIs the rest of the military buildup of Russian\nI mean when I was\nIn order to cross water is married and stuff is ever cross\nMembership for\nHalf a fresh breath has\nWhat if we could freeze president of the car we rescue the Russian President\nGoing with more of our borders\nOkay and you might recognize the voice of common was actually a very good actor or who known as a hip hop artist common plays a one of the I think he's chief of naval operations in the film\nI look at the movie starts out and it's kind of corny the the first time you meet the Gerard Butler character before they helicopter him in for this ultra secret mission\nHe's out in the middle of Norway a hunting elk\nAnd uh it's okay it's nice looking in spectacular but once this film gets going and you get into the plot\nIt's based on a novel that was written by real life submarine commander it co written by him and it's\nAlmost plausible because it's based upon political\nInstability in Russia and an attempted coup and basically because this us submarine is up there near the naval base where they have taken the president it's actually up to a un American\nSubmarine and for navy seals to try to rescue the president of Russia\nNow nothing goes exactly as you would expect it to go and of the film ends up a with a very satisfying and actually thrilling conclusion\nIf you stick with this movie and and you will if you go to see it in the theaters which is a good place to see it as kind of spectacular looking\nW

I've heard no one repeat no one ... and I don't care how\nFar right you go or what kind of crazy or not or if you are nobody who applauds\nThese months this is one guy and I think yes he is deplorable in every way but he is in\nNo way representative of the people who support President Trump\nAnd he certainly isn't representative of President Trump one of the things that was upsetting to me was looking at the photograph in detail of his van\nI at one point in one of the windows and the very bottom the window he has this he says uh I Am Donald Trump and I approve this message will the president has made a very very clear he does not approve this message\nAnd that's appropriate uh Christopher Wray the director of the FBI appointed by president Donald Trump to replace James Comey when he was gone\nChristopher Wray was there at the press conference just moments ago it's about a half hour ago and he had this to say about the scope of the investigation just concluded\nThe attorney general as confirmed we have arrested sees are say are\nIn connection with this investigation as our investigation is still ongoing I may not be able to answer questions about his background or or about his motive [noise] what I can say that this was a nationwide investigation of enormous go out of the greatest importance our investigation\nThe ... of enormous scope of the greatest importance bar investigation ranged from New York\nTo Delaware to Maryland to the district of Columbia to Florida to California\nAnd as it always does the FBI responded with every resource we've got including our joint terrorism task forces are counterterrorism division in our world renowned experts at the FBI lab\nQuantico okay and then he concluded Christopher way right on this point a lot of people have said what's the big deal well this is the big deal\nWe can confirm that Thirteen IDs for sent to various individuals across the country each device consisted of roughly six inches of PVC pipe\nA small clock a battery some wiring and what is known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives and material they give off sheet and energy so a reaction to heat shock or friction\nThough we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices\nI Want to focus for a moment on the amazing work of our folks at the FBI Web based on their initial analysis they uncovered relating fingerprints from one of the envelope containing ... had been sent to congresswoman Maxine Waters\nWe have confirmed this fingerprint is that ... or say\nThere is also a possible DNA connection between samples collected from pieces of two different varieties mailed in separate envelopes than a sample previously collected from ... in connection with an earlier rushed down in Florida\nOkay uh that basically lays out how this was done and a ... it's it's very important it seems to me\nTo understand for people on the left\nWho have been trying to see the acts of this uh evil mad man\nAnd he has both evil and he clearly is a madman he's also a total loser will go over his arrest record coming up it's bad that takes almost a segment on its own because he has an extensive and prolific arrest record including a prior arrests record for threatening to blow people up with bombs\nAre there are real questions about why he was running around out among us and the point over here is I Would just\nTry to get folks on on the left including I I heard earlier today a congresswoman Jackie Speier who was just way over the top and this is a little reflective of the hatred of President Trump and it's all President Trump has that can you imagine anyone\nCelebrating if one of these bombs going off\nThink about it\nAnd for conservatives it I mean we would feel horrible horrible\nJust as I I Know that when ... was shot and almost killed when there was the would be killer at the congressional baseball practice who fired at Republican members of Congress\nI didn't see anybody on the left celebrating I didn't hear anybody saying oh I Wish he'd killed Steve ...\nAnd and maybe we can sink in those terms and let that inform some of our rhetoric\nOne eight
