Wyoming majority of African Americans there is a little bit of Native American and most people whose families have lived here in the United states for many years and that is true for Elizabeth Warren's family\nBut the best case analysis for her the idea that she has one sixty fourth Native American\nMeans that about a hundred and fifty years ago she had one of her sixty four great\nGreat great great grandparents who may have been Cherokee\nAs she says family lore suggested the entire thing was a ridiculous claim to begin with\nAnd wouldn't it be better for her if she's just back off but no but she won't she basically insists that uh this is the way she's going to set up her presidential campaign my question to you\nWould be what is she thinking why is this a good idea\nIt makes her look ridiculous and make sure looked like a liberal racist why do I say that\nBecause for goodness sake if you grow up in a situation where you never affiliate with a tribe no one in your whole family within memory has ever affiliated with the tribe you've never gone to India and events you haven't raised with any Indian culture you know nothing about Indian history or background\nYou have no connection no affiliation no participation know communal involvement with the native\nAmerican community and ah then when you get hired at Penn and Harvard you put down that your ethnicity as Native American because that qualifies you as a diversity hire\nI mean the whole thing is sad now is it the end of the world\nNo it's not the end of the world but she is making at the end of her campaign she is blowing herself up\nAnd she chose to do this thing this would be a good idea\nOr does she really saying she should get the million dollars that President Trump by the way did not promise here is what that\nIs based on where a that's number three they're under Warren audio Jeremy where where President Trump makes the original offer to Senator Warren he's doing a rally in Montana or over the summer listen I Want\nThat God will open up the doors again for ministry through a real miraculous when it got to open the doors for me to be involved in the ministry here at W.

F a U X of course and means phony false like people talk about food pearls phony pearls their imitation\nSo this was before President Trump started with a book on a stuff their number of people in writing and including me who use the term to describe Elizabeth Warren as ... ... right get it as in ... it sounds like Pocahontas but its FAU acts and then God us\nAnd I guess President Trump must have heard that and he dropped the French part and just made it Pocahontas in any event is why is it a racial slur\nRedskins is I I understand that can be a racial slur we won't get into that issue ... but I'm sure we will at some point certainly if the Democrats win the house um she uh uh there's a second clip of person powers on CNN here she is\nI think it would have been better if she would have just originally\nSaid you know what family lore this is what I thought and made a mistake\nI'm you know as Michael said actually I don't think she probably has much more you know of this this um you know in her DNA than most Americans that was just you know we all histories in our families and you say I I heard it wrong and said she said something about her grandfather great grandfather having high cheekbones which is a racist stereotype\nAnd so I think she actually has legitimately handle the sadly Donald Trump it that's not his motivation it's not about he cares about her misappropriating culture have just acting godly and making racist attacks\nIt why is it a racist attack I don't see that I don't get I think it's an attack on a political opponent and yes the president does a lot of it um [noise] let's uh go to Pam in ... cities Washington Pam you're on the Michael ...\nMichael hey I I feel so sad I used to love your show but you become just like the other right wing radio host that down and worship Trump and um well well I'm just say it's okay if he does is he didn't really mean that he he\nNo way I see that in the ... co Q. say he doesn't lie he misspelled way way way ice ... hold on how wide\nPam I I Will say that President Trump has told outright lives things that he knows not be true because he's been told but where is there an outright lie here on this issue\n[noise] I you know he said find out if you have I don't know exactly what he said\nLet me play ... you should he oh what's her that million dollar let ... let me let me play it for\nYou okay I just want to be fair here listen to what President Trump said here's President Trump's original offered to Elizabeth Warren\nIf you take the test that it shows you're here you're [noise]\nOkay if it shows you're an Indian and my point here was that there is no Indian tribe in the world and the country\nWould accept her as an Indian based upon this DNA test that shows that she may have had one great great great great grandfather who was in India that's my only point\nJust want to say that I'm Trump your color and uh in the previous hour said Trump that brought us down to the gutter he really has and I mean you guys I I'm just so\nI'm a let me let you let me ask you this\nOkay do you think that it is honorable of for Elizabeth Warren to have a promoted herself as a diversity hire to have contributed to an Indian cookbook to have gone through this masquerade for all this time\n[noise] no I don't think she should have done that I don't get out of it it was trivial and she shouldn't have done it but I'll tell you what Trump calls out women he called he'd said Dr forward it doesn't matter if she was lying or not we want we want it that's all he cares about winning and he didn't care who he dumped on\nOkay look I I Believe that President Trump does sometimes go way over the line I think it's unfortunate and I said it already on the show I think it was a big mistake on his part and it was inappropriate for him to attack Stormy Daniels who was made accusations of intimate kind against him\nTwo attackers horse face at who put that in a tweet today\nUm it's probably we probably reached a point in our world where ... if you're going to be attacking a female you can attack or the way President Trump is attacking was with Warren but don't attack or looks I think we can agree on that and Pam I appreciate your calling\nMe and caring enough about the show\nTo actually call even with a complaint\n[noise] the point is that the fact that a Trump

Believe was\nHe basically cared about Trump\nWas he basically cared\nAbout Trump the person\nIn one of the things that I think is terribly wrong with our politics is focusing everything on either

terrible person and uh I Can't stand\nAnything he says ... is one of the other like there's nowhere in between and and most human beings and certainly most politicians\nAre not all evil or all\nGood there imperfect like all of us and the point about this election is it's really not about Trump I Know he says it is but he's wrong it's about Republicans in Congress\nMost of whom are are dedicated

control of the U.S Senate dean has been an an exemplary public servant about whom there's never been a whisper scandal and\nThere are people like that around the country\nWho are deserving support people have done a very good job for the people they represent\nAnd who eminently deserves support\nPeople like a colonel mix Sally in Arizona we talked about before\nPublic servants who are patriotic who are not part of any called forty five it's been called called with a forty fifth president President Trump deserves applause and support and backing when he leads American the right direction\nAnd I think much of the time he does\nBut the idea that his personality should be the big issue that determines how we respond on this direction I'll tell you a way that I think Democrats are going to mess themselves over by trying to do that the American people don't want an impeachment crisis\nAnd and you have Democrats now who have promised that if they take the house they're going to try to impeach President Trump's are going to try don't preach justice Kavanaugh really\nThat helps the country how it doesn't at all and it's absurd\nLet's go to Doug in Houston Doug you're on the Michael ...\nMichael Oh you bet you know a ... that should be some money I'm he made it\nMade a statement and the statements that ... million dollars that prove that she was an Indian yeah she was one one thousand twenty fourth any answer should be about nine dollars and thirty eight that\nI'm sure you've done the math ... the problem is he he basically said she needs to show she's an Indian and what that means is how do you define who is an Indian now\nIn the URL Nuremberg Laws and Nazi Germany this is something you'll find out about the ... movie or they used to count someone who is Jewish who was eligible for execution and liquidation if you had one sixteenth\nA Jewish background now she doesn't close to that\nOne sixteenth Jewish background means what is it it means a great great grandparents she has to go back to great great great great that's for great great grandparents a hundred and fifty years\nAnd it's absurd she cannot prove that she's in Indian she cannot show that she's in India and therefore I think it would be wrong for President Trump to even pay the one thousands one one thousand and twenty fourth of it appreciate your calling and your sentiments Sean San

are so prominent in the resistance remember those little kitten hats that women were wearing this is the day after Trump's inauguration and remember\nMadonna said she had been thinking about blowing up the White House and and people were okay it's almost two years later and here we are and so what is supposed to be accomplished with all this rage\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen

the very act of making a loud noise a sign of their ugly ugly and unnatural personalities and think twice well you would hope so but there are a lot of images like that and then also a lot of desires to try to honor past\nActs of anger or yesterday was the fiftieth anniversary of a truly historic an epic day in the history of American culture\nI it does involve a actually wasn't yesterday it was um longer goes in that uh but it was September of Nineteen sixty eight they uh they had a public what was called a bra burning though they didn't actually burned browsed actually threw them away\nTo protest the Miss America pageant\nOr we will get to that why is this a heroic thing and the important thing\nToday by the way I'm pretty sure is the anniversary of a um another fiftieth anniversary of the Mexico City Olympics and two athletes or John Carlos and Tommie Smith\nWho won a gold medal and a bronze medal and they stood there on the stage and they held up their gloves hands in a black power salute and basically it changed their lives\nDid accomplish something profound do these protests matter\nAnd what is it that the new wave of women is supposed to accomplish in terms of changing America and the Congress of the United states one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six David in Philadelphia you're on the Michael ... that show\nA while and no way once a defense Bill Clinton uh it was interesting when you play those excerpts to hear so many people making the point that there was a power imbalance between him and Monica Lewinsky\nWhich invalidated the relationship or made it akin to rape or assault or what have you and uh\nI Would just like to point out that one of the most well known facts of male\nFemale sexual dynamics is that women tend to be attracted to powerful men [noise] uh and not so much the other direction by the way men don't necessarily [noise] aren't necessarily attracted to our for women so if you want to invalidate that [noise] you know those kinds of relationships there could be\nEven angrier more frustrated women than the one who wrote the book you mentioned\nWhat is it I think the problem in in the abuse of power the abuse of power was not only in terms of pursuing their relationship which has certainly Monica Lewinsky was very enthusiastic about there's no question about it\nBut uh was in concealing their relationship and a and hitting back at a great number of people and by the way using federal resources it's it's so astonishing\nThat right now people on the left I mean I Know on cable TV all morning they've been dealing with\nPresident Trump's angry reaction to Stormy Daniels that entire matter as embarrassing and tawdry as it may\nBe involved the time before President Trump was in the White House long before\nAnd uh does that mean that it's utterly irrelevant no I mean there there are ongoing legal action some of which by the way has been dismissed out that Stormy Daniels defamation suit has been dismissed\nShe can't sue President Trump for saying that she's not telling the truth\nLet us go to Lou in Cherry Hill New Jersey Lou you're on the bench out\nOkay Hi Michael I'm yet know when you're talking about the anger thing there's there's two points I Want to make is one is a depression and there's always angry\nAnd Sally response he gives an angry response to something and then the only way to respond is with that same kind of anger it makes sense right that's the way he communicates the second point I Want to make is that um\nWhen has a went have there been things against a man or against you know\nThere's things against women that happened and are responding to the issue that happens\nYeah but what what is it the thing against women that happens is there's so much of this that is\nOn earth for years and years ago like the charges by Christine Blasey Ford [noise]\nAh what is accomplished by the protests and the anger and how is that supposed to work to benefit the country is

things about some things happen that's been in international news\nBut it's happened right here where I live and work and it's a had a big uh emotional impact on me and I think on a lot of people who pay attention to the larger world you've probably heard that the co founder of Microsoft Paul Allen\nThe lesser known cofounder of Microsoft he started that company together with his high school buddy Bill Gates\nPaul Allen died yesterday and I found out about it I was shocked he was only sixty five and yes that counts as only this year\nHe he died at sixty five of non Hodgkin's lymphoma he'd just announced two weeks ago that he had a recurrence of lymphoma he's been battling cancer for a long time he was initially diagnosed in Nineteen eighty three which was why he left Microsoft initially he beat the cancer\nThen it it came back in various forms as sometimes it does and\nI I never met Paul Allen or he lives in our area he has had a long time commitment to it but I thought there were a couple of things that were highly relevant up people over ... bring him for all of his charitable endeavor as it is in ... and his ownership so sports teams\nHe was the owner of the uh world champion Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks he saved the Seahawks franchise for Seattle there was a plan to move the hawks down to Los Angeles by the previous owner\nAnd a Allen stepped in ...\nAnd Alan stepped in he's also the owner of the Portland TrailBlazers he actually always liked basketball more than football apparently but he came to be\nAlmost a model owner for the Seahawks the one point that I Would make about him as there is a general resentment of rich people of ... billionaires Paul Allen was reputed to be worth about twenty billion\nDollars that's let's be clear twenty thousand million dollars and if you think about that that's just an almost unimaginable amount of money he has given at least two billion dollars to charities since his\nInitial a cancer diagnosis and the charities have been so\nWide ranging and for the most part so noble poll gee Allen philanthropies has been emphasizing the environment including preserving or some some wilderness areas and and global health and helping with diseases like Ebola\nBut he's also had more local\nFocus and and this is one thing that I wanted to to speak about particular it's very unusual for somebody to basically grow up in a place he was born in Seattle his father was one of the chief librarians at University of Washington\nAnd he grew up here and he came back here and he's had just an enormous impact on the city almost all of it very very positive it could have been more positive one of the things that I first admired about Paul Allen is he was pushing a plan called the Seattle commons\nWhich would have been a terrific sixty one acre park right in the middle of the city where it would have replaced\nAt a a bunch of warehouses in a very fairly rundown area of town with a great green space coming back from lake union\nAnd uh and then that would have been surrounded by housing buildings and office buildings in any event it was turned down in a city vote a right the same year that we we arrived we moved to Seattle city vote was incredibly close\nAnd but it was turned down and so now there are lots and lots of office buildings in that same area many of them by the way developed by Paul Allen's company Vulcan\nBut he built the museum of popular culture which used to be called the experience music project he was a huge fan of Jimmy hendrix who was a Seattle boy\nAnd he wanted to commemorate Jimi Hendrix originally then that's developing this big museum with a controversial building by Frank eerie some people hate the architecture's others love it\nHe um owns the Portland TrailBlazers down in Portland and the Seattle Seahawks he developed the Allen Institute for brain science and the Allen Institute for artificial intelligence he also has this other very cool museum it's called the flying heritage in combat armor museum\nWhich is a collection of vintage military aircraft tanks and other military hardware yes a living computer museum that he built the the point about this is that so many people have the idea of why don't we take more money away from rich people pull out and had more money than he needed and the answer\nThe energy and the creativity in love with which he spends his money\nWas a a true factor\nAbout of the the success that he had with these various projects and most of them were quite successful and they made a difference the notion that the government could have spent this money better than Paul Allen\nSoftware game tonight the box play tomorrow night against Charlotte\nW O G O lay tally openly urging more\n\n[noise]\nSay your radio NATO's secretary of
