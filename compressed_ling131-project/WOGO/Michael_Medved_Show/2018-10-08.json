together\nTogether with Dr Tom Coburn who's been a friend of the show in the past when he was a senator from Oklahoma\nOr a list of some of the most outrageous federal government wastes and and it's tough to know where to begin a Adam do you have a personal favorite of all these wasted government programs wasteful government programs are due of spotlight of\nWell Michael thank you very much for our interests that are in our work and open the books dot com I think my favorite is that they're literally is a federal grant for everybody in this country in fact every single year the federal government doled out six hundred billion dollars worth of grants\nAnd if you're a prostitute and California one point four million dollars funded sex education for California prostitutes who could probably teach the glass\nOkay now which which way which a department of government or handles the a sex ed for California prostitutes\nThat's health and Human Services they said they have a difference for demolition of Human Services [laughter] right\nUm so what what is the point how do they just how much money for sex ed for the prostitutes\nWell probably a pilot study 'cause it was only one point four million dollar oh my now overall\nEvery year ha Jeff Dole's out about four hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of grants to put that in perspective the U.S military every year at the department of defense or total budget is six hundred billion dollars\nWow wow ... ... ... it in terms of what you were talking about with open the books dot com you have a a basic approach which is the transparency is the\nOnly way to solve this is letting people know what's going on and President Trump doesn't have to get this through Congress he could do it on his own right\nWell and that's that's the plan on the strategy that we outline first that the wall Street Journal than at USA Today and it's a three pronged attack and as the commander in chief at this moment that our nation's history when we feel that spending is a crisis\nThe president can take the three pronged approach and he should lead by example he should post all White House expenditures and then step to\nCut the federal agency waste and step three and this is my favorite part Michel he should report to the American people show\nUs how he's defending the American taxpayer by cutting waste fraud and taxpayer abuse and we believe that he should do Twitter to do the reporting\nI think it's a great idea and by the way you also suggest here that there should be an across the board cut in every federal department beginning with the White House and this was something I wrote a book about the White House staff years ago\nAnd man is there a lot of waste and ridiculous nuts in terms of the Fifteen hundred people who work in the White House staff a President Roosevelt one world war two\nWith a hundred and six White House aides total and what is it that we need Fifteen times that number for today I I don't I don't get that at all what what about\nCan you give us some background on the um the two hundred thousand six hundred and one dollars that our government spends on a new condom design with a additional lubrication why why does the federal government spending on that\nYou know the condom industry it's a very competitive industry\nBut I'm a two hundred thousand dollars flowed

effectively appealing to voters and the reason that this whole idea of a war doesn't hold a Jeff is look John Adams said something very famous\nIn the American revolution he said assertive people living in colonies at the time wanted independence a third wanted to remain loyal to Britain than a third one and simply to be left alone\nIf you have a full third who are willing to fight and another full third who are willing to fight on the other side yes you can have a very bloody war and they were twenty five thousand people Americans who died in that war\nBut uh we don't have that it's a percentage of people on the left who want to go ahead and how people out of restaurants or want to make this a war\nI I think it's it's not anywhere near a third frankly I don't think it's near ten

necessarily the same as Steve and now we was making clear\nWhat they're focused on other things and they're not focused on his idea we have to condemn Columbus was genocidal and it was a murder\nThe truth of the matter is that I think it's fine to celebrate Columbus or not to celebrate Columbus it's not worth fighting over but attempts to remove Columbus statues\nBecause she did not have points

I\nPlease don't tell me justice for Merrick Garland that ship has sailed I ever spec Merrick Garland I think he's a good judge he is he's a widely respected judge I think that he was caught in political cross fire and when it was unfortunate for him but by the way it did you hear\nAny conservatives whisper a word of smear or attack on Merrick Garland who was a good and decent man no the answer is\nNo and and honestly because for people who think there is no difference between liberals and conservatives there's no difference between left and right in this country\nLook at the way that Brett Kavanaugh was treated versus the way that Merrick Garland was was treated and by the way they were not as harsh to Neil Gorsuch do you know why not\nAnd a lot of these like well you know it's really not the less problem is Kevin O's probably no one is the last probably the reason they weren't that harsh to justice Gorsuch was because he was appointed to replace Anthony and Scalia\nWho is the leading constitutional is the leading conservative on the court\nIn other words it wasn't a shift the court at all and by the way that Justice Kennedy was no liberal Justice Kennedy was a moderate on the Supreme Court he was appointed by President Reagan Reagan he was he was a as a matter of fact confirmed unanimously\nYeah Justice Kennedy was\nAnd its Justice Kennedy who swore in Brett

wasn't he wasn't cold heartless Merrick Garland a basically they postponed I'm considering his appointment because of when it was announced\nAnd but there was no attempt to smear him in any way and nor do I know of any basis to smear him but go ahead\nAnd nothing about the fact of the matter is actually the one who actually accused sexual uh uh uh uh felt\nNo no there were not it was only I'm Sorry and this is very important that um\nThere was nothing injustice Kavanaugh's record nothing involving sexual harassment sexual assault sexual charges misbehavior there were no ex wives there wasn't enough thing a clean record until literally after\nHis hearing had concluded and then they threw a Hail Mary pass and thought they'd make some hay with this one which is totally
