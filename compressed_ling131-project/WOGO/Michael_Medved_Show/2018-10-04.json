expect because\nThey're demonstrating that people are going to rally behind them do you\nUh well they just lost their most important issue I've this is a headline that it's breaking news I mean just today headlined Georgetown Prep alumni clarify meaning of devil's triangle in a letter to Judiciary Committee\nNow this honestly sounds like a parody we have the Judiciary Committee of the United States Senate the world's greatest deliberative body as it's known\nAnd the the Judiciary Committee is pondering a couple of references in Brett Kavanaugh's high school yearbook in Nineteen eighty three here here's the story\nEarlier today a group of Georgetown Prep alumni confirmed Brett Kavanaugh's explanation of the\nTerm uh\nDevil's triangle which\nHe was asked about by the committee effort surfaced in his year book\nBefore alumni who are named Lindsey Davis Bernard McCarthy junior pulmonary and Matthew Quinn clarified that the term devil's triangle refers indeed not to a sexual act as has been alleged by Kavanaugh's detractors\nBut rather to uh drinking game they played in high school they actually played the drinking game devil's triangle\nQuote devil's triangle was drinking game we came up with in high school it was a variation of the game quarters when we played rebels try and go for people sat at a table on the table three small glasses of beer were arranged next to one another to form a triangle each of the four participants took turns being the shooter\nThe shooter attempted to bounce a quarter\nIn to watch the glasses wrote the alumni\nWe do not remember the exact origins of the name but none of us use the phrase devil's triangle in our yearbook to refer to any kind of sexual activity to us it was just a game with glasses and the shape of a triangle if the phrase devil's triangle had any sexual meaning in the early Nineteen eighties we did not know what\nThe letter concludes\nSo the biggest objection now again we don't have a letter clarifying\nBooth thing\nBut I Do have the statements from Greg Tomlin I'm associate producer on the Michael ... who comes from very distinguished background his brother and his father and or his grandfather all graduates of Annapolis\nAnd naval aviators and great people and they say that in their family the term booth thing has been used\nUm I'm afraid to say to describe flatulence that's exactly what Brett Kavanaugh testified and the obsession with these issues can it's it's all over the New York times right now\nIs it just seems to me nutty and strange if you want to speak\nFor the demonstrators if you share some of their anguish and their occupation of the\nHeart atrium Senate office building I clearly if they're going to try to disrupt the business of the United States Senate they will have to be cleared away and arrested and what is it they are demonstrating for here\nWhat exactly one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six Lindsey Graham spoke out clearly as he has been doing basically his whole career\nBut he had this to say about the FBI investigation that was just completed listen\nI'm confident the FBI did a good job\nThey were not a hindered in anyway [noise]\nAh the focus of a background check was all credible allegations before the committee [noise]\nUh I was looking for certain things to be answered by witnesses [noise]\nThat what the committee found is held up and then some [noise]\nThe main thing for me\nIs that you need to go to the FBI\nAnd you need to ask them [noise]\nDid they feel like they were able to do their job without insurance and I think the answer is yes they interviewed over a hundred and fifty people have been interviewed throughout the course of Brett Kavanaugh's life [noise]\nDisregard for interviews no evidence of that so manufacturers [noise] the senators who requested the supplemental\nFBI background check out what they read [noise]\nAnd I am ready to vote okay\nAre they are ready to vote they are going to be voting tomorrow on a procedural question which is going to be to advance the nomination to the Senate floor and apparently the final vote on the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to be adjusted to the Supreme Court will occur\nOn Saturday Susan Collins and Jeff Flake of both said they're very satisfied with the with the FBI investigation and that's an indication that they are probably going to be be necessary margin\nBecause that would give 'em even without Senator Murkowski even without senator mentioned that would give Brett Kavanaugh the fifty votes he needs\nBut wouldn't it be better if the

Bush he didn't get a majority but he got more popular votes than George W. Bush he lost the election\nAnd uh then last time in November of two thousand sixteen Hillary Clinton three million more votes than Donald Trump she didn't get a majority and a yet she lost the election how did that happen what would happen largely because the third and fourth parties but leave that aside\nA President Trump won the election you won the electoral college President Bush won the election won the electoral college so if our caller is right and these protesters are really protesting the system by which we elect presidents the only way to change that as a constitutional amendment\nAnd it won't do you know why\nBecause under our constitution in order to change the constitution you need three quarters of the state legislatures to go along with the change\nAnd there are more than Thirteen states and that's all it would take that are small enough that they would lose a lot of cloud of the electoral college went away I mean right now in New Hampshire is a very important state New Hampshire has only four electoral votes\nBut those four electoral votes in close elections really count people go to New Hampshire not just because the New Hampshire primary states like gum Wisconsin Wisconsin is ten electoral votes\nAnd people go to Wisconsin\nAnd part of the genius of the federal system is meaning it is I mean that you need to win not a majority of the wrong popular vote but a majority of the various states which have their independent existence\nAnd look that does you know those states are are weighted not one vote per each state\nBut they are awaited according to population\nAnd so it's worth down for two hundred and forty years the the idea that that is what this protest is really about what the protest really is about is just his Dario on the left\nAbout\nLosing some of the dictatorial power that had been assumed by activists on the Supreme Court\nLet's go to your calls and to Tammy in Marietta, Georgia you're on the med bed show it's

what's your other disagreement Tammy\nThe green and then I Will answer your question very directly coming right up but go ahead what's your other disagreement Tammy\nThis agreement with a few weeks ago you were talking about [noise] uh I I think I don't know what it was a young black man and he felt unsafe and I'm a white neighborhood\nAnd that does make you make that statement and you're trying to convince you stay true it's true but you don't know how this young men feel in a quiet neighborhood ... any feel unsafe every white neighborhood is not safe\nAnd that's absolutely true you're right I bet a what he was saying is that he feels unsafe in any white neighborhood not just that he feels unsafe and specific white neighborhood which can be crime ridden the point that I was making was that\nIt you know that there is one of the things that is appalling in this country and that we need to continue to make progress on we've made some progress\nIs the highest rate of crime against black people but nearly all of that crime nearly all of it or the overwhelming majority and it's over Ninety percent is perpetrated by other black people and that was the reason that I was speaking about that now let me go to your point about judge Kavanaugh\nDo I know that he is telling the truth or in in terms of his denials about what happened allegedly to Dr Ford I don't know for certain diseases telling the truth\nBut I think the absence of any confirming evidence at all\nIs overwhelming and the whole way that her accusations against him came out or very suspect\nAnd and by the way it is impossible to remove this from a political context\nAnd the reason I feel so outraged about judge Kavanaugh is she really did appear to be the ideal nominee I don't know I've never met him but I Do know people have worked with him closely and they have the highest regard for him including people who are only a left\n'em ... who was a guest on this show recently is a professor of law at Yale who has had interaction with the judge Kavanaugh in the classroom and otherwise\nAnd he's a liberal he was very active in the Hillary Clinton campaign he strongly supports judge Kavanaugh's nomination and the notion\nThat he should be blocked from the Supreme Court\nBased on on early unsupported unprecedented accusations against him seems to me a profound wrong because one of the things that you know about people who are sexual predators real sexual predators and people who commit sexual assault and rape and\nAnd uh at end violence against women\nMost of those people do it as a pattern is not a one off\nAnd the idea that the other accusations against a judge Kavanaugh other than a doctor for it are completely non credible and have been clearly denied a that I think is worth taking into consideration of coming up\nA a very prominent Republicans\nA group of protesters that will be women [noise]\nAny urges those women to grow up\nIs that an outrage we'll play the shocking audio and

when I was five year old kid and report growing up in poverty and saw street for firefighters putting out a far across the alley from where we live and um when I saw those firefighters that day I uh looked at my\nBig brothers and my mom and a little sisters and said I Want to be a fireman when I grow up in a stuck with me all my life that I became a firefighter in St port in Nineteen eighty one and Eighteen years later I became the first African American fire chief in the city of St court records\nExperienced a tremendous amount of discrimination it costs about race or their early ... of my career but through hard work and faith and determination over came out with those challenges but eight years after becoming fire chief in St port I was blessed to become the fire chief in Atlanta on

just under a year when I was recruited back to the city of Atlanta about it the honorable America same read\nIn two thousand and ten and I served him faithfully for five years until I was terminated in January of two thousand and fifty\nOkay this is this whole story your whole story is a great American story and it's a great story of public service and success how how is it you ended up\nWhether you are say you were terminate you were fired was it wasn't because of something that happened in the line of duty what was it that led to your firing\nWell a a year prior to my termination I had published a book that I had written on my own time and self publish for Christian men the book is called\nWho told you that you were neck and just the question that got ask Adam in the garden to eat and ... and I say that because a lot of people don't connect that question with genesis chapter three birth eleven so\nAh so the book is titled who tells you that your neck it overcoming the stronghold of condemnation and uh so that happened a year before I was just spend it ah but the reason why I was terminated this was cause I spent a few paragraphs explaining God's purpose for

and you weren't trying to impose these opinions on some of your men and the fire department where you\nKnow sir not at all so it it was\nMen and the fire department where you know are not at all\nSo it it was the fact is you self published the book he hadn't use public funds what business is it of the city of Atlanta\nOr the mayor of the city council or anybody or what the fire chief does on his personal time as long as it's not disgraceful what was the argument we're using a passage in your book to ruin your career\nWhere their position was that those positions those views conflict it with the city views\nAre and that I can have those you as much as I Want but when I was an employee of the city or I had an obligation to check those beliefs that the door is what one council members get

I Believe I Know the truth but they think about you\nBut these accusations about things that he's done and how what about you know the notion that it was an open secret when he was in high school or college that he was wild and crazy\nUm if this was an open secret and all his friends all of its acquaintances at the time would have known about a and instead it's quite the opposite the people who know him best dozens scores of people from high school and college over\nAnd over again say he was he he was he was not while he was not crazy he was one of the more responsible high school students college students are and and the description of him that's been painted by a few\nAh you know outliers audio and next room mate who you know hasn't you know that yeah they had a falling out or something or is is just not the truth\nI I think that uh Lindsey Graham has come up with a perhaps say a solution about the one kind of\nTest of a judge Kavanaugh that might satisfy the Democrats\nAnd I'm One of the snake as as a a professor of law now and somebody who is very well schools and constitutional law whether you think that a senator Graham's suggestion would be a violation of the eighth amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment here is the principal grant\n[noise]\nWhat else is at the bottom said I'm not you know we don't want to say\nOkay what he says why don't we dumped him in water and see a few floats a good old medieval trial by ordeal what do you think\nOf straight out of my python and the holy grail a and a\nYou know I Do I I I think that this process has been really unfair to to judge capital and also the doctor for I think that they have both been used\nBy Democrats on the Senate committee or for political purposes or their strategy all along has not been to try to find the truth which is a slap in the face the doctor for their ... their their strategy all along has been\nTo do whatever they have to do by any means necessary to lay for the sake of delay and I think the strategy has been transparent it goes back to you know a thousand years ago we were talking about whether or not a million documents was enough or whether it needs to be two million documents it was delayed for the sake of the way\nThat explains why her letter was not investigated in July when it was received and it was only leaked to the press against our will on the eve of judge Kavanaugh's\nConfirmation so for these Democrats talk about um temperament I forgot to talk about credibility\nThese Democrats talk about um temperament I forgot to talk about credibility um [noise] you know it's it takes takes a lot of ... when it comes to credibility judge Kavanaugh's way\nOne if you were speaking the judge Kavanaugh I I Do believe he will be confirmed on Saturday probably with fifty one votes and maybe with fifty votes who knows it could be fifty to a but it will be confirmed and what would you advise him uh in order to\n[noise] to rise above and and prevent all and become the great associate justice of the Supreme Court that we both know we will be\nWhere I Am not going to be present trucks and not enough to to I think that you need my advice but I'll I'll say that uh we saw his judicial temperament and hasn't packet of ... legal mind for twelve years and the DC circuit when he was indicated by the Supreme Court and unparalleled Thirteen times\nAnd we also saw last confirmation hearing\nThat he was outraged about an outrageous process as well he should be and I have confidence that wants to use on the bench spring court hopefully he will be\nThat we will see the judicial temperament that we saw for the past twelve years we don't have to guess about what kind of judge Brett Kavanaugh will be\nYou'll be the same kind of judge she'd been for the past twelve years so I'm looking for that I share your cautious optimism I understand uh you know it's it's the process so farcical at times that at least you could sell it lends itself to jokes but\nBut I Do want to really you know he's serious that that this people have been hurt by Kavanaugh has been hurt his family doctor forward if I received death threats this process stinks\nAnd how do we fix it ... and that's the last question that will have time for Justin Walker professor of law how do we fix the process\nOf my good [laughter] um you know I I'm just a ... or as we were
