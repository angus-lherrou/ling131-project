characteristics particularly of orthodox and conservative Judaism is no one comes on time\nAs soon as I said the services are long\nAnd people don't show up on time\nThey they kind of wander in and

she pulled them or a little bit more an extra minute or two\nAnd and at that point cars started flying and police cars they the cars returns sideways they basically barricaded the road police jumped out with heavy artillery they're using their vehicles as barricades as shields and soon as you said to my my my two daughters there\nAnd and their friends she said you girls we better not get out

know what amazes me about this poll is that is it's very much fits in with a I've gone back and looked at every deadly attack on a Jewish target in the United states\nSince Nineteen Seventy seven or so for the last forty years and ... ... there aren't that many of them\nAnd but most of the\nPeople who died in those attacks were a Christian people who are caught in the crossfire or or even the crossfire because mostly no one was firing back they were Christian people who were in some cases just wrongly targeted there was a ...\nA beautiful guy very devout a Christian and the son of a minister\nWho in April thirteenth two thousand fourteen he was killed by an anti Semite who was attacking the Jewish community center he just brought his grandson there and the grandson was killed two for a singing audition they were doing a program at the Jewish community center\nYeah well that's precisely what were we were worried about was them getting caught in the crossfire also to Michael I

Michael med dot com\nAnd I should also noticed Brian did that uh the battle of New Orleans and the miraculous details concerning that battle also feature in my book the American miracle yeah\nThe er\nPresident Trump is restored Andrew Jackson's portraits of the White House and he clearly admires president Jackson I could President Trump for this moment in his presidency with all of its challenges could he learn something from Jackson's example\nI think so because Jackson was like it will be jail BJ was Jackson more where he said okay what do you eat I'll get it done because you've got to get what I Want done\nYou've heard a lot of deals with the Senate and led reached a Weber is power or gotten a lot of people's face but in the end he got things done and he ... he turned the economy over to Martin Van Buren actually with a surplus and he was the last president to do that now have a devastating\nSo I think that he had to make some deals for that to happen at the same time ah you know both to programs that are out of the country to grow\nAnd he understood the working class more than ... percent more than added was more than my row or to watch it um you know more than John Quincy Adams if he was born of legal means to an orphan and he understood he really thought a Midwest and then be south or the southwest was totally ignored\nSo I think that since Donald Trump constituency is the same one in proportion I think you can go in and cut some deals in order to average greater objective for sale and then see what happens after two years if he loses the house you don't see what happens after six years if you get the second term\nSo I think that's what they need to learn but relentless the fighting spirit he's pretty much got that down\nW O G O lay tally
