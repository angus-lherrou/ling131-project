I Believe I Know the truth but they think about you\nBut these accusations about things that he's done and how what about you know the notion that it was an open secret when he was in high school or college that he was wild and crazy um if this was an open secret and all his friends all of its acquaintances at the time would have known about it\nAnd instead it's quite the opposite the people who know him best dozens scores of people from high school and college over and over again say\nHe was he he was he was not wild he was not crazy he was one of the more responsible high school students college students are and and the description of him that's been painted by a few uh you know outliers or the next room mate who you know has a you know that he had a falling out or something or is is just not the truth\nI I think that uh Lindsey Graham has come up with a perhaps a a solution about the one kind of\nTest of a judge Kavanaugh that might satisfy the Democrats\nAnd I'm One of the snake as as a professor of law now and somebody who is very well schools and constitutional law whether you think that a senator Graham's suggestion would be a violation of the eighth amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment here is Lindsey Graham\n[noise] a hell of a bottom well why don't we don't want her to say\nOkay what he says why don't we dumped him in water and see if he slows the good old medieval trial by ordeal what do you think\nOf straight out of my python and the holy grail a and a\nYou know I Do look I I I think that this process has been really unfair to to judge capital and also the doctor for it I think that they have both been used by Democrats on the Senate committee or for political purposes\nOr their strategy all along has not been to try to find the truth which is a slap in the face to Dr Ford their ... their their strategy all along has been\nTo do whatever they have to do by any means necessary to delay for the sake of delay and I think the strategy has been transparent it goes back to you know a thousand years ago we were talking about whether or not a million documents was enough or whether it needed to be two million documents it was delayed for the sake of the way\nThat explains why her letter was not investigated in July when it was received and it was only leaked to the press against her will on the eve of judge Kavanaugh's\nConfirmation so for these Democrats talk about um temperament\nOr another talking about credibility\nUm [noise] you know it's it takes takes a lot of gumption when it comes to credibility judge Kavanaugh's way either\nOne if you were speaking the judge Kavanaugh I I Do believe you will be confirmed on Saturday probably with fifty one votes and maybe with fifty votes who and who knows it could be fifty to a but it will be confirmed and what would you advise him uh in order to\nTo rise above and and prevent all and become the great associate justice of the Supreme Court that we both know we will be\nWhere I Am not going to be present trips and after two I think that you need my advice but I'll I'll say that uh we saw his judicial temperament and hasn't packet of ... legal my for twelve years on the DC circuit when he was vindicated\nBy the Supreme Court and unparalleled Thirteen times and we also saw in the last confirmation hearing\nThat he was outraged about an outrageous process as well he should be and I have confidence that wants to use on the bench at the Supreme Court hopefully he will be that we will see the judicial temperament that we saw for the past twelve years we don't have to guess about what kind of judge Brett Kavanaugh will be it'll be the same kind of judge she'd been for\nThe past twelve years so I'm looking for that I share your cautious\nOptimism I understand uh you know it's it's the process so farcical at times that it leads to sell it lends itself to jokes but but I Do want to really you know he's serious that this people have been hurt Brett Kavanaugh has been hurt his family doctor for that they've received death threats this process stinks\nAnd how do we think that ... and that's the last question that will have

expect because\nThen they're demonstrating that people are going to rally behind them do you\nUh well they just lost their most important issue I've this is a headline that it's breaking news I mean just today headlined Georgetown Prep alumni clarify meaning of devil's triangle in a letter to Judiciary Committee\nNow this honestly sounds like a parody we have the Judiciary Committee of the United States Senate the world's greatest deliberative body as it's known\nAnd the the Judiciary Committee is pondering a couple\nOf references in Brett Kavanaugh's high school yearbook in Nineteen eighty three here here's the story earlier today a group of Georgetown Prep alumni confirmed Brett Kavanaugh's explanation of the term\nUh devil's triangle\nWhich he was asked about by the committee after it's surfaced in his year book\nBefore alumni who are named Lindsey Davis Bernard McCarthy junior pulmonary and Matthew Quinn clarified that the term devil's triangle refers indeed not to a sexual act as has been alleged by Kavanaugh's detractors\nBut rather to uh drinking game they played in high school they actually played the drinking game devil's triangle\nQuote devil's triangle was drinking game we came up with in high school it was a variation of the game quarters when we played rebels try and go for people sat at a table on the table three small glasses of beer were arranged next to one another to form a triangle each of the four participants took turns being the shooter\nThe shooter attempted to bounce a quarter\nIn to watch the glasses wrote the alumni\nWe do not remember the exact origin of the name but none of us use the phrase devil's triangle in our yearbook to refer to any kind of sexual activity to wash it was just a game with glasses and the shape of a triangle if the phrase devil's triangle had any sexual meaning in the early Nineteen eighties we did not\nKnow what the letter concludes\nSo the biggest objection now again we don't have a letter clarifying booth thing but I Do have the statements from Greg Tomlin I'm associate producer on the Michael ...\nWho comes from very distinguished background his brother and his father and or his grandfather all graduates of Annapolis and naval aviators and great people\nAnd they say that in their family the term blue thing has been used\nUm I'm afraid to say to describe flatulence that's exactly what Brett Kavanaugh testified and the obsession with these issues it can it's it's all over the New York times right now is it just seems to me nutty and strange if you want to\nSpeak for the demonstrators if you share some of their anguish and their occupation of the heart atrium Senate office building I clearly if they're going to try to disrupt the business of the United states in it they will have to be cleared away and arrested\nAnd what is it they are demonstrating for here\nWhat exactly one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and Lindsey Graham spoke out clearly as he has been doing basically his whole career\nBut he had this to say about the FBI investigation that was just completed listen\nI'm confident the FBI did a good job\nThey were not a hindered in any way [noise]\nAh the focus of the background check was credible allegations before the committee [noise]\nUh I was looking for certain things to be answered by witnesses [noise]\nThat what the committee found is held up and then some [noise]\nThe main thing for me\nIs that you need to go to the FBI\nAnd you need to ask them\nDid they feel like they were able to do their job with that are friends not have the answer is yes they interviewed over a hundred and fifty people within interview throughout the course of Brett Kavanaugh's life [noise]\nDisregard for interviews no evidence of that cell manufacturers that senators who requested the supplemental\nFBI background check out what they read [noise]\nAnd I am ready to the\nOkay as they are ready to vote they are going to be voting tomorrow on a procedural question which is going to be to advance the nomination to the Senate floor and apparently the final vote on the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to be adjusted to the Supreme Court\nWill occur on Saturday\nSusan Collins and Jeff Flake both said they're very satisfied with the with the FBI investigation and that's an indication that they are probably going to be necessary margin\nBecause that would give 'em even with an Senator Murkowski even without senator mentioned that would give Brett Kavanaugh the fifty votes he needs but wouldn't it be better if he won with fifty to\nA ...

Wednesday night to demonstrate opposition to President Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nThe vigils attended by thousands nationwide\nBegan early Wednesday evening and states including California Alaska Arizona and more Alaskan Arizona of course are particularly important here because a lot of the four undecided senators and there are only four of one hundred were undecided\nOne is from Alaska and that would be Jeff Flake who is leaving his Senate seat and uh\nThat's Arizona and Alaska Lisa Murkowski the senator from Alaska\nI I Do believe that in the last analysis\n[noise] um probably Murkowski Collins and slate will all come home and vote for Brett Kavanaugh now these are three senators none of whom are great fans of President Trump\nBut even\nWho have been very critical of President Trump and I'm One of them\nWould say that one of the things that he has done that has been wonderful\nIn his administration and yes I think it's been wonderful he's appointed exceptionally find judges and not just Neil Gorsuch but appellate court judge isn't a record number of them have been confirmed thank you Mitch McConnell this is the way it's supposed to be president\nThank you Mitch McConnell this is the way it's supposed to be\nPresident working with the majority leader to put good\nPeople and the judiciary and not people are going to upset our constitution or tear at our constitution there are people who are returning to the constitutional order\nAnd to limit the power of the judiciary by the way that is extraordinary because\nThere is a normal human desire to grab as much power as you can\nAnd the idea of a constitutional is judge like Antonin Scalia or Neil Gorsuch or Brett Kavanaugh is that someone says look I I get to decide a lot of things as a justice of the Supreme Court but I don't get to make new legislation or\nCreate or discover new rights that no one ever suspected existed\nBefore that's refreshing and it's worth supporting and I think it's um it's very much\nA force in unifying the Republican Party the Republican Party hasn't been so unified on any issue not even the tax cuts\nThough they did go through\nThis issue I think is unified conservative sentiment across the board number one because Brett Kavanaugh is a good man and an outstanding judge who by the way who's judgment who've been affirmed by the Supreme Court in the past\nIn a record number of them\nHe is a been a very successful judge so far he's a good man the other reason is unified the Republican Party is because the Democratic of salt\nHas been so despicable and it has been despicable and childish and demeaning I Do think there's going to motivate Republicans to turn out to care about this election and it should and with any hope\nIt all it after all the hysteria will discourage Democrats\nThe um [noise] this is breaking for Mac CEOs on the mid term elections\nJust breaking just released top Republicans ... that they're seeing a surprising and widespread surgeon GOP voter enthusiasm powered largely by support for Brett Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court nomination what they're saying\nThe Kavanaugh debate has dropped a
