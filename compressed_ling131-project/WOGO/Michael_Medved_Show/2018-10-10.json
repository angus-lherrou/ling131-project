manage to hold the house and hold the Senate it doesn't do any good for the country when the other side is just completely off the rails\nAnd and bizarre we will get to that with Governor Jindal and I also want to speak to you about the proposition of revolution and the civil war their voices on the left and on the right\nWho say we're in the midst of a civil war or a cold civil war and may not be actual bloodshed but when you have people ranging from Carl Bernstein to on the left\nAnd Thomas Friedman the New York times on the left\nTo people like Victor Davis Hanson on the right and they're all saying yeah civil wars year we're on the verge of fighting here is uh what Carl Bernstein had to say on CNN about why he believes were in the midst of the civil war listen\nI think one thing we need to understand is the larger context of all of this and that is\nThat we are in a coal civil war in this country a than these two events are both of our investigation and the Kavanaugh's nomination are almost a the the Gettysburg and then the the the\nThe absolutely essential battles of this cold civil war in both the Democrats and the Republicans unfortunately uh own understand that and are exploiting\nPublications unfortunately uh\nOwn understand that and are exploiting their uh instead of having two parties committed to finding out the truth in these two important matters we are now into serious tribalism ear\nOkay Gettysburg and anti them\nGettysburg over the three day battle there were over fifty thousand casualties I mean fifty thousand or anti them bloodiest single day in American history there were twenty five thousand casualties in a single days battle and by the way both of those battles\nFor people who know your civil war history and I know a bunch of you to do both of those battles resulted in the union successfully\nAll because they're right winger I don't think anyone needs to fear a rescuer who comes up and then won't rescue from some of the devastation of this hurricane are based upon you're wearing a ...\nIt's it's not going to happen that way and again I think that Governor Scott of Florida who's doing a terrific job and yes he's running for Senate as a Republican but I don't think people are going to say well I don't want to get help from Governor Scott because he's a Republican\nI mean at a time like this doesn't matter they are also ready and they're all Americans\nAnd everybody is going to need a little help and that part of the world cleaning up from this disaster it's complete complete disaster\nAnd it's a serious thing but I think that looking at that perspective is important when a Hurricane Florence hidden South Carolina North Carolina I didn't hear anybody\nNo not even Spartacus not even the most outspoken not even Mazie Hirono\nCrazy Mazie uh didn't hear any of these people saying no no no no no way no FEMA no help for North and South Carolina because they both carried for Trump and these are very conservative states on the south Carolina's okay if you didn't hear that\nAnd that's different from a civil war isn't it let's go to a your calls to a Melvyn in Columbus ohio Melvin you're on the Michael Mann that show\nHello how are you I'm doing well\nI like I I had to come in regarding the civil war fighting the war I think it's um it's important to make sure we say that it's a coat civil war 'cause it's kind of strategic\nAnd award on the wealth and the resources that were alligator governed by the white male you know that was built the last two hundred years and minorities and women are trying to get a larger share of that so that's where I Believe the wars are correct\nBut if you're talking about trying to get a larger share of wells that depends on how if you're talking about going into somebody's house and tying them up and and then breaking into their safe and stealing their money okay then use that as a kind of civil war\nBut if what you're talking about is we're going to perform better and we're going to start our own businesses and we're going to build up our own community and we're going to earn more that's just normal American competition that's what the free market encourages\nThat kind of like the side of your power you're all out and I think if you buy it power\nOkay how can you give me can you give me one indication I understand what you're trying to say Melvin I Do but let me ask you this can you think of one law that either a justice Kavanaugh is going to shore up\nOr a law that he's going to strike down where he is going to act to keep power concentrated for white males which which laws are you most concerned about their\nOr whatever and I start with fair does act equal rights I'm if\nWell that's that's the that's the fourteenth amendment
