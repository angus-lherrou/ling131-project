almost sure to be another number one New York times best seller is called killing the ss\nThe hunt for the worst war criminals in history I'm a bill ... everyone seems to agree and I know that you do because I've read you on this subject that this confirmation process for the Supreme Court is just broken and I mean is broken beyond\nRecognition that senator Collins said as everyone has said this entire thing devolved into a circus unworthy of the United States Senate and then we're the spring court what can we do to fix it\n[noise] well I don't think uh [noise]\nWhat can we do to fix it [noise] well I don't think ah [noise] that's going to happen anytime soon the fixing because there's too much money being made\nImmediate precincts by playing one side or the author see I I always come back to this because it really is the driver\nOf how people uh come to conclusions politically socially entertainment wise you have an eating out is making a ton of money either hating Trump or liking right so the cable news stations are divided one\nSupports Trump Fox to hate Trump CNN MSNBC but all of them are making money from Trump\nAnd they're not going to stop hating 'em or liking him no matter what he does the newspaper industry is dying and he only newspapers that are visible are the hate Trump papers like um the New York times in a Washington Post Wall Street journal editorial page is fair to Trump by\nTheir report Taj as anti Trump now they're all doing it to make money so the New York times understands that will go out of business\nIf it covers Trump fairly even fairly\nIt has to hate Trump in order to keep it subscription rate high so when you have money a driving media coverage which is what you do have now\nAnd you can extended the talk radio where you live okay when you have that situation you're not going to have fair reporting you're not going to have moderate commentary you're going to have extremism because extremism is good for the wallet for these corporations\nWouldn't you think that the New York times as the journal of record 'em could survive and maybe even thrive if it were more unpredictable as it were more up to the middle of it weren't so reflects ... liberal\nNo I think the New York times who's now so ideologically driven if you look at their um\nIf you look at the people running the paper from the owner on down um they're all far left people\nThe whole history is that and they're invested in that so they'll never do it could they have a business plan and expands I doubt it younger Americans don't read newspapers you know anybody under fifty doesn't read them they read it on the Internet\nUm so they got to go to the people that they know where we knew the subscription and times case it's liberal New Yorkers liberal people out of town back all let's reading it and um the Washington Post is gone the same way\nDon't you think that with the legacy the post has that it wouldn't you hire a guy like Martin Baron [laughter] to be your editor I mean this guy it's been a committed left this first whole life I mean it's like Christine\nFord as soon as I saw the doctor hire the most extreme left lawyers in the country I knew that Dr forge presentation was only about what may have happened to her but it was about politics\nAs soon as I saw her attorneys were I knew was politics and that has been now proven that they're the political component in the whole Ford hierarchy the whole crew\nWas designed to get Kavanaugh and all the people in the crew were Kavanaugh haters and that's that if you were an agreed the American and you had been mistreated you don't go out and hire an ideological lawyer you hire the best forensic lawyer you can hire that's what you do\nSo it was too much money and there's too much political shenanigans going on for me to be optimistic that we'll ever have a fair process of confirming anyone in this country at least in the short\nTerm don't you suspect that and by the way I Do think that it's more likely than not that President Trump is going to get in his first term and and that's even assuming that he gets his second term but in his first term he could very well get another Supreme Court appointment\nWhich we are giving organs on our last legs [laughter] you know what I'm saying that way she's such a but I Know I I mean she's eighty five young eight now she's eighty five\nEighty five ... she's at night they bred areas or why he's Seventy ... to yeah\nHe's he's yes I think he may be Seventy nine he's yeah they're they're both under\nThese are too liberal lions and um the as you said I mean they're going to happen at any time so but the court now is uh where Trump wants to debate even if you a Republican you voted for him you know like um you know like a style you know like your handled himself you know I'm the court is a traditional court again\nBut if he if he if Trump and let's say that Justice Ginsburg resigns and President Trump a points Amy Coney Barrett who apparently was the runner up to ... I don't know and\nShe will be the next nominee if Trump gets it\nYeah and it would be the one\nAnd and don't you think they will try to attack her as a whole Catholic fanatic seven children and\nOf course I Do or they'll try to paint her as some Amish person [laughter] doesn't go far\nNot not not that there's anything wrong with Amish\nYou know I mean the extremists are never going to be not screened and that's the lifestyle they live\nUm you know\nSo it shows just back to the media and Alice is which you've just been putting forward don't you think there should be room for the same way that Roger Ailes started Fox News recognizing there was room in the market that there needed to be a conservative voice\nUh don't you think there should be room for something more up to the middle than what we've got right now\nI'm sure a and I think that you could make money doing it [laughter] but it's not easy and it requires a tremendous investment um people come to me all the time I go and

he supported his support for traditional marriage\nDidn't attack anybody didn't stigmatize anybody didn't insult anybody who was fired because he wrote a book on his own time and this is what a chief

let me just share with you some of what a Brett Kavanaugh wrote in and it's now they are declaring even over at NBC they have up there no more undecided votes on Capitol everyone has announced\nAll the Republicans plus Joe mansion with the exception of Lisa Murkowski voting yes that means fifty one vote yes on confirming Kavanaugh\nAll the Democrats with the exception of Joe mansion voting no and uh the Democrats are joined by the one Republican dissenter Lisa Murkowski so pretty much straight party line vote with one switch on each side\nUh fifty one forty nine vote it's one of the reasons that it's so important to get a better majority in the Senate\nOr today Brett Kavanaugh wrote\nThe Supreme Court must never be viewed as a partisan institution the justices do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle they do not caucus in separate rooms as I've said repeatedly if confirmed the court I Would be part of a team of nine committed to deciding cases according to the constitution and the laws of the United states I Would always try to be a team player\nDuring the confirmation process I met with sixty five senators\nThe only reason he didn't meet with all one hundred as most of the Democrats would meet with him they refused\nAnd I explained my approach to belong\nHe writes I participated more than thirty hours of hearings before the Senate Judiciary committee and I submitted written answers to nearly one thousand three hundred\nAdditional questions I was grateful for the opportunity after all those meetings and after my initial hearing concluded I was subjected to wrongful and sometimes vicious allegations\nMy time in high school and college more than Thirty years ago has been ridiculously distorted my wife and daughters have faced violent and violence threats\nHe writes I was very emotional last Thursday more so than I have ever been I might have been too emotional at times I Know that might tone was sharp and I said a few things I should not have said\nI Hope everyone can understand that I was there was a son has been in that I testified with five people for most of my mind my mom my dad my wife and most of all my daughter's going forward\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael thank you first of all for having me on your show the most important thing to keep it going\nTo make sure that we have the right people in Congress\nAnd they said that know what it takes to get the economy growing right ah obviously the president as a job creator and so you first and what it takes to make jobs and to create jobs and to keep them going which was a pro growth economy had lower regulation less red tape led government and lower taxes\nAnd these are the three things that are small business owners were asking for and they got in the navy and small business optimism sky high consumer optimism sky high and you're seeing the results right three point seven percent unemployment rate record low a numbers are in terms of unemployment also for Hispanic black\nYouth of for example weapon eight percent I heard it below ... percent now I mean if it it it's incredible but we need folks who understand what it takes to make an economy grow and those are the people we currently have in place right now\nOkay so what happens if I'm the ... the a disaster happens for conservatives and the Democrats take over the house of representatives and they immediately focus on trying to wipe out the tax cuts what happens to the prosperity\nIt's going to go away I mean there's there's no other question I mean they have to point blank promise\nA you know we've heard Nancy Pelosi say this we've heard Elizabeth Warren stay with her Bernie Sanders said as we heard Chuck Schumer the this right that come to this November they take the house over but first thing they're going to do is start working on repealing the tax cuts\nWhich has made which really made the United states go from one of the most uncompetitive countries across the globe me most competitive country again back to be the envy of all trades partners across the country with a wonderful trade deals that have now are are now happening across the board look at the new NAFTA for example the U. S. M. C. A. is the president's calling it\nMisses now jumpstart and making may factor for example be alive and come back and true here in the United states over a million a factory jobs now being created and President Obama if you remember that that could not be done that may actually it was done in this country\nYeah and and what is bizarre here is a again they not only one to raise taxes and they want to kill Medicare in effect because when they're talking about one third of all the Democrats in the house or co sponsoring a Medicare for all bill\nRight what happens to our whole Medicare system if you get into a situation where you're giving Medicare to people who are sixteen and twenty five and thirty a instead of reserving it for the senior citizens of actually paid for it\nI mean Michael this this is this is one of the biggest things that we have to talk about the nobody's actually talked about the thank you for bringing this up this Medicare for all the expected costs for that is thirty seven trillion dollars\nThat's early in the ... billion trillion yet so thirty seven thousand billion dollars\nI I mean it's it's it's absolutely over ten years writes it so there's no way to that sustainable what's going to end up happening is Medicare for all the medicine for none right as far as I'm concerned is going to be the same thing that happened with Obamacare you're basically setting up but\nThat can input on it because it's just not survive that way we're going to eventually go back exactly where the Democrats want to go which is a single payer system period\nOkay right now the these congressional races are so close I I Do want people to get involved and you can get involved by going to tax cuts work dot com it's a great source of information and engagement\nAnd getting engaged is the crucial thing one of the points that people have made is that\nOne of the impact of this whole cabinet thing has a lot of Republicans who are kind of sitting back and enjoying some of the economic good news and some of the good news on foreign policy we're just taking it easy they weren't particularly excited or worried about this election time to get excited don't you think\nMichael absolutely I mean one of the things you've been around obviously a while and very election season called the October surprise I think the October surprise here is that the Democrats are priced themselves have this whole thing Kavanaugh thing blew up in their faith\nI'm ... and we're going to see that enthusiasm gap for example the past week alone I think we've seen that not only in the state by state level but across the country has closed up almost entirely\nThe badgers on Saturday Night\nW O G O lay tally ... awful\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nKnow Republicans Susan

fact he wrote that the Supreme Court precedent strongly suggested that there was a compelling interest in facilitating access to birth control\nThere it's also been can set up a focus on the future of the abortion rights based on the concern that judge cabinet or what the CIA overturn roe v way protecting this race is important to me\nTo my knowledge judge Kavanaugh\nIs the first Supreme Court nominee\nTo express a view that precedent is not nearly a practice and tradition but rooted in article three\nOf our constitution itself he believes that precedent and not just a judicial policy it is constitutionally gift Kate it\nTo pay attention and pay he two roles of precedent\nIn other words that's Jason ... goal or an aspiration it is the constitutional candidate that has to be followed except in the most extraordinary circumstances\nThe judge further lie that President provide stability predictability reliance and fairness\nThere are of course rare and extraordinary time where the Supreme Court foot\nOh of course rare and extraordinary times where the Supreme Court foot racing overturn a precedent the most famous example roe versus one where when the Supreme Court in brown versus the board of education over rules plastic versus for Ferguson\nCorrecting a gravy asleep wrong decision to use the judges term allowing racial inequality\nBut someone who believes that the importance of precedent has been rooted in the constitution would follow longest tablets president except in those rare circumstances\nWhere a decision is gravy asleep wrong or deeply in ... with the law does\nOur judge Kavanaugh's phrase it\nAs the judge just started to me a long established precedent it's not something to be trimmed narrowed just guarded or Oprah lost its roots in the constitution get the concept I'm Sorry to say since greater weight such as the president\nCan't be trimmed or narrowed simply because the judge might want to on a whim\nEnsured his views on honoring president what prints clued a chance to do by stealth\nBad which one has committed not to do over noting that roe\nV Wade was decided forty years forty five years ago and reaffirmed Nineteen years later and Planned Parenthood versus Casey\nI asked judge Kavanaugh or\nWhether the passage of time is relevant to following president he said decisions become part of our legal framework with the
