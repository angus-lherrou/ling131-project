up and ready to go and then nobody shows up yeah\nThey're trying to you know their their\nMomentum kind of swung down a little bit kind of gone or they're not here and by then the other way they are but the raiders are bigger and stronger and failure and more talented and accolades scoring right away with a big long run I mean it's nothing like that to really\nPut a big hurting somebody right away right and and they're doing a great job in them and I'm kind of enjoying this mark because I get to see from what you could guide yeah play it right on right now I'm sure we'll see more of them get in the field out here in the second half and the ... and\nThe raiders are doing a nice job of filtering and they're young kids that are young kids are just as big\nAs some of our older kids mhm they just got a nice program going there so All right let's\nTry to reach out some of this going and there's been a lot of it in his first half a with over ten minutes to go in the first half a sixty nine yard touchdown run that I think we were in some doubt like could that possibly offend the eighth grade quarterback but at the rest of my knowledge was generally the better the senior at that point\nWho rented around right and for sixty nine hours that you point ... conversion was successful I think that's one of the few that was not Jericho Peterson though he had a number of them\nThan a fifty two yard touchdown pass again with a twenty nine to go and a half a\nAnd a to point conversion was good it was sixteen to nothing with seven twenty four\nTo going to have joined pathetic intercepted a pass from getting the ... starting quarterback at the time was prior to the injury Kendra and go to your point conversion was good on a Peterson run and it was twenty four to nothing again that's with four and a half minutes gone by without minutes\nForty left in the habit Fifteen are touchdown run by Jericho Peterson\nAn unbelievable given he also had a to point to a conversion catch to make it thirty ... thirty nine point six seconds left in the first quarter Dylan Drake are picked up a\nStumble I think ten or ... had been the quarterback of the time or early on in his tenure or played a little better as time has gone on but he lost the ball it was taken into the hands on for a score to make it a thirty eight to nothing and the two point conversion made it forty on a run by Peterson Jericho Peterson\nAnd then with nine twenty nine to go in the second quarter or fifty two yard touchdown run by hunter why go for the raiders making it forty six to nothing [noise]\nI think that's the first time and the only time and a half or two point conversion failed forty six nothing than McDonalds scored at six thirty eight left and a half will catch that your for

Maria was uh one of the younger fellows number sixteen for mountain Ira viewers are Tyler lamb Maria name was just a freshman year to carries for ten years and I've been ... also a carrier for six so you can see now I said yeah they've had a number of significant runs mark right I mean you can see a number of\nA double digit runs and and that was really a herd of defense you know in the ... when you got that quarterback and again everybody knew that a job with that I was going to be the man to stop and you score that first touched off Robin\nLet everybody know what was going on and then again a jerk or Peterson does a fantastic job when he's in the open field ... it'll just eight man I man\nYeah a lot of room there and you've got a good running back it's a they can make things happen\nMhm uh receptions wise or shy they're catching a two balls for McDonald's really haven't heard much from him lately known up the kind of pulled back but to carry your catches for twenty five yards a valid threats catches for seven or written three catches for fifty one I'm giving him credit on the hook in ladder\nWhich was caught by a salad or and then as me nearly handed out to him which was very successful play and that central to catch it for fifty seven yards the eighth grader really standing out there and so he's not one of the shining lights one of the nice surprise us here today\nYes and it's ah it's good to see that I'm a I'm a bet that will maybe see a couple of more eighth graders seldom that field if not on the office of side maybe on the defensive side\nAnd meanwhile I also read receptions at fifty two yards a bin ...

half\nOf the high school football game you gotta running clock so that clock continues to run and now is due back the eighth grade quarterback you're going to have a long pass receiver down the field and I had the McDonald's a fender bender looking that time said they'll touch probably might have been able to pick that up but in complete\nHim a very long past maybe a little under thrown on that one\nYeah well I guess just from their standpoint they still want to play their full game recognize that they still have a season that's progressing and I don't know what the playoffs looks like in Minnesota was arms of privacy they afford one foreign one record coming in today so\nYou know I don't know how that nightmare for\nMe but I think for for McDonnell and and folks in ship or who are following this program you'll watch with interest you know usually with the coverage it's uh\nThe TV coverage as a pass fail they gotta look back quite a McDonald's center has got to it's difficult to be aware of the quarterback and the ball and ah that time again an incomplete pass but ah for the max ... just a freshman right it's it's kind of a learning thing but nowhere that\nBall is right and again that's a theme that very same play actually passed the run up three times now\nAnd they just do the little play action and they send their tied down streets all in the middle of fields and the right somebody's got to keep an eye on him\nSo third again an incomplete pass is like that the clock would ordinarily stop not the case here ... the quarterback receiver in motion left or right rolling did the right to back looking now he's going to scramble here's the chased\nBy my down they cannot snack and now he's going to run up to the fifty American wrapping short of a first down\nAnd

rather it seems like something revenue and so I just wanted to get the information out there that folks up because you know as you know hackers that are finding new ways to Provence here uh to access your money\nAnd now just a few weeks ago we got a phone call from our our local um I'm a credit union and they know our habits anyway they they they got a um a um check that said a so called purchase set up was near Fifteen thousand dollars from the popular a sporting goods chain\nAnd uh they produced we went to go see the next one they produce that similarly upstairs it's our check we don't use two minute checks but somebody was able to take our check and and there's er there's there's there's or address or routing number there's already ... the the the check that one was a little bit different\nBut there was it was like fourteen thousand dollar is from from this this place and I called to if I can say the name of the company\nYeah sure go ahead yeah it's a ... okay so I called them\nThat's a lot older that's a lot of fishing gear by the way I was in the same boat [laughter] All right but wait\nBefore you continue I Want to know so the check looks really good\nIt was it was a it was our check the only difference was that it had a different name on it [noise] and uh yeah so yeah we had that so when I I I contacted a they they were most interested in and say what was going on because I told her I said that if it's it's not just one\nBut I suspect that there may be some other things going on maybe it's not only with our account but with other people's accounts as well sure and sure enough yeah there was and so they they put a stop on it but the guy said that he had his own experience was that this was the second or third ah like\nI'm a I'm a ... a problem that he had seen and so I don't know if this was if he had any awareness or if there was something that you might be able to offer because the next day here where the credit union\nAnd and to do the fraudulent paperwork and or I kind of good stuff well the the bank manager right then and there as she got some information and she said hey they just took nine hundred dollars from your checking\nUm she yeah yeah they were okay so so so that the number one I'm impressed that your credit union called you I mean that's really something right there I don't know a lot of banks that might do that\nA number two is that they were able to potentially pass this check through so what what did the banks say that you could do as precautionary means right now\n[laughter] well the only thing that we had to do was to actually shut down the the our account number and switch over to another one not the the routing number wasn't anything um but certainly because we wanted to maintain a we'd been there for years and that again they know our habits that was a that kind of a defensive player\nAnd so I so I guess the the big thing to take away message here is that a lot of people don't like to keep track of their checking accounts right I mean\n[laughter] well sometimes it's just very easy not to think about doing it at ... and to be honest this caught us at off guard a bit because we were right smack in the gym right smack in the middle of but just saw her house and a lot of the house but we are we're right in the middle of moving I mean if it was like a constant\nOr you know and then when you're moving like that I mean jeeze I mean the last thing you want to think about is if somebody who's trying to steal from you know what I mean it's crazy\nUm you know what Randy thank you so much for your call today and thank you for spreading the word because there is any takeaway take home message from this is that if you have not been watching what's going on with your checking account\nYou need to do it at least once a month appointment on your calendar so that have popped up on your phone and say you know it just scan it doesn't take too long\nI mean obviously you've noticed at Fifteen

end have issues with their website or unable to log in to our phone up things like that and a lot of times you know how people are when they are on hold bill push this button though that button to try to get a life you know\nAnd I've actually taken calls just like what you're describing also liquid Randy called in probably about ten minutes ago right so we're in light of all of these things and you just mentioned about technology and you mentioned about monitoring couch\nWhen I'm done primary but large amount of people to call it generally seniors are they tend to be a good target for fraudsters\nWhat do you think is probably the best reason for them to get involved or stay involved on line and with technology what's the biggest reason than your mind that would be beneficial to them\nAnd what why do you ask\n'em personally I've run into the worst um I've I've I've seen and heard it all over the many many years that have been doing this\nUh I've talked to many Rand is over the past um I've dealt with the truck scams that you mentioned um and all of those are very personal\nOne universal thing pretty much comes into play and unless something dramatic cap of ... so vast majority of these things I discovered after the fashion or if they are somebody who is still gets a paper statement than the good at the end of the month [laughter] it's it's far the money's long gone\nAnd the ability to recover is is\nJust you know that that's a good point you're right Korea's position that that's a real\nChance that's a really good point is that I'm thinking of even my mother she gets a paper statement at the end of the month right by the time you get the statement your account can be wiped out and exactly so you know so ... they're so the whole thing is to educate
