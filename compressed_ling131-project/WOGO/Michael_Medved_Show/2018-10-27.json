hundred top stations we talk about everything digital and living in the best digital lifestyle ever\nAnd before we go back to all of your fantastic phone calls interesting items across my screen that you need to know about because after all I always want you to be up to date and this whole tech race we're going to start with\nA little item from the oh my gosh\nThe newest smartphone\nHow would you like a phone that you could actually fold up and then shoved in your pocket right it's something that several tech makers are racing to release and now it seems at Sam's down to the first one at the gate they're going to be releasing the first ... phone that's right\nThey tease the big reveal the device that its developer conference a on a tweet\nThey tease the big reveal the device at its developer conference a on a tweet to show the short animation showing\nTwo lines unfolding into an arrow anything that a full smartphones could be in the future now it looks like the big reveal is going to be happening in San Francisco on November seventh\nNow I haven't seen rumors that the Samsung folded all phone is not a thousand dollars not Fifteen hundred dollars and try it if you want the Samsung fold the phone [noise] uh one thousand eight hundred dollars crazy I Wonder if it makes phone calls\nAnd while we're on the topic of phones well everyone's going bigger and better well one little company is making one little phone it's a phone about the size of a credit card to think about the food to the fold will fall and the big one that you're putting your pocket what if he would just have a little tiny found the size of a credit card\nWell if the brand new palm many smartphone the variety than exclusive phone is available on November ... second the full retail price is three hundred and fifty bucks tiny tiny Android powered smartphone here's the deal\nGotta listen this is not meant to be you're going to phone doesn't even have its own phone number instead the palm\nMany smartphone uses numbers shared think with your primary phone so you have your big phone and you have your little phone and they share the same phone number [noise] the whole idea that you could take the palm out with you when you don't want to carry your bank handset\nAnd because it's an Android devices back in the think your messages by the way if you have an iPhone so it's like a phone for your phone like a mini me or you put a strap on him for your wrist or you call it a smart\n[laughter] Oh thank you very much for taking my question\nYou betcha alright so tell me what's going on\nOkay so we have a a hot spot that's like a jet pack and we have unlimited plant [noise] ah we have twenty five gigabytes of data and we used Fifteen in like four hours and then and we go down to the bottom and it's slow extremely slow\nPace of flower or ours\nWow yeah because I have two teenage boys you're updating their [laughter] video game or X. box and and what not and\nThen my husband and I like to look at things on the Internet and I know I have another one that has an eye pad he likes to get games and it's just to the point where I was just I'm frustrated so I was wondering if a we boost for the home it's a cell phone signal booster that I've looked\nAt and you plug it into one of the house and like in the end of the other end of the house and I was just wondering if something like that would work fresh\n[noise] no [noise] no [noise] um\nIt's all it's doing at that point is it's boosting the signal okay and so it's amplifying\nThe signal so the whole idea is that if you don't have decent cellular coverage is that you can buy this booster and then instead of having like three bars you might have for bars okay uh and it does it by amplifying the connection with them in a certain area around you\nOkay a kitchen so that's not going to help you um I assume that you this is the only option\n[noise] well I'm that's why I'm calling you because it it's to the point where we've gone over to a friend's house the Internet to uh teach\nWhat you do what she 'cause you know it's you know you can get fifty gigs but if you're blowing through ... you know Fifteen gigs in four hours I mean what's the sense right I mean you're right\nThat ah there's always satellite\nAnd yeah we try well we've heard our neighbors to gripe about it\nYeah if you don't want specially when you're looking at games and you've got three guys in the house that are trying to do games that's not going to work or doesn't work very well it also crawls um have you looked into a DSL\nLine and that comes from a company ... because we called our uh TV company and\nIt is that those Bactrim\nYes okay stack them an charter and nobody will come down our wrote it was followed them since two thousand for\n[noise] I just for giggles okay let me tell you let me tell you a couple of things from Kaye\nIs it a friend of mine recently purchased a home in North of ... there's probably isn't going to be the day but north of Scottsdale, Arizona okay [noise]\nAnd so you have Phoenix you have Scottsdale and then you have like this stretch of road where there's nothing okay miles with her I mean\nAnd and she bought this beautiful house in the middle of five acres okay All right it's in the house has like a thousand square feet but she likes it because there's she has no neighbors right right now\nThe ... square feet but she likes it because there's she has no neighbors right\nRight now she's also a doctor on call [noise] and so\nBefore so she has the house in escrow and she's totally Cosby she freaks out ... it's like\nOh my God what am I going to do I don't think there's Internet and we I have this house in escrow\nSo I told her just to uh I I did some homework for her and I found a a a gentleman who lives about a mile away from her\nWho who has a line and has set up a point to point Internet access service with some of his neighbors\nOK okay and she pays fifty dollars a month and\nShe said she's got Netflix she's moved in she has no issues you know things like that her kids are now in college so she doesn't have to worry about you know three kids gaming she has five kids and no she was worried about that right [noise]\nBut but still she is able to get to to fight in and she has to look at you know X rays or whatever it may be just look at them in real time right mhm\nSo but she's able to do that through a point to point service so I'd see if there were any options in in a if you just Google years the code with point to point that's what it's called or sometimes it's called fixed Floyd wireless\nAnd basically all you need you don't need any lines you need a line of sight\nOkay so if there are a lot of mount or is it a lot of mountains around you know OK okay\nSo so if they're sometimes if you have a lot of mountains that it doesn't work but years ago as I I Believe it or not I live in the center of Phoenix and there were a cable company wouldn't come down the street and I actually had to have a fixed point wireless lined put in on the roof\nThat I could go down to South Mountain from my house which I Know that doesn't mean luck to you but it's like twenty miles by the bird flies okay so uh so I Would look around to see if there's any type of fixed point wireless I Would also call wins train in your area\nUh to see if they have any options for you as well you know other than that you know you don't waste your money on a booster a cause you you know these game updates could be a gig right there and then I start playing you know you're you're looking at even just a movie could be three gigs\nAnd uh so you know and then and then of course you're gonna have to tell the kids that you know there was a time not too long ago when you used to walk to school on the railroad tracks\n[laughter] in the snow with no shoot exactly [laughter] so they're just gonna have to go to the library okay we'd been there at all out you

a total fat okay\nYou know as a matter of fact when I ... and I know you've heard me tell a story that when I was trying to syndicated show I called this guy CPS his name was Frank Murphy Hi Frank and casual listening and Frank told me that that a show about computers in the Internet would never work because it was going to be a fad a fad like the pet rock\n[laughter] and I'll never forget that 'cause he said it's like a pet ... for my iPhone is just a pet rock sitting in my pocket speaking of the phone when's the last time you used a pay phone I don't even know do they even exist anymore\nOr I saw them in Great Britain okay summer no I I've been a long time\nAnd so I was standing there it's actually quite funny is I'm standing there like in front of the phone booth where there's a phone you know like in front of the phone booth were inside there's a pay phone and were you on your phone no and I was just stand there like being towards like\nHi okay and in bust out laughing and I said what are you laughing at okay behind me there\nWere all these naked women like on the phone booth like but their phone numbers and they found a use for the phone booths exactly which is also the phone book\nBut it isn't that something that's crazy you have a phone book or the telephone operator yes the telephone technology for the longest time did not change\nAnd now we just fast forward and when when did the iPhone come out and years ago two thousand seven that was ten years prior to that it was fifty years the same old phone okay did you have an Atari twenty six hundred yeah\nHow are we are all generations video games game boys just had a game boy how they say go CD against this generation than anything about that no cars on their parents' phone they don't know anything about a road atlas\nLike a map map yeah now now that would have had good right yeah okay\nI've never I never learned how to fold up a map and I I don't think I'm going to try now\nOkay America Online now you know I started the computer section at AOL years and years and years ago do you remember when everywhere everywhere you turn around that somebody put an AOL disc play out in the cereal box that you went to store it was everywhere that was really genius marketing right there\nBecause how they did that behind the scenes\nIs that and I could I could talk about it now I'm sure I'm not under any more non disclosure agreement says that we'll find out Tuesday [laughter] that with AOL is that if you gave a desk\nSometimes you'd make ten dollars at that person is that is that person used your desk to sign up for AOL you just made ten bucks\nSo we always got them from another place that doesn't exist anymore and that was blockbuster video so you're telling me when we got our Fifteen hundred free hours of AOL blockbuster was making my yes and then they would make money every single month I mean oh wow yeah it was really crazy for a while\nI mean this is like in the early nineties I was I was banking like ten grand a month\nJust on AOL biscuit yeah just how are you getting them in people's hands just down a corner chopping them up and people\nYou know like I've been in the science [laughter] no I was I Would put him in like because I had the computer tutor videotaped oh okay\nI put 'em in the videotapes and then people would use them to sign him do one day they just said we're not doing this anymore we're not paying for this any more\n[noise] yeah you know what happened is that so you know so I'm like I started the computers to actually get this whole AOL thing going on okay and then they changed managers at the top right and they actually called me up\nAnd that month I had gotten in the old numbers I've gotten like a check for twenty five grand for the month just by people using the disk you handed that it was the disc and then taken using the computer section okay ah I I that I managed and this was my job right okay so all of a sudden\nThis guy calls me up but he says you know how like we've been paying you every month\nWell now we want you to pay us up a bit different I took a different character I said well that's not going to really work for me [laughter] thanks okay and so that\nWas when using key word commando instead of going to AOL that I knew we negotiate I didn't go that it would go to commando dot\nCom that's when you watch the website but that is also when I learned a very valuable lesson\nIs not to depend upon the company\nFor the marketing of your company so that's why when Facebook came out I was so like I Am not sending anybody to Facebook because I already gotten screwed over by AOL right so why would I Do that which speaking of one last one can you make the sound of a dial up modem\n[laughter] [noise] what was that anyway [laughter] yeah one on one hand shakes like all the handshaking no garbled [noise] yes\nI mean it was so bad that you know sometimes we go away and and where there'd be no Internet or anything and I like walking around making that sound like\nYou can only do they do that intentionally yes\nThey wanted it to sound like you know they wanted people to know that that was
