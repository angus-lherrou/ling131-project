vote is going to be counted and it's going to be counted fairly and it's not going to be basically invalidated by all sorts of phony votes\nWell there's a new book that says you got to be concerned\nAnd the book is called fraud how the left plan is to steal the next election and you might just sort of throw this on the pile and say well this is nothing but actually it's a book by Eric eggers who is research director for the government accountability Institute\nAnd he's worked with Peter Schweitzer has been a frequent guest on this show on the Clinton Cash or extortion and secret empires which blues the lid off a different kind of corruption right now\nFraud is about vote fraud one of the most ... basic forms of fraud imaginable a Eric thanks very much for joining us and congratulations on the book\nHey thanks so much Michael it's great to be here\nOkay first of all we seen this New York times in the Washington Post time and time again there is no evidence that voter fraud has ever ever occurred\nThere is no evidence that voter fraud has\nEver ever occurred can you or I help people with a\nA little bits of evidence about some recent voter fraud that really made a difference\nWell absolutely and I I think it's important to point out Michael 'cause you touched on this earlier about uh the idea of you know people have could should they have concerns with their vote\nCount a I think the real concern is that their vote will be I think invalidated the true weight of it won't count because of illegal votes being cast and what you hear from the left is it voter fraud is that you just mentioned incredibly rare or certainly not happening on the scale to swing elections\nBut that's because they defined voter fraud in the narrowest possible under inclusive terms or they defined it only as an intentional acts of impersonation\nBuying the legal voter are on behalf of illegal voter right but in fact I think most people would say well anything that makes my vote not count as much as it should\nThat voter fraud or in the reality is that happens all the time uh and you have to look no further than the tactics being employed to get illegal voters onto the voting rolls just in Texas this\nWeek there was a story about the Texas Democratic party sending out a voter registration forms with the boxes that yes I'm a citizen check\nTo non citizen voters uh there's blow in voter rolls all over the country there's actually two hundred and forty eight\nCounties in this country that have more registered voters than citizens of illegal voting age or the Supreme Court to that nearly three million people are registered to vote in more than one state and it GI where I work as part of the research for this book\nWe did a national study in which we found Twenty one hundred instances of double voting in the state of Florida alone enjoy sixteen and Michael you remember\nThat's nearly four times the margin of victory of a presidential election this century so clearly it's happening and it's happening in the scale of the largest as when you're lessons you just noted or the ... election prince sixteen how close that was a so so it's a very real problem and that's one of the reasons why but\nWe do you um can you point any specific elections\nWhere you do feel that evidence exist that the the result was tipped by fraudulent voting for instance I Know a lot of people look at the Al Franken or a Norm Coleman election\nBack in the in two thousand eight\nThat that's exactly right there was I think that the election it'd be unsettled by around three hundred vote and it wasn't until a couple of years later unfortunately with discovered more than a thousand votes were cast by I think spelling\nAnd people that shouldn't have been voting so that's a that's a very prominent example and by the way before Al Franken went on to become the sixtieth vote in the Senate\nSo anytime people ask what the true cost of voter fraud I Would say well look you're a rising insurance premiums because uh out forget especially if you came to the vote that locked in Obamacare\nAre in New Hampshire and twenty sixteen New Hampshire has a very weird policy about voting to have what's called the intent to reside law so and I write about this in the book that Democrats x-ray said New Hampshire bill Gardner even admit this is a massive problem he's actually a champion of\nTrying to eradicate voter fraud in New Hampshire that senator from New Hampshire Kelly ... she ended up losing by one thousand votes\nTwenty sixteen well they had six thousand people registered to vote on the same day in New Hampshire and they have these buses that come in from Massachusetts and neighboring states six\nThousand people voted but then didn't actually register a car or take the follow up steps to suggest their actual New Hampshire residents\nSo those are a couple of recent examples but um you know but but some of the other things that happened I think that document example you got mayor's races you got sheriff's racist sheriff rate\nIn Florida that uh it's basically been proven to that they've had felons that had voted illegally but because the election basically been certified or the suit the judge has ruled that well we have to give these felons due process though that's not enough evidence for invalidate though\nIt happened a nationally\nDon't change would would you say there's a certain amount of voter fraud in every state every election\nI I Would um because I think it really gets down to the below in the voter rolls I mean and this is something we experience I live in Florida and I've been having numerous interactions with the elections officials here and elsewhere because the the reality is the bias is\nTo let people vote right I mean no one wants to suppress illegal voter\nBut because of that it's created a system of vulnerabilities that I think are actively exploited by bad actors\nSo I mean that's the Texas Democrats mailing the the voter registration form is one example but you know you got groups like acorn ... and their whole job is to go out and Ralph's stop as many voters as possible regardless of the legality of those voters right you've got\nVoted I should I Know one ... one of the same way one of the things or one of the things that people seem to be interested in on the left as the idea that if you're a college student you can register both in your college and uh where where you live and then you vote twice\nThe national legal but that happens a lot doesn't it\nAbsolutely I mean there's nearly three million people registered to vote in more than one state in the country\nOr the Supreme Court sided views that are specific to that says twenty four million voter registration is this country are completely wrong so that's one an eight by the way that we know we've got massive problems and then the question is how easily are they exploited\nAnd show you have to Washington and we're going to face in just a moment with Eric Eric angers his new book fraud how the left plans to steal the next election is posted up at our website\nQuestion that we're going to ponder is what do you do about it how can it be saying how can we be protected we'll get to that and more with Eric eggers whose new book is called fraud\nHow's the lesson plans to steal the next election will be right back on the ...\nVolt Michael ...

his\nPhenomenal fundraising haul the thirty two or thirty six million dollars in small thirty alienation yeah largely\nSo what I think is happening as he watches Cory Booker a fall out of the race rather quickly\nAnd and I in my view and all those with the war on a effectively\nDisqualified herself last week probably in terms of the public relations although I think he's going to run for president he's going to lose the race and the Senate and he will be running for president and will probably be a pretty strong a candidate given his I don't\nAgree with his views but I think he could be very charismatic and you could extend that magic to the country in the early primaries\nOkay there are two reasons I think you might be wrong I I watched a bay toe performing and that is a performance is sort of a performance art as they say\nWhen he was doing a town hall in or near El Paso which is where he's from and you know very friendly crowd and very friendly moderator Dana Bash from CNN [noise]\nAnd uh she she asked him very directly about running for president and he said no if he gets elected senator he'll serve all six years of senator now of course he can re but he said it's so definitively\nThat it leads me to believe that you\nKnow he he didn't rule out running ever but he can rules out\nPretty well running in two thousand and twenty said that if he loses the race is going to want to spend some more time with his family of course they all say that um [noise] and some of that it might even be true okay the the other reason that I think he wouldn't be so solid for the race\nWas he pushed\nOn the fact that he has said before the race even began that as a member of the house of representatives he thought there was enough evidence of obstruction collusion that he could vote to impeach Trump now and he was asked about that as a U.S senator and he didn't back away from it\nFor impeachment he he believes even before the smaller investigation is wrapped up even before it's reported anything\nAnd yes they've indicted some people and they've uncovered some stuff and I I I think the Mueller investigation needs to finish and maybe it'll take some time to finish it needs to finish but better or doesn't he agrees with a lot of those people on the far right the ... just forget about the investigation let's impeach him anyway\nAnd I don't think that's a popular position and I don't think it sets them up well for a future presidential run or anything of the times hey I appreciate your call\nUm [noise] I I'm a hack\nTo this and to David Leonhardt piece what if

Georgia you're on the Michael ...\nThank you for taking my call a ... a journalist or where we are there's more to that and we really it's a it's not our country not our battle anywhere else to talk about the uh the planned invasion\nYou are you calling the caravan of planned invasion\nYes sir\nWell it's a you know given the fact that we've had so far this year\nI think we've had about twenty times are of illegal entries into the country this year the illegal entries are way up because the economy is very hot right now people are getting across\nAnd ah this I'd only constitutes an invasion I think it is a challenge to our whole immigration system\nIs basically an attempt to raise the border and say that uh we have to let in anyone who wants to come in and most Americans don't believe that in the law doesn't say that so [noise] but when you say and and planned invasion what do you have in mind\n\nUh I think it's just a part of the the war or the battle between conservatives and left us that are trying to take down America\nAnd this is the latest strategy\n\nExcept if you look at those people and I've seen ... and of course they play a lot of very close compassionate a video showing these poor people who I think are hungry uh scared\nI'm hopeful ah\nThey they do not appear to be\nI'm hopeful\nAh they they do not appear to be actors or manipulated their just desperate people from\nPlaces in the world that are deeply deeply dysfunctional look I I think that President Trump is doing the right thing to basically make a stand and just say no we simply cannot just overs to anyone in this country that's not going to be our immigration policy\nBut I think he makes a very big mistake when he threatened to cut off foreign aid and I'll tell you why the best way to prevent other incidents like this and so this doesn't happen every week or every month\nIs not to cut off foreign aid to Honduras it's to coordinate more foreign aid to Honduras to take these people the seven thousand people I think that's how many they think there are right now\nAnd to bring them back home where you can work with them to try to make Honduras a more livable place because that's really going to be the only kind of it has a long term impact on let's go to Marco in Los Angeles Marco you're on the net that show\nI might go I'm like hey three things I was calling regarding that that the um the reporter that got killed I I feel that that's really not are right it lots of guys get killed all over the place we're not we're not up in arms about it\nFor sure it's a bad situation that happened but why are we getting involved country\nBecause we are and we are involved with the country I mean the the argument is we ah we have a lot of financial dealings with Saudi Arabia\nNow of Saudi Arabia is not a country we give foreign aid to their one of the richest countries in the world but it's a country that we sell a lot of arms to him as President Trump says we have a pending one dollar arms deal\nAnd if it doesn't go through with us if we cancel it for some reason they'll turn around and by the arms from\nA China or Russia and ...\nWhy does that have to do what is that the deal with this guy can\nWell ... what's left is trying to do and I think it's despicable frankly is to suggest that somehow um Mohammed bin Solomon the prince crown prince and Saudi Arabia got the idea that it was okay to kill reporters because there's always so critical of the press\nAnd I think he he obviously President Trump has never called on anyone to kill reporters\nAre and ... do I think it's unfortunate that President Trump made some reference and it was a joking reference to Greg Gianforte in one of the worst moments of his life\nLosing his temper and slam slamming doing a body slam on a reporter yeah he shouldn't be making jokes about that a let's uh go to Matt in Seattle Matt you're on the Michael met that show", "show_name": "Michael Medved Show", "year": "2018",
