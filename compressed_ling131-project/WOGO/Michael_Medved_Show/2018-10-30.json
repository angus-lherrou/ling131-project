I'm not saying is evil [laughter] I'm saying it's raise the state's speech and a ... is it appropriate for the president the United states evil\nOr is it appropriate to suggest that the only thing the U.S army is for is killing people now\nThe I'm\nAdam Serwer wrote a piece with a terrible headline and the headline tries to relate Pittsburgh to the caravan\nAnd it says Trump's caravan hysteria led to this meaning that the shooting at Pittsburgh and a Adam Serwer\nWas on a a TV and uh basically suggesting wealth ingesting basically that ah we may be looking at a potential mass slaughter really here's what he had to say\nHe said he said in the army to kill the enemy that's what the army does the army kills the enemy so when you send a thousand troops to the border to stop thousands of people who actually won't even be there for weeks when you're saying is these people are the enemy and he may need to kill them\nOkay there's nothing that President Trump said that approximate that I think the whole purpose of sending military resources Army National guard is this show of force in determination and one of the things that the administration very quietly has been talking about I think is actually\nPositive on this which is suggesting that okay if people come to the border and they present themselves for asylum and present applications even if they're coming in a big caravan those applications will be considered\nWhat will not be considered is people sneaking across the border and then presenting themselves for asylum that not that's inappropriate and that would involve a change in U.S policy\nOr let's go to your calls one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is a this Dan in Akron, Ohio\nI go how you doing today doing well well\nYou know I'm an old man and I remember when President Reagan called the Soviet Union and evil empire and the left one nuts now the Soviet Union was the real evil empire they killed hundreds of thousands and thousands of dollars into gulag and a\nCall ... ... evil it's ridiculous these people are childish they don't know history\nWell you're you're entirely correct and people do need to know history I mean and and the point is that uh I I think we can establish that murderous regimes genocidal regimes are\nEvil and by that context of course the old evil empire the Soviet Union deserved that title but to try to suggest that the Trump Administration is somehow equivalent\n... is just so first of all it's poisonous to our politics because it does encourage violence but this is coming from the left\nSo it isn't as frequently called out let's go to Frank in Newark New Jersey Frank you're on the Michael Mann that show\nYeah Hi my I was saying that I'm over the decades I was a Democrat a liberal now I'm like I was a Republican now I'm an independent but I've been involved in a\nLot of political thing you know feminism or things like that and\nAnd ... you know the normal American person whether they're white black they're under a lot of culture shock I call it a lot of stress in the nineties we add diversity visa and we've short corporate landscape change and when I was at Eighteen the illusion\nYou know the American was the minority a lotta times ... American lost their job and they ship and somebody\nAnd and and they had nothing to do with the synagogue shooting but I'm just saying a lot of people are angry people have to understand that there's two angry group share it's not just been minorities and the blacks I mean the women it's regular average person white what have you know this has been going on for far too long\nI look I agree with you I think there's too much anger in the United states so what are you saying should be done about it\nI don't think the founding fathers said beware of the factions you're very smart you know the constitution and he pout should not be practicing identity politics and and showing them and we're working with these groups everybody's supposed to be equal you don't get them positive rights because this is what starting all the problems\nWell the the point is you don't give people ... you get people's rights based upon their status as citizens of the United states not upon special status of a citizen of a certain ethnicity or certain heritage and I think you're entirely correct It's one of the reasons that one of the most toxic ideas\nWhich by the way it seems that the Democrats have largely ... dropped is this notion of reparations and I'm Glad that's gone away appreciate your call let's go to a Joe in Los Angeles Joe you're on the Michael Mann that show\nAnd Michael how are you I'm well oh go go ahead and\nAh I ...

a very emotional and personally painful time for me I think I exaggerate and I apologize for that but what the point I was trying have ... to make is that it's not a coincidence that\nAccording to the ... the number of anti Semitic attacks has jumped by nearly ... percent and the first year that Donald Trump like an office and it's no coincidence because\nEven though the main danger is homegrown right wing extremists many studies have pointed out this administration has methodically shifted resources away from monitoring people away from trying to control their people\nAnd keep them from committing violence but I Do apologize to that heated rhetoric over there is\nA okay she uh came back and apologize\nTo them with Jake Tapper after her original statement which we played on the

things to err on CNN and that's saying something\nJake Tapper showing his true colors by refusing to put a stop to this nonsense time to label the show not the lead with Jake Tapper but the mislead with fake tapper\nAnd then Jake responded to that by saying I immediately went to Mona Sharon and David Urban to rebut it and later in the show as we just played a Julia you off the apologized and took it back well she still apologizing she was on MSNBC\nWith Chris Matthews yesterday and a talking\nI don't know which side of the issue she's on now but again talking is the idea of nationalism

should or should say a ... when he lands and what should he avoids say\nWell I mean I think he should know gift condolences and talk about\nAh anti Semitism and what a terrible thing it is and I I mean those are the kinds of things that would help any politician saying and how he mourns along with us and how he feels the grief\nOr along with us and how you know he feels this solidarity with it

saying cash purchase for Jerry\nA memorial American and honor the departed you let me let me pick up something in in some of the little time we have left ... one of the things that struck me about your column you would reference\nThe portion of the ... the Jews everywhere around the world in Pittsburgh and in Seattle and in Tel Aviv and income undo every Jewish congregation was reading the same story of Abraham bargaining with God to try to save the citizens of Saddam\nAnd a very great rabbi the last generation whose name you know rabbi Moshe Feinstein asked a question about it\nAnd he asked the question why is ... why is Abraham are concerned about these evil people these citizens of Saddam y and Z bargaining and there'll be have\nTo try to save the whole city for the sake of a few righteous people\nAnd the answer that he gives he says look when it says love your neighbor as yourself it's easy to love people who share your values it's easy to love people who agree with you what's hard is finding loving your hard for people who are completely opposite of you and that was what Abraham was doing a\nI read something a members rabbi fact I'm not sure but he said only by acknowledging the humanity of the other two week knowledge it in ourselves and he said it right I mean I see it all up mankind it's very hard to love your neighbor especially if you're my neighbor and I'm just\nKidding [laughter] ah listen it what what what you had to contribute to all of this is is so profoundly important and\nAnd again and I hope that the rest of the country can actually benefit from Pittsburgh to example and to be stronger I I didn't know that the Steelers actually showed up at the funerals\nUh today and ... and again that's that's a beautiful thing and ah maybe maybe in
