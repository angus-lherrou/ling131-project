I represent my district as as it happens so what about ... and they said oh my congressman he's the exception and he's really a good guy\nIt said the normal way people feel and they talk about public schools are are medical care anything else\nIs that I'm the only one who's fortunate [laughter] in an island of dysfunction and the wealthy and his numbers in public\nAnd keep the house it may be in part because at the last minute people who are really mad at Donald Trump will say yeah but I Am really so mad at him that I Want to get rid of the guy that I've liked her met and shit or shaking his hand or help me out\nAnd that's why in general you'd never bet against incumbents so some of these Republican incumbents me in the end when because they've built up goodwill over the years\nSince the real problem as the forty empty seats right there were forty Republicans ... or more\nEmpty seats in decades and that's why I think the Democrats do have to be favored to take back the house because it an open seat a basically you're much more able to vote party strict party line\nSo I'm\nIn in terms of I Know that the Republicans have good chances of knocking on some democratic seats I Know there's a district in Minnesota where the Republicans actually now favored\nBy the cook Political Report to win a democratic seat um ... where do you think Republicans should place the emphasis in these last two weeks the campaign in order to try to hold on to the house\nWell I think that they have to emphasize three things one is you know even though there are problems in the world were peace\nAnd frankly we are more respected now than we were two years ago\nThat's number one to the economy is really good and that's not an accident or bronco Palmer back Obama's policies having a delayed reaction if you want higher taxes and want to take a risk with picking the economy backwards vote for the Democrats the takeover Congress and the third is\nYou know uh there's some basic things that Democrats don't seem to care about one of the rule of law\nIs proven by Kavanaugh into why are they saying nothing about this caravan this mob whatever you want to call it the moving up from Mexico as the wall Street Journal reported today which is very pro immigration this is outrageous that we have these people encouraged to move to the United states that influence our election\nAnd at the same time the Democrats are completely silent but a fundamental issue of national sovereignty\nAnd apparently this is the work of a former president of Honduras and his henchmen\nOr what's the wall Street Journal is written about and the Daily Beast has written about that this really started uh as as basically a means of undermining the current center right president of Honduras and to hold the American people hostage to the vagaries of Honduran\nDirty tricks campaigning doesn't seem a good idea\nJon or or the Democrats need to step forward and say this is wrong and I hear crickets cricket\nWell exactly what they have nothing to say because again they would much prefer to a run on the the the the family separation issue which they tried to make a great deal of apparently sixty two percent of all democratic ads of each or health care isn't that a mistake don't you think\nWell let's put it in lots of eggs in one basket and\nYou know I think pre existing conditions are important I don't think they're that important to that many Americans\nOkay and the Republicans have been very emphatic that we are not going to endanger people with preexisting conditions at those guarantees will remain a we are speaking with John John John appreciate your insight and I hope I'm maybe you can come back again\nBefore we have the occasion for a a post election

I don't know a was Camelot Harris this rock star reception\nReally a\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six or let us go to Mike in Cleveland Mike you're on the advent show\nMichael I think that would ban Democratic Party combination that topic and I'll say what does this nation for the confederacy those guys\nThey were traitors in any other nation those kind of a mountain would have been I think it's outrageous that we're any monuments museums to beach oh\nOkay I I look as you know I'm at you and you've heard me before on this Mike I'm sympathetic to that point of view not that they should have been hang\nA but that uh\nTo have a monument in the middle of a city park well Nathan Bedford Forrest I think was just removed or is about to be removed from some momentum and I believe in Memphis, Tennessee and Nathan Bedford Forrest was not only a Confederate general he was the founder of the Ku Klux Klan\nAnd so okay but you see this mountainside is is different um and it it's different because this is like Mount Rushmore it was a work of art it was a public project\nAnd I think it's perfectly appropriate would signage around it reminding people of everything that you said\nThat ah these are people who fought against the United states\nAnd in context of this entire monument was put up\nWith a at a time when white supremacy and neo Confederate apologetic were held to be the case\nBut we're very different place in our country right now but to literally blast away the three acres the image of Jackson Lee Ann Davis covers three acres on the face of this mountain\nAnd the idea of just blasting it up it it seems to me that a number there in a number of black leaders in Atlanta\nWho do believe that that it's an needlessly polarizing and pointless to insist on blowing up a a beautiful city park let's go to John in Kansas City John you're on the Michael Mann that show hey\n[noise] you know my heart I'm well you're very good ... and I listen to respond to your ... okay maybe they've got their heritage\nNo no I never I never say that this was their heritage I never say that because the heritage of treason should be rejected\nAll right okay okay we're hearing the outfits you find that so\nBeautiful historical and all that I Would you feel that there was a Stone Mountain of Adolf Eichmann I'm Rick killer and all that they don't they lost the war to they were fighting for their country that's their character\nBut again and again I I I Would I Do not use the argument of heritage and that's not\nThe point the point is if there was if there is an art work a piece of art is carved into a mountain that can't be moved because you cannot move aid three acres culture that it took Thirty years to make you only blow it up\nOr\nIf there's something like that it's different from moving a statue and I again I Do not believe that they're at I think it's important to preserve for instance I don't think that ... should be blown up I think it's important that it be preserved date is part of the record of history\nAnd they didn't have any statues announcements but if they had them there that should be preserved as part of the historical record as well\nAnd given the fact that\nAh they've taken out some of the they used to have a plantation house\nAt a Stone Mountain I think they still have a place I was there recently they still have a place called Confederate house but Confederate house doesn't have anything inside it any more they just have T shirts say Stone Mountain\nAnd or should it have anything inside us of some people get Confederate souvenirs no of course not because you're right this is a dark chapter of American history it's not one to be celebrated\nBut that doesn't mean it seems to me following the Taliban example

surprise or the comes that wow I didn't see that one coming back in Nineteen eighty when Republicans ended up taking twelve seats in the U.S Senate yep twelve seats\nThere was a situation like that in the state of Washington a long time senator he had been elected for ever been there since the earth cooled name Warren Magnuson\nAnd boom on election day he loses to a guy name Slade Gorton who's a

about this race it Susan for Senate dot com that's pretty easy\nUh right now you just told me something that is\nIs remarkable ... even in the most recent polling that you have of likely voters because of this mobilization of Republicans that everybody is feeling all across the country this is getting to be a close race could be as close as four points\nThat's absolutely right Marie can't well as an Eighteen year income that she should be sitting well about fifty percent right now and we've got her about five points under fifty percent so um\nRight now and we've got her about five

January of next year so what Maria Cantwell has been doing we're not doing for these last sixteen years the last what twenty four years\nWell she's been in public office she's twenty five years right hander congressman before and Twenty years in federal office\nSo this is her six federal race or election I should say but um what what I think it's going to happen is that people around the country are you going to realize that this is not a deep blue state as people believe\nI was chairman for half a decade of the G O P A state party\nAnd we know by data and also by looking at our legislature were split halfway down the middle and so when that happens that's not an indication of a\nOf a deep blue state where a purple state and and and\nBy the way and this is one of the important things that if you actually when the Senate race\nOr that could turn out enough Republicans to flip both houses of the state legislature 'cause it's one vote in the Senate and what is it one one now yeah both and so ... would change one seed there and then makes a a world of difference I'm Sorry go ahead\nIs on it lately right if we have our voters vote all the way up and down the ballot or that is exactly what's going to happen and the other thing that people don't realize is there an awful lot of good Democrats who have become very disenchanted with their party there not socialists\nThey don't want this new vision that has been so articulated by the Seattle's city council\nA lot of your listeners around the country heard about that head tax that they passed\nAnd uh we were ridiculed across the country for it because they were going to fight homelessness by basically forcing employers to lay people off because they couldn't afford to pay this hadn't tax to the city and that's the kind of crazy ridiculous taxation that people in this state are fed up with\nAnd and your opponent is on record of wanting higher tax rates\nAbsolutely and she voted against the tax cuts in jobs bill she said she would rescinded\nA there is like all these big government Democrats there is not attacks they don't love it's another way to get people's money\nAnd the people in this country are seeing a new way

is a an incredibly bizarre it\nSeems to me the the overreaction stunned reaction to a President Trump using the word nationalist look I I Will always a acknowledge there's a possibility that President Trump wasn't planning anything he didn't wasn't trying to do anything\nBut I think this comes down to a pretty well thought out and I think inappropriate and smart strategy for including the election campaign let me tell you why\nBecause right now he sees that the best chance for Republicans holding the house and gaining in the Senate both of which are goals\nIs to emphasize how far out of touch the Democrats have become that's why I think the Kavanaugh hearings were so important was the Kavanaugh\nHearing showed was that even for people who might have some doubts about President Trump and some of his character and his personality and this and that\nWhat you saw from the Democrats was just so infinitely worse and more hostile and more out of touch and showed such contempt for basic American Standards of of decency and due process and everything else I think that a a great core of people on the Republican side\nSaid not that no and we have to come together and fight it and that's why this\nRhetoric about jobs not moms and that's also why the rhetoric about nationalism it seems to me I don't think there are many conservatives who are troubled by the idea of being a nationalist and let me explain to there's a new book about nationalism by an Israeli writer named John zoning\nAnd it's it's worth considering because one of the points he makes is that nationalism goes pretty directly\nWith the idea of democracy because if you're talking about a nation state is your real tribe than the ideas and that's been very much the way it is in America is\nWhat patriotism means is that I find myself as an American\nAnd going back to Theodore Roosevelt again in the new nationalism the whole idea was if you are an immigrant you drop the idea of carrying the flag of your former country you carry the American flag and your nationalism your tribal affiliation which you care about what will you and give your heart to\nIs our nation NATO race not an ethnicity and the fact that that there are so many people out there and the commentary and and so many Democrats who don't get that who are offended by the term nationalism\nI honestly don't think that's helping the Democratic side I think if anything it helps\nOn the conservative and Republican side by the way if you're one of those people just offended by the word nationalism\nGive me a call and tell me why\nOne eight
