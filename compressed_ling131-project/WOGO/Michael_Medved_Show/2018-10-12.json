desk\nAnd there is one book in particular that it just is a must read at this moment\nBecause it is so relevant to people who are concerned about\nThe prospect of a new democratic move for impeachment impeachment Brett Kavanaugh impeachment of President Trump\nOr if you're concerned about what's happening with the Mueller investigation or if you're concerned about\nThe Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation there is extremely relevant material on all of that in contempt\nIt is subtitled a memoir of the Clinton investigation the author is Ken Starr and a judge star I've I've got to tell you this book is so reasonable it is so relevant and some of the revelations are\nMost sensational unsatisfying and\nThings are most as sensational unsatisfying and I the the book is posted at our website at Michael midday dot com in writing it and then the response to the book which has been overwhelming since it's come out what surprised you most\nOf what surprised me very positive way is that uh the Clinton a spin machine has remained silent and I say I say and and I don't mean that to be unkind but to the of the Clinton\nSpin cycle is Howard Kurtz or that of the Washington Post style but\nUh was extraordinarily busy and energetic and somewhat say highly effective\nAt a uh taking a a issue with what seems to me to be indisputable and that is the facts and so I'm very pleased about that the other thing Michael I Would say is that there's so many eerie echoes from the past that we are hearing today and you mentioned impeachment\nThat's very high on the list because as you though of the impeachment was extraordinarily controversial in the nineties and yet some of those crying for impeachment now with some of the most of the center for his voice is saying how dare you are\nOn the book is called contempt a memoir of the Clinton investigation or Hillary Clinton doesn't come off are so very well in your book\n[noise] yes and uh you know turn the other cheek and uh and kindness to to

that led to the impeachment of President Clinton he has now written a book about the whole experience\nAnd it's a page Turner it even though you know how it turns out\nOr it didn't turn out so well for the good guys it seems to me but there it is the book is called contempt a memoir of the Clinton investigation\nAnd before we get back to the Clintons Ken Starr I Know that um we all know that Brett Kavanaugh before he was judge Kavanaugh before he is justice Kavanaugh\nWorked for you and let's make some news here or did you have a problem did you always feel that when Brett Kavanaugh came into a room you had to lock up the booze and put the women in another room and to protect them from this morning I'm a horrible person\nThis was a terrible a smear attack uh uh uh uh it was very reminiscent of the attacks on up work on\nA on a Clarence Thomas a and regardless of liquor didn't hear the other motives are the truthfulness of darker forward but I Do know\nYeah the other motives are the truthfulness of Dr forward\nBut I Do know Brett Kavanaugh on I've known him since he was a very young lawyer and we work side by side literally for years\nAnd uh the outpouring of support for breath\nFor justice cab no by those who not only know how to work with him who went to school with him and said this is just not Brett Kavanaugh and he emphatically and forcefully and emotionally denied the allegations\nAnd so knowing bred to be a person of a just an impeachable integrity and honesty\nI Believe him so it was very painful for those of us who know\nThe judges lead such an exemplary a career professionally and a wonderful life personally with his two beautiful children with the nation for a period of time had a new coach K right the girls' coach and uh it's just it's it\nHe called that a a a and a national disgrace I call it a national tragedy\nOr both guys called contempt it is a subtitled a memoir of the Clinton investigation\nI you um you you look back\nOn a this situation not without some changes of regret ... of the things that you might have done differently or that you look back on now\nOr as perhaps they should've been emphasized differently steered differently what stands out most\n[noise] as I describe a Michael I win against the advice of my advisors a scene out of the scriptures re a bomb or ignoring the advice of his wise elders and listening to\nThe voices of his young rabble browsers and thereby dividing Israel [noise] um I fail to listen to the advice of folks who said do not sit down with this particular journalist who I knew I had known him for ten years his name is Steven Brill\nYeah he's a farmer and as an eight or nine I Know Steve and for many years go ahead\nAnd my goodness well I have a ... ended up being a unscrupulous a character who totally distorted everything I had to say in the interview that's my biggest thing you might say ... well it ushered in an investigation authorized but as she should have\nOf the chief judge of the United states just recorded a district of Columbia and whether\nWe were violating very fundamental rules violating the criminal laws with respect to a grand jury secrecy we came through it with flying colors that being the investigation but it was so it was such a self inflicted wound and then more broadly what I've said frequently is that\nI Wish that Janet Reno who did the right thing and saying the information that we have\nThat the ... the United states is in the process of encouraging people to live is about to commit perjury and so forth in the ... civil rights sexual harassment case has to be investigated\nMichael I Wish he had had a ready reserve independent counsel or a special prosecutor who she could have just said you Mary Roach John do you take over the investigation\nKen wants to go to Pepperdine he's been trying to get the ... and the\nCity or in law school yeah go ahead\nYeah yeah and this to be the end of the law school there and this is just I'm going to take more time energy and so forth although I Will say this we were optimistic a that perhaps the uh ... what became the Lewinsky phase the investigation will be over very promptly\nBecause we were going to be giving Monica\nOpportunity simply to cooperate with the investigation and to receive complete immunity as as a witness to get out of harm's way but\nOf course famously infamously as I describe the hallway scene at the Ritz Carlton hotel on that fateful\nDay in the evening or in northern Virginia and the Pentagon city uh she said using very foul language to her mother who was encouraging her Monica to\nCooperate with the investigation and tech herself out of harm's way\nThat she was not going to bring down this and she is very strong language ... uh and then she said that course for five months and\nThe president for his part insists that of course that he\nHad told the truth is a perjury is a deposition and the Paula Jones case so the combination of the ... city of Bill Clinton under oath and the stubborn refusal of Monica for five months to cooperate\nWith the investigation just hurt us and the nation through this very hellish purgatory old process\nSpeaking of a hellish in purgatory all process\nI'm ... I I'm I'm sure you've encountered a the currents national counsel Robert Mueller he's quiet right now for a while because it's just a few weeks before an upcoming election and I guess the tradition\nFor somebody in that position as you don't break any news right before an election I Would you have some national advice for a special counsel Robert Mueller about how to handle the conclusion and his investigation based on your experience that you described in contempt\nYes I Would say that the regulations that are which she was appointed\nBy a Rod Rosenstein point the way to a very happy resolution and once he comes to let them inclusion and I think he has on me the wrong and I don't know but I think he has concluded that there was no collusion\nBetween the Trump campaign and Russian interests that that's why he was appointed obviously there's the Paul Manafort mount or the Rick Gates matter the indictments of the Russian individuals and organizations which really do touch on the reason that he was appointed\nBring this to an orderly conclusion and a professional way as quickly as possible\nAnd then happily and this is a huge improvement and like all over the independent counsel statute of under which I was appointed and that is the regulations in which a model was appointed to not speak of impeachment there\nWas a powerful dynamic in the independent counsel law that Congress passed in Nineteen Seventy eight to nudge\nThe process toward impeachment\nThat's now where we're going God willing and uh and you'll understand why that's so important when you read content a memoir of Clinton investigation Ken Starr has been a public servant all his life and I admire him Brinkley the book is also admirable we'll be right back\nBeen in bike lanes was my early twenties now I'm fifty one in my early twenties I worked for the state prison I got injured and I was off work for about a year on mental trained engineer a basically sit all day long my wife making me take relief factor [noise]\nLiterally changed my life uh don't feel I Am twenty again but my back and goes\nOkay wives can change your life for the better certainly happened to me uh they can do it by recommending by forcing you to take relief factor you shouldn't have to be forced\nInto inexpensive Nineteen Ninety five set you up for three weeks in three weeks is\nVery very likely to make a real difference most people feel a difference within five or six days it's a dietary supplement no side effects no drugs at all go to release factor dot com that is released factor dot com if you're a Democrat if you're pouring money into this campaign tell me why coming up\n\nOne eight hundred signed by five seven genes ...

by Josh Singer who is the same screen writer\nWho did a spotlight which won the Oscar a couple of years ago and he also did the screenplay for the post and here he puts everything in order telling the

space program\nThis is an utterly remarkable film and it's a riveting I Know a good deal about the space program and I will tell you I'm I have a real interest in this because part of what Neil Armstrong was involved with before the Apollo program was the Gemini program\nMy late father was the experimental director for the Gemini program and I kind of grew up hearing stories about Neil Armstrong\nAnd by the way all the stories that I heard from my late father about Neil Armstrong comport with what you see on screen which is that a Ryan Gosling is outstanding a performing one of those classic American heroes are kind of role that could have been performed by Henry Fonda\nSomebody who was heroic\nBut understated an unassuming with a quiet and mysterious deaths and in the film\nThey emphasize that part of the reason for that attitude\nWas Neil Armstrong's life at least according to this film in the books that it's based on\nRelated to a family tragedy which is very dramatically portrayed on screen at the beginning of the film every one is remarkable in this movie in terms of performance as clear for eight of playing Neil Armstrong's Wife Jan\nA ... and she was a long suffering wife and she was somewhat skeptical of what he was doing she said she wanted to have a conventional life and instead here he is an astronaut risking his life constantly and that's one of the things that the film brings back\nA very dramatically I I live in Seattle is people know and we have a a museum of flight here and you can go there and you can see some of these old space capsules that they actually use from the sixties and you look at them and they're incredibly small\nAnd rickety in dangerous and you think they really want to get into that things of this giant rocket can rolling into space\nAnd yes people died in the space program and that's dramatized here two of the the scenes in which director Damien ... who previously did la la land with Ryan Gosling and before that did whiplash which also won an Oscar for Jk simmons well deserved\nIf he does such a superb job I mean truly superb job\nOf dramatizing the space flight itself the training and the Gemini flights from the dangerous flights that came before\nIt's um it's it's one of these films where you cannot take your eyes off the screen\nIt is so riveting and by the way Jason her which provides a film score that his heroic that his stirring that as captivating and very knowledgeable there's even a little bit of a nod to two thousand one space odyssey during one of the Gemini sequences where they're trying to hook up in space\nUp the only reservation one can possibly have from the film is that it's not the kind of a real wake while we've done it totally satisfying triumphant conclusion you expect it's not the right stuff\nAnd uh ... what it shows also an emphasizes is it the space program had its elements of controversy or use your voices on screen about people who are questioning the value and the amount of money that we're spending on putting a man on the moon when we're going through very difficult times\nIn American urban neighborhoods\nBut with all of that the caring about
