and I as I could open the door for for God Knows what moving forward but but little did we know that we would ever get to where we are now when you get media\nAnalyst like ABC's Matthew Dowd a publicly hoping against another another sexual predator\nOn the Supreme Court another that is a one sentence smear of both judge capital and Clarence Thomas or sexual predator are you kidding me when you get things that have happened just in these last few days\nThere was a column by a man named Eric Brady in USA Today\nIt essentially because you're you'll recall that a judge Kavanaugh had said look as a result of all this out of I don't know if I can coach girls basketball anymore and Eric Brady asked this question well should you should you in a cast doubt on whether that was a good idea\nBringing forward this\nCharge this and then slashed charge and elevating it into a case the judge Kavanaugh should not be able to to be allowed on a court with with a girls' basketball team\nThat is is eggs or criminal behavior now USA Today are trying to cover for itself at the collar back edited and in sort of made it made it look like an objective examination asking the question should judge Kavanaugh will be able to coach goes back to ...\nNo no no no no no no no no no no no no excuse no excuse\nThere is no excuse for cartoonist named Chris rich who works for something called the Illinois times\nYou may have heard about one cartoon of his I'm going to tell you about another one one shows judge Kavanaugh's daughter but up in the corner and says judge Kavanaugh's daughter has another prayer\nAnd I was ... daughter but up in the corner and says judge Kavanaugh's daughter has another prayer and little cartoon balloons says lord please forgive my alcoholic out of control dad for sexually assaulting judge for\nVery good friend of mine Rod Dreher who wrote a column in American conservative saying how can a man do this to another man's daughter how ... what wicked and dark hearts these people must have\nAll this this Christian Brett guy he's a piece of work that we as a piece of something a sound rather a cartoon of is I put this all up on Twitter in the last couple of days\nIs the revised Brett Kavanaugh calendar from a Nineteen eighty two would you like to hear a couple of centuries gets a little PG Thirteen\nOr one day here we go a one day read Bible didn't drink twenty five beers done dropped my pants at school so it just shows some chicks my you know what held some stupid girl down and groped her covered her mouth with my hand watched a gang rape very cool\nRipe ripe life is awesome watched another gang rape Bible study beer rape drugs made up fake Keller rate drank passed out dream big\nV\nBrett Kavanaugh revised calendar from the mind such as it is of cartoonist Chris bread some I'm just pardon me here for a second but thanks Jeff Flake for subjecting judge Kavanaugh's family to another week of this\nBut worried about Jeff Flake or he makes me crazy but it's my job to sort of put a pin in the ways in which Jeff Flake has made me crazy and I'm Glad I Am but he'll soon be gone because it's it's like complaining about the weather\nBut he he he is he is what he is in\nArizona voted for him and you know McCain too so I'd love everybody but this this this phony mode and this elevator\nI must say there's very delicately at very strongly at the same time and I think you'll know what I mean\nIf anyone steps up into an elevator anywhere else to to bully and badge or an elected official to weaponize their story of victimization well first of all as soon as they share their story of victimization every decent human being should listen\nAnd empathize and the foreign person respect of is at the end and deference to that is due to anybody who's been a victim of a terrible thing okay that goes without saying but the but\nOne of these young lady said you with your boat you're about to put somebody who was sexually assaulted a woman you're about to put that personal Supreme Court hears here's what Jeff Flake needed to do pardon me for channeling Jeff Flake for just a minute because God Knows somebody has to do in order to achieve some type of clarity\nIs Jeff Flake job and I and and by the way I'm not trying to turn them into Ted Cruz her turn him and to me this is what a responsible\nJeff Flake ought to have done at that occasion\nMa'am I I Am so sorry for anything that happened to you and I honor your experience and I'm hoping to your experience and you have every prayer and every good wish for healing and em em but that's all I have to say about your experience your victimization I have exactly the the proper deference to anybody should have for that\nHowever when you identify judge Kavanaugh as someone who sexually assaulted someone that is simply not been born out in the fact it may in some investigation may play up next week but it hasn't been yet my decision my vote needs to be based on what the evidence shows\nAnd what testimony reveals and not based on anything anybody tells me no matter how passionate they may be about something that might have happened unrelated in their lives\nNow please get out of the elevator I gotta go that's how it on but it didn't since now we have this week of hell but wait a minute on that wait a minute on that\nWhat is this week going to do we're together today and tomorrow I'm enormously grateful to once again the talk show gods were smiling a Michael's back Wednesday Thursday Friday of course and then moving on a ... for ...
