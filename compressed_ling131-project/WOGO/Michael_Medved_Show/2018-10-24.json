five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number there's a statement from a Jeff Zucker who's president of CNN\nAnd he says this statement there is a total and complete lack of understanding of the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media the president and especially the White House press secretary should understand their words matter that's far they've shown no comprehension of that\nOkay then that again is an attempt\nBefore anything knows anything anybody knows anything about the shooter to basically blame the White House and blame White House rhetoric for these attacks now if these attacks were inspired by President Trump's hatred of the media\nWouldn't you expect\nMedia companies to have been prominently targeted you'll say well CNN was well known wasn't that package that was delivered a CNN had the name on it of John Brennan the former CIA director has been very very critical of President Trump remembered President Trump removed his security clearance\nAnd a yes or that John Brennan's name spelled wrong but it was addressed John Brennan care of CNN\nIt or to the very best of my knowledge\nThere is no report yet of any other media company and the San Diego union an evening Tribune it apparently it was just the same building they were in the thing was in the mail room it was addressed that they think though that has not been confirmed yet either to senator Kamala Harris\nWho has an office in the same building of this ... it seems to me um the the idea it's similar to the stupidity of suggesting that somehow by\nPresident Trump's intent Britain foolish criticism of the media and I think it is foolish and stupid and wrong\nBut equating that with the ... murder\nAnd really you you want to show me that okay I'd I'd love to hear from a prince Mohammed bin ... oh yeah President Trump told me it was okay I heard him attacking the lying stinking disgusting fake news media and I thought okay I'll do something no of course he didn't think I didn't\nAt first of all we don't even know Solomon a modern been Solomon was actually directly responsible he probably was\nBut the idea that he was somehow encouraged by Trump's ongoing fused with MSNBC and CNN\nIs ridiculous I Do hope\nThat when we emerged on the other end of election day whatever happens and I hope urgently in earnestly that the Republicans prevail\nBut that we can move on from this this stupid back and forth on both sides it doesn't do the country any good to have voices in the media just perpetually blaming the president for everything and attacking him for everything\nWith a visceral hatred that I Do believe is unique it goes beyond anything that they applied to George W. Bush a Ronald Reagan or anyone else\nLet's um or go to um Jonathan Berman who\nIs it American news anchor and currently the co anchor CNN Uday with Allison come right on CNN he's a regular uh released presenter of Anderson Cooper three sixty this is what he had to say\nIt could have been sent to John Berman\nMeant to be because they said John Brennan on the packages had Brennan B.

little bit there's an interesting piece in the Los Angeles times\nAbout the asylum process and about the level of illegal immigration and it uh it it mentions that illegal immigration right now is at a forty year low the only years where illegal immigration has been even lower than it is right now\nWe're the last three years including last year the Obama administration has been brought way way down and brought down by three quarters way greatly reduced part of it a bad economy part of it much better border security which began by the way under President Bush\nIn any event here's the interesting thing\nWhen uh people come here\nIn terms of ah applying for asylum\nBetween the years two thousand twelve and two thousand Seventeen in other words including the Trump Administration\nImmigration judges turned back Seventy five percent of the people who came here from Guatemala seeking asylum\nSo she may say it's America's strength to be tolerant accepting but right now including under President Obama and yes under President Trump most people are coming looking for asylum are turned back\nAnd that it seems to me is reasonable and says the Trump Administration has made the process even more difficult by ordering immigration judges to stop granting asylum to virtually all those claiming to be victims of domestic violence\nA move that could block tens of thousands of people from gaining permanent entry into the U.S and in other words if you're running away from an abusive husband\nYou probably don't have to run away two thousand miles to get to the

an FBI agent who was involved in trying to expose corruption in the city of Tallahassee where he was mayor\nIn the city of Tallahassee where he was mayor\nAnd it turns out that there was an undercover agent who was posing as a land developer\nWho is doing all kinds of illicit things like taking marriage Gillum on vacations to Costa Rica and New York\nWhich he arranged the FBI undercover agent posing as land developer was going to be working there and getting them tickets to Hamilton now you may say a big deal to take us away the Hamilton digs in like a thousand dollars each\nAnd he had been nine when he was speaking to the FBI later a mayor Gillum and this is now this is not even contested he had lied to the FBI and he said no I paid for my own tickets\nAnd uh they now have email

are just wrong about I mean one of the big democratic issues that they're trying to raise across the country and the last Thirteen Days the election\nIs that President Trump is they hate filled beget

[noise]\nOn the Michael ... show a when is it that you try to a fix blame for the lack of civility answer that is when there is any kind of attack\nOn on a left wing targets then of course it's instantly I blamed on right winger is even when there is no evidence and all that there is a political motivation one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nBut when there's a left wing\nPresumed left wing attack on a right wing target even one was a resulting in a shot in the chest and the guy seriously hospitalized and broken glass and real damage which thank God there hasn't been here\nThen of course nobody asks will uh somehow how did uh\nSome of the harsh rhetoric by Eric Holder or by Hillary Clinton or by anyone else on the left contribute\nTo it no one asked that and that is a double standard when I'm Talking about is just very quickly this um attacks that occurred uh three days ago where a guy named George ... who's thirty eight years old\nAttacked of Fox Fox five television now again I understand Fox five is not the same as Fox News but in the eyes of the general public you see Fox Fox and if you're on the left you hate it in any in any case through to pains of glassy came into the lobby and then he was shot\nBy a security guard anybody say well he must have been a left wing or it turns out he wasn't a left wing or he was in out of his head or he was a crazy homeless person and somebody who had been charged with murder in two thousand two but was released\nHe was involuntarily committed in two thousand Fifteen he placed a death threats against D.C police and the D.C offices\nRoom in human resources and against a federal judge who had dismissed one of his many law suits you had more than twenty four lawsuits in recent years claiming that he had been controlled by a microchip\nPlant in his head uh so I don't know left wing or right winger know crazy person is it entirely possible\nThat these are bombs that were sent out to people could be such a person or is it just reasonable in any phase of the imagination\nTo jump to the conclusion that because there are a lot of left wing targets here people like Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Eric Holder\nLeft wing targets here people like Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Eric Holder and President Obama and\nPresident of a and a President Clinton and Secretary Clinton because those are targets apparently this attempt it must be someone who was inspired by President Trump and President Trump is to blame that seems to me outrageous and unfair you want to hear an example of it or Andrew\nCuomo the governor\nOf New York right after he gave a decent statement praising the police praise the bombs then this\nThe heated rhetoric that toxic environment is part of this yes we are being on a full investigation whatever a suggestion of the pattern is that they are politically or related\nAnd I think that's a caution to all political officials elected officials candidates and Americans we can have political differences we've always had political differences that's what made America America\nBut let's have our political differences with civility a and let's avoid the hostility and the rhetoric and the rancor and the anger\nBecause we are out of boiling point\nOkay I mean there are a lot of Americans who are the boiling point and I agree with the general settle sentiment that it's better to have reasons conversation but for goodness sake what a hypocrite\nAnd why now\nAnd why is it that there was rice and which is deadly that was delivered to President Trump at the beginning of this month the same rights and was also delivered a General Mattis the secretary of defense\nOr did that get the same kind of attention here\nThere seems to be just as much damage that was done by that attack as this one namely none\nOr is there media manipulation\nGoing on with the coverage of this event\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six it seems to me that there is a ... the New York times and their initial coverage of the attack on this Fox News station that was an attack with damaged property at least in one guy with a bullet in his chest or\nThey said the shooting at the station comes almost four months this is in the New York times the day after the shooting at the station comes almost four months after a man's formed a newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland and opened fire with a shotgun the chilling attack killed five people and left the world of journalism really\nPresident Trump condemned the newsroom shooting and offered his condolences but he has often portrayed the news media is the enemy that people\nAfter the shooting the publisher of the New York times AJ shows burgers at in a statement that he told the president in private meetings that quote his language was not just divisive but increasingly dangerous in other words what did they have to do with the newsroom shooting in Annapolis\nOr the attack on Fox News which is where this appeared in the paper\nOr this\nDon't know yet\nIt'll be interesting to find out we do know be on any shadow of a doubt\nThat wins Steve ... was severely wounded and there was an attempt and and so we're Washington officers severely wounded designed to protect the congressman and other attempts to kill other Republican congressman\nThat was politically motivated the guy was clear about it but\nListen to what Nancy Pelosi said at the time when a and this is more than a year ago this is June of two thousand Seventeen right after ... was shot she asked about uh some Republicans would condemn some of the hospital democratic rhetoric and here's what she said\nWe have heard comments from those of us in sync\nLooting Congress about Israel rhetoric from the left being in some ways [laughter]\nWell I think that your question is an excellent one and I think that the comments made by maverick public ... colleagues are outrageous than eat the dignity of the job that they hold an eighth of dignity and respect that we would like Congress to command\nHow dare they say such a thing how dare they so this sick individual that's something that the ball\nAnd it was horrible what he did hateful but for them to all the sudden the sanctimonious and see if they don't never seen such a thing before and I don't even want to go into the president of the United states but in terms of some of the language that he has you so again I let's go there another day but since you asked\nHow could they possibly say such as\nFar as the way they can have such a thing the way they could say such a thing is big cause that shooter had told other people that he had a grudge against Republicans he had been just active in the Bernie Sanders' campaign for president\nHe was deeply politically active and apparently mumbled to his wife all the time when he saw stuff on TV we know the guy was politically motivated\nSo the only kind of political motivation that can be condemned is if it is from the right well there are other people who say no this couldn't have been from the right this is probably a leftist set up can I say\nWe don't know when will we find out we'll get to that with your calls coming up it's
