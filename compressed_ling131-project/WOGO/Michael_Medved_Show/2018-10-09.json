Neal panic or I don't know him personally but it says that he is the editor in chief of book in film globe and the author most recently of not coming soon to a theater near you\nSaw it was one of those people in there of course many many of them who tries to make a living putting words together and he says now in this piece that after the two thousand Seventeen World Series where he was living out in a desire to see a Dodgers game\nHe uh looked in the mirror and realized she was wasting his life\nAnd he says I've been sober now for eleven months\nI Do the same things with my time that I did

turkey says I had a couple of which he nights and that was it but it's easier to stay off the stuff because I don't live in a state where it's legal\nI can get we'd but it requires a few steps addicts in legal states aren't so fortunate now all of a sudden these things for addicts obviously it's tougher if you live in a legal state 'cause it's all around you is advertised\nA few weeks after I sober up I took a business trip to California in my hotel room was less than a mile away from three recreational we dispensaries\nI paste around and got into the tub with some twelve step literature finally

well I wanted to call and say that I Am a former addict Merrill enough I'm Still struggling with it um about sixty days um give or take a couple of relapses um you know\nIt's very true that when it became recreational and or California or even went to a medical but all the stories we're following around\nIt became so much harder to quit because every corner you look you find it and everybody talks about it that you know if it's a good thing and it's helpful but it's really not because that growers\nKeep making it stronger and there's really no regulation out there to stop them from making it stronger and no regulations on what type of pesticides they use on the actual marijuana but keep them fresh for longer so they can sell them at higher hard so whenever I Would go into one of the marijuana shop\nEverything was about making it stronger not about recreation or having a good time or medical it was only about Frank and to the point that they tried to convince you to go by you know a cannabis cup winter like how is their reward\nShow a rope award show for some you know for a drug\nWe just able or selling it and there may getting rich on it he hears the basic point\nA band ...

they're very important\nAnd justice Douglas had so many ethical problems and just named one of them\nHe actually because he had so many alimony payments he had three ex wives\nAnd he he had to write little articles to help meet the expenses because he wasn't generating enough money and he wrote articles for a\nGuy who happened to be a pornographer who had a case before the courts and he later than pay the money back but he was caught with that and and that she also wrote articles than it had appeared in like a magazines that were some justices thought were pornography he didn't\nAnd just that plus the fact that he got involved with a Twenty one year olds who had been assigned to do a term paper and her college about justice Douglas he was married at the time he got involved with her it could be construed as sexual harassment and today's terms it didn't ruin his judgeship\nA and by the way there were attempts to impeach him and they were foolish and I oppose those attempts\nOr they were led by Gerald Ford who later became president of the United states as a point over here is that when people say oh because he said I'm some in temperate things when he was giving testimony
