this is really a long time very intense [noise]\nThat was presidents from this\nMorning in a actually it was a very reassuring a press availability and anyone who believes that there was some kind of secret and Trump desire to unseat Nikki Haley or whether she's planning to run against him she's not\nA as a matter of fact she made that extremely clear\nOr is she a presidential possibility for the future of of course he is is she just about the strongest Republican nominee one could think of for nine for two thousand twenty four\nOr for two thousand and twenty for that matter\nYeah I think she is now she was a terrific governor of South Carolina we enjoyed having her on the show or she is a natural when it comes to politics and she handled the un job with so much dignity\nA natural when it comes to politics and she handled the un job with so much dignity in class even when she had to work with Rex Tillerson\nWho wasn't an ideal partner for her as secretary of state the um\nUh she did a comment about this rumor that she's going to be challenging Trump for the nomination in two thousand twenty of course that's ridiculous you won't and here is Nikki Haley making at about as close as clear as she possibly could\n\nBe selfless enough to know when you step aside and allow someone else to do the job so they shouldn't have\nI Will tell you this on our own here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty I can tell me she went I'll be doing it for that point so I look forward to supporting the president\nIt's like if\nA President Trump said that's so good and uh of course it is and it's appropriate look this doesn't mean that a Nikki Haley didn't have some disagreements with people in the Trump Administration she did a but she managed to work\nWith the president and apparently the president deserves all credit according to all observers for allowing Nikki Haley to do or jump and it's very unusual for a un representative because look you're talking about such a corrupt organization\nBut she stood up for the country and did it with class and\nEloquence here's President Trump this morning and and again this was a\nPress availability where they both looked comfortable and happy and like they genuinely liked each other or they were sitting in bright yellow chairs in ah the oval office and er here is what President Trump said about the first\nInkling he had that Nikki Haley would be leaving her job\nShe told me probably six months ago she said you know\nMaybe at the end of the year the end of a two year period but the end of the year I Want to take a little time off or whether she's been a very successful you know governor of South Carolina [noise]\nFor years and she uh\nShe did this and this is possibly the more in tune\nWhat's going on in the world is very dangerous in a lot of things [noise]\nBut she's in his job and we've done a fantastic job together we saw a lot of problems or one of the process of solving problems so the gear just wanted to tell you that uh we will miss you will be speaking all the time but we will miss your number to listen to what I Want to thank you very much [noise]\nOkay and uh then Nikki Haley talked about some of\nHer sense of accomplishment she's completing her first\nTwo years ah her two years as UN ambassador and she's going to continue working there until January\nIt's unclear which is going to be doing after that there are some rumors we will get to those but here is an Nikki Haley talking about the achievements that she sees in American foreign policy in the last two years won't get\nHere with the United states on foreign policy now the United states\nKnow that if we say we're going to do something we fall for when the president for that whether it was with the chemical weapons in Syria\nWhether it was NATO sang in other countries have to pay their share and it whether it's the trade deal forgive and amazing they get the message and they all are really bad but then if you look at this thing here is that the last\nThree billion and the un fight\nMade a stronger we made it more\nThan we got an arms embargo which was a long time\nGreen North Korean sanctions\nWhich were the largest and generation down in a way that we can really work for\nAnd the Iran deal bringing attention to the world every country needs to understand you can't overlook the fall of the bad things are doing do you have to see them for the ... that they are [noise] um I think you look at the anti Israel bias and the\nStrength and courage that the president shown in moving the embassy and showing the rest of the world we are and things where we want to\n[noise] you know all those things have made a huge difference in the U.S but I can tell you that um [noise]\nAnd he was a strong in a way they should make America and very proud\nI and this is I'm about as a strong case as you can make and none none of what she said can you argue it it's all the truth and yes she was part of it\nBut all of this did happen under President Donald Trump\nAnd this is one of the reasons I suppose that on the CNN poll a despite the fact that there is been so much hysteria on the left about Kevin on and the the various horrors that are alleged to have been perpetrated by old white males led by Donald Trump\nThe President Trump actually saw his approval rating rising look as far as Nikki Haley is concerned\nThere's a lot of talk about her replacement\nAnd some of the talk that is most inflammatory is the idea that the president is going to appoint his daughter Yvonne ...\nWhy would that make any sense ... has traveled around the world\nAs she speaks very well she has dynamics you certainly would have the president's confidence\nI should also be a terrible choice because it would be very easy for the rest of the world to see a look uh America is becoming like a banana republic or like a dictatorship or clip talk or see where\nThis family that seems to be

think that's right in Nineteen fifty six Eisenhower nominated Brennan the data for Congress was a Democrat controlled and also on the Biden Rule job I was talking in the abstract there was no nominee no nominee was blocked and he said to\nNot have the nomination come up before the election but that it couldn't come up after the election and so a Democrat\nSay when they hear you're doing this as they say he's\nCreating new rules to essentially do what he wants to do and as you've written in your book the long game when you do that it actually hurts democracy\nYeah well that's not exactly a thought at all what happened John you're you're completely misconstrue and whatnot but what I gave you is the history of this I Know the history of this I've spent a lot of time on this throughout my
