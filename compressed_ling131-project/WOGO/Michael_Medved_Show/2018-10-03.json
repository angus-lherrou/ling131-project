what the hell do you have to lose Trump's war on civil rights\nAnd um we were speaking a before about basically okay ah\nOne you question polls that show the president's approval\nRating I'm a strengthening and I'm I'm In improving particularly among African American people are but if you were to\nAdvise the president about how he could bring the country together could improve his standing up and service to the black community will be the first thing you tell them\nWhere I think there are number one thing would be economic\nSo you know the president whenever there's a chart of racial insensitivity or just outright raised with regard to language or tweeting or his policies\nHe says hey what are you're talking about historic low black on employment but you know again\nYou doesn't say that in fact most of that\nBut you know again he doesn't say that in fact most of that took place under President Obama and then he doesn't mention that you have twice the level of unemployment among black if you have a white\nBut what I Would say to him as let's look at the policies\nBecause I I was saying earlier Michael the number one achievement of the civil rights movement to me is the growth of the black middle class in this country\nSo you want things that support continuing growth that black middle class you do not want to destroy\nPrograms intended to help black entrepreneur you don't want to destroy community development program or you don't want to go after people who are in middle management in terms of limiting their ability to get overtime pay you don't want to diminish efforts\nTo try to get people into better schools by saying oh we're opposed to all affirmative action even when we know that\nGosh there's a tremendous history of people being\nHeld out of the schools you you got you can't do that and then expect people say oh yeah we like Mr President because your program as offensively directed at damaging their ability to get a foothold\nOkay I didn't just to just hear about let me to finish the\nPlay I spoke to earlier about the growth of the black middle class the tremendous story\nBut they're still remain as not only twice the unemployment rate but a huge gap in terms of wealth between blacks and whites so even black moving up there still striving to achieve or to a crew that kind of wealth that exist in black and white America stocks bonds real estate savings in their own\nOkay but we eat you say rightly and and I think we can agree completely on this that there is a great on the whole story of black economic progress\nNot all of that is because of government programs in fact most of that and this is something the syringe terms of documented and I know you're aware of their work because you said it is a that Steven an avid CERN stream of of of shown that a large part\nOf the black economic progress occurred before the civil rights revolution help to set it up and then it continued in and gathered steam and gathered momentum because of the civil rights bills but you're not you're not trying to say that a black progress\nCan only continue with a a government programs on you\nKnow I I don't I I'm certainly not saying that in fact I think\nWhat Abigail and Steven third from my shoulders and it was a different era because then you had the black community you know much stronger in terms of everything from its own baseball leagues to its own newspaper's general who were segregated society but in terms of\nHow they could then black business prosper and grow a it was limited uh ... and curtailed I mean there was a it's a it was a segregated society and four and a government backing 'cause that segregation and obviously violence in places like ... where were you estimate that black\nEconomic growth and black or business\nBut what I Am saying is let's not be indifferent to the idea that if you look at the white middle class in this country are so much of it was built behind things like the GI Bill behind things like giving aid to mortgages so that people could buy homes in this country and don't forget\nAgain GI Bill job training educational opportunity after World War two and that was often done again a segregated basis\nSo I mean government has a role to play but that's not going to be it seems to me the be all and end all in terms of economic empowerment it's just that you don't punish people unfairly\nLooking and I I think I think every ... every all people of goodwill should certainly agree on that and speaking of people's good will you played a courageous role during the Clarence Thomas confirmation fight in in defense of Justice Thomas in and I know you were a supporter of his confirmation\nI'd do you think that history is repeating itself to some extent in terms of the\nThe kind of attacks that have been ... level the judge Kavanaugh\nWhere I think it's quite similar in terms of you know somebody leveling a charge against the nominee in the comic case it was a ... hill and\nYou know it was very slow to come out but then the committee the Senate Judiciary committee looked at it privately they dismissed that she wasn't put her name to it and then it got leaked and then he came out so it's very similar because look at professor for she sent a letter to a congressman ash too many makes its way to Dianne Feinstein\nI and then her name is Lee or she does the interview with the Washington Post ... ... ... doesn't seem similar to me is a level the charge I don't think that anybody that\nUh you're Clarence Thomas ... on a better\nYeah but as a one there's a difference in touch and the other direction the charges against Clarence Thomas had to do and he was head of the equal Employment Opportunity commission it was a government official and he was already yellow graduate the charges the core charges against Brett Kavanaugh\nHas to do with when he was Seventeen years old\nYeah but I think that the larger issue here is a matter of character for someone who's going to be on the highest court in the land\nAnd that's where I think he's open themselves to his critics and I wish you hadn't done it because they you know the whole presentation of himself as a urging the choir boy he's just a a a book is the was and then all of his friends like this guy was a big grin and he loved the party is own talent\nOkay wait a minute if you were a U.S senator and who knows you may be some day I don't really mind it before\n... Washington DC becomes a fifty first day was probably won't happen but in any event\nOr one um would you vote for ... confirmation no on at this point\nAnd the main reason would be because the way he presented himself as the hearing\nYeah I think especially last week when he went off even\nMaking all sorts of suggestions about Clinton conspiracy theory against him that Democrats are I'm thinking wait a minute you're ... you're trying to be a judge on the Supreme Court you're displaying a tremendous lack with an permanent\nOr don't you think given given the amount of money that was spent by George Soros and other than it's well known that it's now come out to the\nThose two women who corner Jeff Flake in the elevator or actually operatives of this open society project which is a Soros project or sometimes they can can you well I unfortunately I think we are\nEldest time of the book doesn't have anything to do is Brett Kavanaugh but of course\nAt the moment that isn't an issue that seems to touch almost everything the book is called what the hell do you have to lose its claws subtitle is Trump's more on civil rights Juan Williams of Fox News always appreciate talking to you and come back again soon we will be right back with your calls and comments coming up [noise]\nWithin five or six days and in fact people get the quick start which covers even for three whole weeks adjust Ninety five cents a day\nPeople who get that start eighty percent get more relief factor you have nothing to lose but your pain and the whole world again go to release factor dot com that is a relief factor dot com\nIt can make a world of difference for you and speaking of a world of difference uh there was a sort of a\nOut of work Hollywood star or largely out of work Hollywood star who attracted a lot of attention\nOn Saturday Night live and their dramatization of ah the hearings between having off and Christine Blasey Ford [noise] so what is a list of Milan oh do you get that attention on what is she saying now we'll get to that coming up on the ... that you [noise]\n\nDo you know that a recent politician month vast I've wondered at times what the Ten Commandments would've looked like give Moses in front of them through the U.S Congress that's a quote from Ronald Reagan of course he showed us through his life his faith and with his words the Judeo Christian values and principles still matter\nYou can help spread the legacy of Ronald Reagan and you can do it by getting a Reagan the email address right now if you have a Gmail AOL Yahoo or other big tech company email address you help them market their services with every email you send in return\nThey scan your emails and target you with unwanted advertising now thanks to our sponsor Reagan privacy dot com you can instead share the Reagan name with every email you stand and they won't scan your e mails they will leave you alone\nGetting email address you'll be proud to own at Reagan privacy dot com your very own personal private email address is available to you at Reagan privacy dot com go get your Reagan email address right now at Reagan privacy dot com\nWhen you need them your local volunteer fire department routinely answers the call whether it be a fire traffic accidents or a kind of stuck in the tree and there was always someone there for you however because of declined and memberships departments are becoming under staff and struggling\nHere's how you can help your neighbors and your community no matter what skills you may possessed you can make a difference in your local volunteer fire department desperately need your help and can you direct traffic install a smoke alarm helping fundraisers your community needs you\nYou don't have to fight fire to be a volunteer\nWill you make that difference will you parents for the call brought to you by the national volunteer fire fighter recruitment center a program service of the volunteer firefighter liable\nFor more information on how you can help and make a difference WWW envy F.

accurately some of the inconsistencies and Christine Blasey Ford's memory the fact that she remembered exactly the jihad one beer\nThat night but she couldn't remember which house it was er which year it was as you couldn't remember how she got home after this a legit incident happened which is a big thing that Rachel Mitchell emphasizes and her ... she was the prosecutor who asked questions of her and actually set them up pretty effectively when you read this memo\nIn any of that here was a Sarah Sanders ... pasta or about that to President Trump's comments\nSince there's something wrong with the frozen in the United states mugging somebody just shows you seem\nTo me that he was stating facts that Dr Ford herself a laid out in her testimony once again I every single word that judge Kavanaugh has said has been looked at exam and picked apart by most of you in this room but not no one is looking at\nAh whether or not the accusations made her corroborated whether or not there's evidence to support them\nUsually drift shows that the movies\nI think those Dr Ford in judge Kavanaugh a are victims of the hands of the Democrats I think it is absolutely\nDisgraceful what they've done and exploited this process they exploited Dr Ford there exploiting all of the women that have come out to make any type of accusations this isn't the process that should've been done and certainly everybody deserves to be hurt but that includes judge Kavanaugh's and that should be part of this process and the facts\nHave to be looked at and I think you have to look at the prosecutors memo those are where are you see all of those facts laid out and I think she makes a\nVery good job of any of those have any problems stating facts no John their answers but other than you probably do\nOkay um [laughter] ah\nActually this this could be the basis I imagine for a sitcom is a a female White House press secretary and they um really really annoying White House reporter who secretly

Michael ... stuff and uh that is not considered one of the credible stories\nThat they were called upon to investigate and it is unclear how much they've investigated a doctor for its background\nUm meanwhile [noise] there's this um\n... what you hear again and again and again everywhere\nIs that somehow Brett Kavanaugh should be disqualified because of the tone of his testimony that the one thing I I Want you to know is that virtually everyone in this montage\nAds everyone in this montage was opposed to him before his testimony they were opposed him before anyone and heard\nOf Christine Blasey Ford they aren't opposed to him because of his testimony they are opposed to him\nBecause of his allegations against him of a sexual assault they're opposed to him because he has a constitutional is conservative listen\nHe had exchanges with Senator Feinstein was that are required to share with others that are I felt when over line [noise] um he was clearly a full entrant aggressive angry\nMajor wonder about issued a building in my case yes\nTo me it was to have your that was not a suitable for a person who would be a judge on any court much less the Supreme Court\nWhen a judge capital with all partisan or left wing conspiracy beyond everything I think that was the disqualifying moment in Jordan show the demeanor of a judge at the hearing what\nHe was angry here was ranting he was ... I was astonished at his as his ran I mean he's a judge who just sitting circuit court judge you're supposed to be nonpartisan\nThat part of the race and that's the most fun judicial thing you can do it as soon as he were unfairly do you still supposed to behave as a judge his as an enemy is should be disqualifying me showed no judicial temperament\nBut we know one thing he does not had the temperament to be a judge\nWhile the Supreme Court I've never argued a part of the Supreme Court but I've written amicus brief and I I've sat in the Supreme\nCourt how can he can credibly on the court and claimed to be impartial with temperament like that\nThat came in the ... he came in full of heart as an ... pound and get Ken on the table I was like this is going up the native state Supreme Court justice he showed a lack of judicial\nTemperament that I wouldn't want my case to be heard by them I don't think anyone in America Republican or Democrat we'd want someone as biased and his uncontrolled in his range I can hold and it has ranged\nTemperament is just south city I think he's going to be resentful [laughter] I think that out of everything we can talk about the FBI investigation but even if they clear I think that he felt themselves into a hole\nThat he can't come out of and be a responsible journalists on the Supreme Court with angry and ran away\nBy the way let let me mention the name here the name as Justice Clarence Thomas Justice Clarence Thomas was also angry\nWhen he testified before the Senate Judiciary committee back in Nineteen Ninety One remember he accused them of a high tech\nLynching and he was angry and he was right to be angry and I think Brett Kavanaugh's right to be angry this is what Orrin Hatch wrote today it's a\nTerrific piece he says we're starting to see arguments like the following even if judge Kavanaugh was innocent what he said of the hearing and how we said it is just qualifying this is rich says Senator Hatch\nThe hearing occurred in the first place only because of democratic do plus city\nThat occur only because Senate Democrats sat on ms Ford's allegations for six weeks rather than referring them to the committee investigators as they should have done immediately that occurred only because ms Ford's lawyer's\nRecommended them is for by Senate Democrats refused to tell their own client of our invitation to testify privately in California as she said she preferred\nThe judge cat Kavanaugh had the temerity to defend himself vigorously is now being counted as a strike against him\nWere told

O. G. O. [noise]\nAnd on the Michael ... shows so much discussion recently about the Supreme Court and the direction that it's going and what can be decided and what can be decided\nAnd not all are bound to Brett Kavanaugh's personal life but look one of the things is Supreme Court has decided is that believe it or not we in America still have a right to read the Bible\nAnd even to talk about it and that right is being defended and champion even for students in public schools\nIt's a tomorrow October fourth is going to be bring the Bible to school day it's sponsored by focus on the family\nAnd it is the fifth year that they're doing this last year they had five hundred thousand students who participated across the country\nAnd this year they're hoping to have even more it's my pleasure to welcome gym daily who's head of focus on the family which is an international Christian communications ministry based in Colorado Springs Colorado I've had the great pleasure speaking for focus on many occasions\nA gym of first of all and people are hearing this and a lot of people think is it illegal to bring the Bible to school\nAnd Michael it's great to be with you absolutely not that's the thing in our culture today these religious liberties that we have had for over two hundred and forty years in this country they're simply not exercise every student has the right to bring a Bible to school if they wish to read it during lunchtime and free time\nNot during class time or it's disruptive\nBut you can do that and it's completely legal in fact we provide a one sheet illegal statement for teachers and administrators who invariably come to the student on this day bring your Bible to school and they'll say hey it's illegal for you to have that you're giving your Bible we've had teachers confiscate buy\nInto the student shows that once she legal brief and they\nSkate by an till the student shows that once she legal brief and they read it and go oh okay it looks like it is legal here's your Bible back it's almost like this a head in the sand kind of environment where we don't understand our religious celebrities in this country any more\nThan ... yeah and what's strange year as I'm sure a lot of the people on the left who would say oh it's terrible to bring a Bible to school would absolutely just in any child who wanted to bring a caller on\nThe school or or wanted to bring the communist manifesto whenever they want to bring\nRight absolutely and we get that question off and why why don't you champion that we're we're Christian ministry we champion bringing the Bible the Old Testament New Testament to schools for Christian kids to read on their own or with others and invariably or this is a lunch setting typically we're a little Thirteen fourteen year old girl or boy\nHas four or five friends around the table and they're reading the book of John or something from the Old Testament it's completely right I mean you think of Michael what's so frustrating to think of the impact of the Bible on western civilization\nIn here in this country people are wrongly think teachers school administrators wrongly saying hey what are you doing with that that's illegal here that sounds like something from the old Soviet Union\nNot know it does entirely and see what what I ah I see from the materials that you prepared for this you\nAre emphasizing for kids they shouldn't be brandishing the bibles in front of people and saying unless you read this book with me you're going to go to hell a war I I hate you unless you come in and joined me in my face\nI you you're also emphasizing the kids who bring their bibles to school to try to bear witness you know winning and kind and a friendly way\nAbsolutely I mean one of the things I often ask friends who you\nKnow have difficulty believing in who Jesus was I say you know what what's he missing in his resume he was a person who exposed really espouse loved joy piece goodness kindness mercy and those are the value traits that we like to teach the kids to express to their friends and to the people at the school that they bring their Bible\nTo one of the great stories last year we had a girl who was a little shy little embarrassed to do this but she did it\nAnd to her surprise all twenty eight kids in her classroom at a public school ... bibles but they didn't even know each other we're Christians but the whole class was\nAnd she was astounded and that's the kind of thing we're hearing across the country that you know three or four or five or even the whole class will end up bringing their Bible to school and they're going wow we never knew\nAnd I think Michael part of the problem here in our culture today for the left in the progressive to talk about the um you know the harm of shaming which is good that's a good message they sure do a lot of shaming for people of faith\nTo the point where these kids are embarrassed or feel they can't bring their bibles to school or talk about God and that's not a good in that environment for us to be in today everybody should bring their ideas their thoughts their opinions and their faith into the public square\nAnd again it's only enrich a at the exchange of ideas which is supposed to be part of education I take a gym daily a focus of the family you would have no objection if some other kids on bringing the Bible to school day which is tomorrow\nOr if some kids wanted to bring in all up ... Christopher Hitchens' book God is not great or some other atheist quote classic he's an child one of the counter bring the Bible to school day was that kind of book you'd have no objection to that would you\nO G o lay tally openly urging awful\n\n[noise]\nYou say your radio news Senate Judiciary chairman Chuck Grassley said there was some indication that the FBI's report on its findings

I used to call Donald or the cap and of course I called Mr President I I'd say you know I don't agree with you on that but I think not there was a pretty good thing\nA ... show you you said that this isn't you know your your introduction was it looks like we haven't improve NAFTA and I I think that's a good way of putting it you know uh [noise] you know NAFTA needed to be updated it modernized I think the president was right about that I disagree with them that this was the worst trade deal ever in fact I think it was good for all three countries\nBut it'd be come out of date there were some abusive practices that were happening by the Mexicans in the can they do you have your your right Donald traumatic I talk about the\nBorder to three hundred percent you're an American dairy products\nOr he had a very funny line in this speech by the way the rose garden you said now those are those Canadians are going to buy or ice cream [laughter] you know which I think it was a good thing but I I watch this was a good thing for the whole continent it's a better deal for American companies\nAnd ultimately what this does I think the bigger story yet is that you know this president who's six months ago or a year ago\nBefore he was going to create some kind of global trade war\nYou know is an interesting Michael but now it's first you got that they'll build on with Mexico and now he's got the deal about what counts\nBeing Michael but now he first you got that they'll deal done with Mexico and\nNow he's got the deal about what that looks like he's going to guess you'll do with the Europeans are\nIndeed a national health South Korea\nReacting to South Korea and Japan and it's like these dominoes falling and the irony here is this quote protection as president and I was worried about this with Donald Trump that he would pursue protectionist policies\nOr you know at the end of the day we may end up ... freer trade that not that more trade protections policies ... with the exception of the steel terrorists which I still think was a mistake\nOkay a lot of people are saying that part of what President Trump is doing is trying to settle these less important trade dispute or the ones that are all to the low hanging fruit that he that he can settle a so that he has more leverage to get tough with China do you buy into that thinking\nTotally yeah I think that's exactly what he's doing and you know it was very interesting his speech that people get a chance to if you didn't see it live it was beautiful day by the way it and and the rose garden that was a Seventy five degrees and beautiful day Trump got up there he spoke for about an hour and a half he talked about when I talked about the trade deal\nHe has some ah you know back and forth with the press which was retrospect I'm just as an aside may say Michael that you know I've been to many press conferences over Thirty years um I I've never seen the kind of abusive treatments that the the meat you know these young punk kids they're twenty five or Thirty years old\nAnd the way they're so disrespectful of president I don't have a problem Michael or you know if someone from media asking the president of a tough question that's why we have to be asked the president of question but it's not the tough questions their manners and they just rip\nWith contempt and he started out that press conference by saying okay wait a first question was what Kevin I said look\nI'll take capital questions but we're here right now to talk of the\nYou know the trade deal so are there any questions about the trade deal and he said afterward I'm Talking about the trip you up and I'll take questions with Kevin next person resurrect what Kevin I'm not sure what about camera or you I was just outrageous and and uh\nAnd it just bothers me let's treat the price of the United states with respect and some dignity I mean he deserves it and I look I didn't always agree with with Brock Obama in fact I just read with most of the things he did but every time I saw him I was always sir and Mr ...\nAnd it just isn't happening there\nAnd I and I think most Americans do and I'll I'll tell you another thing I I Do not think it's going to work for the Democrats this huge article and honestly it's like reading more in peace it goes on and on all the New York times\nCan you hear on times that's yarn ten thousand words I mean it's a lot of words basically the theme is President Trump didn't make the money on his own he got all the money from daddy and secondly ah both Trump's both father and son cheated on their taxes why first of all why do you think they decided to spring this right now\nI don't know why they did it right now I was on CNN last night commenting on the show I I didn't I didn't make it through the ... march thirteenth drop thousand uh it was it ... I read a lot of it I didn't make it through the whole thing\nI had a couple impressions I made this point on CNN last night and I'm ... and by the way they really beat me up on it the first point I made was wait a minute this was like you know turning on the TV and seeing you know with a hundred times you know friends episode rerun you know that you've already seen twenty times\nHow many times with the New York times run the story I I really I worked on the campaign they must won three or four stories about Trump cheating on his taxes\nAnd you know then they ran one last year another running this one and there's not much different in this story than the one they've run multiple times so it's just like you know just by an old copy the newspaper because at the end of this movie before the second point I made us look there are alleging kept fraud tax there is a difference a\nMichael between tax avoidance which any good businessman them any good you know head of household will do you want to minimize the taxes you pay right I mean I don't know about you Michael I tried to pay the least amount of actually after you got the most amount\nThere was a shock tax avoidance and tax evasion and they are they are accusing Trump of tax fraud when a lot of these like I'm not an expert on tax policy but it looks like a lot of these things were just legal ways of of minimizing your tax burden\nAnd is there any American in the last fifty years has been hit by the Iraq War than Donald Trump\nOkay but here's the question why won't he release his tax information he he's been very resistant to them I guess about this article is it's an attempt to try to force him\nTo make some disclosures about uh his taxes and if if he doesn't that'll be a reason there are campaigning for Democrats the Democrats will force out the tax returns what do you think\nYeah once again you're all one hundred percent correct that's\nExactly what this is about and that's what you know the CNN uh Chris Cuomo asked me about last night as well why won't Trump\nA release of tax reforms I advise Trump among many other people during the campaign do not do not release your tax breaks because if you think this report which were thirteenth they they did Thirteen thousand words they don't even have\nYou know a lot of the tax documents there's a man who has you know warehouses full of ... tax document through all the businesses she's\nRunning through the ... and all but I mean I I just think it would be a Pandora's\nBox okay uh and and don't file your taxes in a Pandora's box Stephen
