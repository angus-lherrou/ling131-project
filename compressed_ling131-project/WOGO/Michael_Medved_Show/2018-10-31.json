transcends politics I think I Hope it does\nI actually said that to George Bush okay and she also talked about she had a nice conversation with Bob Dole but the point is when she says it doesn't matter about offending Trump\nFans and the heat Meg ... asks can you think of anything good Trump has done anything and that\nSays a very long pause and then she says I mean this is a man who's kind of not kind of he's just mean I worry about the children I worry about what is the image east projecting to them and then\nLater in the interview she thought of something he'd\nDone well and she said

day you're definitely right up there the cream of the crowd is\nMichael ... and on the Michael ... show uh it's I think sort of necessary to\nTalk about the campaign going forward and why I\nDo believe that the emphasis on birthright citizenship debating topic on both sides is unfortunate and I wish the president hadn't brought it up he brought it up in an interview with actually I was a few days before the campaign\nAnd the the reason I think it's a problem is not just because it's a problem in terms of constitutional interpretation\nBut the reason that the Brett Kavanaugh experience and the confirmation of justice Kavanaugh who's a credit to the Supreme Court and I think is one of the truly great achievements that President Trump has managers getting Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh on that Supreme Court\nThat United every Republican and every conservative and there really were no exceptions I\nDon't know of anyone who's still calls him\nAnd there really were no exceptions I I don't know of anyone who's still calls himself a Republican who opposed the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh I Know I Know Jennifer Rubin in the Washington Post was against Brett Kavanaugh has its its she's no longer a Republican in a sense\nAnd basically you win elections by uniting your side and dividing the other side\nAnd this not only this unites are sided also undermines the core principle and let me go back to this Kavanaugh's confirmation fight the reason that it was so important to get Brett Kavanaugh on the court is because he is what is called\nAn originalist which means that you look at the constitution and it means what it says\n\nJohn Adams is famous for saying facts are stubborn things well words are stubborn things they have a clear meaning\nWhere is there any doubt\nI mean real down about what um what this means um\nThe constitution of the United states in the fourteenth amendment which was adopted Nineteen sixty eight\nSays all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and other state where and they reside\nAnd he hears ... basically what people say on the other side they say well but it says subject to the jurisdiction there of the reason they included that is they want it to exclude the children of ambassadors people who had a clear affiliation with a another country\nIn ... by by that context I think that they could say that someone who is growing up as a citizen of another country or somebody who is left the United states and live the rest of his life in\nSomewhere else okay you exclude that person but to try to go after now people whose parents were not us citizens of the United states are not here legally the undocumented\nIs clearly a loser and there's a great great editorial today in the wall Street Journal making that point the real point about this is that there is neither\nPolitical will no judicial will to do this or to have a constitutional amendment to change birthright citizenship President Trump is on\nVery strong ground when it comes to resisting the caravan very strong ground and virtually all\nRepublicans in nearly all Americans agree with that nobody wants to throw the doors open to everybody nobody wants to remove borders I shouldn't say nobody but very very few and just a fringe of the Democratic party\nAnd to stand on that principle the idea that we have to have an immigration system that works that's the kind of thing you can win\nThe or by the way they they did some fake news today on CNN or they said that well and in order to change the constitution the president would have to get two thirds of both houses of Congress and two thirds of the states that's not true he would need to get two thirds of the house two thirds of the Senate and three quarters of the states it is not\nPossible birthright citizenship is not going to change 'em\nIf Mr Trump wants to end the practice is the wall Street Journal and again nothing new York Times Wall Street journal which had been very supportive of President Trump's generally says Mr Trump wants to end the practice sometimes called birth tourism\nHe can always draft and campaign for a constitutional amendment but Congress is unlikely to agree and pass a law much less an amendment to the constitution\nSo he's making this futile gesture of an executive order a week before election day Mr Trump made a political mistake this year by not trading legal status to adult immigrants brought here illegally as children for more border security than Republicans could have run on an immigration accomplishment\nAnd steady one of the political issue and will ... will soon see how well that worked\nBut here's my basic point about this politically\nI don't think there's anyone who was excited by President Trump saying he's going to address birth tourism who wasn't already supporting President Trump who wasn't already supporting a Republican and getting people excited over this by the way I Do think it would be possible to curb birth tourism\nTalk to nine one one person walks in the door shuts what I had a long enough time to see that he had a jacket shirt

is still good reading for Americans across the country are dying thank you for joining us I don't know what is this a twentieth a Halloween debate\nYes at least I'm sure we've had that many\nOkay but there's a difference to it this year because\nThere's so many universities Princeton University just issued a statement for students who was Yale a couple of years ago about the Halloween costumes that were acceptable or unacceptable or do you think that um this concern with a\nCultural appropriation and political correctness regarding Halloween costumes reflects on some of the essential joy of the holiday\n[laughter] flex some of the central joy no how come\nAnd she'll joy of the holiday\n[laughter] flex some of the central joy no cultural appropriation fad is just a reflection of our over sensitivities in many areas that we shouldn't go out of our way to insult someone we shouldn't\nDress up in a way that it's going to inflame hatred or or do anything negative in the culture but on the other hand I don't think that there needs to be declaration some restrictions issue ... to ...\nAbout what students can do when they are celebrating on their own time\nOkay let let me ask you there was a story about a guy who came to a costume contested in Mississippi bar in clarion Mississippi and he chose to go as a wearing traditional Ku Klux Klan garb\nAnd he was asked to leave and he was like permanently banned or from that bar or because of who Klux Klan of course was involved in mass murder and um and the tax and repression and racism ... appropriate that he should be banned from the bar\nWell I think that every business owner has a right to decide what kind of activities go on in their establishment and you know if that owner was absolutely should and I also think\nThat it was very poor taste for somebody to draft factor that Ku Klux Klan or that it is offensive to many many people I mean I don't have a problem with a an an individual owners saying this is not appropriate here\nYeah I think it's by the way who Klux Klan cost and would be offensive not very many people as much as to everybody\nEverybody here I felt like we don't like that yeah I can see that\nWe can't afford to turn back down\nThat's why I asked for your vote on November sex so we can keep Wisconsin working for generations to come\nFrom a friend who's got water and\nBooks around here

many\n[noise]\nAnd I was a very good if every\nNight it was a night to go trick or treat well I guess for some people are it is one of my many problems with Halloween the message of a trick or treating teaching a little kids to be panhandlers\nNot not my favorite thing but my wife feels differently and she is on the line Dr Diane that the best selling author clinical psychologist or do you recognize that wonderful song they're dying\nNo that's a new one to me tonight is a night\nTonight and I I was created for it's from the uh one of the immortal offerings on television which was the Garfield Halloween special\nOh yes of course how could I have missed it\nRight how indeed um do you\nAnswer yeah well I have to answer you on that and handling actually what do you teach kids difference between panhandling and asking\nFor something and receiving it or how letting the other person determine whether or not you receive it in other words you don't go out to the door with the light is turned off you go to those doors that are welcoming you any trick or treat which is a request and then the homeowner chooses to give you candy\nOkay well we went with it but it's it's like you're saying trick or treat which is kind of like uh it it is the candy or your toilet paper over your trees\nNo I don't think that happens too much anymore okay maybe I'm wrong but I I haven't seen it happen very much anymore because it's too much trouble for people that they would rather be out partying\nVery much anymore because it's too much trouble for people to do with it rather be out partying\nCorrect and and also because everyone's so intimidated but they give the candy\nNow ... and ... when I turn on the carpet pumpkin and say and what are you in your life here I mean that is a time or we connect with the parents in our neighborhood\nIs it time we're we're happy to see the kids and how much it growing in the last year and it's not a time in every neighborhood and across the United states\nThat were teaching kids who panhandle\nThey're apparently are some municipalities where it's against the law for people to go trick or treating a past the age of uh a sixteen or Eighteen do you think that's appropriate\nI whenever municipalities to do that can do but I mean I don't think that you see many adults going trick or treating kids going in and they see can just going by that I don't think that you see adults going by themselves\nAsking for candy [laughter] okay am I said don't they're trying to reduce the amount of candy to send me\nA one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number I bet you have a supporter here in mark in Seattle you're on the ... that show\nThat sort of um I'm calling because your wife is right Michael

I mean I feel bad for them anybody has a dress up my door begging for candy I I Do have compassion for\nUm a let's go to a a Tessa in snow Plame Washington You're on the Michael Medvedev show hello Tessa\nHi Michael I think that's ridiculous to sit here and say that the kids are learning to panhandle during Halloween I mean you can say that for every holiday that's out there couldn't list you're asking him to sit on a strange man's lap Easter you're sitting here telling him take food off the ground\nFourth of July you're telling them it's OK to set things on fire [laughter] well I think it's necessarily around here and say that panhandling is what we're teaching kids at that time\nWell extend out except most people generally in the in the rest of the year you would occasionally sit on somebody's lap and uh you would occasionally like different things on fire I don't know any other occasion and die You're welcome to jump in here\nAny any other occasion where you come up to people you may or may not know\nAnd a hold on a bag and expect them to put some good\nBird though it's generosity between neighbors you're sitting here having an open and find time and you know kids that are younger obviously do it under supervision and then what the older kids I'd rather have my teenagers go trick or treating than going out in the neighborhood and causing trouble ...\nThings like that as well that the thing that makes his day difference is that it is one day set aside universally recognized as a time of being appropriate to go in the neighborhood\nWe all recognize it together it that we expect to have kids and knocking on the door asking for candy it's not a big surprise where he just jumped in front of the door and say give me your candy\nIt's something that we all choose to do and we choose to participate in and those who don't just turn off the porch light\nLet's go to Tom Glenn door or California Hello Tom you're on the bed show with the ...\nThank you very much Michael

Pennsylvania abolition society declined to read a letter to the convention delegates from the society that denounced flavor in religious and Republican grounds\nFranklin did not want to derail the convention by further inflaming the delegates over the issue of slavery and believe that the United states could not last without a new federal government forests he wrote in his final convention speech our states are on the point of separation only to meet hereafter for the purpose of cutting more than others throats\nFor anti slavery delegates like Hamilton and Franklin abolition of slavery would be a moot point if a failure to erect a functioning government snuff down the ideals of the American revolution and their infancy than the future of all Americans the free as well as the slave would eventually be as serves\nTo despotic government okay does that sound like he's defending slavery it it it it is completely\nBogus in utterly irresponsible and I imagine that a mirror Gillum never even picked up the book that he's condemning\nWhich sounds like it's kind of worth picking up in the book justify slavery and um [noise]\nAnd then there's this I mean if if you talk about Democrats just going way over the top uh Karen ... who is a columnist for the Washington Post was on MSNBC with Morning Joe and Mika Brzezinski listen\nIs anger whoa whoa what CERN point then that's coursing right now there are politics it's something that is um [noise]\nI think what we need to understand it's not just about rhetoric is not just about political points about flipping the people's lives are on now on the line and going back to the Republican Party and going back to a child\nIt was just this week that three men and Kansas or convicted of trying bomb Somali refugees and they said in court that ... every time I've done rhetoric how to influence their decision to take people's lives is is not just a matter of of rhetoric of a distraction for the\nCultural ... this is a matter of people\nDying all over the climate that's being created by by not only the White House and condoned by by people like Steve King and Lindsey Graham but that\nPeople are dying people are literally dying over there and I think I think that is one thing that Americans need to consider when they go to the cold is if the country that we want to be right now the last week that we've had the last two weeks\nIf I were any other country I mean it shall travel warnings to the United states over the climate and the violence that we've seen\nOkay really\nIf you look at the murder statistics we're still\nAt less than half the murder rate that we had in the Nineteen eighties\nAnd this is something that all Americans should be proud of it is not just a Republican achievement but there's a new ad frankly that that was run by the Trump reelection campaign those this is not the Republican campaign committee\nThis is the Trump twenty twenty election campaign and the ad is one of the best Republican as I've ever seen I really mean it\nIt hits exactly where this problem came to order which is why is it that right now the places where\nRepublicans are facing the stiff as challenges are privileged suburbs places that have done very well that are earning lots of money lots of new jobs lots of new businesses lots of new construction of those places that are doing so well why\nAre people in those communities leaning against Trump\nAnd yet in down crowd and communities in places in the mid west in in rural Americans small town America that really have suffered recently and haven't yet partake in fully of the new prosperity\nThat's where Republicans are doing well have the party's flipped positions the Democrats are now the party of the rich and the privilege and the comfortable in the secure\nAnd the Republican Party has become the party of the aggrieved\nAnd the struggling and the unhappy [noise]\nRelieved factor actually provides a mechanism for you to reduce the ... the aches and pains that come along with regular life and they do\nAnd for most people they start using relief factor was a dietary supplement full of natural stuff for your body\nThat's a relief factor starts working in five or six days you can feel a real difference and for the great majority of people over Seventy percent nearly three quarters of people who get relief factor\nFind after three weeks which cost just Ninety five cents a day after three weeks\nNineteen Ninety five they a reason really factor works so well that they get more of it you have nothing to lose but your pain and the whole world to gang go to relieve factor dot com that is relief factor dot com when we\nCome back I Want to play this ad which I think is much more effective than other ads in this cycle for the Republican side will we're coming right back on the show\nMichael ...
