collection of her pieces and observations\nFor twenty five years and by the way one of the observations that she makes with which I agree very emphatically is the notion that we have a problem in our higher education system and an education at all levels because of the blind spot toward religion and she takes that position\nWell ... to me will you describe yourself as an atheist right\nCorrect I I'm an atheist but I I I completely respect religion as a profound system of meaning okay but there is a metaphysical system\nAnd I think that you know one of our major problems right now is that in our in our era of secular\nHumanism we have our most educated elite having transferred the need for religion into politics some people look at at their political affiliation their party affiliation is in some way salvation ill or they they they see the world in terms of of good versus\nEvil and and that's what's that and that has produced this at this unbelievable hysteria\nThat I think is so

the people's\nHouse okay it was on the ... in the workplace within the White House how how dare he can't be doing that it was degraded I called for his resignation and it and if he had to resign Al Gore had come in and out history might have been changed because Al Gore who turned out to be quite a fruitcake you know on\nThe on the campaign trail and might have learned how to be president and that'd be reelected so the Democrats as usual my party shot themselves in the foot with that\nOkay uh and what about what about our last caller Sarah from Minneapolis who was talking about her son

that story abhorrent that is an outrage had any professor intruding ... into the classroom in that completely gratuitous way that's professorship and fired as far as I'm concerned\nOkay you react to everything so much in line with the way that I Do ... how how is it that you stayed with the Democratic party all these years\nIn the party I Love is the party of Hubert Humphrey way who was on who was on ... of course by the by the ... of Nineteen sixty eight we may be seeing a replay of that coming up here again in terms of my part I Want the party to return to its populace roots\nAnd and I went to heck with this this you know bi coastal\nElite form of the Democratic party to that so in league with the ... media with which it would have destroyed journalism and thought about what so I'm looking to uh you know figures like Steve bullock the\nUh the governor of Montana I that's something that he has I think it has that is a common touch I'm hoping for that\nUm meanwhile uh let me ask you about there's a headline in the New York times um today and it's just add one more insult to presidents catalogue of attacks on women\nAnd uh they're of course talking about the president designating um Stormy Daniels who of course as ... as\nA as a horse race and uh and then the caption or something as as President Trump has a history of attacking women by mocking their bodily functions demeaning their looks or comparing them to animals\nAmong his targets a Stephanie Clifford left a an actress who performed a Stormy Daniels Carly Fiorina a corporate executive Megan Kelly attorney who isn't a TV journalist and Omarosa Manigault Newman who worked in his White House um the\nThe entire peace in the front page piece\nA is basically saying that Trump is beyond the pale because in the course of politics he insults women uh your response\nWell I I Wish the president would not do this so I don't think\nI don't think the president should lower himself to that level however\nWhen I heard that line uh yesterday over the radio that they call this one one horse face I actually laugh I mean I don't know if I see this is this is actually a Trump's\nPopulist lingo it's the language of construction projects of the bar and yard and so and it's why it's exactly why he has a rapport with so many working class people and and the elite is\nSo used to censored language and prudish puritanical language are that this comes as a shock but he but he he ... he should not a ... denigrate when his physical appearance is true\nOkay ah I I think we can we can all agree on that uh um but I I I Do appreciate the other part of his formulation was entirely true where he attacked a Stormy Daniels third rate lawyer my ...\nYeah I'm Bill Marr has said Democrats if they actually want to win ever again have to reject insane political correctness that's his his line you agree\nOh totally absolutely I really I mean I think that just does this bubble obviously on both coasts okay it it it includes and a ... academe everywhere in the United states as well\nAnd um I mean it to me you know I I I teach in Philadelphia but I I return to the suburbs you know after work\nAnd I tried to stay in touch with how people really think and living in you know and the actual world in the U.S and my God I mean it looks like these are these are crazy people that they the echo chamber okay\nBetween the media and the super structure of the Democratic party and so on yet political correctness is is it it becomes a world unto itself I'd if people are lost in it absolutely lost I think

you wanted\nYour entirely correct and and you're right in in terms of the games they play in Washington for instance um when people talk about quote cutting\nSocial Security they're talking about cutting the rate of increase you know nobody ever and nor should people talk about cutting back what's already pledged in Social Security but it's considered a cut if you cut the rate of increase but you're entirely correct I think what President Trump has in mind here\nIs each of the federal departments is a lot of a set amount of money and not say you have a a government bureau department is is\nA has a budget of a hundred billion dollars well that budget would mean you find five billion dollars to safe\nBut you're you're right to bring this up to and thanks for the call let's go to I'm
