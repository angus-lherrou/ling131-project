I think you're under stadium is this a full fledged boom or on right now\nYou know as you know I was out in Seattle what about a month ago when I was in your studio and I was in you know I've gone everywhere from Portland, Oregon Portland Maine in ... in between and everywhere I go I'll I see is you know I saw this in Seattle I saw when I see at San Francisco I see it you know Nashville, Tennessee in Denver, Colorado and\nAh you know Austin, Texas everywhere just a\nFriend's everywhere buildings going up skyscrapers factories\nWarehouses biggest construction boom in history to this country is going on right now everybody's so bullish on America they want to build a lot of it as foreign investment money that's coming in to the United states we have what you know every time I Do your show I liked the you know I'm ... another statistic uh first of all we got the\nIndustrial production numbers came out there like the highest ever and then we the the seven point one million you know the statistics seven point one million more jobs than Americans to fill them that's amazing\nAnd that's part of the problem we have right now with all of these people streaming toward the border and that caravan I'd let me let me\nGo to one of the I just interrupt you for one sure\nIt's interesting you brought that up I was watching CNN Today and they were saying um that the number of people crossing the border illegally has actually increased in under Donald Trump\nAlly ally and ... and I you know and they and they were showing the statistics and by the way the number of people cross the border under Obama what way way way way down but you know why that was right\nYeah because people didn't get jobs exactly there were no traps year yeah so they they have the real\nReliable cure to illegal immigration is basically a lousy economy\nExactly you know actually when we had the terrible recession more people left the United states that came into the United states so you know this was almost a sign of prosperity that people from around the world want to come here because there's a lot of economic opportunity but they never connected the dots on CNN on that you know\nUh but the but it is a sign that the environmental not like you and I agree on this we need a lot more legal immigrants from this country we need more\nPeople in the farm farm workers and we need more service workers and we knew him reading more technology workers and and I used to tell Donald Trump I've told you this you know it and it's in the book\nWe say if you're going to build that wall battle make sure it has big gate so people can come in legally\nThe book is called Trump a non makes inside of the America First plan to revive our economy but you don't believe that President Trump should allow this a ... a caravan from Honduras which is marching forward with Honduran flags by the way that they should allow the caravan into the country do\nYou know I'm actually watching on the on the screen I'm watching CNN as we thought a and I'm I'm watching all these people are you know look no there has to be out there has to be some orderly\nAbsolutely right yeah yeah I mean we we are absolutely agree on that let me let me go back to to one thing that the Democrats have been lying about and they literally lying about this every day and the media never call them on and\nThey claim that the tax cuts that you helped to write and help to design the those tax cuts that have been passed have caused this exploding budget deficit because they've reduced revenues that's just a flat on line isn't it\nYeah red revenues are actually ... this year so we passed the biggest tax cuts in Thirty years and we actually have a slight increase rep is not what I Would like to see revenues higher and I think by the way as we get you know as we continue to see this economy uh continue to grow you you know the best way to get\nTax revenues to put people into work at a business is profitable and move businesses back to the United states which is happening uh but yeah look the problem is spending and you know people I say oh you're just a rival Republican I'm not a rubber Republican the Republicans and Democrats this bipartisan spending spree that's going on my caller both parties deserve a lot of blame for this\nAnd you like a President Trump's a idea a vast along every department to cut five percent yes\nI Love that you know that's what businesses do\nYou know that that's the thing if you're running a business\nAnd you don't have enough money coming in and your expenditures are too high you got to go to your agents and this is what businesses did during the recession they talked in their stomach\nThey tighten their belts they got rid of inefficient workers and inefficient services and things they didn't need and they save money they became profitable getting we never do that and government and by the way I Would like to hear one listener\nI Love your show Paul endear show and tell me you can't say five cents on the dollar\nThat right it well exactly ... what about the one aspect and you mentioned this in your book Trump ... posted up at our website at Michael ...\nThe one aspect of Trump's America First program that he talked about in the campaign was infrastructure that he's really done pretty much nothing to implement a where's the money going to come from to do the big infrastructure improvements that we need\nWell let me go back to what I was just saying about this construction boom that's going on in this country factories\nAnd warehouses and and apartments and that that is an infrastructure we need pipelines we need ... terminals we need\nOil refineries we you know the point I'm making is a lot of that infrastructure and we need in this country you know rebuilding our ports a lot of that Michael I think can be good to be done with private money it doesn't why what where does it say that the government has to pay for all of this stuff\nI think that's a great ... points for President Trump to borrow from the book from ... from my friend and guess Stephen Moore he is a a chief economist at the Heritage Foundation of the book is posted up at our

of Nikki Haley made a very profound point in fact maybe that's worth playing again [noise]\nA a Greg if we can because Nikki Haley spoke at the Al Smith dinner and her humor has gotten a lot of

political issue that person with whom you disagree as necessarily evil\nThat is not true I Do not believe that the Democrats are in general evil\nOr maybe some but I Can't even think of any off hand lose an evil Democrat don't call me on your nominations for an evil Democrat that a lot of deserved eludes\nActually I Hope that all of them lose this time they want all because we have a two party system in this country but the point about this is it there's a difference between evil and foolishness or even corruption\nAnd here's what a Nikki Haley had to say about this at the Al Smith dinner and she said it so well that well let's just have her say it herself\nHow can we find ourselves and our political rivals that really didn't want to share something isolated and for say a lot when I

differences peacefully in the\nWay even life recognize that we are a marriage and we are stronger and healthier than we are you\nOkay I think it's tough to disagree with that and particularly in the

ultimately happened is one day cautious daughter in the hour we're going by our national to protect her privacy something the school didn't do here\nWas excuse to go to the restroom and a boy in her class that identifies as ginger fluid with also excused and while Pashtuns daughter was using the restroom the boy came in\nAgain allowed under this policy and sexually assaulted posh his daughter\nA ... that evening I learned about it her daughter telling her what happened and was shocked as any parent would be the here that this happened to her daughter and she talks to the school officials and finds out that this happened because the schools transgender policy\nSpecifically allow this boy to use the girl facilities\nOkay is there a is there a policy of the schools just basically any restroom you want to go to that it is it's fairly fairly easy for a boy to go into the girls restroom\nThat's right and all it takes is for students to assert that their gender fluid or identify as the opposite gender and they are allowed by the school to use these facilities a play on sports teams whatever they want to that embraces that gender identity that's different than their biological\nSay okay I assume that when you say that the little girl five years old was molested she was touched was more than just a her feeling uncomfortable\nThat's exactly right that this was a um touching in a private area I won't go into a lot of the ... hills but um and it's something\nThat we would all be involved I of course with the opponent anybody who has children or grandchildren is going to be appalled by that so so what happened Pasha went to the school authorities are looking obviously for some justice and probably looking to correct his policy what the school authorities said or\nYet no justice was given you would think the school with the very least would reconsider this policy um they refused to do so you would think the school might at least say well let's\nTransfer the boy to another classroom because remember they shared the same classroom the school refused to do that as well so Pasca was left with no choice but to do with any parent with do take her doubt daughter away from the harmful situation and that's when she reached out to us and and we've been involved in helping or seek the justice at the school district refused to offer her daughter\nOkay now let me make clear we're not talking about Portland, Oregon or Bennington, Vermont\nVicious Decatur, Georgia wouldn't you think that there would be more upholding of a a traditional commonsense values\nThat you would think so schools everywhere have a constitutional duty to protect the privacy and safety of their students and it's just common sense that\nGirls going to girls restrooms voice go into a boys and if you've got a student that's struggling with issues you can accommodate that you can allow him to use a\nTeacher's restroom a single use the facility but you never allow them into facilities or the opposite sex and this demonstrates why but this common sense even in places like Georgia is being thrown out the window because of this gender identity ideology being forced on our school kids\nOkay and so ... by the way is African American not that it matters but uh and it's usually you things that people on the left would have sympathy for an African American mother who's doing a beautiful job trying to raise their children\nUm what ... what happens next year ... alliance defending freedom you've taken this to the education\nWhat happens next year ...\nAlliance defending freedom you've taken this to the education department is that right\nThat's exactly right so ah the school district was relying on a an old guidance issued under the Obama department of education that has since been rescinded and we brought this to the attention of the department of education and they have now launched an investigation that were encouraged by that we're glad to see the federal government taking this seriously\nLooking into whether the school district has violated federal law as a result of this dangerous transgender bathroom policy\nOkay so ah ... in the best case scenario or what happens next what happens to address the concerns of this brave mother indicator Georgia\nI think first we're hoping the department finds that the school was violated federal law and hold them accountable for that and to the school has to revoke this policy this is not working it is causing harm like what happened to posh his daughter there are better solutions\nBut the uh common sense solution should be never allow a boy into the girls restrooms or vice versa those are supposed to be private intimate places that are reserved for students that designated sex or better solution than what the ... the cater school district did hear\nOkay I'm speaking to match they matched sharp who is a senior counsel for the alliance defending freedom and he's one of those terrific attorneys that I've told you about who um I give heart and soul to this cause\nNow not everybody is in a position to give heart and soul and legal skills of this cause but everybody's in a position to give a donation\nAnd it's really important because right now\nEven with a much more sympathetic administration in Washington DC a religious liberty is still under assault and it's under assault or by bureaucrats by local officials by school boards\nIn many many different areas and right now you're on something of a winning streak over the ATF orange you\nWe have we've had some incredible wins from the Baker jak Philips to defending pregnancy care centers and most recently cheap Cochran also in Atlanta getting a one point two million dollar settlement after he was fired by the city of Atlanta for writing a book about his Christian beliefs\nOkay be part of this take part in it um maybe there's not that much we can do right now to save this poor Christian Woman who's been condemned\nTo death

Disney Princess movies are banned well we'll talk later on about why feminist ban Disney Princess movie is coming up but ... but he one of the things that are more ... achieved as you can now actually\nLook at movies they're censored or they want to protect people's sensibilities in Saudi Arabia we are talking about Saudi Arabia not Connecticut\nBut still it's been moving in the right direction does that mean that you forgive something as horrible\nAs the to show the torture and killing and by the way for people who say well he's ...
