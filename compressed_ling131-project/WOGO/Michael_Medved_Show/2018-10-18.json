eight\nOr let's just go back for a moment to this deep question\nAbout the out of wedlock birth and why it is a problem for any\nChild and and I'm not now suggesting that people be punished for having children out of wedlock I'm not suggesting is preferable that\nA baby who was conceived out of wedlock be aborted or dispensed with\nWhat I Am suggesting is that we get back to the idea that in this society there are norms norms are worth preserving and one of the norms would be that\nIt is worthwhile for people to come together to form a durable relationship and to raise a child in that context\nIt the truth as a matter isn't you've heard this a lot on this radio show but it's always worth repeating it is a common lie is a misconception it's not just a misconception is a\nTotal distortion that most marriages or even half of marriages don't last anyway so you could get married before a baby and well then maybe no no it's true not all marriages last but the majority do\nAnd particularly for four people\nToday today people are getting married a much older age is an average American Woman\nNow has her first child woman who's going to have a child at age twenty seven that's still pretty young that's up from twenty to win Nineteen Seventy and one of the things that they're blaming for the out of wedlock birth rate is the fact that people spend longer in school but the ... the idea that\nYou're getting married at age thirty or age thirty one or age thirty five or aged forty\nVets that doesn't mean that it's not valuable\nFor your future children to be in a committed long term and chances are permanent relationship\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six the traditional progression of western life has been reversed says John ... who teaches at Columbia University he says cohabiting\nPartners are having children before getting married that's a long term trend across developing nations okay\nThe idea that they get married later find good glad to see that but what about all those couples and and we know of is it is couples who are cohabiting\nAre much less likely to last long term than couples that are actually married and there's a wealth of data that makes that clear let's go to um Bob in Cleveland, Ohio Bob you're on the Michael ...\nI think instead of trying to go back to the crash\nInto society we should uh adapt to these new trends and um find new ways of helping these kids succeed and I just want to say it is you know back in you know maybe a hundred years ago\nUh you know that much of the rich for show high that often a parent would die in the trial would or maybe you have to live with her grandma parents or relatives or other relatives show\nI think this can be done successfully as long as we are open minded in in the day after these tranche\nAbout what does that mean I Know it sounds good and adapting to trends are it sounds very open minded and terrific but what does it mean\nI Would say that we need government programs horse that would help\nThat would uh specifically be tailored to kids living in a single parents situation\nOkay what kind of programs are you thinking of you want the government to send babysitters you want to establish government day care centers\nI think over ... would be one way I think manners where you do you pay people who are professionals to go in and spend time with these ... these children and help them out\nOkay let me just mention something to you Bob I I understand that sounds very generous and very nice but you know what there are some times families\nWho are married to each other who are raising children sometimes multiple children\nAnd their financially press is it fair that people like that who are having a tough time financially with their own kids at home should have a bigger chunk taken out of their income to provide for other people who may be struggling with only one parent\nOr you know you're going to hate the fish but ah I I I'm going to say that as we should cut defense spending because it's just it's just not not necessary and we should also raised taxes on the rich\nOK well of course when you say I'm going to hate this on my shelves you down but the idea that cutting defense spending is going to be an answer right now we are spending more on interest on the national debt\nThan we are on defense and in my opinion I think the end opinion most Americans the defense spending that we spend is the best investment we could possibly make\nAnd some of the very ambitious social programs in the worst one of the things that has happened in this country and has been shown by a wealth of books and information\nAh there is uh Charles Murray wrote the first book that the blue the lid off the welfare\nSystem in the way the welfare system has it been designed particularly by Lyndon Johnson the great society actually encouraged out of wedlock birth\nAnd there are Democrats who are written about that Daniel Patrick Moynihan who was a moderate Democrats [noise] rose about the problems with family structure in the United states when he predicted exactly where we are that if government wars out of wedlock birth of course they're going to get more of it\nWe'll be right back ah with when does a a public figure go over the line\nBy assure you I have never before endorsed a pain relief product\nNot until now not into relief factor came along as a one hundred per cent drug free solution for people struggling with ordinary pain quite simply relief factor was designed by doctors to help relieve those occasional aches and pains due to aging exercise\nAnd everyday living let me ask you are aches and pains keeping you from sleeping through the night for keeping you from taking those nice long walks or playing golf or tennis you can't really call it living if you can't get around comfortably\nOkay or you can get around comfortably with relief factor and you can get it comfortably uh just Nineteen Ninety

New Jersey Lou you're on the Michael Mann that show\nBy Michael thanks for taking my call again you better go\nUm so I just wanted to say oh there's there's a difference of the impact of statements when it's coming from different groups\nBetter disparaging other groups and what I mean there's there's a history of white supremacy throughout the world for a long time ago in particular when you're looking at white versus black or white versus views you have Germany you have the United states for different places where you know blacks were\nOver centuries in factories and generations um attacked in that way that hadn't been the case of a history of black supremacy on issues or on white people or something like that so there's different impact of that\nI I agree I agree and again I I think it's obviously much more serious if somebody in public office say is\nSaying something that is negatively racist then if somebody like Louis Farrakhan saying it however I think people were right to challenge President Trump when he was a candidate for office about support he'd received from David Duke\nBecause even though David Duke is a joke and a loser and a creep and a former klansmen and a former leader of the Nazi Party and all of the above\nA she she still it to to allow him to be associated in any way with someone respectable\nIs a very real problem and this brings us to Farrakhan\nBecause if you look at fire comes history of just a cop Khamenei anti American hatred of his own country the idea that he should be on stage as he was at a recent Franklin's funeral he was just a few seats away from a former president the United states Bill Clinton\nAnd uh I Do not believe that Bill Clinton is anti Semitic in any way I don't believe he is a racist\nBut you you simply can't all of a sudden sale because Louis Farrakhan his old at this point and because he associates himself\nWith um with with black people and as a representative of black people than anything that he says that is filled with racial hatred and its racial hatred by way against white people in general and it's still toxic instill deserves some kind of sanction go ahead last year\nBy by understand that Michael can act that one more point go okay so my point is that where this is\nComing from where they misled or in my opinion a a black people who are you know very hatred of their have full of of whites where it's coming from if they're a kind of a revolution are fighting back about what happened to them at the people over time\nWhereas the other direction when it was the Nazis or whomever it would attacking people not because they did anything to them they made off and fear if your theories and made off that these people were doing stuff against them ... it really\nOkay I look I I understand but if you're talking about this goes into the for instance hatred of Turks against Armenians and the Turkish genocide against Armenians one of the justifications for that genocide which was real and it happened and and also being now Israel direct and so the Armenian people\nWere cruel to the Turks and they were undermining\nIt doesn't matter if you were going to express irresponsible hatred toward any group based upon ethnicity or religious faith\nOn there ought to be sanctioned and that doesn't mean that you want to be shut down by the government but it means that respectable people should John you\nLet's go to Calvin in Columbus ohio Calvin you're on the ...\nAnd Michael thanks for taking my call you met one\nI just wanted to mention a little bit uh I Do agree

tweet that came in\nSays Michael this is from a Jeff\nAnd Jeff says Michael it was reported today that the budget deficit exploded Seventeen percent year over year do mostly to the Trump tax cuts the Jews often preys on your show\nPerhaps you could comment on that instead of this ridiculous Elizabeth Warren side show very glad to comment on that uh let me just tell you that those people\nWho are saying that the reason for the budget increase the budget deficit increase is the tax cuts are partisan hacks\nBudget increase the budget deficit increase is the tax cuts are partisan hacks it's not true how do I know it's not true\nBecause revenues year over year at the same time that the budget deficit went up revenues went up they didn't go down the increase they increase slightly but ah my source for this is a not only government figures but the New York times and the Treasury Department the New York times\nThey um they report that as a matter of fact the\nTreasury reported that federal revenues rose by huge zero point four percent from the two thousand and Seventeen fiscal year to the two thousand Eighteen fiscal year and uh they view that a treasury is assigned the tax cuts are paying for themselves and the New York times takes issue with that because they say well\nThe growth in revenues would have been even greater without the tax cuts okay they might be right to the growth in revenue would have been greater but the growth in revenue is still growth in revenue we're taking in more money\nThe problem we have is we are spending too much\nAnd I actually think President Trump did a good thing and advising the cabinet that he expects every federal department to cut at least five percent and acknowledge that we should do more let's go to on disagreement day Christine in Seattle you're on the Michael ... show\nSean Michael I'm I'm calling today because I just to be with your aunt marijuana\nI Am a survivor of\nYears and years the method violent and um I because of that developed ... and\nI go to therapy I've been in therapy for about three years and\nThey recommend it needs to be on you know\nLike pharmaceutical drug\nWas scared to do that and I didn't want to\nBecome reliant on it so it's a combination of therapy and smoking marijuana I Am recovering\nI'm I'm very happy for you and I'm Glad to hear it and marijuana is legal medical marijuana has been legal for a long\nTime um but you said and you're right you didn't want to become dependent on some of the pharmaceutical drugs shouldn't you also be concerned about becoming dependent on marijuana\nYes I actually am a gun that is a concern of mine um however I\nProven to myself I'm a numerous times that like I'll go I'd I'd gone through fans in the past ... years of no you and then I you occasionally and then I can like turn it down\nThat OK early when I Do use I use it right before a therapy session I agree\nAnd and again and you're you're getting medical and psychological attention and and that's good and I hope everything should continue to be better for you and then the the basic position that I Would have on marijuana is simply that being dependent on anything\nIs not great uh I think people get very dependent on alcohol I was reading a they have a thing in the New York times they have a advice column called sugars and somebody was writing in and asking for advice\nAnd I was saying what should we do our children are are talking to my wife and myself children are nine and seven and they say hey mommy and daddy you drink too much\nAnd he said one of our kids said or the other day when my wife was having a second bloody Marriott month as lunch\nOkay and of course in the answer to them they never said you know maybe you do drink too much I mean it's and it turns out that they have a family history of alcoholism they got to be careful but the idea is looked life life has all kinds of challenges\nAnd sometimes it does make sense whether it's with marijuana or with booze certainly with opioids or any other kind of prescription drugs anything\nDon't make things more difficult for yourself then is absolutely necessary let's go to a Lauren in

really just taking our influence in our leadership position in from other countries\nOkay Lauren and Lauren what do you think would happen if a President Trump all of a sudden it's announced okay okay uh we're canceling this arms deal with Saudi Arabia where they're buying a hundred billion dollars worth of our arms that we make here what what would happen and you think they would get their arms from somewhere else\nFor sure\nAbsolutely they would they would first probably get them from China or Russia and a ... again what have we accomplished ... I Do I Believe that Saudi Arabia's a problematic country I think it's a corrupt and brutal autocracy it's a very problematic country\nBut do I believe that it would help the United states to completely alienate ourselves and end a working relationship with Saudi Arabia Thomas Friedman is a big liberal wrote a find peace in the New York times yesterday\nAnd that piece made the case that look we need reform and the whole Islamic world we need reform and the religion because the essence of what happened\nIn September eleventh was not paying enough attention to the real threat of radicalized murderous a neo fascist\nIslam O.

substantive disagreement that came in from Renton, Washington from Richard\nHe says Michael in regards to Senator Elizabeth Warren ... claim of having Native American heritage it's no different than you claiming to be Jewish\nOh really I'm not a U.S senator and I've never tried to claim any advantage to identifying as Jewish just who I Am it's the way I was raised\nHe writes the name ...

they were all taken a during the eggs on\nAnd again this is all pretty well known Jewish history\nUnless you believe the twelve tribes of Israel came from Europe no I don't according to my knowledge

tribes of Israel that's right\nWhich upon entering the promised land God commanded them to commit ethnic genocide against the pagan is well no not exactly commanding them to kill men when children

dollars to the charity of your choice if you can show you have more than thirty percent Jewish DNA you know I might take this that\nI might take this bad for the record my grandfather who was an immigrant from Germany his mother I understand was from Poland grandfather told me his mother handed down to him a solid silver Menorah which I have a very good memory of seeing as a child during the holiday season it was always placed above his fireplace\nThere were never any Christmas trees and grandpa U.S House this Menorah there was handed down from his great great great grandfather to his mother does that make me Jewish\nAnd you're faithful listener Richard okay Richard ... it it does not make you Jewish because you weren't raised Jewish you've never affiliated Jewish you've never been part of the community the point about Elizabeth Warren that was so stupid\nWas that she never participated in any American indian life she was never registered with any tried there was no tradition of

or what do we do about the fact\nThat Americans seem to be so isolated out there I I'm In past writing have written about the uh the notion that a lot of people live in sort of suburban Fort Apache where they're prepared to defend their home turf against hostility\nBut they don't really have a lot of alliances even right next door and that's one of the themes in them why we hate each other and how to heal it's the new book by Senator Ben Sasse the senator from Nebraska a many many of our listeners\nWere extremely grateful senator Sasse for your common sense in perspective during the Kavanaugh hearings\n'em ... before we we get back to that and where we go after the Kavanaugh hearings you were talking before about teenagers\nAnd how isolated teenagers are by age and they have in today's world very often are not serious relationships with people who are older or even people who are younger\nAnd a ... one of the cures to that it always seems to me is provided right in that religious context you're talking about which is the Sabbath\nThe idea of one day a week where a lot of these other demands\nA take precedence string about presidents Theodore Roosevelt and he tormented his six children and they were all required to go to church with him on Sunday\nAnd then they would have a Sunday dinner and that was required for the kids and a lot of them resented it of course as adults they were grateful for it\nOr what about that as a means to heal as you talk about in your book\nUh yesterday man uh so I mean the ... and it does maybe viewed recovered and you do see places in both Judaism and Christianity now where people are recovering it um the\nThe intergenerational stuff you were talking about a minute ago kids are less happy if they spend their whole life as a Fifteen year old or an Fifteen year olds 'cause they're not a lot of wisdom there there's constant immediacy and there's value in knowing not just forty five year olds but Seventy five year olds\nAnd so and the crowd trigger die he's written a pretty interesting book called the cat lives family a ... guy and he he talks about\nOne hour a day one day a week one week a year they lock up all their technology and there are people in that tradition and I mean does it matter jokingly say they're trying to be almost almost Amish\nOut with their approach to acknowledge it what they mean is all the technology you can use in your work environments but being really self conscious about the ways that technology can crowd out real satisfying human relationships in your family and your social life there's a bunch of data now in the happiness literature which shows if you go from a few hundred five hundred social media\nThey're now in the happiness literature which shows if you go from two hundred five hundred social media from Twitter from five hundred to a thousand social media friends you don't get any happier I covered this in them um why we ate each other and now the hill\nI'm but it's you know the person who lives two doors away from you and your neighborhood your statistically much more likely to be happy\nAnd it's got a few invite people over for Sunday lunch or or Saturday solve a hunch or if you have people over for dinner and of course of the week um\nYou get happier you you get into a service posture where you realize your whole life isn't about your own consumption and you start to build was to grow relationships in the neighborhood that aren't transactional and they end up making you happier and so I I Try to spend a lot of the book on that constructive kind of topic\nAnd that's a Senator Ben Sasse senator from Nebraska his new book a them why we hate each other and how to heal\nLet let's talk for just a moment about the aftermath of the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation fight and thank goodness you were a very key part of winning that fight for a justice Kavanaugh and I'm sure he's going to be a big credit to the Supreme Court and do a terrific job\nBut what about this idea I I Know your colleagues Senator Graham and some others have talked about not letting it go going after the leakers and the people who set up the ugliness that America saw going after Dianne Feinstein for instance I'd do you think that's productive\nAh I I don't know the right path from here in the Judiciary Committee\nThat is is broken as the committee on which when the un I said that they're loving loving Republicans and Democrats edited a terribly broke and circus right now um it didn't serve anybody who are kids or the cabinet family or the Ford family or a search for facts and truth it didn't serve\nAnybody well because the Senate and the Judiciary Committee in particular\nDecided that it wanted to be swallowed by cable news television instant instant certainty on everything\nWe did a really really bad job as the United States Senate but senator Feinstein's team did some really horrible despicable fangs\nAnd so I Do think we need to sort out how did we get to a place where these allegations were\nAlways treated in the circus like atmosphere as the first bite at the apple when I sat on the Judiciary Committee now for two years we'd get lots of allegations all over the map about stuff that ends up being real some it ends up being ... ends up being clearly made up political hits\nAnd there's a way to deal with this with the FBI and in the Senate confidential process that doesn't start with everything as cable reality t._v. screaming and there were people in our Judiciary Committee who decided that's where they wanted to start at the top of that back to the theme of our half an hour together here I really do think there is a desperation\nFor some of our political addicts and Washington to try to act like blood sport politics\nOr forever more is what they want what they don't really love their neighbor they don't really care about your listeners kids and grandkids because they're not trying to solve long term problems they're trying to make politics the center of the gladiatorial fight and that's not going to work in a republic\nYeah I mean somehow World Wrestling entertainment is not what you want for uplift of of your kids or for the American future I'm speaking speaking of which is one of the things that last night I I I gave a talk or to a neighborhood group bleed and had a couple of hundred people there was great\nBut there's this general sense that our politics is broken and I found myself ... when does to you today talking a little bit of a would I be wrong to say that the Nebraska Legislature which is non partisan and you and a camera on there's only one house in the legislature\nThat things work a little bit better in your state than they do and many others\nThey do a ... there's less sense of preening constantly for the cameras and even though my state is you know one of the four or five most conservative states in the union and that's one of the reasons I as one of the most conservative senator of the United states elected from here\nEven though we're a very conservative place probably two to one Republican legislature people do not officially ... really parties in our unit camera all our one one house a state legislature and so what people are mostly doing is wrestling with ... term pragmatic question how do you get a good infrastructure and\nHighway and bridges bill that's cost effective\nUh there's less certainty that you're going to find the line between good and evil of for people who might have slightly different priorities of which bridge in which highway to find it's a much healthier thing to do bridges and roads by politics\nInstead of trying to do a good and evil heaven and hell by politics if the federal politics do what they should be an American constitutional hooked up with your maintain a framework for ordered liberty approaching the idea that people are created with dignity the image of God and they have rights by nature and government is our shared project to secure those rights\nGovernment is the author of sorts right then government could do a small number of big things\nOr we need to build the fiber of strategy for the digital age et cetera but then most of what's meaningful can happen back and communities where people actually live next door to their neighbors\nWhat ... what a concept change from the bottom up not the top down that's part of the theme of them why we hate each other and how to heal it's the new bestseller by Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska\nAll I can say is keep it up senator we need you there in Washington and across the country\nOn the book
