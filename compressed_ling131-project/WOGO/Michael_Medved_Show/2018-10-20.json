was a huge taxpayer in Japan now ten years ago if I were to say tax fair in Japan you'd say okay it's all about TV and DVR and home entertainment systems well that's about the case anymore\nWhat's hot

hands are sweaty\nAlong with how you're sitting in facial expressions are being tracked by a camera ... why all of this ... and being tracked and analyze so that this way you know how stressed out you are\nAnother company and we were at a manufacturing has a small device that you hold for a minute between your thumb and your ... and it measures pulse rate and the nervous system\nThen there's this device that was created by a lines for hygiene they say if you're worried about your teeth you can smile at a smartphone app and then the company will tell you about your oral hygiene okay there the center for the tablet measures water temperature your pulse and body temperature\nAnother censoring her crib can upload data to a computer showing whether the baby rose onto the stomach temperatures

it seems that since the event of square and you have into a pay and the other ways that people are are now able to take credit cards that seems to be everywhere it's like you know I had to have airport in my tire and I paid for the gas and the guy says here you know you want it to me for putting air the tire with the gas and I'm like well what was that\nYou know I gave them a book but still you know is a tipping becoming too much for talking about that as well and the phone lines are open one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty for his way to join us when you're calling in there's Andrew but been skiing that Kim commando show man gave hello there Andrew\nKim we have a ... or I should say Dr Bonnie Dr Bonnie in Chicago yes she is a doctor and she was going to start doing\nTele medicine so like like seeing patients over Skype and coast time and things like that exactly I think that is amazing technology have you ever tried it no I've never done okay I have and so you ought to look at this especially 'cause you have kids young kids\nThat you know if the kids get sick and you have to take him to the pediatrician we did last night okay then there's like the clean you know that they're supposed to be like the the wealth side and the six side yeah there's about four feet of carpet separates or\nNearly so the germs really aren't going to go from there to hear hey where do you think you're doing the acquaintance I stay over there and then they give you that\nSo from there to hear hey where do you think you're doing the claims I Would say over there\nAnd then they give you that tend to use right okay and you're like was that the Clinton side or the other side pen okay\nWhen doctors on call doctors on demand and you know you might even have that as part of your health care package 'cause we have it here at West star as part of our health care package is that you can\nGo online or download the app and you see a doctor right on your phone one thing I don't like the ... stuff alone is going on\nAnd they can prescribe antibiotics they can just tell us what you think another doctor\nIt's absolutely amazed well this is going to be a change for Dr Bonnie ... but she wants to know on the technical side\nHow before logging on and greeting a pack a patient can choose to make sure the lighting is right the camera looks good maybe she looks good on camera before she jumps in and started talking to a patient yeah because you don't want to look bad no no you have to look you know body you\nHave to look hot [laughter] yes yes this is going to be quite a transition going from a brick and mortar office to my home office where I can either use my Mac laptop\nOr even my eye pad and iPhone right yeah\nSo um I just didn't know if there was a way that I can do a selfie check to see you know if the lighting is OK or maybe the background the position of the camera I Know you're supposed to look into the\nEye of the camera and not the actual screen writing things like that so I did I wanted to know what I can do to prepare before you actually get out and start thinking\nWell you know the big thing is is that we want to make sure there's a good light on you okay\nAnd in Chicago you have sunny days you have cloudy days right yes and you have a cold winter days I've been there like that so I'm the best case scenario is that you get what's called a Ringo light I don't know if you've heard of this\nAnd it's a it is a rank and I can put a link to one for you that I Would recommend free over at Amazon dot com and so what does it has\nIt's for a facial ... like portraits that people use that for it's also when you're on when you're using a webcam\nIs that you have a tendency to be washed out okay with the ring light is exactly what it is is that it's going to illuminate your face K.\nAnd so that this way people are better able to see you and you'll actually you will actually look better lit up than dark a lotta people say oh no I live better in a dark restaurant\nNot not so much on K now when you're faces illuminated within the background will appear darker OK okay and so you being a doctor I Would want to see your credentials on the wall meaning I I Want to see those diplomas\nYou know what I mean even though I Can't I won't be able to read them\nI Want to see all your awards I Want to know where you went to medical school I mean I I'm not gonna be able to look that closely but I can tell what they are right okay and of course you want to get rid of any junk behind you to you don't strike me as that person but you know we've interviewed people before like this guy you know for jobs here\nAnd you know and you look and they have it's like they're the hoarders behind them and you're like ooh what is that pile that you like to write the weekly and all that up\nNow there are ways when you have faced time for example that you can hit a button this was going to be hard but what I Would do is I Would just\nRecord say a couple of seconds and then you don't have to worry about just taking a picture so if you can record some video of yourself for thirty seconds\nThe big thing too that a lot of people don't realize by is that you want to smile OK okay and because when you smile you look welcoming and\nI'm sure you've done that you know where it's hard to deliver bad news but you might have a little bit of a smile you know race a because there's a whole side of\nI mean I have a lot of friends who are doctors and I I hear a lot of the bad story but I also hear the good stories you know yeah and um but you know so being letting your personality come through have you ever done this before\nAre only ... but not actually as a patient doctor saying\nThis is so cool I'm so excited frail um the ring lights are about\nSixty bucks okay and it makes like I said it makes\nTotal difference you're going to love what you see when you record a couple of minutes of yourself because at that point you're going to say yes a little extra blush sometimes works to and you're on a webcam because uh you seem to get a little bit washed out even if you do have this ring light and again thank you for your call\nHey speaking of let's talk about their or works relieved like many of us she might suffer from muscle cramps in your legs and also in your feet to experience relief do what I Do use their works really if

there's the Starbucks I was at the Starbucks in Honolulu and I'll never forget\nThe ... percent like eight hundred dollars or something and it's probably had to tip jars\nOkay and so you know not only can you tip on the receipt but they actually had tip jars right one\nWas one said for all you Android people and the other ones had for all you iPhone people and the iPhone ... drivers like overflowing [laughter] and the Android One didn't have anything\nYeah I was at a a video game thing and they said if you think the X. box sucks trip here if you think the PlayStation ... it's just a ploy it's just like you said before giving people out of their money\nBut how about this one this is a little different when we ordered or my sister's kids came over for dinner or something like which was get a bunch of barbecue so we go on Amazon restaurants right a bunch of barbecue and I get the total and it's like a hundred and twenty five dollars and I was like that's a lot more than I was expecting\nRight they automatically added on twenty five per cent tip after also charging me a delivery fee okay that that's really tough because they don't even ask you yeah and\nYou know ... for that and also overeat because they'll say like\nPricing search okay and\nSo they add another five dollars if you order something that's under ten dollars there'll be a small order delivery charge you know or whatever it may\nBe but maybe it's like being a server at one point in my life\nI actually will tip the whole foods or the Amazon Prime driver or whatever it is I'll actually add more like he's like okay I got a whole foods delivery yesterday and it was probably I think it was like a hundred and fifty dollars\nShe got two things you had salmon and broccoli [laughter]\nWhich is probably about it and some sushi okay\nAnd if the tip was a recommended to was twelve dollars\nPay and so so I was ten percent okay I ... I gave the guy sixteen I gave them an extra four\nOr five I Wonder what I mean the research has got to be out there that this worked otherwise the apps that are doing this the squares and stuff like that they wouldn't included\nWell and because you know remember they're making a percentage of the total even on a tip yes okay because they charge square and the other one said two point nine percent two and a half percent of as a transaction fee of the total amount right okay so if they can get that told and thinking about this if they can get the total\nAmount up by five dollars I Would think the temporary dollars no no no you pay the whole transaction than what the ... what is that what is the bottom line transaction then you have to pay a fee for them collecting the money and doing things like that and ...\nI'm Still not tipping well I'll just have a hard it is hard\nAnd you know I I don't know maybe I'm\nMaybe I'm just a nicer more generous person than you are maybe about uh that I think that you know but I but sometimes it is kind of awkward\nYou know tipping again for just like what is normally and what we should be considered like just part of the experience like somebody handing you a napkin\n[laughter] so I think here's ten percent ... instead of having them after ... let me just use the cash that you're expecting me to be joined by ... something like that [noise]\nAll right let me tell you something over the years of epson printers they have earned my trust which is why I'm a committed user and you'll see what I mean you have to experience the economical apps and ego tank forty seven fifty it's a fantastic wireless all in one corner love this friend is my printer choice\nOr for a couple of reasons well first of all it's cartridge free don't you hate buying printer ink cartridges oh my gosh what's in there anyway golden no it's colored IQ\nBut the epson ego taint forty seven fifties cartridge free comes with up to two years of AIG right in the box that's enough to print up to eleven thousand color pages that the equivalent of thirty a cartridge that's now if I were to run to the store and buy thirty cartridge that's yeah do the math it would cost me about Fifteen hundred dollars\nWas ego take you easily refill the printers ink tank and second\nThe ego tank of the compact space saving printer that is truly cartridge free and it's available everywhere\nYou can learn more right now epson dot com slash eco tank Kim unless ISI O.

what I have\nAnd also now the ex are so is the acts are really truly worth the money it's actually cheap seven hundred and forty nine dollars I Know you're you're saying the Kim seven hundred and forty nine dollars is really expensive for our phone well not when you compare it to like eleven hundred for the latest I thought\nAnyway just last week talking more about that but I really love to hear from you this show one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty for once again is the way to join us\nAnd then there's Andrew been skiing the Kim commando show man cave hello there Andrew Kim\nWe're going to start with Karen and she is in spring grove Pennsylvania she lives spring\nGrowth that sounds like a nice place to live doesn't it doesn't really horrible place I live in spring grows right next to a garbage town Pennsylvania which is not very well populated not at all she uh she lives in rural areas\nAnd she's thinking about switching cell phone providers currently she has ... and for home wireless 'cause she was in rural and she has it for her so even while\nThe company that she was thinking about switching to uses the horizon towers so she's like oh well they use all the same stuff is going to be all the same kind of action and then she went [noise] what if it is what if it's worth\nIt if it's where I Need to call him and it's so frustrating\nThough isn't it I mean when you don't have a decent connection in your house I mean you know we just talked about you buy a new house right now is a lot of millennials especially millennials are you a millennial here and I know I think I missed it by yeah you're right on the edge is that a lot of millennials won't be won't buy a new home if it\nDoesn't have say a fiber optic next I mean that is now requirements like you know two and a half bathrooms three bedroom [laughter] enough fiber connection so that this way\nYou don't have to worry about what's going on so I don't care and you don't have all bars in all places that's what I'm hearing\nPad is correct\nAnd there's no way that you want to move to the big city\nOr no no we're going to stay right here okay so so when you complained of arise and what did they say\n[noise] um\nThey really can't get many answer I've been I've been within twenty twelve okay\nBut the past month is just so slow here that the Internet's almost useless [noise] so I'm looking at switching to Comcast for my Internet and then can't can't say well we also have noble and so I thought well that might be a great don't service but\nI'm concerned that maybe it won't be because they do use the same price and towers and would switch between pricing towers and Comcast hot spot you know I don't know\nI I don't I don't know if I Lincoln switching between the hot spots um [noise] you you know what you okay ... you know which you could possibly get and I don't know ... varieties and you know would give you a deal on or sometimes if you complain loud enough you get it for free\nIs that you may be able to get a little what's called a fence do self or your house\nAnd so it's kind of like a repeat or off of the cell tower itself\nAnd but the thing with the ... and this is why I kinda went and I don't know about the Comcast is that is Comcast\nIs using other Santo sell to increase your reception and you're in bars I don't know if I like that either um so my first recommendation we go\nAnd in your bars I don't know if I like that either\nUm so my first recommendation we go back to arise in and say listen I Need to have some type of a micro cell or something that you can I can put inside my house\nThat will repeat the signal from the tower that you have nearest may so I get a stronger signal and then they'll say no we can't do that because you're only talking to a rap\nBut if you get up into a manager a supervisor level and explain to them that you're paying for the service and you're not getting everything that they promised sometimes you can get it for free if not that it's like a hundred maybe two hundred bucks okay\nOkay now let's talk a little bit about the cell phone towers is that even though like for rising and AT and T and Comcast or maybe they can share cell towers\nThey often use different frequencies in technologies so they're not actually sharing the hardware on the tower makes sense\nOkay um and they're usually own now the towers are owned by a leasing company not even by the provider anymore because the providers figured out that they could sell\nThe uh the towers and they don't have to carry that debt and they can make more money\nSo the thing that you couldn't go back to Comcast with say you know which frequency is Comcast on the tower and how does that compare of arrives in so that this is not that you're going to know what all this means but just this way if the numbers are different than you know that that it should be different of that one service might be better\nAnd I and Comcast senses the cable companies some of this band with maybe coming off the cable to now there is hope on the horizon\nAnd the hope on the horizon is five gee and it's supposed to get better for all of us that are having cell phone problems um because basically you're talking on for gee you're talking about one gig in bed or per second speed versus\nOn five gee you're talking about multiple database and so you know couple of solutions that you might want to try before you just dumped ... do you think you could call ask one of your neighbors if they have Comcast\n[noise] I could try that we don't have real real close neighbor from afraid of 'em [laughter] I knew that we know but um [noise] but I could try that\nBecause sometimes you know and and of course you know they may say it's great and then you get it and then you're mileage made very right and she was good you know here's where I'm at you know what you might want to do\nIs explain to Comcast what the problem is have Comcast to turn turn on the line you try it for a couple of days see how it works explain\nTo them I don't want to sign a long term contract right now I Want to be able to at least ten and put my tone or see what I'm getting\nAnd you don't let me tell you something the cable companies are struggling right now they'll do anything to keep occurring customers to get a customer so again you might have to escalate this little bit up higher but it's definitely something that you might want to take a look at doing just having a conversation and Karen thank you so much for your call Gary in South bend hello there Gary
