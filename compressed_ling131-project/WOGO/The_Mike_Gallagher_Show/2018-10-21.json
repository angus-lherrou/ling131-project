I Believe that George\nSoros and Jim Wallace in Sojourners who again they've taken a I mean the Sojourners and evangelical left has taken a sharp left this is not the left\nOf the eighties or the nineties and so they've gotten to people like John Case people wonder what happened to John Case like that's what happened in ... and various\nYes when ... began to think what's happening to my church in life that suddenly the social justice agenda that defined by the lap followed the money that's uh\nAnd why is that suddenly the social justice agenda that defined by the lab followed them money that's what we learn sad but true\nUh where you know sorrow to its funding Al Gore John Kerry for president they lost that was a meeting or why do we do we need that faith narrative and it had a wicked kind of a lens tactic and answer it began funding groups like\nSojourners to literally\nTeach the last ... cherry pick a few Bible word\nIt sound like minister ministers and he uses busy you know our mall an American shift ... they don't understand and so um it's a clever tactic and we just need to either said the ... and and it's and it's\nGot well about ...\nLook ... let me let me say this and this people are gonna think this sounds a ridiculous some all thinking but I don't because I I Know\nThe story and I've done the research when the church and Germany was infiltrated by the national socialists okay they were very clever they understood\nThat if we can work with people who are biblical he is not illiterate I\nDon't know the Bible particularly well we can sell them whatever we want to sell them\nThe same thing is happening when in America George Soros funded people they throw phrases out there you just said they they grab a Bible verse like oh we're supposed to welcome the alien blah blah blah and people say on that of course means open borders and I say wait a second\nThat's insane that doesn't mean open borders that means we're supposed to be loving and we're supposed to welcome the alien it doesn't mean we're supposed to change national policy so that no American is safe and we don't know who's coming into our country and we don't know where a country begins and ends to make that leap is lunacy but people\nCan be persuaded because they don't really know what the scripture teachers or they don't have a sophisticated understanding of how you marry with the Bible says to public policy they just\nUse these catch words like welcome the ill units that simple doesn't a Bible say welcome the audience what George Soros has done and it is really dangerous and if you and if you think that the church\nCannot be taken over in America and that the government can't be taken over in this way\nI just have to point to the Nineteen thirties long before anybody was talking about death camps or the Holocaust\nThe German church was saying uh hey you know what we can work with um with the national socialist and the national socialist pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed until the church got infiltrated and that is effectively\nWhat has happened to many parts of the American church the but the fact that you've done the research Kelly now people want to find out more about this is there any place they can do with her website\nYes yeah we we we\nCreated some American eating and ... with an ass American even ... dot com and there's

stuff and\nPeople need to understand this is real they they can look it up they can look into it\nAnd people have on thinking we as I just said with regard to you know welcome the alien ... you think wait a second you're grabbing one scripture averse and you're saying that you can beat people over the head and say that we shouldn't have borders and we should change our policies were based on one scriptures\nThat is insanity I mean it's no different than findings ... reverse that promotes slavery I mean you know you're ... you can't you can't do that you have to try to understand what is the scripture teach and so of course we are supposed to be welcoming\nBut it doesn't mean that we're supposed to change or national policies in so Soros 'em and Jim Wallace and others have very\nUh cynically in some cases in in ... case it is totally cynically and Wallace his case ah I I think it might be well meaning lately but ignorant Lee has has twisted the scriptures and people have\nSwallowed it I have many dear friends that have swallowed this stuff\nAnd and they've decided that you know they need to vote for Elizabeth Warren or they need to vote for here he know or they

from Texas I'm Talking to my friend Kelly Monroe cool Burke uh Kelly before I forget you know here we are talking about\nUm young people being led astray or by George George Soros funded groups a lot of these groups claim to be a evangelicals they're really a socialist\nVeering toward secularist left these and it's disturbing so I Want to put it in a good word before we continue this conversation some people know that I'm always talking about Hillsdale College\nIn Michigan why because they are doing just the opposite they teach young people or what it means to believe in American style self government and liberty or it teaches kids what is good and beautiful and true that's the whole point of education and they're doing it there but the reason I bring them up\nIs because they're also trying to do this they're committed their president the or the president Hillsdale College my friend Dr Larry aren't\nAh they're all committed to reaching beyond\nUm the ... walls of Hillsdale\nTo reach everybody in America so we've got a website ma taxes for Hillsdale dot com if you go to my taxes for Hillsdale dot com\nYou can find out all the stuff that they want to do for you they're

Goldberg um the website that you have set up is American evangelicals dot\nCom um do you think that this election hangs in the balance because evangelicals are being swayed in this direction\nI Do have nearly ... million even calico don't even vote and I think it I could hear\nDying already dead and then having not voting but I Can't imagine any other reason given what's in the hour and a and so this is why it's so dire and these guys are trying to break up the evangelical why\nCan vote for that party Republican platform right and not be on President Trump the future of the country but that we're talking about\nBeyond a President Trump is the future of the country but that we're talking about and so that reads and sorrows and others Obama even what funding through the state department\nOr some faith groups to see the mass migration was that it was quickly connected it to have to come out or registration right and so this is about\nPower at period and a sadly open society foundation is at twenty five billion dollar foundation funding all this\nA lot of this stuff around the world America it's one of dozens of countries what is that is undermining and demoralizing so we need to wake up to what Jesus said the ... and stuff\nAnd we need to vote and we need to bring our white friends with us\nIt's it's really amazing I you know I speak all around the country and I and I often say that if you were ever tempted not to vote or to say politics is not for me that Christian in politics don't mix\nThat is bad theology is bad it's not typical if the Bible said that I'd be screaming about it on this program because it's important to do with the Bible says but the Bible doesn't say that people\nSince the beginning of time at ... understood scripture so it's really important that you take the responsibility to understand what it says and does and doesn't say and I really think that a lot of sweet young people have been swayed in poll\nLeft towards you know hashtags social justice because they missed understand what it says of course we're supposed to be compassionate but the question is how\nAnd I I have to say with Kanye West or you know appearing to praise this president for his policies a lot of young people are thinking\nYou know what maybe we have been getting it wrong maybe Donald Trump's policies are compassionate may be the policies of the people who talk about compassion are not compassionate and I really think\nWe have to think for ourselves you can't just when somebody says that we believe in compassion we believe in helping the poor doesn't mean they're doing it and this is the thing is that if you want to destroy your future and if you don't want to help the poor and then you float along with the socialist tied but the fact that evangelicals are being very cynically drawn into this\nUh ... it's just so good to have you wound up to wake people up to understand that a huge effort has been made it's been going on since the Obama administration and before two thousand and eight in two thousand and twelve\nOr I mean you know that for a fact don't you\nI Do and I think it's time for all Americans to\nLook past words like progress that actually read grass and compassion let's not compassion we have to Jesus said you know that for you know the tree by the fruit and so American evangelicals dot com we make tried to make

ridiculous Elizabeth Warren side show very glad to comment on that uh let me just tell you that those people\nWho are saying that the reason for the budget increase the budget deficit increase is the tax cuts are partisan hacks it's not true how do I know it's not true\nBecause revenues year over year at the same time that the budget deficit went up revenues went up they didn't go down the increase they increase slightly but ah my source for this is a\nNot only government figures but the New York times and the Treasury Department the New York times\nThey um they report that as a matter of fact the\nTreasury reported that federal revenues rose by huge zero point four percent\nFrom the two thousand and Seventeen fiscal year to the two thousand Eighteen fiscal year and uh they view that a treasury is assigned the tax cuts are paying for themselves and the New York times takes issue with that because they say well\nThe growth in revenues would have been even greater without the tax cuts okay they might be right that the growth in revenue would have been greater but the growth in revenue is still grows and revenue we're taking in more money\nThe problem\nWe have is we are spending too much and I actually think President Trump did a good thing and advising the cabinet that he expects every federal department to cut at least five percent and acknowledge that we should do

I'm Sorry I Will be moving into the executive suite CEO love to know what are your expectations for Airbus under the new leadership\nWhat first of all I'd like to say it is being a great news for all of us to hear that you almost being nominated I'll tell you it's great to know that that would be that made it in the governance of the company\nThat we can project office in the coming\nYou know six months with that warm during okay who's going to be the next year it's already done it since late and they did it and you see a a is now working on you know the nomination of all the different succession the or the you know a wave of succession can be a to be made and\nThis is going to happen in the coming months um I don't see and\nWe don't really expect any big changes in terms of vision we will continue to work on the uh by an animal beneath the will continue to work on you know the ... uh all the other ... sorry like the kind of acts you know that we we love of the\nBuilding prototypes demonstrators\nSo we're building now an electrified the one ... which is a chill your member of a it's a foreign Jeanette crops lower their crops and basically we planning to put one electrical engine out of the four engine and\n[laughter] yeah I we had somebody on last week or two weeks ago Patti Dr ... Anderson from Emory rental on the show with us and we were talking about the electric airplanes and coming and that's good news I mean essentially it's good fuel savings and obviously one of the four engine it's it's completely different from the future\nAnd I think it's important for us in the industry to demonstrate things I've learned a lesson from that I Know that can be ready for the next generation so this is what we're doing and you're talking about a banana mobility and flying drones and the\n... of a it is also the importance to add this to be top of what's going to happen in terms of atrophy controlled at traffic management because\nYeah because there's all sorts of questions now I mean people are flying drones all around the world I ... in the U.S last year I mean do already had more than one million officially registered whereas in about three million being shipped from shops to individual is hot so that that you that there's a huge number of\nYou know flying machines are violent at some point in time you will need to\nPut some regulation into all of this and therefore we had a boss won't be off of those and you can\nActually link France not necessarily right next time I Would lie for you to talk about the Eighteen twenty and a lot of talk about that on their side of the Atlantic down south to has committed to buy a large number of this aircraft we've heard great things about ... let's say the ... about his plane\nYeah no it's great used to have\nThose on both you know I mean not chosen definitely the products what I can I say uh that twenty but in particular they're three Twenty one to three Twenty one is a machine you had a lot I mean it takes them two hundred and forty four pack a but it has the economy cut a single crop and what's unique about\nThe three twenty line is that we did\nIn the long range version as well so remember we've just been talking about the three fifty nine hundred you at all but we all throughout stretching to arrange overall smaller\nThan what you like the three Twenty one for all of it's not done airlines can fly I think a lot of that cropped across the Atlantic ocean and come actually fairly deep into
