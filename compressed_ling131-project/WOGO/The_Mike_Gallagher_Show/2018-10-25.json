bad I'm come in and dilemma what's the dilemma let me straight\nOh good how are you John [laughter] not too bad I'm kind of in a dilemma what's the dilemma let me straighten out a\nWhile I'm trying to figure out addicts specifically which Democrats are running on open borders because I care a lot of talk about it but you I only hear about it from a counterpoint or\nOr which ones are running on that let me share with you that I'm trying to figure out what's going to exactly or like saying you know let 'em run free let 'em run ... want to know that ain't right ...\nYeah let me let me answer you because there was an analysis I was just reading from the Associated Press and it ran on Fox News\nHeadlines Democrats are remaining silent on the issue of the caravan of thousands of immigrants on the march from Central America and unwilling to get into any kind of a debate with President Trump the terms are just weeks away the the answer\nEither way on him to step up and they're waiting on him to step\nUp the ... the answer John is that the Democrats are saying a word of condemnation of the thousands and thousands of illegals you're heading towards the border the answer is they don't condemn that because it's it's it's it's an implicit least supported\nFind me a Democrat and you know maybe the easiest things to answer your question with a question which Democrat\nIs expressing concern and fear and worry anxiety um over the thousands of illegal short headed towards our border name one\nThey want because they are in favor of open borders they've all set it in various ways and and sometimes you say something by your refusal to step up you're talking about stepping up John\nHow about a Democrat stepping up against the kind of violence we've seen directed towards\nMitch McConnell in restaurants and the mob mentality Boulder thrown through a a house majority leader Kevin McCarthy his office in Bakersfield, California how about some condemnation none of what we've heard is getting Republicans faces go after them create a scene\nCreate a crowd that's that's your answer they are not um uh expressing the will of the people in concerns and and and frustrations\nOver this uh this angry band of people heading our way eight hundred six five five Mike will your next how you doing will\nUndo all make it really thing\nThat I haven't heard a lot about it and it's a little bit frustrating is where does it say it in our constitution and our laws whatever that we have to pay benefits\nTo people who are here illegally [laughter] I mean ... it's just it's almost like people assume that well when they get here it doesn't matter if they're here illegally and I were given benefits or why don't we\nJust you wait a minute what's wrong with you you mean you don't want to give in state tuition benefits to illegal you mean you don't want to give drivers licenses to illegal you mean you don't want to give free health care to illegals what are you a racist well\nWhat are you mean honest to goodness you're right where where in the world does it say we should be given folks who come to this country illegally and tried to steal residency and that's

New York which is a leafy suburb north of New York city\nUh they've lived there for a number of years or to the home of Iraq and Michelle Obama in Washington DC they have not lived there for a long time that's post presidency and of course this coming on the heels of a package of bomb package being sent\nReportedly to the home of George Soros who is the billionaire liberal activists\nI'm who funds a lot of anti conservative causes and ah and movements or this is a district\nConservative causes and ah and movements or this is a disturbing story um it is evil it's wrong and it it just has no political story a component to it it just doesn't\nGallagher horses\nAre show abroad to you in part by citizens for truth in drug pricing this is a very very big story this drug pricing thing and I'm really really excited about the way that we are going to be able to partner rejected Frank Luntz\nThe uh the iconic pollster a little bit later this hour eighty percent of Americans think drug prices around reasonably high the American people know that the drug makers are putting profits in many cases ahead of patients\nWe spend about forty percent more on prescription drugs then the Canadians do our medication and are prescription drug costs just keep sky rocketing farmer spent more money on lobbying than every other industry in America over a hundred and Seventy one million dollars worth of influence by way of lobbying the American people believe the system is rigged\nAnd read because of the big drug makers undue influence with their lobbying dollars the overwhelming majority of people think drug pricing is unfair and that the greed of the American drug makers is unchecked\nThe monopoly pricing power the drug makers can only be countered by action taken in Congress drug makers have to be held accountable Americans want that accountability in drug pricing\nAnd we want Congress to take action enough is enough\nIs what we hear in the polls and we'll get that confirmed with great Frank Luntz a little bit later this hour [noise] it's time to hold the drug makers accountable for patients ahead of profits they have their lobbyist there are hundreds of millions but we have our voices are stories are votes time to end the drug makers monopoly pricing power stop them from overcharging the American people it's time once\nAnd for all to put patients ahead of profits enough is enough [noise] freaking\nNow on the Mike Gallagher show\nABC is reporting suspicious packages haven't found that the homes of the Clintons and the Obamas as well as CNN in New York City this morning a potentially workable explosive device was founded the ... home of former President Clinton and former secretary of State Hillary Clinton\nA meantime a suspicious package was also discovered at former President Obama's home in Washington DC the secret service released a statement saying that the Obamas I did not receive the packages nor were they at risk of receiving them and after Kennedy just after ten am eastern\nThe NYPD bomb squad responded to a suspicious package inside the time Warner center mail room in New York City\nWhat appears to be a metal pipe with wires was discovered floors above and below the mail room are being evacuated Time Warner center is of course\nUh the home to CNN in New York City so we are watching this developing story and keeping you posted let's get your reaction to all of it at eight hundred six five five Michael start with Joe Hi Joe you're first up welcome to Philadelphia here on the Mike Gallagher show how are you\nI'm doing great thanks how are you I'm doing great sure appreciate your call today is\nWith these all these devices are being sent I'm Ninety nine percent sure there are being sent by Democrats um [noise] and the reason I say that one of the reasons is everything is trending towards Republicans right now\nI'm just you know they tried that Kevin thing they've tried a ... a president President Trump nothing's working\nAnd now with the caravan that's also um [noise] it's also helping Republicans and uh so I'm I'm almost positive it's Democrats are doing this is part of their October surprise\nThey were alive they ran out of other things and this is this what they do\nI let me respond because I have to disagree with who strongly and let me tell you why and I and I and I understand your cynicism I really do I ... I'm cynical too and I and I recognize that\nExperience you know I watch everything I watch CNN which all the channels\nYeah yeah we all do but let me respond I think it's a mistake to try to say the Democrats are behind this any more than it it's a mistake to stay away from my area where I Know and you're entitled to your opinion I just think it's a big mistake and let me tell you why we're contributing to this um\nSort of violent back and forth where where we're we're trying to politicize weaponize rather political disagreement and and I we shouldn't do that we just shouldn't again I respect your cynicism and I get it\nUm but to say well this looks like a came from the Democrats or I suspect that came from the ... if we have no idea who it's coming from\nYou know I mean you could theorize that this is from Democrat to slant who's trying to change the narrative or it is some evil maniac who hates Democrats and have CNN and is trying to just send them a message\nAt ... potentially do them harm\nWe should rise above that we shouldn't say well this is a political this is a political story no I I\nDidn't say well this is a political this is a political story\nNo I I think that's a big big mistake now we don't know a show all I'm asking is for um some calm and we should be reasonable and we should not speculate because in speculating um you know where that goes\nThat could that could that could absolutely take us down a very dangerous path\nUm and then frankly if let's just go let's go theoretically down that rabbit hole let's say some\nRabbit violent um you know Republican is arrested well then the Democrats are going to come back and they're going to say see what people like Mike Gallagher and his colors and his listeners sat on the radio they blame it on us they tried to blend ... there's no there's nothing to gain by that we should we should be calm and we should\nBe paying attention and we should uh we should wait to see when the facts are revealed speculation to me is not going to be\nVery helpful Tammy your next to Tammy how are you today [noise] I like how are you I'm doing great thanks for calling\n\nThanks for joining us what's what's on your mind yeah Tammy Hi\nOkay All right I'm so sorry um I I don't I understand why you're trying to be I Want to wait it out to get your hey what's going on just to see it is I don't blame anyone but I truly feel it in my heart before that caller called that\nIt is it's some it's the Democratic party collateral damage a net net ... a lot of the ... you know they don't care what they do they don't care if they're caught\nYou know if that turns out to be a Democrat what do they have nothing we can\nJust throw everything against the wall and see what six again yeah yeah yeah well get don't get me wrong I get I get the cynical reaction you're having I get the cynical reaction of the last caller but as you said we're reasonable people were the adults in the room\nAnd we're not going to we're not going to speculate on me I mean all of us we should be the adults and we should be the people who say we're going to listen we're going to find out what the facts are\nAnd we're going to go from there hey portions are show brought to you by our friends at a job creators network ... you know we know what's on the ballot in November the sex and when we can stick to political issues and when we should stick to political differences\nJobs are on the ballot the tax savings or on the ballot the American economy is on the ballot America's great comeback is on the ballot\nYou want to be active you want to be involved let's not speculate let's do something tangible good tax cuts worked dot com we make it so easy for you to do your part make calls sent me emails text\nKnock on doors ticket neighbor to the polls go to tax cuts work dot com you can do your part let's not get out and work and let's not get outsmart it unless I make mistakes be proactive\nTax cuts work dot com today\nThis is Mike Gallagher\nFighting for what's right here Roger W O O G o\nFinally a beautiful toothbrush that is keeping my teeth nice and clean and\nFresh up to Ninety percent of us do not brush with a full two minutes or we don't clean evenly that's why I'm loving the quick story quip\nQ.

when you hear me movies on the radio and she sounds so sweet she is so sweet I mean that just tell the whole family you know you don't find that in other places\nNumber two is it really angers people when I'm cleaning up the language here she is the idea that they have to pay two or three times more what a Canadian pays or what a bread or French German person\nTo pay two or three times more what a Canadian page or what a bread or French German person base because of our meticulous drug pricing answered\nIt hits them off when they watch all of these ads these ridiculous sixty second ads\nAnd asked to be careful because I Know that they they run on your favorite programs and often on your radio shows but it doesn't make consumers happy when they're paying two or three times what foreigners pay and they're watching these ads that they know\nCost a significant amount of money and they've got all these side effects and they're kind of frightening and badly produce\nAds lobbying high prices it it is actually after\nUh how much people take home in their pay is the number two most important issue facing America today and Trump is talking about it and credit to him for doing\nSo now he's bringing it to the forefront and that's why I'm so intrigued by it and I I Want to bring this to the attention of our listeners because I'm surprised to learn through your polling and the and the conversations you've had with ordinary Americans the drug pricing is a top legislative priority of Americans that's ahead of everything else does that surprise you Frank\nIt surprised me because it should it because I'm now once you get to the fifty average individual begins to take a medication regularly at about the age of fifty and I don't know how old you are\nI'm but I Know that if the ...

happening in the suburbs it's happening to to upper middle class families and wealthy families and at this point all of us know someone\nWho is addicted to some sort of opioid and yet the pharmaceutical companies don't seem to be doing anything about it so you take all of those issues and this is so easy\nOr the president is talking about it the vice president's talking about it not as many congressional and senatorial Republicans are talking about it and I think it's a mistake\nBecause it is the number one or two issue among people over age fifty\nIt's a huge issue and I'm Glad

C.\nAnd there are reports that a package was sent to the time Warner's Senate which is where CNN is headquartered in that building is being evacuated to get an idea of where and when you go with an investigation like this\nAnd how you sort of when things seem to be spinning out of control we're really really privileged to have one of the finest law enforcement professionals\nIt professionals in American history quite frankly on the line with us now he is the former New York city police commissioner actually the longest ever serving a New York city police commissioner as well as many other uh an incredible positions he's held in law enforcement gives me a great deal of pressure welcome commissioner Ray Kelly ... thanks for taking a few minutes this morning\nFrankly is a good way to get back to those kind of a lot\nWell it it you know it has the edit virtue of being true I I Am curious you know we're seeing that the the FBI is investigating the secret service is investigating and the finest police department in the world\nThe NYPD how do you get when you're in charge the NYPD and you have to work with other massive agencies like this how do we even begin the logistics of a coordinated effort like this\nWell there is a structure in place during a terrorist\nSix of a coordinated effort like this\nWell there is a structure in place because the joint terrorism task force which is essentially an FBI entity that has about a hundred and twenty NYPD investigators in it were closer together they've worked together and every day this type situation would be handled ...\nBy the NYPD they have the bomb squad there on the ground\nThe federal government just wouldn't have these types of resources available you know all over the all of the country so this will be initially as far as the bottom is concerned the NYPD a affair or they have a terrific bomb squad that probably had more experience and the bomb squad\nOr in the country what they what they doing now is obviously assessing the device\nItself bill they've already I'm sure X. rated\n... is a possibility with actors devices of using something called up awarded disrupt the to\nSort of a do it this is a is this a NATO or make certain that will go off and it they will hate this device whatever it is to in a self contained vehicle it's a big um harden truck\nThat is is built specifically to transport bomb they'll take this device and you know bring it to the Rodman neck\nPolice firing range where it will be detonated but of course they want to gather as much evidence as possible before that happened so it looks like it was in a pretty ordinary envelope looks that gets a pipe bomb obviously they want to get\nTo your friends are the envelope as possible and want to get DNA is somebody actually lick the envelope ... those sorts of things or how to be addressed before the\nThat they should take place but it's done very very carefully of course\nA Jew final questions and then I Know everyone's talking at you and I'll let you go but uh I'm being inundated with rumor after room or a unproven fact after unproven fact\nCallers are emailing me or or college or calling people are emailing me about reports of a a suspicious package tend to the White House as well when form that's not true there were reports that a suspicious package was sent to Governor Cuomo this morning where we understand that's not true how difficult does it make of the next few hours\nWhen you have all these rumors flying around which seemed to spread a lot faster and the social media area than they did Eighteen years ago\nYeah right the world has changed and there's a lot more information out there uh yeah it's difficult to have to respond to the ones that have some credibility to the I think it's important for public buildings\nAnd almost all of them have they caught a cold to do it\nTo conduct a search of the building to say if there's any suspicious packages they sit with public ... locations train stations that sort of thing I'm I'm sure a lot of this is going on but it's sort of a self help of initiative that has to take place look in your own space to see if there's anything in that uh\nThat around the suspicion but you write a law enforcement these days is Aaron David Miller copycat calls or people who just want to be a disruptive and it's a it is it takes a lot of time and effort\nTo dispel is saying\nAnd finally commissioner I'm a Jew or we would you be pretty certain not that you're involved in this investigation but if the facts are true that they were similar packages sent to the Obamas the Clintons and to CNN um is there any doubt in your view that this is a\nCoordinated effort by someone or some group\nI think it depends on the device itself I'm sure a bomb squad in Westchester in in uh Washington D.

more\nDifficult um but that being said I I Would urge people don't speculate rent\nDon't blame don't you know ... you know I I Know the political arena today will go hog water wild on\nThey already are you you did you hear people rushing to blame or either the Democrats are the Republicans for not certainly not terrorists\nHonestly fried that doesn't help anybody [noise] you know what\nWe need to find out who did it well number one number two if the devices or will they need to prosecute that person to the next to the fullest extent of the law in second example for others that may do this I'm the one they're going to get caught until you're going to go to prison\nFor over ... this is attempted murder these things are real\n... and we're also seeing apparently the device that were sent to CNN was addressed to former CIA director\nJohn Brennan I'm with that that that the caviar you gave if these things are real and people are just tuning in is the my Gallagher show him Frank Marino sitting in for my Gallagher from New York City while my traveling this hour\nFormer New York city police commissioner Bernard Carrick a free kind enough to join us for a few minutes this hour\nIf these things are not real let's say there are some hoax a explosive devices what does that mean in terms of the investigation and what does that mean in terms of the likely perpetrator or perpetrators and what does that mean in terms of what sort of criminal penalties he's facing\nWhile the criminal the criminal penalties will be there for him to of course you know these devices are real explosive devices that it can be charged with attempted murder 'em in in some capacity I Would imagine I'm a plus all the you know the the transportation mail stuff or you know the federal charges\nIf they're not we'll ah they're still going to be a federal consequences of criminal consequence so um you know but like I said\nEverybody should let lawn course job let them conductor investigation\nDon't do this blame game and and all that nonsense that people are going um you know step back take a step back put politics aside for the day and you light in in a court function of locating finding the people responsible doing this\n[laughter] and then finally commissioner I also why we have you on the line I Can't resist taking advantage of your expertise in your experience having worked in a Saudi Arabia or we've all been following the coverage and the investigation into the disappearance and death of\n... um apparently the Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammed bin Salman today a sad that this was a killing was a crime\nTo all Saudis and cold and\nUnjustifiable a ... you know ... pardon me commissioner for being flipping but this is ... reminds me of a child who killed his parents and then complains about the fact that he's an orphan I I mean if this guy wasn't responsible who was\nUm you know frankly I I wrote a piece or you know when this happened I predicted\nYou know what happened I was a hundred percent right you don't have four\nMen from his intelligence bureau aside to his protect the detail that goes on a mission like this and basically kills a guy named the lights and uh you know the numbers of cuts up the body gets rid of it\nUm without his authorization there is no way anybody that's lived or worked in that arena\nThose guys wouldn't\nGo to the bathroom without getting authorization they're not going to go on some secret covert mission to eliminate some reporter that the government to light and not tell the guy that they report directly to that's not happening so people are naive\nTo think otherwise um then listen as far as the crown prince of what he's saying which is supposed to say you know he got caught got caught they're gonna have to deal with it\nUm the bad thing for us is the president's gonna have to deal with is in there and fortunately we're in a position where Saudi Arabia is sort of the lynchpin to Middle East peace\nDealing with the Iranian problem dealing with counter terrorism um oil reserve issues I mean\nYou can't just say we're gonna stop talking to the salaries you know for these political leaders of the Washington that's out there spewing that garbage they know behind that political ran that\nYou can't just stop talking to the Saudis and the king's son the crown prince the number two in the country is not going to step down\nThat's not going to happen so get over it figure out what you're going to do about it and move on\nBecause you know it's a you're gonna have to deal with them and some lawyers\nWell commissioner
