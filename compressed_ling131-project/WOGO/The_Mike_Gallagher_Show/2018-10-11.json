I'm Sorry if you want me to back off from you know being\nWorried about something are concerned I Can't because I Want to win on November the ...

ballot on November ... not Hillary but her party and believe me I don't want to get any I don't want anything to get a new way of sending Democrats packing on November the ...\nSo that was my genuine heartfelt reaction to Nikki Haley's decision to make this announcement when she did now let's see if I can find somebody who uh was upset with me as reflected in a lot of those emails I got after ... during the during the after the show yesterday here is Melanie Melanie welcome how are you today\n[noise] Hey Mike how are you I'm good thanks for calling\nJust wanted to say first you know I'm a supporter of your um you know you had it lost me as a listener but I was disappointed when you get ... immediately went to a less\nThat's an hour but I was disappointed when you get your day that you immediately went to a less tactic of thinking the worst about Haley and saying that she thought she was anonymous in that New York article\nIn the wires that all I I was not a left tactics\nBecause they immediately went to go to the to the the assumption that Trump has done something wrong and I think\nThey really are up and why what did I see yeah like you said it's OK I'm Sorry go ahead and finish my thought oh go ahead\nOr the left uses a tactic immediately go on to that Trump has done something wrong I think that the right can at times do the same thing and immediately counter assumption that someone has done something that when we want to try and support chop we find a reason to them so at this person did something like that\nWell again there's nothing I said within a million miles to give anybody indication of I bought anything negatively about probably about President Trump president you misunderstand what I'm saying\nOkay well let me ask let me ask you this quickly 'cause I got a I've got two minutes and I want to lose your I Want to get your I Want to pick your brain\nDo you remember who gave the Republican response to the president's first date of the union it was Nikki Haley do you remember what she said let me quote\nShe said during the anxious times it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angry as voices we must resist the temptation\nAre we ... no one who's willing to work hard abide by our laws and love our tradition should ever feel unwelcome in this country and then in an interview\nWith NBC as a follow up Nikki Haley specified who she was the one who delivered those words as the Republican response to presidents President Trump's first day of the union she specify that it was Donald Trump\nWho was one of the angry as voices that she was condemning she I remember that Melanie and I suspect with all due respect maybe you don't\nKnow I I Do that I Do like where I'm coming from is I also suspect it something else was going on yeah I'm a follower cue and on I think I I Do read and research thing\nAnd you know what they're saying you know when you're watching the night you\nKnow what they're saying yes I Do yeah well my concern yesterday where I was an angry I I was disappointed in year is that with no evidence you would come on up to a radio station that you have a loud voice in this country right and put forward the conspiracy I'm In a statement about ...\nBut with all due respect I just gave you evidence I just reminded you know whatever that Nikki Haley in those she is that's the one that or it's an honor\nAdded and you know that's how I ... and you know that's not what I said I didn't say I know she's the one who wrote the anonymous article that you're putting we all know have your foot in a while there is a serious evidence she bash\nHair she bash the president at a time when he needed her support he stood she stood there is the Republican response to his first date of the union and bashed him and then she bad even follow up interviews and so frankly Melanie\nAgain if you got to think for yourself you got to be able to say okay for\nMy well here I show here some of that she said lately about ... and I pray are they are good friend I'm praying that can somewhat skeptical and I and I pray and I'm and I'm and I'm praying that right and then and I and all I can give her up in it

you need to do you know where you need to go is the polls you need to vote because that's where the power is citizen screaming and people in a restaurant or harassing a broadcaster it's it's putting Republicans in office so that the grown ups are in charge so we can have the policies of this enormously successful administrators should continue\nThat's why I was upset about Nikki Haley resigning and that a big announcement yesterday I got I got some pushback on that that's okay I don't mind that occasional push back we're going to talk to a GOP strategist in South Carolina ship ... who's gonna sky put this next find out what's behind it stick around\nFighting for what's right six eighty W O O G o\nIt's a real honor to tell you about relief factor at a regular basis one of my favorite

longer you don't need to take every day in New exercise\nAnd get your sleep and just like your body your car performs best when it's properly cared for by Curtis the auto in trucks center\nWrong and um she does have a long term game here I doubt very seriously that she's finished in politics everybody can take a deep breath or she made it very clear she's not challenging Trump and twenty seven twenty twenty\nI'm but I'm like as you well know\nI'm running for president cheap right and ... and you've got to have a source of income with your family to understand\nMe how this will be taken care of when you're\n... and you got to have a source of income with your family too and the family has to be taken care of when you're on the campaign trail and you gotta you gotta be able to provide for your family but chip is it it was hard but one thing that's hard for me to shake off\nAnd this is why I'm I'm absolutely uh I I'm not going to back down from from being a little bit cynical of the time of the timing of this you know people forget she gave the Republican response to his first state of the union and it was pretty scary that she was critical of him\nShe confirmed that she felt that he was the uh you know the angry his voice in the room\nAnd we have to welcome immigrants and all of that she was not on board now many say she's come she's she's certainly come a long way and she's come around on the issue of Donald Trump but I always have this deep cynicism and suspicion of people\nWho were against the president early on at West he was a candidate ... you know what I mean it always kind of bothered me the way she ... she spoke out against it\nWell a lot of people that spoke out against Donald Trump that have come around I mean Lindsey Graham certainly a good example of that as well you're so um well she had a pretty tough spot I'm the president a and solve his advisors take a harder line that maybe some some with life into 'em\nAnd she's kind of been in that tenuous rolling the UN and you know and I I think you got a I think he just got up maybe maybe it'd be OK if we all want so cynical\nOh trust me but but you know what they read it out of us on\nEvery single day when you turn on the TV or you pick up a paper you look on line and you see the garbage when you see Hillary Clinton bragging about the fact that it's impossible it's impossible to be civil\nTowards Republicans until the Democrats take control of the house and the Senate how are you not cynical at a time like this chip chip\nSet chocolate chip fell gulls are gas piece of public affairs media relations strategist or South Carolina no south ... South Carolina politics quite well how about Senator Lindsey Graham boy he has emerged as the man of the hour and many people believe that we're not for his passionate\nFiery um monologue his his soliloquy from the U.S and during the Senate Judiciary committee hearing on behalf of Brett Kavanaugh judge Kavanaugh doesn't become justice Kavanaugh Walter south Carolinians saying about about uh about Senator Graham these days\nI think he's enjoying a tremendous amount of support here in South Carolina maybe song that had not ... years past he didn't have\nUm he's been a true team player the president or did take a a very active role there and um he was making the other night and just in ... county in my unit ramble area that's not an area that necessarily was John McCain country\nUm and and he's a he has being warmly received and greatly appreciated for his role right now\nAnd it's it's it's kind of fun to watch because he's the Lindsey Graham that I've known for years I mean he's a guy who fights but he also has been a big believer in saying I Want to get stuff done I Want to reach across the aisle when I can but there's a different Lindsey Graham right chip I because now he's saying\nHe's never done this before he is going out and campaigning on behalf of Republican Senate races and he's never done that before he's never campaigned against his his Democratic senator Senate colleagues\nWell I liked it I think what they what they made a big mistake when there is that he felt like he was under cut I did feel like it was a late you know a last ditch effort that was treacherous at best and and disgusting at worst\nBut he also felt betrayed by those Democrats that he had tried to work with the support other nominees cake and I think ... it ain't just ideology now like personal it's person and a and so I think that's why you see him talking away his and doing the things he's going to do and he will actively engage\nChappelle can we appreciate your profit on with us and joining us on Skype it on our gas line here on the Mike Gallagher show all the better thank you so much a you know just in just to kind of an interesting a couple of twenty four hours and uh\nAnd and yet boy I just I cannot play this enough we'll just play the first part of the ... let's just a once again Hillary Clinton speaking in London of all places should maybe she thinks I think some of these people whether it's the Dixie Chicks or whoever it may be they figure if they're overseas maybe the news will never get back\nTo the United states but maybe they think there is no Internet in London here's Hillary in London this is audio courtesy of grey being and CNN and video if you're watching as Mike online dot com\n[noise] this is the from the lady who almost became president of the United states of America\nWere not criminal ripple political party that wants to try to form for what you care about that ... if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house for North\nKorean military style dorms\nIsn't that amazing as Hillary Clinton with a ... a shocking admission that there is to be no civility from Democrats towards Republicans until Democrats when the house in the Senate this is her deplorable moment\nOnce again Hillary Clinton has given Republicans a rallying cry\nA reason to go to the polls\nBecause if the Democrats are in control will see more people chased out of restaurants and more protesters in the streets of Portland harassing senior citizens trying to to get from point a to point B this is the party that we're facing\nAnd this is why November six is so crucial in many ways\nI'd argue it's every bit as important as November of twenty six team I mean in some ways it's more important because now we've got the president America\nThe elected and an agenda that is being achieved\nAnd an economy that is benefiting and middle class Americans and black and Hispanic and and Americans of all stripes\nIn showing the benefits of a booming
