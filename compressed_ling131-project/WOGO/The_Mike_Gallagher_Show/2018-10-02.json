me\nWell I don't know the ... and I knew it does you knew he was going to rape me or what you said was I thought he was going to rape me or he was attempting to rape me by taking off my ... my clothes

she had explained that her father had been an alcoholic and she became then a very sympathetic figure it was a bad moment why he apologized to her because he realized I went too far now he's angry he's upset he's emotional he's crying he's raging he's furious that his good name has been destroyed in the blink of an eye\nSo there were there were moments that both of them had that you could pick that apart it ain't going to do any good it doesn't really matter what's done is done the senators heard from both of them the FBI has until friday\nAnd then we're going to see what they do [noise] um
