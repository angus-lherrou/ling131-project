had without sort of getting a little bit of tidbits from these friends of mine who know her\nAnd she's just the only thing worse for her than losing the show and losing her whole career in the blink of an eye over one tweet about Valerie Jarrett is the fact that two hundred plus people lost their jobs to\nThe the fellow actors the crew members all the people who worked on that particular production and with that in mind that's why I watch because I knew that she wanted them to be okay and she wants to show to do All right even though she said when you hear this vice\nHer where she is

other thing that happens I Can't tell you because it would be a spoiler\nIt's a deeply personal moment and maybe a little bit of dramatic license we don't know that he did it we don't know that he didn't do it I have no quarrel with it\nAnd and and that's it and that's it and Buzz Aldrin does not appear on the flip it on our surface Mike He just doesn't when you come out of this movie you're

asked why didn't you guys show\nThe flag being planted on the moon you know what his answer was well Neil Armstrong didn't really see himself necessarily as an American hero\nYou know call me crazy but a little things like an American flag\nBeing planted on the moon because the United states was the first country to get there it was a crowning achievement if you love the space program one would think you'd love the fact that we were first\nWe read the ... the Russians we beat everybody in getting there and it was a moment of pride and and and\n... among men just occasion you know what take three seconds and showed the flag on the moon guys sorry marks argument is lame he just likes the space program and and he loved the movie so be it but no he's he's not right on this not by a long shot\nMixture she coming up here on the Mike Gallagher show [noise]\nTalk sports six eighty W O O G o fighting for what's right and\nI'm pretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't

the fact that it's not gory so I Want people to know that if they want to bring their\nTeenagers you know to see a movie but the deals with this travesty of\nOf the Philadelphia officials looking the other way as this monster ...\nWere was performing these late term abortions in these horrific crimes it's not a gory thing to watch but it's obviously a disturbing message it's a powerful if you any of us who believe in the sanctity of life\nYou got to see this movie and celebrate the fact that the guy is finally riding behind bars what brought you to the project Nick and tell me what your experience was about ... was like as you as you made this movie does melt\nThe trial of America's biggest serial killer\nWhile I knew about the story or south followed the story when it happened and when and I was friends with St lemon\nAnd on I was involved in the fundraising campaign when they first had the idea to raise the money on indeed go make it now and when we started talking they started talking about making the film after they had the script they asked me if\nI knew when he directors and I sent them a couple and they didn't work out and so then I sort of submitted myself\nAnd they watch the film that I made a few years ago and decided that I can do it so that's kind of how they brought me in and when I read the script that Andrew claiming\nOr oh I knew that I really wanted to do it\nThere was so much about the script for that though it was an recall and and and informative and fair\nAnd I thought yeah this is the this is the way to go about this we don't want to shock anybody with horror with or we don't want to tell people what to think about the issue what we want to do is is tell the story and let let the facts the story work however they were in in the mind of the audience\nBut what fascinates me is what you guys produce this movie and and and gave us something that dealt with facts and yet you still had a world of hurt and headaches and trying to get the movie made there was all kinds of controversy weren't there are places that didn't want to let you shoot scenes on location\nYou know we didn't have a you know that that may have been I mean we shot the movie in Oklahoma City I I didn't do ... Haitian management stuff I'm just the the lowly director but you know we we we found a way to to make the movie work\nAnd a ... and and and we had to\nBuild some some sense you can burn some uh some church buildings here and there in the courtrooms and that kind of thing yeah but we did find a way to get the movie\n... the director of the the movie God's Nell the trial of America's biggest serial killer again this was an abortion doctor in Philadelphia it's it's not only do you want to\nSee what nic looks like he's he's one of these guys you know and I mean ... million movies and TV shows and always working so feel free to pop on a onto the computer go to Mike online dot com and click the watch Mike on the button and you'll be able to\nTo see ... as he joins us from his undisclosed location via Skype\nA you know because all these big movie stars have undisclosed location it's shocking Nick back to the movie for a moment that they weren't well it ought to be shocking that so many officials and so many people in authority new ... new what ... was doing\nBut didn't stop and can you can you speak to that because that to me is one of the biggest takeaways of what we learned about the trial and the whole case of ... no\nWell I you know I'm not so sure that they knew you stand up when he was doing it because the fact of the matter is they\nDidn't and spent his clinic for Seventeen years I mean they they they run not there was a conscious decision\nIn the in the higher ups in the government and the governor's office governor Pennsylvania that they did not want to be perceived as being anti woman or anti reproductive\nRights and so they said that the policy was by the Pennsylvania border now was not to inspect abortion clinics unless there was a specific ... Wang now even that in in God's nails a case there were a number of complaints about when it but still\nFor whatever reason the bureaucracy did not inspectors clinic so I don't think they they did not know how bill the it was they did not know how unsanitary was and the irony is of course as we say in the movie they're required to inspect nail salons once a year just to make sure that they're operating on\nAn issue but they never they didn't win his clinic or Seventeen years\nSeventeen that's what's so astounding about this she got to see this movie and you've got to appreciate the fact that the justice was eventually serve\nYou know I I saw in a one ... pick your brain a little bit about about the knee jerk reaction to actors and politics Roseanne Barr at the last night they did the re boots the counters or was well done just about Roseanne they fired or over one tweet was a defensive tweets\nAre but you know what I was in ABC's said you're done you're finished we're going to go we're going to go on without you and I saw very sad portrait of Roseanne\nOn vice last night on HBO she's obviously anguished she's bitter she's a she's a heartbroken that her baby was taken from her what what what's your take on the way people can be shut down and yet\nWhat what what's your take on the way\nPeople can be shut down and yet the left can say anything Bill Maher Chelsea Handler you know go down the list just Kathy Griffin there definitely is a huge double standard when it comes to retribution for people for things people say on social media is they're not\nAbsolutely and uh you know I better watch but I say about it [laughter]\nI may have been I Know but I don't get in trouble\nI Do believe that there is a complete double standard it is it that left us for for almost anything they say they're actually reward it a lot of times for\nCalling people racist and and you know wearing an entire\nPart of the nation as being Nazis white supremacists and and and this kind of thing and uh\nYou know one one slip up on the other side and and you see what happened I mean Roseanne has been a particularly vulnerable position but that was a she has a show that she had a show that was built ... we we around her personality and win a major network has to get behind a show like that they\nThey and especially if the if a right leaning personality causes some controversy\nThey're not going to stay behind it are very long\nNext year she uh again we we'd Meyer your voice or if you want to follow his tweets and it's not for the faint of heart at yes next year
