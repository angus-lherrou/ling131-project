energized invigorated optimistic there's such great news right now and it feels like Republicans\nAs we know we've got a mountain to climb on November the ... less than two weeks away Americans are going to decide whether or not\nWe're going to be um speaker of the house Nancy Pelosi whether we're going to see Maxine Waters in positions of leadership in the in the end on on the house side we're going to see if Republicans are going to lose control of this the Senate or will Republicans\nAre just lifted up by an incredible incredible amount of missteps\nAnd and and and news events that have happened in this country will will will take Republicans to another miracle finish sort of like what we felt in November of twenty sixteen welcome in to the relief factor dot com studios will get a real treat for you\nA few years ago I've done a lot of these traveling tours around the country and a ... a few years ago during the twenty sixteen campaign I had the chance to go\nOn a number of cities with Newt Gingrich said I'm not one of these big a\nRich famous people who travels by private jet but once in a while I get to go on one of these multi city tours a on a private jet with some of my colleagues from the sale and radio network in one year in particular I got to go with Newt Gingrich from city to city I think we did fourteen cities and twelve days\nAnd I got to sit next to former house Speaker Gingrich on the plane\nFrom city to city and we would talk and he would tell stories I mean I I was just like at the needs of the master listening to this political giant\nUm a guy who has so much history and so much perspective Everytime I see him on my buddies Sean Hannity show a week nights on on Fox News channel I feel\nA little smarter a little more confident a little more gratified that I live in a country that has produced leaders like Newt Gingrich so we are very proud today to offer an hour with new we're going to spend the rest of the hour with Newt Gingrich I Want to find out\nUh is now behind in his race for attorney general and frankly a guy who goes around wearing a T shirt in Spanish that says no borders are probably deserves to lose\nBut in addition these had so many other problems that are he's ... he made right down the entire chicken and the Democratic party in Minnesota so a lot of this has been\nVery profound change in the nature of what we're in the middle of and I think there are historic precedents once you accept the idea that this was a period of very profound change\nAnd not only that it you know you you you you list list some of these examples of what seems to be so much\nOver the top instances of Democrats behaving badly and we're seeing a lot of we're seeing a kind of a mob mentality this week uh the house majority leader a Kevin McCarthy's office in Bakersfield had a giant Boulder thrown through the glass\nA window we've seen Mitch McConnell and his wife harassed in restaurants I'm ... and ... and and and new to this is coming from the top you got Democrat leaders encouraging people to get him Republicans faces draw crowds chase them out I mean the words such an unhinged time\nThat uh I got to believe this bodes well for us to November the six because a lot of Americans Republican independent maybe even Democrats are saying the only way\nTo to stop this from continuing is to put to keep Republicans in power because if these guys are in control heaven help us\nWhile I I Do think that the uh the the whole notion of jobs not march or in the whole notion of having a former attorney general say when they're down kick them right now I think for most Americans that's just way too much yeah and so I Do think in that sense that there's a\nA substantial push\nUnderway uh and and I think that being if you say to me it was just really the country you want to become a and you look at this mob coming up from Central America and there is no other way to describe it it's it's just an invading force\nOr at least seven thousand in ah somebody will she just you know last night that there is another couple of thousand coming out of\nGuatemalan algae joined so it may well be cut her twelve thousand before long a he said if you will you really want to live in a world will these people believe they can come and impose on you or whatever they want and I think the Democrats are in the real bind\nI play a video clip yesterday I'm ready we're we're spending an hour\nAnd I play a video clip yesterday I'm ready we're we're spending an hour with Newt Gingrich today on the Mike Gallagher show here in the relief factor dot com studios had a great event last night\nIn Philadelphia ... great great crowd for our battleground talkers tour tonight I'll be in Dallas uh and then later this weekend in Chicago so we're going around the country Newton knows these kind of rallies very well it's fun to be with like minded people in a room full of excited energized\nUm citizens and incidentally for ticketing Chicago ah freedom someone put a battleground toured dot com battleground tour dot com\nI play that clip Mr Speaker yesterday of the president in Houston proudly proclaiming that he's a nationalist\nThe crowd roared with approval and then I followed that up with a clip from Don Lemon over at CNN who was literally just mortified\nOr at the word nationalist and he kind of conflated he seemed to tie in nationalist with I'm white nationalist white supremacist because you said the word nationalism is is a national TV\nAnchor host well nationalist as racist overtones anti Semitic overtones bigotry show I guess we're now in a place with the left where if you say you believe in America's sovereignty and you believe that America is the greatest nation on earth and you want\nTo make America First as an American you're nothing but a stone cold bigot\nThat that is the modern left a modern laughs loyalty is to some kind of vague global assume that the president's speech at the United nations was brilliant and the first really solid defense of\nAmerica as a patriotic foreign policy since the Nineteen twenties and and he drew the real distinction\nOr do you want an American government worries about America if you have this with this this mob coming up from ... from from Central America should the U.S government\nTo decide that we want to take care of the entire planet and if that means that we bankrupt America we eliminate are free to destroy our prosperity but at least we let the Don lemon standard of of uh\nYou know caring about the globe\nWhich was what ... what I always said that John Kerry really had to be given the past because he was actually the global secretary of state and that's why he can continue to meet with the Iranians because he doesn't represent American Austin\nAnd and the Obama administration was I think the first overtly global ...\nAdministration we've ever had\nAnd their view was that the United states was uh the the weaker the United states was the better\nYeah but I but I have a theory too and I want to try this this out on you I don't believe Don Lemon or any of these guys on the left and in the media the advocacy media is trying to stop the Trump agenda they don't believe\nThat Americans who ... who who feel the way we feel about the sovereignty of our country I proudly saying you you better believe were nationalist they don't believe we are racist they don't believe we're big and they they don't ... been renting semi it's just a way to chill the debate\nNow they believe that they believe all those bad things about you if you say nothing\nJust despite existing\nBy existing your senses and the French to them and they said this one insane\nFresher at Georgetown a woman\nWho tweeted during the Kavanaugh fight that all the people who favor all the men who favor ... defending gang rape has noticed that she now\nDefines who he is on her terms deserve to die and the feminists should stand watching them choked to death and then cut off their penises and feed them to heart surgery at tweet from a professor at Georgetown\nWow that that is that that's that that that's\nThe arrangement which leads people to throw a Boulder to Kevin McCarthy is office window that's bigger range well which leads people to think that they can go into a restaurant and verbally abuse the majority leader he was Senate whose life by the way is the secretary of transportation\nAnd she was with them for dinner that night I mean we need to understand you have a brown shirts tucked toilets area and mentality on the left\nAnd they can shut you and me up by calling us bad my name's they'll do it every day\nThe right Newt Gingrich Gingrich's with us here on this special edition of the Mike Gallagher show an hour with Newt

while ignoring the things that are a pen impacting millions and millions of Americans these policy achievements that we as conservatives have been dreaming about for decades\nWell I think the first of all these people don't care about the evidence may have made a judgment that they have to find their life around is the worst thing that could happen to them\nWill be for Trump to be a great success because they are dedicated to believing that he has to fail\nAnd of course you know use but you see this I mentioned earlier earlier this up when you're in great historic periods you have these kinds of changes right uh when Jeff when the Jeffersonian is one of the federal is literally died out by Eighteen twelve or so uh when Jackson won the anti Jacksonian hated him so much\nThat he did not get a good biography until Nineteen forty five over a hundred years later because the the week the aristocracy wouldn't\nTolerate writing nice things attraction a Lincoln one people feared how bitterly divisive\nWe fought a civil war over it\nUh and and uh in FDR won he was he was described as best man by conservatives who wouldn't even say is neat and the Al Smith who had been the Democratic presidential nominee in Nineteen twenty eight left the Democratic party in Nineteen thirty six because it was now too liberal than FDR then it's probably ...\nBut he just concluded that FDR gone too far to go so when you go through periods of this kind of change\nYou're going to see some people switch in that direction of the change agent and some people forming sort of a fossilized remnant and that's what the anti Trump preserve becoming they're not only fossilized remnant of a group a group that used to be dynamic and now just sits in the corner and ... them and says bitter pinch\nAnd you know you talk about the ... that they are defined by trying to prevent his success\nArguably he's been an enormous success you look twenty months into this presidency\nAnd and you see the accomplishments on the judiciary you see what's happened with the court with the Supreme Court on down\nThe economy foreign policy domestic Newt it's not it's not a stretch to say we've just seen an enormously successful twenty ... twenty months so the Trump Administration is that is that fair\nYeah look I think I think that you go down to less now again if you're a liberal and says this is where it's a little hard to understand the never Trump first and then if you're a liberal having the most successful\nConcert with the judge process in history right literally in history better than Reagan better than Eisenhower better than it's nobody's business got gotten\nThis far as the chefs are but if you're a conservative that's an amazing achievement if you care\nWhich actively about the economy having the lowest black unemployment in history the lowest Latino unemployment in history I mean the best overall record us and I think fifty years\nUm those things out to be seen as ...\nAnd and you
