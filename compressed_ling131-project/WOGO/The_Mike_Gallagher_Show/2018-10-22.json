they're they're not they're not so there were there were so many issues that you raise here was so we'll take that one first\nThey're not only not offended on Christians perhaps it is not possible in their view to offend Christians there is as you probably know a famous or infamous art work quote unquote would they crucifix in the jar of the urine of the so called artist\nNow uh as I tweeted out last week if you put a uh if if you put a ... in urine or you would be an Islamic fold if you put a tour in Europe I mean you would be an anti Semite if you put a crucifixion urine you're an artist\nAnd and I tweeted that very exact it word for word what I just said for that crowd ... it is not only not possible to offend Christians to the best of your bill will be you should\nSo or is it ... this is ultimately a war against the Judeo Christian civilization that the west is built I Am convinced that that is the ultimate ... of the left\nThey hate the idea of a Bible based value society they're frightened by it and they hate it now the second issue is the use of the terms God and Jesus Christ it depends on the context so I Would say for example\nIf somebody says God the juicy that home run I Do not believe they're violating the commandment against using God's name and paying a lot of people do and I don't and I explained what I think the commandment really means because I Know the Hebrew very well and the Hebrew\nThe commandment really means\nBecause I Know the Hebrew very well and the Hebrew effect commandment these do not carry God's name in vain not to do not take God's name in vain and the people but I Believe carry God's name and vein of the people who in the name of God do evil\nBecause that is the only one of the ten commandments that God says he will not forgive\nIf so it cannot be that it is about oh God that I have a hard day at work today or Jesus Christ I just really hurt my finger I I I it's hard to believe that God will forgive murder but he won't forgive that\nSo it has to be really bad since that's what set is said God will mapped forgive those who violate that amendment ... doing evil in God's name\n\nThat is that's the worst evil atheist evil is evil religious evil is the most evil\nThe Islamic to or doing evil in in their God's name are doing more harm to God and religion\nThan any atheist group that has ever existed\nOkay

nation of procrastinators up like they describe this Chevron near LAX\nAnd that you know funny enough because remember we took the show to LA I Know exactly where they're talking about because it really stands out and they say there were seven hundred people buying mega million tickets seven\nHundred people seven hundred I'm trying to get in before it shuts down crazy but nobody wants nobody in Los Angeles one that nobody across the country one\nNot to not clearing the board all the way across and you think of the possible combinations that there could be no winter among two hundred and eighty million tickets [noise]\nAmericans spend nine billion on Halloween really\nThis they've done the analytics the national Retail Federation annual survey shows that the more than a hundred and Seventy five million Americans are expected to partake in Halloween festivities how about you are you dress up as anything\nStates in the south and northeast spend the most on costumes candy decorations greeting cards all that kinda stuff\nAnd those living in the south spend on average they say Ninety dollars a person on that kinda stuff Ninety dollars a person\nUm I you know if you have kids\nThen I get a gift their dressing up or you're taking them somewhere there during that trunk thing where the candies in the trunk or is that the church parking lot or whatever because now there is I mean not balls people like to have it contained not like the wild crazy\nChase we used to have gone from neighborhood to neighborhood I mean it was ridiculous because we weren't consuming all that candy anyway but I Know my brother and I I Know it\nMy brother Patrick and I would have this race where we had you took a pillow case white pillow case and you'd be out and you'd be going all the way up and down all these neighborhoods\nAnd I am certain we were more than halfway full who knows how much candy that was I Know my mother immediately took it from us realizing first of all we're not going to we'd be sick if we just started to inhale it but um it's different now\nBecause it's much more controlled for most people and here's what I Love so the number of costume stores and the biggest places for Halloween I just talked to this fabulous people in Idaho Idaho really celebrates I guess\nA Halloween big time top candy in the state is candy corn they say 'cause they've done these surveys\nThat but the number one place for Halloween [laughter] I I was so surprised by this is done so I don't know the Knicks Arizona\nPhoenix, Arizona they have Eighteen candy stores they have three giant haunted houses they have for team costume stores and the top candy top selling candy is Snickers yeah if you go to LA\nI don't know why they say that's number one I think it's because of the amount of the consumption the candy or Los Angeles fifty nine costume stores of course it's bigger Nineteen haunted houses and scandals is the number one can be a lot of states get all get\nIn Houston, Texas receive peanut butter cops are number one and if you kind of jump around\nPeanut butter cops are number one\nAnd if you kind of jump around I mean Snickers comes up a bunch jolly ranchers in fabulous savannah I talked to people from savannah I'm dying to go to savannah so they only have one costume store but they have six candy stores have to haunted houses\nAnd the top candy is jolly ranchers\nYes in Wilmington Wilmington North Carolina love that area M. and m's number one candy San Antonio Texas Reese's peanut butter cups and that comes up a lot\nLehman had in New Orleans had lemon has ... in New Hampshire and Rhode Island candy corn wild and where our satellite facility is Dallas texas Reese's peanut butter cups candy store Sistine costume stores six there's one right down the road from\nMe who uh I I used to love going and haunted houses and now I'm veering in a crazy directions that's why America Tonight is honestly like a box of cracker jacks you you're going to keep digging for the price but you're going to find the price I Swear to you know\nIf you haven't run to the vending machine what is your favorite candy for Halloween\nBought her fingers I like butter fingers\nTo do you like to you you have to get the little ones 'cause the big ones you just didn't help them you know they had the little ... the little tiny sigh [laughter] well you go and get them when you go get some butter fingers to celebrate\nOr to do a ...\nA finished off the bag yeah that's why I wait until the last second because we do have trick or treaters I wait till the last second to go run out and get them because I'm afraid\nI'll say oh it's just not that many calories it's just that little tiny ones they'll just eat one one little bar yeah right um I like butter fingers too I like butter fingers I if I'm gonna do candy I like butter fingers and I um I like her she's bars I guess because I grew up\nOutside of Hershey PA I mean not right there but not too far and I was always fascinated by chocolate town and the fact you toward the factory they'd give you a free bar of chocolate and I like it with um with the ... in it [laughter] of course I'm saying this now with all of you are listening and\nYou heard me mentioned sixty nine days basically until we're at the end of the year and I'm doing today so I'm going to a gym when I'm when I'm not doing the show I'm In a gym or I'm walking the dog my hello you hear me talk about my hollow in his awesome wholesome foods so I'm trying to keep him in good shape\nSo I wouldn't be down and too much of that a candy candy corn is cool looking it I cannot be consuming a ton of candy quarters too sweet\nSo Halloween twenty five cities investing\nA lot into a haunted houses and a candy and all that kinda stuff some of those that I mentioned that you know it's big like people will spend money and do that isn't that wild um 'cause I think it's some were controlled so I wondered about that if it was different\nAs I said we talk about the bus in the backyard so there is conversation about Halloween because people are decorating houses I've got a house near me great older couple\nTheir kids are grown and gone and all that but they still love Halloween I Swear they have eighty inflatable is I'm not exaggerating I'm going to take a video and I'm going to posted on Kate ... is capable any official than age\nAnd you'll be able to see it but it is it cracks me up ginger and her husband do it\nBears ginger embarrassed\nAnd every year it seems like they get bigger and bigger the great pumpkin becomes the norm is pumpkin it scares the dog if I Walk the dog at night he is frightened by private display on the lawn [laughter] so some people put stuff out some people don't do it at all [laughter]\nThey don't [laughter] so it's a good reminder to you because one of the things we are going to do it invites you to go there 'cause then you can comment and those things you don't see

they do up their lawn I mean absolutely\nCrazy crazy crazy crazy in the meantime while we go back to Washington the nominee of conversation is about\nThe Saudi prince and the death of the journalist is sickening horrific deaths\nAnd then the president pulling out of a new treaty with Russia he's saying that the U.S is going to go away that they're not going to do it that this treaty that limited the number of missiles\nHe says he's gonna he's gonna dump out of that a Trump said Moscow has violated the\nThe intermediate range nuclear forces treaty and so he's going to help the agreement why why bother you thing\nTo do that or you know that doesn't make any sense Russia's violating it\nThey've done it for years we're not gonna let them violate this kind of an agreement and go out and do weapons then we're not allowed to it's ridiculous I agree with him if if if we say oh okay I don't do it we sign it it's been there for most of the Cold War U.S Russian summit's were dominated\nBy nuclear weapons that was the conversation with Nixon and Carter and Reagan and the size incremental agreements number [noise]\nThe size and the location of the arsenal of the nuclear arsenal but if they're not sticking to it's going to say why isn't it it's not agree with my brother used to say who was a lawyer [noise]\nThat ah there's no contractors no agreement\nIf it's one sided one sided so

was\nGoing to be 'cause I'm gonna try to call\nI just if we're going to see if you call because Pete always cause and uh Sharon from Maine always called always get a ton of emails I say time like six seven eight we only do it for one second to last segment of our one\nAnd it'll be our show that is um Wednesday Wednesday in to Thursday is the show where we do that so just\nRemember\nWednesday into Thursday unless there's something weird that comes up and I'll give you the heads up ahead of time um this was one of those weird things because\nI got trapped in the airport in Las Vegas the Dallas Fort Worth area has had more rain I think we're having a crisis of identity where we were all of a sudden the Dallas Fort Worth area things in Seattle and the rain just keeps on fallen and so on and it's messed up a lot of the flight so I\nCouldn't do that unfortunately at the tail end of the week or or I Would have but thanks for asking me that question and how about this\nThis is from a Mac who says Kate what's your favorite scary movie senses is Halloween what's your what's the one that scared you the most well that's two different things favorite scary movie and then one that scared me the most\nKind of like suspense movies but um\nBut stunts movies are different than flat a scary movie slasher movies I think are\nUm not not scary it's there because there's no suspense it's the suspense that gets you so when I was a kid I was way too young probably to see this movie when I did but the movie Halloween I saw that movie and Michael Meyers that was scary to me\nSo now they have this remake forty years after the first original Halloween I guess forty years that's crazy so it it uh open in first place Seventy seven million\nIn ticket sales there's something about Halloween and Jamie Lee Curtis is back in this\nAnd you know all these years later and I want to say she was a teenager I think when that first one came out so I guess the nostalgia of it I don't know just the whole idea Halloween the movie and Michael Meyers and that's um that's what's so to me the scariest movie 'cause I was so young\nSo little Saul Halloween that scared me and I would say um that to me was a scary scary movie suspenseful movies are the ones that will get me all the time\nAll the time because it's a central on what's going to happen next you know like there was a movie called catch the girls and who is in that movie I Can't think of it now I'm Morgan Freeman was in it\nAnd it was pretty scary so I Would put that suspense wise up there I just moved I Love these the mail bag is just all over the place by the way\nI see a onto more serious types in the mail bag and I get it so how about this one um this one is from Mitchell who says Kate\nI listen to the show a lot this is probably the second time I've emailed you I don't know I feel compelled to tell you that 'cause I guess everybody always says things like that um this whole thing about the ... deal or ... however you say his name\nIs just mind boggling to me and very sad how does he go on a consulate and ends up in pieces where they don't even know where his body is can't even say anything about it say they arrested people all seem like much baloney to me and it is really\nFrightening to think\nThey did and dismembered bring him and it puts us in a very awkward position when you think of dealing with the Saudi family the money with weapons\nThe ally ties to you know to um the crown prince and the post where he was a contributor is calling for investigations into his death by the United nations\nAnd Congress including may say whether the Trump Administration has conspiring with the Saudis to cover up the murder of a distinguished journalist [noise] yeah 'cause his columns were pretty critical about the Saudi regime\nAnd he advocated\nDemocratic and educational reform in the nation and more broadly even across the whole Arab world so he got under some of their skin [noise]\nMan cave
