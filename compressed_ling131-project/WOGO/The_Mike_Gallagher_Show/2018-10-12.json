who struggles with substance abuse and there is a way out [noise]\nHi I'm a\nTook everything I mean I got to the point where I was lying and saying that I had to work at all but I Would set when my friends and get high or another eight hours and set up my mom and my son I mean here got a shot in the Bronx I'm becoming a person God intended need at the end you're showing me\nHow to be a mother and giving the hope that he has a plan and the things that have happened are nothing short of America [noise]\nSo if you or a loved one whether pain or an adult is ready to enter the diction team challenge can help\nIn other words are they one of the same I I honestly don't know and maybe if somebody can try to give me an answer\nLast less clear line or two and see if we can get somebody who can try to tackle this in this whole awareness we have of people who have been brutally victimized by sexual assaults powerful men although even the Harvey Weinstein case is now evidently falling apart\nThere's media reports now saying that the woman that they were trying to prosecute Harvey Weinstein over\nWho claims that he forced her and ... and sexually assaulted her now there are apparently text messages and communication this is reportedly I'm just ... going off the media\nThat said that she texted him after\nThe alleged assault and her comments led investigators in the prosecutor's office to believe that she felt it was consensual and this is so hard about\nHe said she said this is what's so tough if there's somebody who is a predator you know the defense is always going to be but it was consensual\nAnd it's a it's a tough burden for for a victim to prove that she wasn't agreed to it or ... or or or wasn't consensual sex and now apparently there's a big there's a big rift in um is a big a battle\nOver the Harvey Weinstein prosecution there's apparently it in ... internal fighting going on\nIn the Manhattan District attorney's office over whether or not they could proceed or should proceed in the wake of what apparently are messages from this accuser and ... and alleged victim\nThat suggested that she was still very fond of him after the salt and that the the the sexual encounter was consensual so this is very very tough to tough issue it's a difficult issue it's a painful issue\nSo here's millennia Trump and she is answering the question by ABC's Tom ... this was cutting number eight probably never maybe she and gravy and\nI'm Talking about corroborating claim of sexual assault\nWhat is your take about the me too movement though do you believe in them do you support the me too movement\n[laughter] I support the ... can be a little disappointed and you know her mom not just the man\nDo you think man and then in the news that and accused of a sexual assault sexual harassment had been treated unfairly\nAnd you have a really high on the ball you know [laughter] you know all kinds of books on the ethical\nSomeone in my view of that and say how could you say that this has trouble you hate to stand with women going\nThrough to ... to sound awful bomb could not to vote to come by be hiring you know sex and yes all attack or even the ... because sometimes I go to high\nIsn't that interesting that the reporter said well wait a minute Mrs Trump some they say that say how can you say that in other words it's it's it's shocking to suggest that there has to be evidence to support\nA claim and of course again this is difficult because it's been for so long women have had to\nRely on or or ... or live with being overpowered and victimized and assaulted by powerful men and at the end of the day you have to ask yourself is it unreasonable to ask\nFor corroborate and that's what happened with the Brett Kavanaugh case you got a woman who came forward after ... after thirty six years and said this happened to me thirty six years ago\nAnd you got a man who says my gosh look at the life I lead it's been exemplary that is not true I did not do this\nAnd everybody wants to protect a victim so back to my truth\nI'd like to know how you define this because I'm\nI'm I'm ... I'm a little bit confused by Zachary is going to try to tackle it\nHere the relief factor dot com studios is to go to your phone calls eight hundred six five five Mike how you doing factory\nTo like I'm doing well how are you\nI'm great thanks helped me understand what what what is meant when people say you have to let an accuser speak\nHurt truth ... what's his or her truth or might truth me\nAs an amateur philosopher myself in a college student uh that's kind of popped up at the turn of the last century what they call the post modern Islam as a tack on like the scientific method writing\nRight well that may be true for you but um but that is that true for me to multiple ... equal troops if they contradict each other\nSo so what so what's the actual truth if if your truth conflicts with you know ... if you say um I I don't know you you see something happen you see a blue car hit a white car at the intersection\nAnd you see the the you said the blue car went through the red light and crashed into the white car\nAnd but you say well my truth is the white car hit the blue car you you understand my point I mean in other words ... well how can how can to truths to be be correct both be correct\nOr throw it out of the explained on it and I kind of hold too\nBut for whatever the explained on it and I had a whole to subscribe to myself is that\nThere may be in the midst of a speaking the evidence out things there may be all kinds of true that in one sense but as soon as you find the real truth the actual truth but bottom line truth but it turns out there's only one truth so in that in the seeking of truth yes you can have a lot of options on the table\nOr to actually get to the bottom line all the options get off the table because we finally figure it out\nYeah but it isn't so I guess is that journey is that path where you say getting\nThrough what the truth is you have to accept a person's accusation\nUntil you find something else that refuge but if there's no corroborating evidence and that's what the first lady was saying you have to have evidence you have to have something to corroborate somebody's claim\nOr else you're you risk sheen people destroyed because somebody makes a claim heaven forbid somebody makes a false accusations\nWhere do you go with that it's a tough one it's a very very difficult a difficult issue and uh and I struggle with it 'cause I I don't want to make a mistake here because I don't want to ignore\n'em ... somebody who's a victim of a of a brutal sexual assault and they'd never gotten any justice\nMore coming up
