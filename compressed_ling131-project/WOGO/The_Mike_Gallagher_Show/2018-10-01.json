happened she gave some of those details then it was Brett Kavanaugh's turn the judge in the afternoon where he got angry and volatile\nAnd I'm defensive at times and emotional too so now everybody's pulling it apart and trying to decide ultimately what is the answer here\nWho do you believe what hangs in the balance of Supreme Court\nJustice seat the highest court in the land that my friends one hangs in\nThe balance the clock is ticking so far that nine thirty meeting that confirmation meeting is going to be held as far as we know I had some friends in slip me a little bit of information of course all the staffers are running around\nKind of taking back on and not necessarily the nasty wages kind of unofficial pool because like all of us they want to know how this story and as it affects all of us in America who better to have on this show than Bob Ney the former congressman from Ohio from talk media news\nBob your impressions of what you saw today\nI was there you know during the impeachment of Bill Clinton\nAnd that was a longer process but I must say this was in my opinion um more incredible and in other ways a in a sense something like comparing to the impeachment just the absolute within a short period of time drama you know and everything you would look at a\nRight when you look at this who who could go in a different direction I mean everything's party lines\nBut when you look at least the Murkowski for example senator Collins so Senator Murkowski senator Collins\nAnd Senator Jeff flake is another one that seems to be up in the air I say seems to be up in the air we we don't know that for sure I Know from my own sources there's lots of conversations going on behind the scenes with aids et cetera trying to figure out what it is\nThe way the Senate math works\nThe Senate is fifty one forty nine Democrats unite against Kavanaugh which is a good question too\nUm Republicans can lose one vote and still confirming by using a tie breaking vote by the VP my pets they cannot lose two votes those that tight so that's the question after the\nReally frankly long arduous process of seeing both of them out of the few senators figure out what they saw and the way they're going to to vote that's clearly what this breaks down to\nSo there may be another Republican waffles I I mean we don't know it seems it seems unlikely to me I mean Collins is up for reelection and twenty twenty Murkowski is up for reelection and twenty twenty two\nSo for them you know if it's trying to keep moderates on board what are they willing and then\nFrankly wouldn't it be a novelist idea if you really just voted what you thought I'm not worried about when I'm running again and if we're all going to still be here on the hill I'm going to really way my options and go with what I think is the correct way to go so there's going to be\nPressure that will mount on certain sites for example Democrats up for reelection red states like\nMansion in West Virginia Joe Donnelly in Indiana\nAnd that's how the ball bounces this is this is what it's about so the clock is out there it's chicken and\nThe nation watched I think what happened those that could those they couldn't we're following it on Twitter they were I'm listening to what other ways through streaming if it wasn't just flat on the tubes somewhere if they were working\nSo there are plenty of opinions about what we saw what we heard what we think\nAnd where this is all headed\nDo you believe her account do you believe his account do you think there's holes in both of those stories\nAnd I think\nWas alcohol involved here um how much what happened all of that it's it's like um talk to anyone who\nHow much what happened all of that\nIt's it's like um talk to anyone who's ever blacked out from alcohol and what did they remember them saying blacked out too many tequila shots too much bruised especially kids I mean ... it's a whole different thing\nSo we're not talking about feeling a little queasy a little I'm with a little bit burnt out\nFrom a no food too many drinks we are talking about\nProbably a maybe a blackout scenario maybe I'm the friend in that situation who\n... smart judge that everybody's talking about he clearly wrote about alcohol and clearly which is grappling with that and is not available or has not been made available had made a statement but it's not available for any of this and there are now\nOthers who are calling for more to come for the FBI to get involved here but I I don't see that happening I think the Senate panel is just going to is going to vote on Kavanaugh that's it it does this vote is happening or\nWe would have heard that called off I'd be very doesn't mean it can't happen at the last second but I'd be very very surprised if you want to weigh in you know you can always here eight five five to six six fifty two eighty three eighty five five to six six fifty two eighty three\nYou heard I'm just a little slice there\nAbout the trauma and and uh and and what that was like Lindsey Graham had his own take on what this must be like for Kavanaugh as he really exploded at one point uh during the hearing here's what he said\nDo you consider this a job interview the advice and consent of roles like a job you consider that you've been through a job interview\nI've been through a process so there's some concern of the constitution would you say you've been through hell\nThen for a while and then so this is not a job and R B\nThis is hell to those remarks happened after Senator Dick Durbin called for cabinet to request an FBI investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations made against him\nGraham said he went on after what you just heard there to say he's sympathizes with Kavanaugh and the Democrats had no intention of protecting\nChristine Blasey Ford the first woman who came forward with a sexual assault allegations against\nKavanaugh so you know he ... he said listen let me tell you when it comes to this is what he said to judge Kavanaugh you're looking for a fair process you came to the wrong town at the wrong time my friend it was clearly he was frustrated\nAnd that's when this fiery comments came out from Lindsey Graham he says he believes Ford was betrayed by the person who released her letter\nWhich was sent to the Democratic senator that we've talked about Feinstein I'm\nOn the allegations that he said I think she just much victim his cabinet as because some of the trader trust and the people who were trader trust they owe her an apology and that\nThat goes to the okay what happened with the letter and then if they hadn't won its release and but going back to it needed to be released sooner if you have that letter and you have that conversation and then it's going to end up\nComing to this and and what can be said as she didn't want it to be revealed okay\nUm she didn't want it to be revealed and then it was what a waiting game to see if if he was going to be the nominee them once he's a nominee so it was\nA really hairy\nI kind of a\nKind of a creepy day frankly to kind of a creepy Paul this hanging over D.C that washed over the rest of us I think in the U.S and I was monitoring social media\nAnd let me tell you it pretty much echoes what I said where you've got decides\nIts its side were this was like watching a football game it's like deciding what side are you on ... do you believe after these Kavanaugh hearings what do you think is going to happen\nAnd he had the bulk of the afternoon so\nOn the Twittersphere the conversations were geared toward that cause they everybody had already heard her and um\nYou know the the his emotion was brought up and some people like did some people didn't like it the um senator lay he asked cabinet if he is bart cabin on mark judges book\nAnd he refused to answer then he said he said he didn't think mark judge you'd have to testify and it kind of was that back and forth wasn't kind of it was that back and forth\nYou know all the way around so which is it who's right\nWhere do they go from here I think quite\nHonestly it's going to just be that vote\nAnd what happens and that vote is what happens from that that vote\nAnd then that's it I mean ...\nHash tag if the Kavanaugh hearings is done and what comes out of that is is simply who who do you believe to believe him to believe her\nDo you think um [noise]\nHe should be the next Supreme Court justice I mean there's the other question that some people are asking including Steve Schmidt he was a long time Republican operative\nWho worked on many Republicans campaigns and he doesn't think\nHe should be a judge he doesn't have a decorum for any American tonight [noise]\n\n\nRelax log on to dynamite auto zone\nWhere we auctioned a few select vehicles are dealerships every week no reserves which means a hybrid or wind and take someone right or wrong we find a wreck from the public into vehicles on consignment to insure you get Tom dollar worries with their lives are more than three day money back guarantee dynamite autos raised by my concern was when\nAm or dynamite autos Tom for a great option deals right now\nYou know your new tires but finding time to get to the shop burst to work yeah you lose a vacation day for that there's no one to watch\nThe racing\nOr you lose your entire lunch for it and to be a sign mobile tire PSI mobile dire dire jobs to come to you that you're home office wherever car truck the rest\nThe streak and that would be really really awesome if that happens\nThis isn't so off them if you were the Yankees ... to ... I Know we've got the people listening to us who are so bad for your fans the Yankees a starter ... within the middle of a one hit are tuning shy of earning a half million dollar\nIncentive based bonus but he was a jet confirm Thursday afternoons game at the Trump\nHe pitched um\nHe editor Thursday's game having such a hundred and forty eight innings in the season\nIn what would be his final sort of the year he needed to last through the seventh in order to make it to a hundred and fifty five innings and get the bonus he was tossed by the home plate umpire and the bottom of the six after throwing in Ninety two mile an hour cutter into the race catchers left leg\nAnd bath you said I don't really make decisions based on money I just felt like it was the right thing to do why how oh the half million dollar pitch that'll go down in history right and it was the yanks when twelve one over the race but he lost all that money\nSo I guess at an original a warning and once that ball went in there that was it it was only the fifth objection of his career so he's not necessarily known for that he's been around for a long time but um\nYou know that was it is against the Yankees organization save some money anyway if you want to look at it that way if you're a college football than it's interesting 'cause this is a big week in college football and already have one in and out Miami\nBeach UNC forty seven to ten forty seven too and\nAnd then there was some conversation about the Clemson a couple of days ago the Clemson quarterback Kelly Bryant is transferring from clumps that after losing the starting job\nHe doesn't want to be the motive that is what happens a lot you see a lot of quarterbacks move on to other opportunities he started to watch Eighteen games for the tigers but he was told on Monday that he was demoted in favor of the freshman Trevor Lawrence and the coach taboos a Sweeney\nSaid it was emotional he gave Bryant the day off from practice and he skipped practice on Tuesday\nBut he said he was you know he wanted to he wanted to transfer and he did say he did say that he said I was like I'm not discouraging Trevor he's doing everything asked\nOf them but um I thought it was I felt like I haven't done anything not to be the starter I didn't hear what am I turn I've done everything y'all have asked me to do which the well that's true but this is how it goes in college football whoever you think the better guy is let's hear putting and the and\nThe you know the show on walks in with a guy a couple of years ago who ends up being the the quarterback for the Houston Texans\nSo Bryan started the first four games this season at Clemson but splits time with Lawrence\nNow they've got these red shirt rules this season Bryant a senior has an opportunity to transfer charter school one year of eligibility remaining because he played in only four games this season so that's why he had to do that so that he can they so he can be the red shirt guy so he can go to another team\nAnd a Sweeney said that he was saddened and disappointed that prime made the decision to leave\nBut he said you know as far as the decision as a coach sometimes you have to make tough decisions that are in the best interest of the team and this is one of those decisions and I would make it all over again because I Believe that's what it's right for our team I feel like Kelly would've continue to help those play a lot but that's not what\nWe wanted to do I you know he said that's not what he wants to do I would have started him I could have started him but he would have had limited options so that's it and Lawrence has the bigger numbers he's got six hundred a passing yards and nine touchdowns and\nSo they made that switch and he's playing the rules as meaning he can go someplace else and that's what happens\nBecause when you're a quarterback and especially if you think you have some kind of a chance to go to the pros you want people to see you play you want to have big heroes games and have those big daddy game so that you'll get a more looks\nIn the draft when you decide to come out if that's the case and then just in some cases just because you want to be the person you want to have all you don't want to be the backup or\nThe guy who got it he didn't win but now we're gonna different direction [noise] yep\nAnd wonder where he pops up next there's a couple of teams that could use a good quarterback where he would feel\nIn nicely stay with us we're going to the movies next here in America tonight [noise]\n\nThe final phase of
