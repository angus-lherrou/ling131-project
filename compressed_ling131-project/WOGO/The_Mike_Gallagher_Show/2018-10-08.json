it\nWhile it interesting that first of all the White House has responded standard way and actually there can be Sanders had a press briefing today which is like the first one and twenty some days but of course she had people coming in and so she had to have a press briefing\nUm but my cake is that they basically responded and the only way that they could after the president's sort of went off the

think they're oh don't you\nWell there are ... they're going to go after New York state is going to go after any money that I think that it it you know what they think that they owe it however there is a statute of limitations to the question is which of the things the New York times outlined about Donald Trump or within the statute of limitations on what you're not\nYeah yeah crazy um and then back to the cabinet sing NBC reporting to the FBI hasn't contacted people with information on Kavanaugh is that\nThis is what's happened to many people and who have said that they have information out

we kept in a secure facility behind closed doors it is a single copying one by one for senators walked in signed in like it's a library\nAnd read what they read at the FBI report seems kind of crazy ... because I think they're afraid of the whole week thing I guess\nEspecially and none of this is coming out a senator Amy clover char the Democrat from Minnesota who's a member of the Judiciary Committee who opposes Kavanaugh said McConnell filed closer even senators haven't seen the FBI report hadn't seen that that it was\nWhy I'm you know and then you had a lot of reaction to wow can we do this without seeing this so maybe you know it's kind of in that phase of like I said my mind goes to the saw one minute it looks like OK them this is going to go\nAnd then the next minute it swings back into\nYou know the other direction and this is nothing new with what we see here in the United states because it's teams and so with very polarized and of course politically speaking and then

appointment and it is an incredible honor can be tapped to be asked\nTo be picked for that it's something on it for getting paid for something that nobody listening to this show because I guarantee

to to do that to be pegged as somebody who gets confirmed goes through and then has the ultimate says part of that process\nUh to me that something really sacred I Hope we don't trample on all of that really honestly I Hope not\nSo the Republican save the Republicans are of safeguarding the FBI report\nAnd one by one I guess people are filing in and they're going to read it and however long that takes\nA while to actually if you think about it\nWhat is really wild and really sad and more than wild very very sickening I think is what happened with these officers six officers were hurt one killed in the south Carolina shoot it\nYou know I've heard this before because I have family members who are police officers that domestic violence that's where you can have a debt when you're a cop so what ...\nOh and that's where you could end up dead when you're a\nCop so what happened was that was a two hour standoff and nice residential neighborhood in Florence County South Carolina\nIt was a man who had children hostage he fired on the cops from multiple agencies 'cause they were from a couple of different ones the kids were unharmed that's a good thing it started about four o'clock eastern\nWhat happened was the shares the Orange County sheriff's office tried to serve a search warrant at home I'm In a subdivision not far from where the flooding from Hurricane Florence had\nReally the ripped up places and then the suspect started shooting they said all you can hear you know shops all over the place\nAnd the where he was positioned his view of fire was several hundred yards and he had an advantage they say and imagined again trying to serve this so I'm the wounded officers were evacuated they were transported to a hospital\nAnd the the one that was killed was a\nA thirty year veteran of the police department I mean really John ... um\nYou know talked about it um as the talked about who it was a parents care away they say and I just gosh\nIt just breaks your heart when you hear these stories I mean how difficult it an awful as this and a lot of people were tweeting out about a senator I'm Lindsey Graham said heartbroken oh God Bless the people who choose to protect them from their families\nA president tweeted out thoughts and prayers are the Orange County sheriff's office and the Florence police department tonight I in South Carolina were grateful for law enforcement\nOfficers\nAnd then here's\nThe reaction and just a little more detail about the officers being shot\n\n'em and they're more of that reaction is vi I'm governor from South Carolina said this is simply devastating news from Florence to selfless acts of bravery for men and women and law enforcement is real and it's um\nYou know I was looking at a map and and it really was in the middle of all that devastation that happened with the heavy flooding because of the hurricane and it's a\nIt's a city that's like kind of in the northeast cause I've spent some time now as you well know in South Carolina is like in the northeast corner\nOf the kind of that of South Carolina and it's right where two majors thoroughfares or interstates you know intercept Ninety five and twenty it's a pretty decent size city and I'm here is that reaction more reaction\nWas offered ... ...\nTo do random\n[noise] yeah so random search warrant you're not looking for that to happen and this has been in domestic violence\nCases as I've heard from family members this is where is the scariest when they walk into a situation that they don't even know what they're walking into they have absolutely no idea Mm wow [noise]\nIn the meantime with a little bit of this and that meaning things that we might miss out on the map up quickly all go to a couple of stories that I was looking at earlier in the um earlier in the day and\nOne of them was a this one and it it has to do with the fact that you've got um\nWell I like I have no idea what's going on with these\nAirlines because we keep seeing that none of these things are happening and they're having to to land planes and when I say that there was kind of a may there was a mayday call with this Australian flight and it it you know the horror was\n... I mean what's going on because they just hear this mayday mayday just really creepy but they United a flight ended up landing thank goodness and ... it's a\nIt landed safely in in Sydney after the hysteria over that it was Seventy seven Dreamliner from Los Angeles and they have low fuel low fuel oh my gosh really oh that's awful so what do you do when you have low fuel while you do a mayday because what's\nGonna happen if you can't get there it's gonna\nIt's going to trigger responsive to All right if you've got low fuel where can we possibly get you down and it was looking like\nThat's what was going to have to happen they were going to have to figure out a place where they could dump the flight and um it did it did land and then there was some kind of weird mechanical issue but they got to the gate the customers got off\nAnd uh you got a hundred and eighty passengers for teen crew and it was a few things that there's an international standard that requires when you get down

on in my backyard and buzzing is probably buzzing in yours to the bombshell report that came out on Donald Trump's\nTaxes on his release father Fred Trump they're saying now that his father funneled at least four hundred and Thirteen million basically the equivalent to his son and they're saying including instances of outright fraud\nSo\nThe times found in their report in any way at least a hundred and forty million for sure like where it was tied\n'em there's the in the report they had a whole bunch of ways that this was being buried and now New York's department of taxation is vigorously pursuing this so when you look at this\nDo you think\nThat um this put the presidency in peril or do\nYou think that um it could be just a matter of he's going to pay a ton of money back\nWell I think if there's this fraud and the New York tax board goes after it and they can uncover the way it was being funneled then they could charge interest and all of that on top of it and I think um yeah it would be a money thing it couldn't be criminal thing\nBecause the statute of limitations I've said it's another show would be up on that but um\nIt could be that is the money thing that the ... they'd have to pay the taxes\nWhatever tobacco taxes were and if they go way back to think about the interest but that interest I guess look like would it look like\nI mean I think it would be a ton of money from what they're saying so\nSomebody said to me today we'll just give up a building right [laughter] do you sell a building\nUp will have no idea [laughter] I Do know that
