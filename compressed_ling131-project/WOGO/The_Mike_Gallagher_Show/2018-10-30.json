was Saturday afternoon and I saw some CNN anchor say the president said something about armed guards now we know that's not possible to have an armed guard and a synagogue\nIt's not possible to have an armed guard in a synagogue\n... what do you mean it's not possible to have an armed guard in the Senate in a synagogue\nAnd of course normal people know if you have an armed guard in a synagogue the people in the synagogue have a fighting chance against a madman who walks in with guns blazing\nThis isn't even an argument the president said it cut number eight he went to his rally in ah where was he he was in uh\nIllinois Campaign rally in Illinois and he\nTalked about a very common sense response to this kind of evil cut number eight from a audio from NBC and gravy and\nThis is a case where they had\nAn armed guard inside\nThey might have been able to stop him immediately\nSo this would be a case for if there was an armed guard inside to temple they would have been able to stop it may be that would have been nobody killed\nSo it's very very a\nVery difficult situation then when you look at it we can look at it two ways but\nAgain if they had somebody\nProtect people now isn't
