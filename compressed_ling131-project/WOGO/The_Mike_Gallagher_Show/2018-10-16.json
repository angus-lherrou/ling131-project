York post said in the beginning it was safe to ignore con da and his romance with President Trump after all west as a performer\nIt's easy to discount his political talk but recent events demand attention first came as Saturday Night live appearance where he wrapped in his red make America great again hat and praised Trump then there was the meeting in the oval office Goodman calls it a spectacle\nOnce again his stream of consciousness commentary veered from nonsense to common sense no denying the events were intriguing and entertaining Michael Goodman said I still\nDidn't regard any of it is politically significant until the left wing media went absolutely bonkers on it they're extraordinary venomous and personal attacks on west reminded me of the left's unhinged smears of Brett Kavanaugh and Trump some sunk deciding west documented mental health issues\nMany invoked his race in Jordan terms making them especially outrageous a black a black guy anchor on CNN accused Conyers of putting it on a minstrel show\nA black pundit on the same panel called him at attention the horror\nAnd the token negro of the Trump Administration another chipped in with Kanye West is what happens what negroes don't read a black New York Times columnist said the White House scene was quote white supremacy by Ventura\nLiquids\nAnd a white MSNBC anchor called it quote an assault on our White House Michael good ones says woe Nelly what nerve did he touch\nThe first thing they noticed that the double standards if a if conservatives criticized a black liberal in those terms the liberal would let loose a chorus of racism and demanded every Republican denounced the commentators but this time it was the liberal media itself making the offensive\nComments\nMichael Goodman says my conclusion is that the outpouring of wrath suggests the answer to whip if Kanye West is important enough to be targeted by so many in the media for character assassination\nHe must also be dangerous if he's dangerous it's in the same way the conservative speakers are dangerous to college snowflakes any dissent from the ruling coercive liberalism might be contagious and therefore must be silent diversity of thought cannot be permitted he writes\nSo we can assume that the left fears Kanye West could be a leading indicator that Trump's appeal to the working and middle classes is cutting across racial barriers\nParadigm has shifted\nPolls show Trump gaining support among black voters his approval rating has been as high as thirty six percent in Rasmussen\nOthers including Gallup show he has gained\nMichael Goodman says we will know more after the midterms but I generally believe the willingness of individual voters to buck historic group trends is a hopeful sign\nFundamentally America is a nation of free individuals' none of tribes or groups and are Republicans healthier when both parties\nAre forced to compete for every vote any vote taken for granted is a vote not earned and leaves politicians free to break their promises without suffered any consequences surely\nWe've all had enough of that\nMichael good one I Love his points I Love what he says about Kanye being this existential threat\nTo the liberal mindset and they're afraid of and they have to be why else would you attack a guy\nWith the kind of viciousness we saw when Kanye West appeared at the White House all he did was go to Trump and say I want to help with the inner cities I Want to help with fatherless this in the black community let's talk about what you can do to make this country better\nDo Trump haters really not want this country to be better to Trump painters not admit that Trump wants this country to be better that's just that's all of it\nFascinates me All right here we go sixty
