would be criminals who want to break our laws it enter our country you're spot on like\nNot what they they are they're criminals they pass through multiple checkpoints where they could have found

does\nWell because not one of them have been there but let me but Mike let me let me play for you the clip ... number for for last night uh on on Fox News Danny ... who's a former assistant FBI Director\nAnd he believes that these things are laughable we you know here's what he said last night on Fox News on the glory and grim show cut number four from Fox News and grape you\nOr I commanded the Oklahoma bombing investigation and I've been to bomb school I've been the victim of an idea and are these things work\nAnd either this guy is out for a new mom made a curse or he had no intention of these things going off as as your other guest said oh this looks like a movie prop and then you have to get to the point of what is the purpose\nAnd I tend to believe that the purpose is not hurting anybody because these things are not capable of injuring people and that's verified by the technicians and examine them so then what is the story I think it's I think is the editor\nI think it's definitely a theater and I think his messaging and I think that as this stinks and here it's it's it's it's it's almost it's almost a joke and and it's not it's not a joke because it would take it seriously but they're saying it's not a bomb\nThat's the former FBI deputy assistant director with some uh some very interesting uh analysis of these bombs again eleven and twelve found today nothing detonated\nJust a suspicious looking packages with PVC pipe apparently and fire powder in there and we're wires\nHey don't forget to reorder your copy of the national issues is death of the

hitting the pocket books of American families hard the outrageous cost of prescription drugs in a recent poll conducted by Frank once he got an earful words like greed gouging an unfair kept coming up there were lots of questions what is the cost of drugs keep sky rocketing why has the cost\nOf the top medications increased over a hundred percent since two thousand and eleven when does the whole system fuel rigged\nWell there's an answer the big drug makers spend a lot of money to lobby to protect their profits over a hundred and Seventy one million dollars should be exact\nBut there's a bigger lobby in America are politicians must answer to we the people we want solutions to prescription drug affordability we want them now trying to hold the drug makers accountable and put patients ahead of profit they have their lobbyists and there are hundreds of millions of dollars\nBut we have our voices are stories and our votes time to end the drug makers monopoly pricing power and stop them from overcharging the American people it's time once and for all the patients that had a proper because enough\nIs enough\nMy Gallagher\nHi this is Dave states like I've been with WW IBM W O

I've never once she and her show\nI I've I've known begging over the years been on her show a lot and in fact I've been written about a lot in the history of of the Megan Kelly show a lot of people said I helped kind of pulled her to stardom it's a bitch bizarre how it happened\nChris Wallace an eye from Fox News were joking around one day about maternity leave Megan was off I was a ... do a lot of appearances on Megan show years ago on Fox News\nAnd I made a joke as I often joked with Chris Wallace about maternity leave [laughter] what a racket that is for ladies and old vegans offer\nFourteen weeks or whatever boy men don't get maternity leave it was just a couple of guys joking around and came back she came back from maternity leave the day she had she came back she had me on as a guest to talk about some political issues\nAnd then she surprised me contrary to what she wrote in her book by the way that I I knew that she was going to ask me about it because I did not but that's okay it was all in good fun and she blasted be ah for\nTalking about maternity leave and then that got that went viral and a lot of people view that and it\nThe narrative became look at how Megan Kelly stands up to a conservative big mouth like Mike Gallagher she's tough she scrappy and every time they wrote about her from Vanity Fair and although I was always in there\nWith that time that she yelled at me about maternity leave again it was really kind of in good fun\nAnd I was shocked when she wrote in her book and it's just a minor point but she called me a good guy in her book and she said that\nIt it it it was a reflection of how what a good person I Am that I knew she was going to ask me about it on air and I came on the show anyway\nWell I guess I'm not that good a person because I wasn't briefed at all her ... she was going to ask me it was I was blindsided by it which is fine I I mean that's a good blindsided every time I go to a caller so it's okay\nBut I thought that was a little bit interesting I don't know to this day if she really thought I was told or if she\nWas deceptive in and talking about that story\nBut in any event I've always liked her she's always been nice to me and uh you know\nI Wish your well\nIt's just a very interesting dynamic that again that third rail seems to be in America race it's got to be about if you if you make a
