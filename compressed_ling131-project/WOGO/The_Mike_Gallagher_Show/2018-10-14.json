Thomas is a mother in Decatur, Georgia and her five year old daughter was sadly assaulted in the girl's bathroom by a young boy\nThat had been allowed to use that under the school district's policy that said boys who identify as girls are allowed to use the girls facilities and so as a result of this very bad policy a posh his young daughter was sexually assaulted and and this goes to show what we've been talking about what the dangers of\nAdopting these policies and schools allowing students to to use the restrooms of the opposite sex well\nI don't really understand how can a little kid identify as gender fluids I haven't my notes here\nIn in Decatur, Georgia at the au cursed elementary school uh this boy who identifies as gender fluid\nA entered the girl's room and somehow sexually assaulted a this little girl I mean ... was it actually a sexual assault or was it just an assault or what what are we talking about this sounds so bizarre\nYeah the the school district\nPolicy made this possible it was a pass sort of under the cover of darkness there about two years ago and it said we're going to allow students to make their own determination of whether they're a transgender gender fluid however they identify and we're going to respect the desires of the child in the ...\nIn this area rather than establishing good policies to protect the safety and privacy and so as a result of this ... as ... daughter was using the restroom that's a young boy that identifies the gender fluid was also dismissed and went in there and did um assaulted her in a in a sexual nature\nOr do we know how old this boy was\nHe he was also he was actually in the same grade a posh his daughter and so they're given a very young child that\nSame grade as Pashtuns daughter and so they're given a very young child that that obviously has um issues going on but with the the bigger problem is the school enabling dissemble\nWho but as we Lincoln ... who identified him as gender fluid that just insanity what does that even mean for a five year old that you did they ask the boy\nYeah that I think that's part of what the investigation that the department of education is launching is looking into but under the school policies an indicator as unfortunately not alone in this but it it really is determined by the child and so if a child walks in and says this is what I Am or this is how I identify today\nThe schools essentially say okay we're not going to question that we're not going to determine whether that there is a better accommodations we can\nThat we can offer rather we're just going to let you use whatever\nRestroom or facility you want to regardless of the impact it has on other students\nWho's a senior counsel for the alliance defending freedom and we're talking about religious liberty um met I have to ask you a you know right now there is so much misunderstanding\nAbout religious liberty or in America why do you think it is\nThat what really wasn't an issue twenty or forty years ago is suddenly an issue an alliance defending freedom has to step up and be defending all kinds of people left and right because there are so many crazy situation suddenly popping up in my in my wrong in thinking that it's more of a recent thing that it wasn't happening some decades ago\nYeah I I agree this is definitely been a growing trend within the past two years and I think it's a couple of days one I think there's a loss of\nRespect for the importance that religion plays in the lives of so many people when you hear stories of people saying that jak Philips just bake a cake and things like that and they don't recognize that for jak this is about a biblical view of marriage and and his desire to\nDo his artistic designed with cakes consistent with that and so I think there's just a a lot of people looking religions say oh that's just a or something you do on the side and not realizing that it is core to the lives of so many American Well\nI guess the other oh no no I'm so I'll I'll make my point later go ahead\nAnd and then I was just gonna say and I and I also think there's a growing 'em just pure hostility like I view that not only are these belief you know something you on the side but they are terrible beliefs to have to begin with and and I view from\nYou know live and let live and we can have different views about a lot of issues including religion to know your view as wrong it's bad it's awful it's bigoted and we must drive it out and punish you for even holding such if\nWell um I think you're you're right in saying these things and I and this is why I guess I Want to say to my listeners folks if you do not fight if you do not understand that we're going through a tough time you you you better vote\nYou better get your friends to vote and you better if you can gift organizations like alliance defending freedom because they're pretty much all it stands between us and a country that demonize as people of faith\nAs bigoted now again you know I always want to be clear this is not about defending Christians or anything like that if you're a Christian you understand that you're supposed to stand up\nFor everybody so religious liberty is for for everybody but we're living in a strange time right now where people seem to think\nThat biblical values which are basic and which have been taken for granted in this culture for a long time that's suddenly are there on the wrong side of history suddenly if you disagree with whatever the pundits are or the cultural elites are saying is true somehow\nYou're bigoted and and we need to understand I think everyone in America needs to understand\nThe basics here that when we have this thing called religious freedom in America what it means is the government now listen carefully 'cause I don't want to anybody to misunderstand what I'm saying here\nThe government can't take sides on issues that touch on the ultimate questions right religion touches on the ultimate question what is the man what is a woman how they relate what is marriage all of these basic things what is a sexuality what's appropriate sexually all these are big questions and typically the government has stayed\nOut of this but suddenly now\nWe're having the government forcing views on Americans with regard to marriage with regard to a transgender a number of these things you just mentioned it I'm Matt with this ... Thomas Case that\nThat the government is kind of pushing with all the might in Maine of the state uh with all the the tax dollars that we give the state and all the power that you get from those tax dollars they're pushing a view\nThat is actually now limiting\nThe religious liberty of people who have traditional values so that if I say well I don't want my daughter to go into a restroom if there are young men in there who are playing these had games that they say I'm a girl or maybe they think they're a girl but we don't know\nThe it's now incumbent\nOn your average American to stand up for religious liberty and to say we've got we've got to be careful uh we've got to be careful about what kind of going with the flow going with the cultural flow because the costs\nUh we've got to be careful about what kind of going with the flow going with the cultural flow because the cultural flow is now\nReally discriminating against people who are either serious about their Jewish faith serious about their Islamic faith serious about their Christian faith\nThose people are are having their own religious liberties abrogate it and that's why lines defending freedom has to step up and so it it's a strange thing 'cause it's not about defending Christians\nIt's about defending a principle of the U.S constitution I just want to be really clear about that\nTo try and unfortunately even with policies like the transgender policies were discussing they're being even\nEnforce on churches so we had cases we had to file in Iowa and Massachusetts where to go local governments were saying churches you must open up your restrooms to the opposite sex because you are open to the public and so now we've got even efforts to go in churches and micromanage\nHow they use their restrooms and locker and other changing facilities and all the churches wanting to do is operate consistent with a biblical view of male and female and yet the government is enforcing these policies are trying to even in in congregations in churches\nI mean it really is madness but I'll tell you if people don't fight this then it's on them and so I Want to say it all the people listening to me right now\nIf this stuff rubs me the wrong way if you understand that there are problems the world's going crazy or ... you need to do something first of all to any extent that you can be involved in government in school government or whatever it is get involved at least\nVote folks at least vote because right now in America we're seeing a takeover of radical I'm ... of people with radical views this is not that the Democratic party\nOf Nineteen eighty this is ... ... people with really really radical views out of the mainstream\nAre are being so pushy that they're pushing any moderates in the Democratic party out I mean try to say that oh I'm I'm pro life and I'm a Democrat that was easy to do Twenty years ago plenty friends of mine identified as Democrats and they were strongly pro life\nTry it now see see what happens\nUm we're living in a time where\nWe have to speak up and and I want to say to people getting we're doing a fundraiser for alliance defending freedom or if you\nWant to or Ken I'm asking you if you don't want to give to this gift to something else but please folks up put your money where your mouth is if we don't step up right now and defend against this stuff it's it's just awful and it's ridiculous and is destroying America so you can go to our website ma taxes talk dot com\nMa taxes talked outcome if you'd rather call I've got a phone number for you it is eight hundred\nFive five six twenty seven Seventy eight hundred five five six twenty seven Seventy eight hundred five five six twenty seven Seventy and you know man I Know that there are people out there thinking oh Eric this fear mongering uh\nI don't know what to say uh you know because the last thing I Would ever want to do is uh is you know play to people's emotions in that way but I think that this is it's such a serious issue and\nWe we often just think like well everything will be fine but everything won't be fined and everything is not find if it weren't for you and the folks alliance defending freedom doing the hard work of of taking these cases on for free and defending them these people would be hung out to dry Pasha Thomas you've just described I mean nobody is standing up for her\nAnd the whole school system is telling her hey you can go jumping a lake Pasha Thomas like we we don't we don't really care what happened to you I mean that's effectively where we are\nYeah and it is tragic because there are victims of these dangerous government policies you've been talking about and now we've seen this happen to a young five year old girl is a result of this this was avoidable\nHad the school district recognize the dangers of this policy had there been people in the school board saying wait a second should we be adopting this policy um but it's taken courageous ... people like Pasha and her daughter to take a stand and say we're not going to be silent on this we're going to take a stand for our rights because it impacts not just posh and her daughter\nNot just even the kids in the cater but across the country as more and more school districts are adopting these dangerous policies\nWell I also just want to say how I'm going to the restroom or it ought to be a place of safety especially for young women and the idea that somebody can go into a place like that and have a physically strong mail whether it's the same age or older\nUh but but attack them or something like that that that shouldn't even be possible and of course here you know it it's a situation we didn't know the details but uh it seems that it could be so much worse than what's been described here I mean here you have a five year old and a five or six year old\nBut a little boys can be strong but the point is once you talk about this general principle and you think about teenage kids and it's just it's just a nightmare waiting to happen unless we have unless reason prevails\nAnd unless a cool minds prevail in courts of law and we have folks like the alliance defending freedom defending these ideas\nOr you know what's happening folks them I'm going to tell you again please uh we're we're doing\nA a fundraiser lengths of cream so just go to my website it's ... attacks us

otherwise he's going to be forced to bake this I mean it's just\n... if every American is not outrage I Want to say to you where do you are legion says why we're we're in an existential battle for the soul of this country if you cannot stand with a man like this now what have we become\nAs a nation what have we become\nAs a nation we once believed in in civil rights for African Americans that was a noble battle and and the African Americans when you think of Dr King the way he fought that battle he would never dream of anything vial\nLike this uh Rosa Parks was a woman a tremendous Christian dignity Jackie Robinson was a man of tremendous Christian dignity it's why\nWe went along with what they said they they shown a mirror or a light on us and we looked at ourselves in a in in a new light and we said you know what\nThey're they're right we need to change the way we think is a country we need to change our laws what we're talking about right now is as far from that\nAs you can imagine it is absolute found this absurdity it's playing games with people obviously a ... there's not really meant to make this could these people are looking for trouble the alliance defending freedom has to step in and defend this and I just want to say to folks\nYou need to understand this is an existential battle for the soul of this country we need to vote we need to take action this is it's not okay that people are having to defend themselves against this kind of violence this this should have been thrown out\nI mean nobody should have to take that seriously but right now jak Philips and others have to take this seriously and the ice depending freedom has to defend them\nI'm having met this is a really crazy cases it not\nIt absolutely is and I think the the icing on the cake so to speak\nIt absolutely is and I think the the icing on the cake so to speak with when the civil rights commission that had just lost at the Supreme Court\nUsed jacks case against him and said oh we're going to fight your own case to find probable cause against you again and it just shows the hostility that this commission that the state of Colorado has towards Jack and his beliefs this isn't about letting him\nContinue to operate as business and serve every body but\nGive him the freedom to decline certain cakes this is saying we hate your beliefs and we're going to punish you as long as you continue to hold those and try and operate your business consistent with them\nWell again I think that uh your average American really would would rather ignore this kind of stuff that I'm telling you folks ah one we're fighting a civil war when we were fighting the revolution there always people that want to kind of ignore the fight but sometimes you have to fight\nA and if you don't fight you'll be held responsible for not fighting when you were needed that this is a real battle folks that we're we're going through right now and I just want to say that\nThis is a battle for everybody this is not us against them God Forbid the people in the wrong side of this battle are fighting against themselves these are crazy people who need to be protected from themselves the very idea that they might get away\nWith this kind of deeply cynical behavior toward their fellow Americans it's it's just not right and but we have to stand up to the least we can do\nAs I said his vote a please vote folks vote your values are get serious don't don't uh\nDon't so many people have such excuses please or if you don't vote don't ever complain again a and I want to say uh if you can give to the alliance defending freedom I don't know\nAnybody that is doing this a kind of work right now so I Want to say go to taxes talk dot com you'll see the banner every penny you give will be doubled up please give what you can\nVisit folks this is why God gives us money\nAnd energy is is to use them for his purposes and right now I'm this is something that's about all we need to fight it it's

delusion after the president won in November\nI became a target of the house and the Senate and the more education as a witness or to do to try to figure out whether there was any Russian collusion as soon as my main came up\nIn March or twenty Seventeen at a house intelligence committee hearing\nOn national television threat started coming in on a daily basis in fact the very first one I had to call me said he knew that I was out of town and my family was alone and then he was going to burn my house down what my children inside\nSo what really scares me I mean obviously you know like you get a lot of threats I get a lot of threats that you know most of these of course are nothing but what what really frightens me here is that in your case it just seems like a lot of it's real because you are genuinely tied to the president a lot of people who get threats aren't tied to the president\nDid you ever requests Secret Service as the White House ever offered and did you request Secret Service\n[laughter] no I haven't been very much in touch with law enforcement I've talked to the local police here they have been great and my little village out\nI've talked to the local police here they have been great and my little village or outside of buffalo I'd rather state police have been helpful the county sheriff has written helpful here and I haven't spoken to the FBI here and there are on this uh you know I I'm convinced that most of these are fake you know most of these aren't serious but I've had\nAre coming to let me set the stage a little bit so after the cabinet debacle the first set of polls that we get a lot of pulling those are two were the first of all seem to suggest\nThat it would then the Republican base because of Kevin I Would be more energized in the Democratic base and that might take the Democrats down to and then pick up I'm only Eighteen or twenty seats in the house he wouldn't take it\nBut then there's more polling that's come out in the last three days this week that now suggest the Democrats are going to be well over and pick up a twenty five in the house what state you\nWell I think it's going to be an interesting split here potentially just because of the way the Senate map looks are I think the cabin I'll Fight is going to be a positive thing\nFor Republicans in the number of key races I think it could work well for them in Missouri it could work well for them in Indiana are good work well for them potentially in Florida and Montana too and it has probably shored up the likes of Ted Cruz and Marsha Blackburn\nPossibly ah Martha ... valley in Arizona and maybe even Dean Heller I I still think that the Republicans will probably lose one incumbent but they're in much stronger footing with their income and and they're in a better position although maybe not a conquering position with a lot of their challenges on the house side though it's working against them and there's a clear ...\nBecause the the the districts that are are generally seem to be the toughest for the Republicans to hold\nOur in states that are generally blue so there are ... seats in New York their seats in Pennsylvania their seats in New Jersey in their seats in California in those four states which will probably make the difference into has the majority in the house and so when you get some of these suburban left winning voters\nAnd in other places where a both bases are rallied in some of these places especially in the house side the Democrats have more votes to rally than the Republican Jack Lew the opposite of where it is and some of the Senate states\nI see I see so in my native Pennsylvania view of the suburban Philadelphia in those races that will hurt that hurts Republicans ... significantly as she was she mean okay so let's start with let's start with the house and\nOkay so what you predict on the house or your prediction all along has been we're gonna see speaker\nPelosi what do you what are you seeing you're using and at twenty five are you seeing even more than that how do you see the hospital and\nI said for the past couple of weeks I think it's probably gonna be somewhere in the thirties usually when there is a is usually if there's a way there's going to be some extra that you don't expect to on top of it it's just the way it works the Republicans got the same thing and twenty ten twenty fourteen twenty sixteen I have yet to really go a house race by house race because there's a lot of them obviously\nBut just with the states you know Pennsylvania the Supreme Court which leans laughed redrew the map that's going to probably be a plus for a for a ... a Democrats right in there you go to California and New Jersey you're probably looking at most of what they need\nThen you go down to Virginia Barbara Comstock at a tough race she's been behind and every poll I've seen some of them by double digits\nShe's down double digits in that in that ... and she dumped double digits Washington\nPost as are down fifty five forty three and so a commitment made to be a lot of error in that poll is that that's not correct and then you've got other Republicans in Virginia in trouble to Dave Brat and a tough race that's the old Eric Cantor said obviously and then down in the tide water area you've got Scott Taylor in a very difficult race so if there is a blue wave\nA folks who are right on the margins could get swept up in that and I think it's not going to be right at the number that the Democrat debated\nBrad seats was was not us that wasn't even a swing didn't we got him many years that wasn't even competitive district for years and years no it\nWasn't I mean Eric Cantor was winning that thing comfortably so as Dave Brat once he got passed Eric Cantor and twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen\nVirginia is an increasingly blue state my only going to get bluer because that's the government continues to grow a northern Virginia is going to get bigger and bigger that population looking for affordable housing and other opportunities wound that spread south down towards Richmond and incumbent Republicans are potentially going to pay the price if not this year in a cycle not too far\nFrom a sharp turn our friend Barbara and just sort of the viewers know by the reason we're talking about these things as\nWe know these people well they're in they're in our immediate backyard Bagram starts district is about three miles from here bread is probably thirty miles to the south but more intimately familiar with these things so Barbara and Barbara faces a bluer\nElectorate than she did two years ago and unrest lure electorate than she did four years ago is that that's what's going on basically\nWell right because it's northern Virginia is an increasingly blue increasingly liberal area Donald Trump in northern Virginia a barely got thirty percent if he got the thirty percent and so uh for for Barbara Comstock the numbers just aren't working well for her if there is a especially a lopsided enthusiasm gap but even if it's fairly even\nAre just the way that her to a district is trending demographically it's not going to work out too well for her so she needs to have a deflated democratic base somehow but I don't think it's going to happen\nWell you're right because it looks the house looks like bad news let me ask you this\nHow would you advise if you had the twelve major Republican strategist in a room right now what would you say to them in the last three or four weeks that could possibly changed the house races just focusing on the house what would you tell them\nYou talk about what would happen if Speaker Pelosi is elected and that that anything that Republicans and independents to try and conservative on issues whether it's a social issues economic issues national security of your priorities are not going to get much\nIt's a social issues economic issues national security\nOf your priorities are not going to get much of an audience\nOr in this in this upcoming Congress of Nancy Pelosi the speaker\nYou obviously point to the things you accomplished which unfortunately for House Republicans as not as much as it could have been they didn't do much with immigration or the border wall or border security they didn't get the Obamacare repeal done I mean they did pass one in the house but uh it wasn't what they originally promised an ultimately no final bill got done\n'em and then you look at or some other things with the deficit approaching a trillion dollars again it's going to be tough\nBut you can't talk about tax cuts you can't talk about putting a a money back in people's pockets you can talk about rolling back regulations which help families in small businesses and and hope that that resonates\nBy a if I ever running if I were running like even if I were somebody like calm soccer brat maybe especially brat but if I were running in Philadelphia suburban Philadelphia I Would want it runs just what you said a lot of scare ads about Speaker Pelosi\nAnd tried to tie her to support a very extreme things I Would just declared her to support very extreme things and run those kinds of ads you got to believe something like that would work maybe we're just not doing enough of that\nPotentially and and they are doing in some districts I Know Dave Brat or at least people supporting Dave Brat are running ads talking about that the Democrats want Medicare for all and thirty two trillion dollars more in government spending over the next decade\nOr how it's going to be just one investigation of Trump after the other and the Democrats really just want to impeach him and they're not going to be focusing on quote unquote your priorities they're going to be a trying to settle political scores\nAre some folks are trying that but uh when when so much of the left is amped up against Trump I'm not sure that ads saying hey these people are going to go after Trump is uh is going to be able to offset that when I say it's a district that my\n... couple of minutes remaining wouldn't you see in the Senate so using crews will wink comfortably heightened Heitkamp in North Dakota is gone I presume of what what about Hillary did we talking about the hell are in jail or in Rosen in Nevada\nHeller and the latest poll I saw I was up to and that's obviously within the margin of error most polls still have them slightly behind so that's going to go down to the wire in Nevada has been increasingly blue in recent cycle so I still think he is\nBut he's doing well I expected Hillary a lot worse than eighty to ... yeah I mean well oh yeah when\nHe opposed a part of the Obamacare repeal and supported part of it ah he alienated both sides and his approval rating in Nevada was down around twenty percent so\nThe so he's doing much better than than he had been on that in Arizona are the toughest ones I think for the Republicans to defend but there is one poll out lately showing Martha McSally pulling ahead of purist and send them up\nI Do think crews and Blackburn are are in very good shape I Do think Kevin Cramer is likely to beat Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota and and uh I Would say that in terms of other potential Republican pickups\nYou gotta like Indiana I'm increasingly optimistic that Republicans can probably win Missouri but that they're going to remain very close I think Montana and Florida are just so neck and neck particularly Florida I think Rick Scott handles as hurricane well I think that might be a boost for him\nAnd made me enough to get them across the finish line is down he's down within the margin of error about right he's done I'm seeing like two and three\nEvery poll I see as one or two points either wise do pretty much a dead heat and uh the governor's race is probably not helping a Rick\nScott right but he has governors' races where like that just got obviously not a dynamic candidate he's always won close that's just I mean of course was closed but Scott has always been particularly close to my right\nYeah I mean he'd be Charlie Crist a four years ago and that was a a pretty tough race in his twenties and writes was not easy either it's a it's a battleground state to be sure\nOne more thing now and there were pulling ahead and seems like three and four points ahead now in Tennessee as you predicted\nBut we had to pour a lot of money or into the national media market ... national money has gone in there to do that is black fur and going to win comfortably last\nYear polls I've seen that black run up five and eight and the one up eight Israelis since all the Kavanaugh um developments happen here in Washington so that probably portends well for her even though her democratic opponent it said he would have voted\nFor Brett Kavanaugh if in fact you were in the U.S Senate and so I think that could be potentially binging his support a and enthusiasm among Democrats said some of them might be thinking why are we going to send this guy there if he's\nJust going to do with the Republicans would want him to do on on a critical vote like this so uh we'll see tendencies a deep red state you've got a gubernatorial candidate there who's up twenty points you can probably\nHelp or put pull Blackburn across the finish line a little bit you've also got a big gubernatorial leads to Republicans in Arizona and Texas a Ted Cruz looks to be in better shape than he wants a couple of weeks ago um whether or not the WTC can get Martha McSally across the finish line that was a much bigger question\nI I don't know I don't know that I'd been with us in Arizona that feeling\nAbout that one was ... director radio America those are poorly America's Best and brightest political analysts thanks so much for real lucky we'll be able to have you back again for coming up next we're getting getting back into the story of needs to was frisky for and stay with us\nOr no evidence at all or ... or no evidence at all\nJoined us very write a story I mean with the I agree with you I'm I I think we are kindred spirits on this I mean it would seem to me if you look at it if you really start looking at what's happening I mean a lawyer like you or more oil rig or even someone like me we have the skills if we want to we can\nMore oil rig or even someone like me we have the skills if we want to we can produce a bunch of actresses right

do you want to tell them what you want to make a lot of money\nYou you were attacked worms you you were assaulted weren't you and and the woman looks at her and says Oh yes I forgot\nI was attacked now we know that she does that I mean a lot of is becoming a job [noise]\n[noise] yeah it is and I'm an encouraged and unfortunately we ... now learned that\nThere is one gentleman who thinks that cause the lady for those also coached because she was scared\nTo some attorneys some very liberal and very active is liberal\nAttorneys that was suggested to Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein I'm and I'm sure that they help Terre polish her testimony and I'm sure that they helped her and then\nTry and and team a little bit more credible than someone who doesn't know that something happened today six years ago in a place where she can't remember the address you can't remember the day I Can't remember the people except Oh yes she does remember one person and that happened to be the person who's now nominated\nWhy would she remembers in the room is no recollection of the party being in the room her or anything else\nRight nor does her best friend leaned um Kaiser I think the attorney and the best friend you would think if this thing happened to her [noise]\nUm I was a girl I was sixteen year old girl I called my best friend and very thing even if I didn't tell my best friend that I had been attacked clearly she would have been something at a party that I went to and Leland Kaiser says\nShe has no knowledge no recollection of anything that Christine Blasey Ford is testifying to\nSt Louis is going to meet you how bad it was the weaponization of me too what do you see is the future that about a minute left where where do you see this going\nOn you and I think I think that it is going to backfire on hold on to guerilla tactic warfare or industrial complex because they're women like tool conservative Lenin or even the liberal women who believe in due process who are going to look at them from say this is hysteria and\nHash tag ... not in our name and not have to take me to hush type not an hour and ... they're not going to be around to destroy our you know our system is due process and justice and fairness and we want to start to get some kind of gender advantage here and let the nice thing to mind\nIs anathema to me I Do asylum case and every day to ... to ... ... that's nauseating repellent\nSo let me ask you this no Christie and when you look at if we if we look into the future another analogy another analogy I Love this is so much I used McCarthyism during the Christie for Ford thing I was fond of saying Joe McCarthy is alive and well in the Senate\nBut an even better now that I'm Talking about the print or are we talking about ... or the an even better analogy\nThat I think is just so out or the Salem witch trial so much of this did Salem witch right isn't it that really on point ... which is\nAbsolutely absolutely I bought on the exactly because of this I bought another a new copy of the crystal ball you know Arthur Miller's oil crystal ball\nAnd and also um a book by I think the news Stacy Schiff called ... which is a biography a lot about a

to this maybe Fifteen Years ago there were none of this stuff is there\nLike doing archeological warfare here they're picking these memories repressed memories with new details from years ago but

we've sent a three hundred clients just about on surprise trips\nWow and and tell me honestly as anyone tells you bag is it you know what that just wasn't what I had in mind\nSo that we had one uh only one negative experience that day was actually a great learning things because\nOn the questionnaire um when you're when you're supposed to find your travel effort says you asked if you want a multi destination experience or if you'd rather spend more time uh one place and really immerse yourself there so it's kind of a I travel pays question right like the solar power and also if you want to go to many devastation just trying to stick around one and that was all tied up in age and I'm\nAnd their budget doesn't really allow for you know our country offering by by ... by resistant to

all their budget when you're just a trip with an artist I mean this is like one of our like one of our first twenty trips that we did and it was definitely a learning experience so that was the one negative Utah where\nUm we definitely have to adjust and make sure that we were out you know we were given the right information for people in the survey that we know exactly where they want and\nLuckily we're able to reach out and make 'em make it right by them but we actually sent them to the ... in August and we plan to um response of the entire transport them so they can have a

have a great weekend with you planning and surprising me for only a thousand bucks\n[noise] yeah so that's that's the average right so I mean we we we work with other budget you have so we've actually sent people anybody from you know executives have extremely I bought this or anybody that wants to more luxury experience to the to the hospital backpack or yeah yeah it's really what we found a juvenile under the problem is that\nWe give you the luxury we'll give you out of the value added with electric travel agent but we need\nBut we don't you know we we work with at your budget within

an experiential trips I mean I'm all set estimation trip but not really a was a bit of adventure culture nature I think that if they're more ... says you have to either do the research yourself and have a million times open or you go with a travel agent and a lot of travelling to that there are a bit\nOutdated and unreliable depending on the travel budget but usually they ought to come up a very

generally that they were looking for something new relax and where they could just kind of the kind of want us to have like I find myself experience and they had actually put the provinces and it was actually like standing aging capitalistic looks dot com Copenhagen within that but in terms of like their travel south of what they want us to do it with a lot of nature\nAnd I'm On a nature I didn't watch the Arctic abide by the coasts as well so I think there are a bit\nWe we took a chance that we give them a proposal that was if I say Sri Lanka and we ended up saying it's a lock out and they told us a boat satisfied\nOr reason also which was really like to hear there was a validation of what what you just quoted and what we believe the premise of this trips that fact is is that they didn't have a chance to really Google it so much beforehand and really do that much research and so she she said that she was just there was a surprise\nUm because she was in a state that she would never have had to go to ourselves\nThat we made sure that she had her hand held the entire time that she knew that she was good at it but she's still got out of a triple she was looking for and actually other job I needed to be done for her no got done as she got all the all the I guess all the ceramics yeah of course that was really cool 'cause those kind of a complete one eighty in terms
