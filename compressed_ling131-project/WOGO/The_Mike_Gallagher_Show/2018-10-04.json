people a clarity that they didn't have\nTed Koppel from remember ABC's Nightline veteran journalist he was on a panel with CNN's Brian shelter and I thought Brian shelter who is a\nBitter\nPartisan overt CNN like they all are frankly\nI I thought Brian was going to fall off his chair when Ted Koppel Koppel called CNN out that CNN brags about how well they say they're doing\nThey're not incidentally they are distant they earn a distant third it's easy to look at the ratings\nOn television on cable news I've showed Germany before TV news or dot com\nIs the um is a website that shows the overnight so you can see the writers from the night before\nWhat the other night Hannity got like six almost six million viewers that's those are unheard of numbers for cable news cable news they they they get excited to get a million million and a half I mean they they it's not it believe it or not it's not a big universe because of all the way it spread out and ratings being ratings but but\n... it's a Fox News MSNBC battle right now\nThere are some nights Rachel Maddow performs very very well and outperformed spots most nights Fox wins and Fox overall wins pretty easily CNN gets beat by\nThe discovery channel and the cartoon network and the hallmark channel CNN is getting wallet they are down dramatically year today now\nThat doesn't mean they don't think they're up from where they would be if Donald Trump born President Trump delivers ratings Ted Koppel knows it but when he pointed that out to Bryan shelter Brian's Daltrey of CNN pushed back in a big white listen to this exchange a this was a Monday panel discussion\nAnd ah and Koppel was simply stating the obvious the despite the chaos\nAll of Trump's all\nOf the Trump coverage is financially beneficial to entities like CNN listen to this\n... that have been good for baseball has been wonderful for the industry your boss knowledge as much a number of number of months ago during the campaign\nThat who ... also acknowledged that so to say on that\nBut that means ... that means what oh the ratings are up it means you can do without Donald Trump you would be lost without Donald Trump he says you know that's not true CNN ratings for me in the toilet with a double\nAnd you're not you're late last you live there or not president seems to know hold on a hill in where I live in\n... with the ratings before Trump and ... now\nI Would say we might be up twenty we might be at thirty percent we might be at forty percent if we go back down forty percent that's okay too well may not be quote I reject the premise that the networks are making so much money off of Trump me we\nBenefit from it that tell me for a moment and say well let's get away from CNN\nAlright sensitive subject let's go to a MSNBC\nIs there a moment of the day when they're not\nFocusing on Donald Trump or some intimately related subjects\nI I'm so embarrassed for for for these guys they're so unaware they used to have such a lack of self awareness there's Brian sheltered either doesn't know how broadcasting works\nWhere he was just plain dumb for that exchange because he couldn't bear to be called out the way Ted Koppel called CNN out branch shelter has written about broadcasting for many years he's like a boy wonder if you had some blog ... hit a site wasn't he's the one that was behind um\nWas it media I maybe it was TV news or I don't know one of the sites one of the media sites and he was like this wonder kid he was a college kid that wrote about media and wound up being elevated ain't got a job at the New York times I Believe and then of course his current position on CNN he knows how the business works\nIf he's up if they're up twenty thirty forty percent he claims and incidentally that's absolutely proven to be false they're down twenty Fifteen twenty twenty five percent Seventeen percent from a year ago and they're down but if overall the Trump era has elevated\nCNN twenty thirty forty percent as Bryan's daughter said you know what that means for CNN [noise] that's what that means we're far yes that's what makes us look talk radio yes that's what that means\nTrump is great for
