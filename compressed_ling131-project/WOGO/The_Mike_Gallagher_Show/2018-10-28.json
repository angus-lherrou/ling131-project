I was a journalism major at Brigham Young the Mormon college and funny enough I might feel aspiration in life was to get married and living in a cul de sac and have eleven children because my cousins had ten and I wanted to beat them\nAnd do something\nI wanted to beat them back [laughter]\nTough\nSometimes may have all their plans but OK\nYeah have you told me I'm listening to talk so Clay Aiken pretty foul broker to the high school aged carry I think you're insane I'm I Am but yes well that I'm right\nUh so basically I had this goal to be at bat housewife and that's that's the Mormon women are are a condition to believe that that was said\nBy the way I actually am not a Mormon but I think that's a great thing snow women I've ever met her were\nHousewives hey hey you will not hearing you say anything that in fact it really upset me actually when uh the Democratic I forget her name she was insulting ... around me and said that she'd never worked a day in her life and I'm like the one the gate or at the five boys\nWell that's the ... well ... they want you to use a method\nShe could just stay home and baked cookies and you realize that well in in a way housewife has itself ... Georgia because\nIt's really inaccurate in the sense that anyone who has raised children full time there is in finish work infant at work and that's if you're not home schooling them and I meet\nWomen who home school because I'm thinking you were a teacher a year like this is just it's kind of you know stunning what is involved so yeah what let's so let's start there\nYeah I guess I I never planned to have paid work I should say yeah I plan to raise eleven children which would have been a lot of work a which is of a different kind um and so yeah I Know what I\nWas three you can go you can go to his own defense and stuff and I'm In a little bit easier\nCheck um [noise] but basically a and again yeah there's nothing I I I I think\nTrue feminism is is empowering women to make whatever choice they want whether that's staying at home and raising families were working and doing a hybrid or fulltime working and not having kids I embrace all of that so\nAh but as far as why I chose journalism funny enough part of it was I just thought it would be a non threatening major that wouldn't I'm\nA threatened male Mormons who might want to date me because I wasn't studying something harder and I could just be a nice little uh like maybe freelancer on the site of ... but I wouldn't have to worry about threatening someone and this is my thought process\nBut ah at any rate I get to BYU and ah\nEventually through a my journalism courses and just doing research I came upon a lot of information that ah with outside the official curriculum that really troubled me about uh the Mormon church in terms of\nThe lack of transparency the lack of uh just the full spectrum of information about who the founder was a and I felt really upset I felt like I had been like to I felt like there were ... whitewashing um the origins of the church that they were presenting this this um pristine\nImage of Joseph Smith and I it took me having to go to the Internet to find out the truth\nAnd it I like to say it's it's sort of like Richard Nixon where the cover up is worse than the crime you know ... and what's interesting now is that in the age of the Internet you're seeing the Mormon church actually start to open up more and and they're open up their archives about Joseph Smith uh they're they're studying to be more transparent I think because they've been forced to\nUh and it's sort of that uh you would knock you late them when they're younger so that they don't feel like they're right completely I I thought\nWhat I was the worst of it in other words you're you're saying that you were a you were blindsided by what I mean that he had many wives that they were young like what what would you\nLike that like one was fourteen which was really upsetting but also the were married to other men because they say that\nOh he only did it because they were widows or they they were never getting married it's like no he basically said if you don't marry me and leave your husband you will be smitten by God and you won't get to have an old ... ...\n... and there's ... [noise] that's interesting\nYeah and I and again look I'm not a member anymore and the church has its own responses and and the church uh also will say well he he obviously was a flawed man and he's\nNot what you hear that there's a kind of stuff whenever you have a you know particularly I'm a very very strong leader like you find this in in a religious cult that they start changing the rules and everybody's freaked out and you know it's like you hear these weird things about these people who have this kind of power\nAnd so I don't know very much about Joe Smith but go ahead and also what\nBothered me was that the book of Mormon and and you can read in the introduction to the book of Mormon they claim that they historically accurate factual document a and that this Smithsonian was using it as a guide for ancient history\nAnd the Smithsonian issued a letter that said please don't use our name that's not true\nUm because the book of Mormon purports to be this ancient document of a record of Jews who left uh Israel and moved to America um before the coming of Christ and that when Christ died before he rose a or appeared after three days in that three day period he came to America\nAnd that this was an ancient book of the American continent despite the fact that there is zero evidence of this and also um the book where in Queens that the Native Americans are actually descendants of\nJews hang on one second we're going to go to a break folks were talking about Mormonism with Cary Sheffield stick around\nMoving here again and I assure you I have never before

I I don't know what I mean he has been quite clear about stuff and and it's close to ... [noise] a person is in general you see the Democrats don't want to talk about this far reaching that want to talk about who's caravan because we are as a so called license from the border earlier this year\nI don't know why I think the president was just trying to stop a immigration problems they\nSaw the Democrats to college or did they call for the call a abolition whereby you hold a full funding of sanctuary city out to our cities and calls for\nA nickel or even prosecuting ice agents so that's where\nThey are doing ... and a New Yorker wants to do away with ice doesn't you know court that sort of out there before what about where you are and what about Hillary Clinton went out on their on the crazy bandwagon now\nOkay so the Democrats don't want to talk about this for what I think it's a whole list of people that sentence [noise] ... ah particularly from Guatemala apparently for part of the nation from some of power\nAnd he's trying to start a crisis on our own government bomb they probably believe that Donald Trump because of the because of what happened earlier in the end the pressure and hear or see he was open willpower ran off with a woman on\nSand and allow NATO is and this is what I don't understand why don't we just why does why don't we send a high level of communication\nTo the Mexican president said look we're done with this is going to become the military issue let's see away as pro jazz let the let the UN that shows that the last two days and it's over US military good end all of these immigration problems quickly by just throwing the ball back over the border and that that\nAnd so we take a little hit nearly as a cause some kind of resolution against those who cares rights\nBut I just I Hope to God your rights and that Donald Trump does one troops to take them back over the border I Hope you're right but I have a feeling stand that you're not right and I have a feeling this is headed muddled them because my instinct since Donald Trump moderating on immigration\nIt was my instinct since Donald Trump moderating on immigration\nI don't know where you can get them from I don't know where he got the lottery and he certainly moderating on illegal immigration nursing there and the issue if you want to talk about ... if you want to talk about the whole world on ... and he's willing to pay which way sensual Eby we get everything slept off about\nA guy and then you can call that saw an eight five I'm what\nI Do not believe he saw something on immigration I certainly don't believe he softening on illegal immigration you're going to somebody like\nMe these people are ... Senate in there now welcome doctors false during the ... by the way is whatever he wants to be in your industry shouldn't unit goes back to the anonymous ... op ed in the New York times and it goes back to the shoe bomb\nJohn Kelly I don't like him I don't trust him\nLike jelly either I don't like him Kelly is a bad into he's got to go I ate John Kelly I'm with ya I don't like them either\nAnd and it doesn't go in and can secretary Nelson John ... so he put into the H ... with that there is obviously things\nThat can be done I Am sure if you talk to the ice age it's I'm sure if he told the people that support since president and remember this president was the first time ever he received endorsements from ice hockey tournament anger could be done so I Know I just don't agree with\nYou that we saw them on you and I both want the president to prevail and twenty twenty but you know if there is a procedure if there is a softening or more appropriately if there was a perceive softening real or not\nYou know very well that's what the good by the president a primary in twenty twenty this issue this is probably the only issue of the only way he could face a primary Caribbean might be more important politically to the president that he realizes suggests these things are living good regularly I think they're looking good even in the general election and\nTwenty but this could buy a tough primary on the immigration issue because as as you know like you found out in sixteen this is the issue for the Republican base\nCertainly is the issue it's a threshold issues on the Republican conference change her you even see it now with um [noise]\nAll Ryan superb actors doing of actually a very very good job on these advertisements same been hammering sanctuary cities have been supporting ice agents in an Amory Democrats answers on a on amnesty an immigration so I don't think by the way I don't think he'll ever be a\nPrimary in terms of a low I I think there would be more from something like that Jeff Flake of Romney's or a job or John Cage I fly\nPlus he is running on this ... he's making this one of the major injuries you just had TNN say earlier this week and they don't even want to show us the cars and sang the caravan because they view it as laws but I Would say it's too if you look at these people to put this makes the point of the president and from the day he announced his candidacy when he came down the escalator payments like\nWhat's this shows you is that when they're not sending their best dark their boss\nI don't I I'm not going to say whether or not there uh item or ... or the mom is perhaps there are in there but I Would say certainly some very strong connection so cardinal you don't have to be a genius slam direct food so I think they are but I tell you what I also think\nI don't think there are any engineers in there I don't think there are any golfers in there and that's ...\nI don't think it was not a guy that I don't think I'd already lawyers did not know the lawyer is it is it's all very low level people coming over the border and Trump is right next to go loves to get rid of their worst and trust them over the border\nIn the Central American countries do the same by and large that's what immigration coming north is ah the president was right about that you\nKnow you bring up one side of point nights we need a much tougher policy towards Mexico generally you know when you're talking about homeland security now spends\nA Seventy five percent or more of its money fighting the Mexican drug war\nWhich I think is ridiculous because I think there should be our militaries allusions to the Mexican drug lords\nI think we should target them go in and take them out with bombs but instead of doing that we're now in this perpetually managed to ... where we spend two hundred billion dollars a year citing the Mexican drug war which is three quarters of the ... budget you agree\n[noise] I hear you and I agree one hundred percent and\nThey have a thousand executions I Am sure in the new regime in power and Arabs and all I can often while they while he's able to agree any part of their life and go on the side of like a lot of things ... well where I went to my manufacturing I'm sure you've heard the same excuses time and time that we've\nHeard from the Mexican some facts with our phone we want to ...\nYou will be able to have you back again I Will continue to an agreement send them very famous from the twenty sixteen presidential campaign and Donald Trump will coming up next more on colleges and universities stay with us\nHas been not the same today let me ask you this you and maybe as well as anyone in the country are better for the answer this question if you're a young conservative man on a major college campus today talk to me about the fears and insecurities and threats that young man's feels\nWell to keep quiet about you're going to throw it is I mean you're probably won't have very much trouble if but if you try to me\nIf you're going to serve it is I mean you're probably won't have very much trouble is but if you try to be vocal you could get into quite a lot of trouble with your professors\nAnd as a matter of fact you can get into a certain amount of trouble with your fellow students too heavy and let us ration wouldn't back you up\nFor it is scary but there was no question about it and it's gotten worse absolutely every year you know it's gotten worse every year since I got my PHD in Nineteen Seventy seven so at the beginning you can see the start of it\nBut to be a little bit like what you see and coming out of university isn't affecting our society at large you used to be that these people were asserting their own view is but not trying to shut other people down now they've got so powerful on Capitol so they can shut other people down and I started to happen\nWell maybe around Thirty years it's certainly has gotten much worse than Twenty years and now the last ten years it's gotten really bad and it's getting bad and every year getting worse\nEvery year so what did they talk to me about that what do you universities do so professors is talking about what maybe some of the things you're seeing done to conservative kids just seek out what universities\nDo do they say what kind of sanctions or their professors and using the professor take it out on the kids' grade or do they try to ... kid or do they get people to harass the kid but do they do\nWell you know that's the sort of thing that some professors don't really know what to do with their colleagues are doing in their classrooms for if\nI Would say though that in that same way that these classes are defined seeing the books that are assigned seeing the kind of assignments they're being given\nA very even political science courses and then which are supposed to go work for a democratic candidate as part of your grade if you will resist this\nYou're going to run into trouble and I think your grade probably will suffer I don't think I can say that that's a rule for every class everywhere it isn't that I'm sure but it definitely will happen if they if they just won't be understood\nAnd uh well professors the thing that happens to them by a large is a very not hired in the first place\nConcern and it was just are not welcome in American ...\nShe was a sense of what the domination is you can speak about your university but only if you want to are they are the typical major you as university what is the ratio of liberals to conservatives in the faculty are we talking tend to want a hundred new one rarely ever a conservative what are you seeing [noise]\nWell it varies from University of University of course and especially from field a field but we're certainly talking ... ... ... in certain places\nYou might as well be zero that because the truth of it is the conservative professors have learned to keep their mouth shut or they wouldn't have been hired and they wouldn't have said\nThey would have been given ...\nNATO's needed needed me the discrimination against conservatives today in universities is very much like the discrimination against African Americans and universities sixty years ago they\nReally weren't even there but maybe it's the exact same type of discrimination they focused in there and they face in the early days\nIt's not quite the same because you can't hide the fact that you're a black and you cannot act which are concerned as others want advantages a little easier but still there are similarities\nOh yes there really are well you know this is why if you perhaps noticed about the demonstrations that you tend to see on campuses today are against outside speakers not against professors within the anniversary\nHere because they're afraid to speak guys out of the interest ... they don't speak interesting there is no more coffee house chatter because they're afraid of it\nYou might be able to get away with it or coffee house but in a play by her and then there would be a problem\nYou know I was talking to a client this morning down in North Carolina oh what an enlightening funny we do the segment today\nI was talking to a plant and he told me that\nHarvard and Harvard has no men fraternities and sororities I don't think that's out in the news media you can no longer have returned and he in a sorority no they exist but you must open them to both genders Harvard's position is there aren't too genders are you ready for this\nWhat Harvard believes there are nine different genders now I Can't imagine what the nine are that the U.S to show position of Harvard University\n[noise] well I'm a Harvard I've followed this remarkable [laughter]\nBut uh it's it doesn't surprise me if not the way things are going through my own university isn't the worst example you could find but it's not much better than the average so if that's the way it almost everywhere a tiny handful of institutions or Deborah [noise]\nLet me ask you one of the question have you seen professors using tenure I I guess you have to have you seen a tenured professor beat the frogs are because of views political views [noise]\nYes there was an attempted case in Wisconsin Marquette recently but to a state courts in order to be anniversary to reinstate him\nOf his problem was that even though with

is that their vote will be I think invalidated the true weight of it won't count because of illegal votes being cast and what you hear from the left is it voter fraud is that you just mentioned incredibly rare\nOr certainly not happening on the scale to swing elections\nBut that's because they defined voter fraud in the narrowest possible\nUnder inclusive terms or they defined it only as an intentional act of impersonation\nBuying the legal voter are on behalf of a legal voter right but in fact I think most people would say well anything that makes my vote not as much as it should\nThat voter fraud or and the reality that happens all the time uh and you have to look no further than the tactics being employed to get illegal voters onto the voting rolls just in Texas\nThis week there was a story about the Texas Democratic party sending out a voter registration forms with the boxes that yes I'm a citizen check\nTo non citizen voters uh there's blow in voter rolls all over the country there's actually two hundred and forty eight\nCounties in this country that have more registered voters than citizens of illegal voting age or the Supreme Court but to pick that nearly three million people are registered to vote in more than one state and it GI where I work as part of the research for this book\nWe did a national study in which we found Twenty one hundred instances of double voting in the state of Florida alone in toy sixteen and Michael you remember\nThat nearly four times the margin of victory of a presidential election this century so clearly it's happening and it's happening in the scale of the largest to swing the lessons you just noted a the Trump election prince sixteen how close that was a so so it's a very real problem and that's one of the reasons why\nDo you um can you point to any specific elections where you do feel that evidence exists that the the result was tipped by fraudulent voting for instance I Know a lot of people look at the Al Franken or a Norm Coleman election back I'm ah in two thousand and eight\nThat that's exactly right there was I think that the election ended up being settled by around three hundred vote\nAnd it wasn't until a couple of years later unfortunately with discovered more than a thousand votes were cast by I think spelling and people that shouldn't have been voting so that's a that's a very prominent example and by the way you know Al Franken went on to become the sixtieth vote in the Senate\nSo anytime people ask what the true cost of voter fraud I Would say well look at your a riot and insurance premiums because an outbreak of it's actually became the vote that locked in Obamacare are in New Hampshire and twenty sixteen New Hampshire has a very weird policy about voting they have what's called the intent to reside law\nSo and I write about this in the book that the Democrats ... state of New Hampshire bill Gardner even admit this is a massive problem he's actually a champion of trying to eradicate voter fraud in New Hampshire the senator from New Hampshire Kelly yeah Audie she ended up losing by one thousand votes\nIn twenty sixteen well they had six thousand people register to vote on the same day in New Hampshire and they have these buses that come in from Massachusetts and neighboring states six thousand people voted but then didn't actually register a car or take the follow up steps to suggest their actual New Hampshire residents\nSo are those are a couple of recent examples but um you know but but some of the other things that happened I think\nThat document example you got mayor's races you got sheriff's racist sheriff rate\nIn Florida that uh it's basically been proven to that they've had felons that had voted illegally but because the election basically been certified or this to the judge has ruled that well we have to give these felons due process though that's not enough evidence brought invalidate so\nIt happened a nationally\nOkay would would you say there's a certain amount of voter fraud in every state every election\nI I Would um because I think it really get down to the below in the voter rolls I mean and this is something we experience I live in Florida and I've been having numerous interactions with the elections officials here and elsewhere because the the reality is the bias is\nTo let people vote right I mean no one wants to suppress illegal voter\nBut because of that\nCreated a system of vulnerabilities that I think are actively exploited by bad actors\nSo I mean the the Texas Democrat mailing the the voter registration form is one example but you know you got groups like acorn ... and their whole job is to go out and Raul stop as many voters as possible regardless of the legality of those voters right you've got\nVoted I should I Know one ... one of the same way one of the things or\nOne of the things that people seem to be interested in on the left is the idea that if you're a college student you can register both in your college and uh where where you live and then you vote twice the national legal but that happens a lot doesn't it\nAbsolutely I mean there are nearly three million people registered to vote in more than one state in this country or the Supreme Court sided views that are specific to that says twenty four million voter registrations this country are completely wrong so that's one in eight by the way\nThat we know we've got massive problems and then the question is how easily are they exploited\nA hand washing and we're going to face in just a moment with Eric Eric angers his new book fraud how the left plans to steal the next election is posted up at our website says\nQuestion that we're going to ponder is what do you do about it how can it be saying how can we be protected we'll get to that and more with Eric eggers whose new book is called fraud\nHow's the lesson plans to steal the next election will be right back on that show\nThe Michael ...

to start off by saying to marry and I we created this program almost Fifteen Years ago back in two thousand four and from our original host to Rudy joining us in two thousand nine to marry me I'm pretty confident when I say that you're a\nFirst for us as I Can't recall any past guest ever receiving such an honor from a dummy Lama not to mention the two sports you've meddled in during your various power Olympics as Mary mentioned during your intro\nSo helpless set the scene for everyone listening around the country today you are promising ski athlete at Middlebury College at one time but share what happened that sets you on the course that you're on today\nSo I was actually it was my first day and I was home I'm getting ready for the ski season we're big races coming up in two weeks I went to the mountain ice skater to mountain called perjury in Charlotte Massachusetts growing up and my brother and I went to the mountain met up with a few of the buddies guys that we had grown up skiing with and\nWe were going to train there because that's what you do on your own mountain and train over the Christmas break after we went to do that and just a freak accident in the middle of warming up my popped up in the middle of a turn I fell in the middle of trail\nDidn't get anything but the ground\nAnd broke two vertebrae and and obviously in some ways I Am recreating this story based on the knowledge that I have nobody thought this is this is one of his certainly happen and I broke two vertebrae and paralyzed from the waist down as a result of that probably relatively\nInnocuous kind of which is sometimes when the worst one but I go\nTo Chris from what I understand you are you returned pretty quickly to school I think it was two months and he's starting to train and it took ... about a year later\nI did go to school for me was returning to live the life that I saw in the hospital with a life in a lot of ways scares me it was it was a life that was really it was really easy for me to envision the limitation whereas the social part of school\nMy wife didn't change that much because my my relationship with my friends didn't change so I went back to school I bought\nI fought as hard as I could get out at the hospital as quickly as I could to go to to return for the spring semester so that was two months after the accident and you know to say that I was prepared for that is a complete overstatement that was\nI was down to fifty pounds I was super super weak I could barely if you watch anything but\nI learned in very short period of time what would have taken me a lot longer had I had I had I not have as much of it\nIs better for it to where you are today since our time is short and I think for so many people achieving your level of success after an accident might be enough but it didn't seem to be for you since you got back in the game so quickly as you mentioned um you\nEnough but it didn't seem to be for you since you got back in the game so quickly as you mentioned um you travel a lot this year and now the guest speaker on the topic of inspiration you're currently the chief information officer for the well known researcher at St Regis ... valley in Utah\nWhich is in the Park City area I Want to know about your experience there how do you interact with people all travelers specifically and what does it mean to you\nYou know one of the biggest thing is that scary for me as much as my greatest dog and pony show I had people say oh well I'll come see what this will be great and then we take our first round like oh you're actually really good friends and\nYes I've done it I've done it a lot and and as an amazing sport in\nIt's what we end up sharing together where I watch you is your growing up you watch me is I'm a ... or as I'm going up to lift I watch you if you're going up let's watch me and we're trying to achieve the same thing but it's the nature of\nLife and so many in so many ways I think it's such a great life lesson in that\nWe and we end up trying to perfect something in part of perfecting it is in doing it over and over again and sometimes people can have a great creative solution to whatever they're trying to do and a lot of the answer to getting better is\nMiley well let's talk about over and over again I I Want to expand within your cars and they listen to your right now you know I'm sure most people even count her there quickly inspired by your story but\nAm curious to know if you ever worked with a Traveller where travelers or people on the slopes at your job is who\nYou know there are skeptical or they're down on themselves and after a while you sort of help them turn around their motivation because as you know probably better than most of us out there a lot of it has to do with getting out of your head sometimes so are you able to reach them and connect with them and help them\nI didn't really um and I think that part of it\nIt it ... to learn something new if we get a new door opened it's super exciting for us and then went looking for what's the next thing but it's but as you said it's so easy to be stuck in the ... were in\nAnd get it from me is that I've done this for a long time I ski race for Thirty years and there's a whole lot of video and break things down into into it from the new show and so you see things in a different way than most people do and and\nWhat's fun to work with clients is that it through working with skiing you can open somebody's eyes to through an entirely new possibility that it can be one very very simple things and not only makes it all makes sense which\nThat that's where I think it is such a you know a great metaphor so many ways for what we're doing as people in general and how our our lives work\nThat well we're an hour from a different perspective\nWe want to turn this conversation a little bit right now because you are a very humble person who we can hear that\nBut you know Mary I think you would agree we have to turn this\nMore links you mean you can really hear your passion for scheme you and your first love obviously and also for what you're dealing with people but um I don't think this interview with the complete if we didn't have you give everyone a quick summary of what we think we might have been your biggest achievements ... traveling to and concrete mount Kilimanjaro in Africa\nYes and I I think conquering might well be a a a bit of a bit of an overstatement ... is still there right hand and will continue to be there long\nFriends I've seen the video of you do I mean I have to tell you right now I I I couldn't do it myself and I like to think I'm a pretty good shape I mean what you did was amazing it really was\nIt was it was a you know and I think part of that the motivation for climate Kilimanjaro in a lot of ways but but it was a it was the objective was much bigger than me myself as somebody with a disability I broke my back almost\nThirty years ago now and ended up in a wheelchair you become an advocate for a group that you never had any I joined it\nBut there are hundreds of millions of people in the world with physical disabilities and a lot of ways it's an invisible part of the population because from the time were little were taught not the stairs among the looks different\nAnd I wanted to give people an opportunity to stare so I felt like and climbing the mountain I really rode the power of hundreds of millions of people whose lives I was hoping to two and a and it was it was amazing it was difficult\nBut also I think they getting there were probably more difficult than men actually climbing the mountain\nWell you're talking about some of your travels 'cause I've seen some videos you even how you get on and how you're born in
