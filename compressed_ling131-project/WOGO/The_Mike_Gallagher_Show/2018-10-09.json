and said that they could have been the wild\nYeah yeah yeah yeah there was one that I knew of and then there was a second one as well who said that that's right you never heard another word about that but you know when the news cycle plays out\nAnd there's no more need for those individuals in the process they go away if you noticed for example\nWhat happened to the women who claimed that Roy Moore proposition them at the shopping mall all those years ago when they were all under age where they go what happened to that story\nDr Christine Blasey Ford says she is going to take no more steps to pursue her accusation against justice Kavanaugh she's done going back to teaching hope everybody leaves you're alone she goes away in other words once the political cycle plays out\nAnd the activists do their thing and they get the outcome the desired everybody just vanish is like I didn't even happen which makes you wonder doesn't it\nAlex you're on the Mike Gallagher show how you doing Alex\nHow to do my good thanks [noise] I hear the bottom line I'm as a general rule a vote on ideas not on party night on person and that's the wise thing to do now the last trying to convince as they call it we call it the ... the politics of identity\nThey vote on sex color et cetera they don't vote on ideas per se [noise] now I Know this upcoming election I Do have to vote party in order to perpetuate\nAny semblance of conservative ideas that are left in the Republican Party because and also as a general rule Republican Party is letting me down year after year after year after year that's only because we have President Trump\nWho is who is crazy Democrat his whole life but he's acting more conservative than anybody and so it's a strange world we live in but I just want to remind people that\nYou vote ideas you don't vote people anybody who votes person as opposed to voting ideas as misguided in school\nWell here's the thing very arms in Iraq and they don't take the time you see so here's the big\nPicture idea you you can't get bogged down I appreciate what you're saying I think you and I agree this year you better vote Republican there is not a Democrat as\nThe outset to make sure that there was no misunderstanding I'm going to vote party\nYou have to vote party you must vote party this year at the end of the day if you don't we're doomed if the Democrats will take the house in the Senate We're in big trouble that means we will will have won the battle in October and then lost the war\nIn November and again I hate to put it in these terms one thing I keep coming back to and I'm going to say I'm going to say it probably to my detriment\nThere are people genuinely anguished people who have been sexually assaulted people who were convinced because of all the activism and the media hype and all the stuff they don't even know the facts they don't even recognize\nThe the exhaustive lifetime of FBI investigations that Kavanaugh was subjected to and the bottom line no corroboration but there are people who are deeply deeply anguished over judge Kavanaugh becoming a Supreme Court justice\nAnd those people should not be mocked or ignored or marginalized or or or ... or whatever\nThis is a messy messy business making an accusation this thirty six years old\nIt's measuring because a you can cooperate in this case and be somebody got smeared very badly the Democrats handled this horrifically and everybody knows\nThere's a lot of bad actors who got involved in this I don't know the Christie blog Christine Blasey Ford is necessarily a bad actor Susan Collins set on sixty minutes last night she believes that should that ah Christine Blasey Ford\nWas sexually attacked she just said I Can't accept that\nHe did it because there is no cooperation and she said frankly I Believe that she was attacked but I don't believe she was attacked by Kavanaugh ... senator Collins walked away with the conclusion that it was somebody else\nWill never know we'll never know\nWhat I like is the acknowledgement\nThat the me too movement that has insisted that women are to be believed and that's the end of that\nThat's changed\nThere is a there's a counter narrative to that and it comes from no no lesser person than to want to work the founder of the me too movement for many years ago remember the me too movement which sort of reignited after the Harvey Weinstein affair\nHere was to water Burke on NBC's Meet the press yesterday and this was very important what you said about women being bullied because\nA lot of activists they take that literally and they say that's the end of that women are to be believed and that's the end of that you're ruined the man ... some of the even said if some men get ruined up their lives get ruined that's the price that has to be paid well that's baloney\nThat's nonsense here's what to want to break the founder of the me too movement said yesterday morning to Chuck Todd on NBC's Meet the press\nOne we paint believe survive and not\nTo leave them without investigating sounds leave them without a car in case and we have kind of ... in the country I'm not leaving thinking at women in particular are lying when they come forth with Alan thanks and when people come forward an allegation so that the macho believe survivor about can we start with the premise that people can not\nTalk to lie about their pain and atomic acts of violence if we start with that primary techniques to lean on his tail and then you can have it in that case and you can have an interrogation at the back and that kind of thing\nHappened paint believe people blanket and don't and back again and don't do any\nAnd that kind of thing that they believe people blanket at Dell and back again and don't do any of anything else but that believe that\nNow that's a very very important declaration very important her her her position is quite clear you you believe\nThe accusation\nBut you also have to believe\nIt sounds to me like you said the presumption of innocence and make sure there's an investigation to corroborate the charge were the relief factor dot com studios lots to cover today Thirteen minutes before the hour
