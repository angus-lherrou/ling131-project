moving forward this is one night job who destroyed these innocent lives to forty six year old guy\nBut the answer is how do you protect yourself from that\nAnd there's all these stories about hearing noises and people running and seeing dead people I mean awful people from their fifties all the way up to their nineties and like I said ... been charged with not a twenty nine cats make that clear in\nSynagogue shooting in Pittsburgh to criminal complaint is saying what I just said that he said a lot of anti Semitic stuff I Want to kill Jews got kind of thing they're committing genocide to my

is on the Jewish community and now in Crete security police presence synagogue across the nation or it was warm\nBut it's not just that remember their fins shootings in churches certainly\nAnd people killed so we know\nAnd I think that's all the time we live in the greatest country on the face of the earth and seeing people that are going to worship whatever their religion is and not coming out alive is just despicable and on it unacceptable so\nThings happening to bomb attack and printed bomb attacks on Thirteen\nUm the eleven people killed in the Pittsburgh Pentagon you know it certainly it shouldn't be a political certainly what happened shouldn't be political I Would agree with that any Democrat or Republican and says that\nI completely agree these divers for Republican from Ohio

and can be pointing fingers in that direction because they can go both ways on that as an\nAwful awful awful um that the political discourse the level of\nThat I think is the problem we get I mean I look I've been doing America Tonight for ten years I'm as frustrated as you think of affected my family deeply\nStatic stupid decisions on the hill that infuriated me I've gone to Washington every year I'm In it I get it because I always say I'm about vote vote vote if you want to have\nYou want to have a say in anything but certainly not at this horrible nasty level where you know you can have a day but you have to take out the person has legs no that's not how I was raised I Know a lot of you are good people you weren't raised that way\nThat's not how I was raised I Know a lot of you are good people you weren't raised that way\nDefinitely when have the rhetoric of in a in a different direction is what I say hey by the way hats off to the people who are donating to the synagogue victims they raised more than three hundred thousand and one day there's been vigils all over the place\nTo how to repair broken heart in when this happens um and ... you know again trying to help families\nThe insane violence all of that whatever it takes by the way the suspect has been charged and on the positive again\nWith twenty nine count stemming from the attack including violating hate crime laws um so you know there you go with that\nIn the meantime while that's happening\nYou know wild thoughts are there and so much is this lunar with tick nonsense um is going on there there are other things believe it or not hard to switch gears though right I mean the Pittsburgh Penguins or you're going to have a blood drawn to collect\nA collection to help the synagogue victims and there's you know all kinds of people doing all kinds of things and how do you pivot on this but there are a couple of other things that are\nHappening obviously the elections big vote you want to make a difference going vote get involved locally that's where it starts know who you're voting for when I was a kid that was and it's probably stems to me doing this show current events knowing what's happening all that stuff\nVital in in my life because my mother told me don't come to the kitchen table if you don't\nIf you're not versed on what's going on and I applaud her for that so that she knew that she wanted to raise two people that were going to be involved in what was happening in this great country you know growing up a stone throw away from where the founding fathers met with the declaration of independence outside of Philadelphia anyway\nSo I always think of the the right to vote as a really sacred one may always in my life it will\nBe important and I hope it's important in your life to then when you want to complain you can lay claim right um\nAnd that's what I that's what I think I mean honestly [noise] so we've got um just a couple\nOf weeks and then the official and then do you know voting that's it the Democratic campaigns and outside fundraising groups are expected to outspend the Republican in the final stretch for the midterms that I was looking at some\nUm numbers heading into the weekend actually not Democrats are expected to spend a hundred and forty three million on TV ads in the house races compared to the fix for the Republicans and there's a big surge on an ad by and you know so what's gonna happen there the Republican National committee has held a fundraising has a fundraising\nAdvantage over the Democratic National Committee committee rather joined the cycle\nThe Democratic congressional candidates combined raised more than one billion that crazy this election cycle through September compared to the seven hundred and nine million for Republicans\nAnd there's all kinds of numbers surrounding that but here's the bottom line Democrats are looking to get the majority in the house and Senate in the midterms\nThey have to gain twenty three seats to retake the majority in the house they have to gain two seats in the Senate to do the same thing in the upper chamber I think a lot of these races are close to close to call and they're going to come down to the wire and that's why again voting is so important for what you think\nShould happen look at who's running where and what's happening in your world because it could be closer than you think\nAnd you could have an incumbent that you think is naturally going to win but maybe it's not you know maybe it's not as obvious as you think that they're going to win it might be much much tighter let's put it that way I was talking about money for a second so many of you ask me about\nWhat I think about the stock market I think if you're talking about investing in anything any kind of investment you have if you can I don't care if you have a few dollars whatever it is I'm\nBeing serious about this diversify right diversify I've heard people say oh you can't make money on bitcoin but I Know people that made a lot of money on bitcoin because they believed and they got in in the beginning when it was right to get in\nSo it paid off dividends to them\nWe have definitely thing down markets and part of that ad on earnings people taking back money that's what happened I think it's all said again is that it last week at the ... called the market correction that's what happened I mean would it be great if we can all put money in the stock market and walk away with a ton of money\nYeah or you have the four oh one K. and then you work for a company luckily maybe some of you where you get that money and you put it in and it get matched and then you've\nGot to pick the basket of you know dark and you pick who you hope you pick on widely but you know it kinda barking just correction are armed chartered territory so with all\nHeading into the weekend the the market was was down again the NASDAQ the tech having our that closed down over to point with chairs and Amazon losing over seven percent of Google soccer's down to point two percent\nAnd you know has it run its course the Dow Jones ended two hundred Ninety six points or one point Nineteen percent it almost eight percent from down on the eight percent from its high on October third the answer is you pay attention you watch what's happening and\nYou know you get all these gain\nAnd it actually is going to come back it's going to there's going to be a correction some of it is higher interest rate\nBut um you watch any pay attention to what was the end you pay attention to what's going on negative\nI stay with us as I said yours are coming up with by\n[noise] not just conjuring still documents British in the once a year potato onion so you lose on no bigger fifty phone banks

this is life you move on but it it's it's really really really\nA tough terrible terrible thing and then I got two emails different kinds of email one from and who says Kate how much does the president there for what's happening in Pittsburgh we live in such a divisive thigh any I think you have to say that\nDonald Trump bears the burden for some of this he does he even care what's\nHappening here um you know look\nThis is the situation where you know we've just seen this happen a couple of different times with ... even though Trump has Jewish people in his life some of the the hatred and the divisiveness\nStems from the top do you think well you said he has his daughter can converted to Judaism and grandchildren on Jared Kushner his I'm One of his\n... you know other people in the lives so I don't think you can point to I think you pointed out I think you point to the\nEspecially specifically if you want to look at his own family um you can point to where we are in the country that as the president I think the responsibility for the president is just and it is to just issue that looks really not hatred and this is wrong than\nAny he didn't say that and I think we'll see more and that this week that I'm\nIn we can't you know this constant battle that everybody's having over ... we can have battles over ideology is we can we can have a team because it is like sports teams we can disagree on tons of things but gosh\nWe live and just awesome country where we have freedom of speech where we can argue and fight and disagree\nBut kill each other over that over ... over rhetoric over anger that's not even affecting the person who gets riled up I don't get it\nI mean I Do and I don't I I mean I just wow here's another one this one is from Julie and Julia Says Kate the I'm\nSo tired of people blaming charm for the shooting did he tell people to go and shoot Jewish people especially when you have them in his family love because he loved his daughter and grandchildren give me a break and he's responsible for anti Jewish rhetoric\nThat's ridiculous and people are just hate on Trump to another excuse to bag on Donald Trump and I don't think it's right here not the person responsible for the fires that are being cut across the country\nIs a world bomb in office if it were Jimmy Carter if it were one of the bushes we've stayed the same
