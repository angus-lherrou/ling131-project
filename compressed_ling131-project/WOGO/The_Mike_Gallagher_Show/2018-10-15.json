states the great experiment is liberty liberty in God we trust the pluribus unum our what I call American trinity wrote a book on the American troops would be still the best hope\n\nPeople are not

a lot of other parents the states should teach your children who the hell are you to educate your own children\n\nSo this has been a revelation in my life is the ultimate issues that are because this is an ultimate issue do we do we want to preserve liberty number one or take care of people\nBy take care take being taken care of now obviously there's there's got to be an element of being taken care of we we all understand that but an element is not dominant which is dominant liberty or the other\nEven being taken care of to the point where I don't want you to have the liberty to speak because what you say\nMay offend me there's another example of liberty being downgraded on behalf of being taken care of I I don't want to hear anything that may hurt me\n\nOkay ah let's\nGo to a are

selling point of relief factor well actually the greatest selling point is that it works for the great majority of people who use it\nBut the big selling factor is really this you can get all the pain

how many important subjects they're all which makes sense life is complex and it's tough to navigate it properly but here is another one of these examples this ultimate issues topic\nThat\nHuman nature does not urine for freedom\nLiberty is of value and as I said I as I've gotten\nMore experience in life I have realized so much is our values that instincts\nHappiness is a value marriage is a value children having children is a value\nIt's an amazing thing I miss almost there and and liberty liberty yes it's not it's not people urine to be free people urine I Am sorry to say more to be taken care of them to be free\n\nThe power of the power look look at the trade off the people make\nIn in Europe for example there's so much less freedom in Europe and the United states and we're catching up with less freedom but there there are more benefits\nAs benefits rise freedom declines that's their way of life like that because on one minute everybody sorry\n... you want to get that

appealing similarly\nWait wait wait that's my point ... forgive me that's what people would like they would they would like single payer for all I I I Would be very interested to see if we took a national vote only on that question would you like to nationalized healthcare every one is covered and doesn't have to pay dues\nWould just take it out of those people now are forced to want that because the health insurance premium for double double right oh\nNo no no All right so you have no no no no no I hear what you're saying so you have very articulate spokespeople on the other side saying folks don't vote for that your premiums will go down if we have medicine the same way we have food and everything else competitively priced\nSo we will have articulate people argue I I hear you perfectly\nThey'll say no no no don't worry you will have premiums obviously because it's going to be a private insurance market\nAnd then the other side will say folks don't you just want to be taken

couple of big things are hanging on my radar I don't know about yours but I like to say that this show and if you tuned in for the first time is all about what the buses in your neighborhood and mine frankly because there are a\nCommon denominator is the obvious one is always the weather everybody complains about the weather or they're excited about the weather fault temperatures nice Chris good weather in some places no in Colorado My pals in Colorado have been sending me some photos from there but always when you get the first\nCouple of weeks of snow everybody seems to be pretty happy\nAbout that and then we're coming off of another week of football so there's conversation about the NFL has you know it's your team in my team and just like politics everything in between\nAnd before anybody asked we did not have a winner for now the score now the score this week will be moved to our Thursday into friday show Thursday into friday show as I Will be in Las Vegas\nThursday into friday show as I Will be in Las Vegas vive I'm not going to try to sing [laughter] viva Las Vegas I used to live in Vegas\nAnd um it's interesting always to go back and it's so different from what I've lived there I Lived there\nIn the early nineties and the strip was still the strip is you know what I mean so if you've ever been there now it's so cavernous the casinos you could lose ten pounds I think if you just walk through like three casinos and you can't go straight down the strip so if somebody says hey I'll meet you at the other end\nYou're taking a new over a cab or the little monorail system they have because there's no way to do that you have to go in\nAnd out of casinos and leave your way through but some of the brightest minds from around the country will be in Las Vegas so I'll be there and I'll Bruce bringing you some of the sights and sounds of Vegas will have a jam packed show at the end of the week and that will include\nNail the score I'll remind everyone of that 'cause I hate moving it but we have to move it\nTo our Thursday in to friday show so sweet do the\nCheap movie reviews and we've talked about a couple of the movies there's one called venom that is making some noise so then I'm a star is born and then there's the Neil Armstrong flick bio pic called first man Ryan Gosling\nStars as Neil Armstrong I have to say I saw that the other wanted to see it because he's crazy about flight and space so we went to see it\nFirst man hauled in sixteen point five million twenty five worldwide twenty five ... worldwide been North America six teams\nSo that's not ethic but it's the first week a lot of times these movie sit out there for a while and kind of merit aid it's different from how it used to be and then the money starts to roll in a different direction but movies certainly for the most part aren't making the kind of money that they've made in the past unless we're talking about\nSome of the superhero stuff of sometimes the animation that kind of a thing but stars born\nAdded another twenty eight million to its hall so domestically almost a hundred million it'll certainly get past that in no time so that turned out to be a movie that was well received or received enough\nKind of um power where people were watching the Sunday night game\nAnd it's it whether they were fans of the team or not\nThey had something to cheer about because it was just kind of an exciting game so sometimes football can be the neither let's put it that way so it is a mailbag and some of you did\nSomething about the game so I'm just going to go to a couple of quick one this one is from jak who says Kate I'm going to get in on that action I Swear I Swear it I Swear to fall asleep I have crazy wicked hours sometimes I'm On the third shift but that's usually when it's your day off\nAnd um I listen to the show all the time I Love that I even turned my wife onto it and we love love love nail the score I promise you one of us is going to represent the fan on believable\nSunday night game I'm certain you saw it I've heard you on the other network as well very cool\nAnd I can't believe that it came down to a kick with the time winding down that's just vintage Brady but you got to give the chiefs credit they played one hell of a game and it was very very fun to watch that and forget about everything else for a while\nI how about this one this one is from Tom and he says Kate\nOn the misery index I have to tell you that my daughter in law has a house that uh had the roof ripped off outside of Mexico beach we were scared to death for um her\nHer friends and for others that we knew that were kind of in the the area but luckily nobody was killed and for the most part\nThey survive with their homes somewhat intact all others going to be some rebuilding their\nAnd a neighborhoods are math they got to tell you that in a lot of different pockets that you would be probably surprised about to take my mind off of all of that I was watching this Sunday night game normally I wouldn't necessarily watch that because my team\nIs the rams so I'm always busy watching the rams but don't watch very much of anything else I get\nAll uptight about politics and then I'm focused on my own business so I have to tell you I did watch and I was so impressed with this kid quarterback from Texas where did he go to college he went to Texas Tech cut my homes he did he went to Texas Tech and\nHe was um you know highly touted but did ... did anybody think that he was going to explode like this well of course any of the guys that\nDidn't coaching him from the time he was young I could tell you what kind of guilty had but a boy he is really showing off those skills to that last\nKind of guilty had but a boy he is really showing off those skills to that loss of the patriots just by kick forty three forty what a high scoring game and it's funny Sunday night games seem to be so close to the last one was all about defense in this one\nWas all about\nOff and so I guess that's just you know the way it goes and it was the decisive kind of a thing and it was a game that just kind of had championship Britain all over it so there you go\nI just move on to something completely different how about this this comes to us from Julie and Julia Says Kate I just got to tell you\nI understand Saturday Night live and all the poking that they do Donald Trump and the administration I Know they always do that with anyone who's in office and the politics of the day but I'm just tired of Alec Baldwin and it's our put spaces it was I have to say I'm a\nTrump supporter but I'm not offended necessarily by jokes however this joke is like gone on too long it's just not funny any more sort of like\nYou know when you tell a joke over and over again it's become a joke over and over again [laughter] oh well you said it I mean this is what happens on a show like Saturday Night live especially because\nIn it's heyday remember there were only a handful of stations to watch now it's I'm sure very difficult to get viewers so anything politically speaking especially in a polarized nation that's going to trip the needle in any direction [noise] that's exactly\nWhat that's exactly what's going to happen especially to lead off a show\nYou know it's interesting a politics of another note there are a lot of you were talking about the midterms and what did I think about the midterms will be finally see a lot of people come out and vote\nAnd I got this one from Barry who says Kate do you think because of all the vitriol between the Democrats the Republicans the undecided than whatever you want to say\nWhat we saw with the whole Kavanaugh saying and what we see what the Russian investigation and just constantly every single day the conversations do you think we're going to see more people vote in the mid term elections this time around\n...\nYou know if you look at polls when people are asked are you going to vote and have you registered and they kept pumping out all the list of what when you had to be registered by across the country you would think that and you know my thing is this I don't care how you vote vote and then you can complain\nSo we live in a country where you're not getting shot when you go to vote your they're not stuffing the ballot box like I saw in Mexico scared me to death\nWhen there was shots that were above my head because we were with a camera crew and I had no clue what was going on between the three in the pan east is but I Know that I saw that and it was frightening 'cause to me it seemed like such a lay up in our country it is to just go and vote\nAnd I think you you owe it to yourself to to exercise that right and I think what happens is for some people\nThey'll say who cares I hate I hate what's happening I'm not gonna vote for anyone\nBut that I'm being like that and not paying attention\nIs what allows us to keep going down the same lethargic path and then complaining about what we don't like there's a better chance you might find somebody that you like you might encourage somebody had run starting locally\nWe could change\nYou know the game around but you can't do that if you consistently have that that attitude so\nI I I'm always hopeful that more people voted any of the elections and I hope the mid term elections bring anyone out who's eligible think about your own neighborhood ... you know locally what's happening in your state some important issues what's on the ballot it's so easy to find out\nAnd you know arm yourself with the fact that you want to hear about and go and vote now the latest\nPoll I saw said Seventy seven percent of voters are say there is certain to vote in the mid term elections let's see what those numbers add up to be\nHow about this I got this one from Gordon he said Kato would you still do the radio shows if you won\nThe mega millions or the Powerball ... well that's a loaded question because here's the thing nobody hit\nThe Powerball jackpot on Saturday So you might want to go buy a Powerball tickets\nA nearly a billion dollars are you kidding so if you look at the if you get mega millions I guess in the Powerball we're talking about serious money so the mega millions jackpot for Tuesday is\nThe largest ever in the game it's six hundred and fifty four million the mega millions six hundred and fifty six million\nAnd um so the jackpot for the Powerball is going to be three and a forty five million I guess it's crazy the mega millions record of six hundred and fifty six\nBy the way so I don't know\nIf I Won [laughter] if I Won\nA that kind of lottery I just you know what I Do I have some cool people and radio that have had to really eke out a living I that's what I Would do the answer your question honestly I just buy a radio station right I'd talk to ... we'd syndicated\nPrograms whatever\nAnd that's the answer I mean I Love doing this so in some form that wouldn't go away um but all the people I Know that have been messed over in the business and that are awesome at what they do [noise] I Would get a gift for them\nThat's what I was honestly at least for a while at least for a year or so right now what are the chances of me winning like a zillion\n[noise]\nTrue for men are over senior living the fields and lose like [noise] or actor campus has its own professional salon fine dining chefs daily activities and weekly church services with Robert Bob Hoekstra has been on for more than Thirty years\nBeing ... motor community yours truly an honor

even considering getting online you can do it no one gets on my own if you were thinking of an issue in your high school diploma\nA I think both of these have\nThe makings of a good\nChampionship series on both sides to fight for the right to be in the world series ooh\nDoes you know the NBA is going on well yes of course it is and people are talking about predictions and what's gonna happen and what the season looking like and all of that because this is the time of year that you do that\n[laughter] when we we look at later on it's all about LeBron James and has moved to Los Angeles and people are picking the warriors still for the three peat so is it another Oakland title\nBefore the um [noise] you know before\nThe move or not because after forty seven years at oracle arena the warriors are going to move to the chase center\nIn San Francisco it's always tough for a loyal fans and you think well you know how far apart is that if you know anything about San Francisco where some of these big cities that's like a world of difference\nPlaying at oracle arena versus San Francisco getting their all that stuff blah blah blah playing in Oakland versus playing in San Francisco it's all about stadiums how much money is being put up\nHow much is a taxpayer paying what is going on with sales tax what is the owner\nHauling in where should we put the stadium I've worked in places where that's been such a major discussion when I talk about the buzz in the back yard and the man cave that's part of the bugs because do you want to pay for it or not\nAnd a lot of times people especially if they have no interest in it why are we paying how can we have to pay more\n... and sometimes you really get jobs on what you think is going to be a good situation because you always get sold this idea that how wonderful is going to be and then it doesn't turn out so wonderful and it just kind of depends on where it is I suppose the team and then what's around it\nAnd how easy it is to get in and out and does it gum up the traffic in one way or another because isn't it all about traffic I mean what is what's the common denominator always say the weather is the traffic is one of them right\nFor sure the um\nWork situations that's another one where you work and do you have hang dog look when you're pumping the gas and you're going to work and the person next to you does something and uh and you just want to get in and out of work quickly or is the opposite I mean these are little three major major bullet points right\n[laughter] but the arena when there's ever a fight over an arena and there was a fight over this arena\nWhen there's ... whenever there's a fight then it becomes sticky and\nPeople get upset when are getting left behind the fan bases don't like it and then who's pulling you know who's paying for it and how are they pulling people in and then what happened to the ticket prices\nBecause a lot of times these ticket prices which are out of reach for the common than become a little bit higher even after that\n'cause they have to they have to charge up somehow and they pass it on\nA little bit ticket wise even if they have specials which especially in the NBA a lot of times they'll have some good specials and they do that in major league baseball I Would venture to say really 'cause it's such a crazy marathon and baseball during the regular season\nIt may be of all the sports the cheaper sport like when there's like dollar hotdog nights or whatever to get cheaper tickets especially the team is doing well if the team is doing well yeah forget about it it's much different situation\nAnd college football a lot of people whether they went to college or not it's a college that's in there we'll houses in their backyard\nPeople always liked to talk about college football and it was an interesting week because Notre Dame ... now is in the running for one of those semifinal games will see what the college football selection committee says but Notre Dame\nAnd the a P poll comes in at number four so that would put them in the range if the selection committee agrees with that you've got Alabama of course the runaway number one\nOhio State to LSU jumps back to number five LSU\nWith a huge win feeding Georgia and number two really slow laying them college football to me is so interesting on Saturday when you wake up and you start watching there's so many games crazy right now there is only\nTalk to your team and then the others the eight rank team's overall that lost on Saturday including on beaten seems Georgia West Virginia and Colorado how 'bout that stay with us [noise]\n\nFinal phase of extermination there's got to governments now Anders population die out becomes evident you know what is the time of
