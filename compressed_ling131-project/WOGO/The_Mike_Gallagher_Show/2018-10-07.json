David I'm going to need to see some ID because a lot of people claim to be related to Rush Limbaugh and I'm not going to believe every Tom Dick and Harry they walked in here are you really a brother of has a sibling of some kind yes when I Do\nGo to the family reunions these distant cousins come up and say I'm related to Russ\nNot rush [laughter] not I I Want to talk about Russ\nI Love the idea that even his own relatives can't say rush\nOut and what he's ever been named rush before rush but now there's an are you younger or older than Russia younger you're younger you know what I was just going to say how come you look so much healthier and younger than your brother died because you were younger than he had exactly the kid ... year his kid either your kid brother okay well ah look\nUh the reason you're here is not because you're related to Rush Limbaugh although congratulations on that very few people achieve that in their lifetime allies that it's not an easy because I tried for a while and then I'd rather just not going to happen but um\nBut you've written a book written so many wonderful books and here I'm holding in my hand another one the title of it and Jesus is risen\nPaul in the early church you did not used to be a Christian and you certainly did not used to be a Christian author you have to you you dove into this thing almost like you believe that\nYeah yeah uh interesting I've always so enjoyed our interviews because you bring up things that no one else does\nThat was one of them when I asked my points no but you know what I Want to know seriously you are you you said is on the program before before my listeners people just tuning in how did you you're a lawyer how did you come to faith what happened\nI it was a skeptic as you mentioned and that I was a seeker I I always believe in God that I didn't embrace the God of the Bible didn't embrace Jesus Christ didn't really believe that an all loving God would allow people to suffer a much less a turtle damnation and all that\nAnd um I finally started studying it reading apologetic books\nPaul Little um you know Josh McDowell Norman guys are and I finally uh overcame my so called intellectual doubts\nAnd then I later place my faith in Christ but I\nI just I I I don't understand how anyone can think that there is a cod I mean Romans one I don't understand you know that you look at the creation and you look at the ah you look at everything I Know the cynics can point poke holes and all of that but if they have an open mind they will understand\nBut but I'm raising the Bible was a little difficult and what I didn't realize is that people had placed\nSeeds in my path all along and I didn't realize it until after I became a believer little things that if they hadn't happened if God and his Providence hadn't put people in my path dropping those seeds I may not have become a Christian of course I was always destined to be one because God I I don't I'm\nAs you could you believe in their predestination guard I actually don't even know what I whatever I Want to get into that but but usually you you I I just want to see how how you were raised because how many how many uh kids were in your family just Russian I\nJust you and Russell yeah [laughter] and I call him Russ Russ un Russ where they were just two kids know how many years apart\n[laughter] and I call him Russ Russ un Russ where they were just two kids know how many years apart are you to have you now this is the ... have you always been two years apart yes it's amazing you see that's\nVery rare it is that's very very rare of fluids ... it was just the two boys you're ... you're like me and my brother we're we're about two years apart and uh I guess my question is did you go to any kind of church on Sunday\nOh yeah yeah we were raised in Methodist Church\nIn what in what a part of the state where part of the country the southeast Missouri okay so you went to church so you didn't think it was a bunch of bologna\nNo no no no and my parents were Christians and and I I I just not like I was cynical about it I just I had trouble with it I didn't understand how it was fair and all that\nBut but what I was going to tell you a minute ago when you so rudely cut me yes I always tried to cut people off rudely otherwise what's the point yeah but what was that I hadn't really given it a chance it's like okay so I'm passing judgment on a thing that affects my eternal life\nRene not to be confused with\nThe great Keith Richards a who's had many blood transfusions at fifty thousand dollars a pop but we can't get into that now because I'm sitting here with the brother of Rush Limbaugh David Limbaugh book your book is just a beautiful book\nFor many reasons but the title a Jesus is risen that is you you realize that that title alone is a kind of spiritual warfare when you declare Jesus has risen\nThe demons tremble that's a fact uh the subtitle is Paul in the early church the demons do not Trumbull at the subtitle but uh but it's just so great that you're writing all these books but I Want to get back to your story because I Love the idea\nThat you're very rational you're a lawyer and he got the point in life we for some reason and and listen let's be honest it was probably your wife's prayers for you because she knew that if you did not become a Christian she was in sin for having married you so she had to prove\nThat somehow she knew ... word of knowledge that you'd be Christian otherwise she's in trouble right\nAnd we wouldn't raise our kids in an overall Christian home what\nRight we do not exactly good things so ... so she's praying for you and I suspect strongly actually that that's part of the reason you're you're a thoughts began to focus as they did although who knows right now\nBut I just love the fact that you've dug into this to see if it's really true but you live in a culture and I live in a culture where unless you're hanging out with Jesus freaks you believe this stuff\nMost people are very happy floating along they don't even say they're seekers they're not seekers they're floating along I think kind of\nWanting it not to be true because uh it it might their lives might have to change or something like that\nI think there's no question about it that are intellectual doubts are sometimes masks for other issues that we have in our life whether it's wanting to continue to sin I'm not talking about major sin murdering people or something whether it's drinking too much whatever\nUh that that you whatever lifestyle you want to engage in\nA ... so it might be a deterrent and you and it might be a deceitful thing where you think this is intellectual now there are some intellectual issues\nBut I don't think that's ultimately what keeps people from believing I I think Christianity is based on solid evidence overwhelming evidence actually and and it's based in reason\nBut faith and read and and so faith and reason are compatible but they're not the same thing and you you ultimately take a leap of faith with just a matter of the will but in my case I had to overcome my so called intellectual obstacles before I Would allow myself to take that step\nBut but state by its own definition require something more than just a rational thought you can't argue someone into the kingdom because it is a matter the will and some people are are are predisposed to dispose against it or their mindset is against the war will be thing and um\nYou can argue with the what you can discuss things with them you can show them how they're some of their doubts are not grounded in reason right uh and we have affirmative evidence to show how Christianity makes more sense than anything else but you can't ultimately get them to take the leap\nThink it's interesting because I I Would say a lot of people say you know faith is a leap in the dark and I I've always disagreed with that I've said faith is a leap in the light because good when you believe in something that is actually true it's like saying [noise] I don't know this one plus one equals to thing I just I'm not convinced and it's like\nIt doesn't matter whether you're convinced it is true so when you leap\nTo grab onto one plus one equals to you're grabbing out of something that is true and not to grab onto it is really to be foolish but the point is that even something as simple as one plus one equals two on some level requires an act of the will to accept it you know and and to accept face\nI've always said I'm anybody knows I mean I've written a book on miracles but the ultimate miracle is conversion why because there is no way a human being can come to believe\nIn the God of the Bible apart from the grace of God really it's kinda like Lazarus is a rotting corps he didn't do anything to sit up God did it All right and so it's not like we're sick entering in need of all of a little medicine\nGod did it All right and so it's not like we're sick entering in need of all of a little medicine to feel better we're corpses in need of resurrection and in face is just like that when somebody goes from not believing to believing\nSomehow got has to be involved and that's the dishes the huge mystery so you're right I mean I've done the same thing I've written books of apologetic since I've tried you're trying to help people along because it's not like that's not important\nBut at the end of the day it's prayer and it's God and so that they are to me that's the mystery you know like why did this happen to you when it happened 'cause you could have just kept drifting\nNo question but when you look back and when you remember that people like a a friend of a friend who was visiting a ... from his law school my friend and he both with law school in Texas they were visiting over Christmas I was um we went to my friend's\nParents' home started talking and randomly Christianity came up that wouldn't come up and my ordinary conversation and Steve Springer my friend's friend who was with him as a cool guy cool guys aren't Christmas especially not then there are a lot of them now right but in why if we would have been caught dead at those nerdy think excuse me what is in way of\nMethod is you've found Asian or what they do something like that yeah maybe that's not what it is I didn't even knowing that I Know what it was\nWhatever it is was on cool man\nYeah ... it's so ... so a Steve start talking about it and I'm kind of making fun of it in a non non smart all the way but I wasn't very charitable he's he's a cool guy all the girls love him he's a Christian Girls that can't be but but now he goes into his\nBedroom and his where he was staying at his friends my friends' parents and brings back a Bible in any started showing me reference by how you know if I'd ever seen a reference Bible I didn't ... know to write showing how\nOld Testament passages are tied the New Testament how New Testament an Old Testament are internally integrated I must tell you a light went off right there and\nAh he also was very patient with me uh in in ... and told me about Jesus in his lab and everything I kinda filed that then later Twenty years later or maybe ten years later or whatever it was he came back to visit my friend Peter\nTender and I said bring him over he came to my house\nI he I was a Christian then I went to my library got the Bible that he'd given me came back the guy got really emotionally couldn't believe that I that that had such an impact on I'm telling you without that pivotal piece I may not have become a Christian I'm not saying it was random by the way I think it was superintendent by God corps yeah but\nI think it moved in so much you wanted to talk about it in his church back in Texas a and ask my permission if you could give his testimony and talk about that\n[noise] I Love it you know I mean everybody's path is different and it's so fascinating to me but I I Want to encourage everybody who's listening this is not for other people is just for you would see the true or it's not and if it's true\nBy the way it can only bless you there are people I think they have this fear is comparison me it's going to make me live say that as absolute garbage I Want to state that clearly\nThat is garbage if you think that believing in Jesus will make you into a weird person it'll only make you into weird person if you want to be ... percent but\nHonestly if you want to be who you are supposed to be you know if you want to get to your grave\nUh always wondering who am I really supposed to be well then you can avoid God but God is kind of like the gas in the tank cars and go anywhere without gas on the tank and I I just want to say to people you know who find themselves in a position like you to say honestly the idea that this is scary in some way is a total lie\nIn and picking up on that I I think there's a there's a lot of paradoxes in Christianity in my view and I talked about some of them in one of the books\nBut I think some some of this pre Christian had this fear that Christians don't have fun they don't enjoy life there like I said they're ...\nThey're they're regiment of the robotic they don't they don't live a robust life and if they do is just to be goody goody isn't the kind of people you wouldn't want to hang around with not cause you Baskins enjoy just 'cause they're they're not happy people some of them the kind that I'm not so there are a bunch of well\nI I Know I can give you named after the show okay [laughter] but\nBut what I didn't understand until later and I began to study it I said how can you reconcile this idea that Christianity gives you liberty Paul talks about um ... it it'll set you free ... believe in Christ and all such for what okay here's here's the answer that paradox\nBefore you become a Christian\nYou are a slave to send it is your master I don't mean that kind of stand your terrible person all we're all the praise but I'm not in just vernacular labor macular I'm not saying if you're a terrible person may be a very nice for\nBut you're a slave to that kind of lifestyle in his it has dominion over over you when you accept Christ is your personal savior\nYou are a liberated from sin and you become a slave to Christ now what does that mean that that that doesn't mean you're free ... and Paul addresses these cars that me and I'm Free to sin\nNo emphatically no it means you're now a slave to Christ slave I don't want to be a slight know what you understand that you then out of love and the ... you want to even raised yourself to a higher standard of morality or out of obedience and love for Christ and and what it all means but you're not down to you're not living under\nArbitrary not are not living under the the set of rules they transcend that Christ goodness and love\nA transcends all that and you want to be a beating and you're no longer a slave descent\nAnd I want to follow up with this when we come back folks were talking to David Limbaugh brother of Russell and ah this is the architects his show I'm not a sibling of Russell's but I'm aware of his work we'll be right back to the book is Jesus has risen\nThat Pat Boone here again and I assure you I have never before endorsed a pain relief product not until now\nNot into relief factor came

about going through the scripture what you've done in your book now this is the new one Jesus has risen Paul in the early church\nYou are effectively entertaining the scripture another's you're doing a Bible commentary even though you you you're presenting it as a popular book because it is a popular book but the point is that you're also doing a Bible\nCommentary you're helping people because and by the way that is biblical people always say well that's the word of God is not about the word got well by the way in the word of God says uh unless somebody explains it to you how are you going to understand that you need somebody who gets it to help you understand what it says that if you just open up the Bible and start reading a lot of people are going to get stuck I\nGot stuck you need somebody to help you and that's what your books are doing\nExactly thanks for saying I I saw a guy in Twitter somebody promoted my book on Twitter and some Senate comes on there no thanks I I got the Bible that's all you know that's not all you need but we have sunny schoolteachers by the way\nThey can you can you imagine we just kind of say like the level of of foolishness that his on social

read anything but the Bible exactly but there are people will say that thing and guess what in the Bible in\nX. okay Paul is in in in Athens okay preaching to the Athenians what does he do he quotes pagan poets in the scripture absolutely okay so there's this idea you can't even escape pagan poets when you read the word of God\nSo folks that that is going to challenge some people the logical but I'm not challenging you the Bible is challenging you\nAnd by the way he he he cited pagan poets not only did show that he was learned but to relate because he he said I become all things to all people

more than much and want to come here Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump and how they govern any Trump's numbers certainly the numbers Trump's numbers aren't all that bad right now he's hovering around fifty percent which\nGiven the circumstances I think is good bordering on excellent what's say\nYeah I I think you're right those are strong numbers and you know Ronald Reagan finished out his term it over sixty percent but there was often times especially during the tough times of the Reagan presidency where he was well below fifty percent so uh uh you know read at the present moment that Trump's on a really nice path\nNow Trump and Reagan and correct me if I'm wrong seem to me they have kind of management styles that are almost opposite\nMean Reagan was a consensus was a consensus builder he was moved Trump leads in a very different way with similar outcomes and resolve somehow you tell me how you would characterize differences in in style in management style\nYeah you won't find a link to executives more different and our management style a you know Ronald Reagan\nGentleman par excellence rarely had a mean word for anyone a great sense of humor an optimist a\nYou know he led the country with an optimistic outlook and um uh but you know in the Reagan days are no such thing as tweets and um he had to communicate to his message through a mainstream media and the mainstream media consisted of\nThree networks you know a nascent CNN at the time you know several national newspapers and radio of course but that was a way Reagan had to communicate and so he had to rely on\nRadio of course but that was a way Reagan had to communicate and so you have to rely on powerful powerful communication skills or you know a number of what she built up there being an actor\nTrends show crime

Jackson none of this\nWell it goes without saying it's not part of his mandate what they are investigating rush of the White House collusion in the emails but even beyond that\nNone of what they are even talking about with Manafort his anything even remotely to do with Trump or the White House at all they have um unfair of violence they've got taxis uses is completely separate matter and yet the press\nAnd treat this with such credibility and now you have the possibility of metaphor to actually going to jail for life I think it's a tragic story\nNot just for the individuals involved in this case a Manafort but because of the way it's it's twisting Arab entire judicial process which is supposed to be\nA a process whereby\nPeople are put on proper notice or about where the government is looking a there is due process uh guarantees that are put into place and in this case uh none of that really seems to apply and the fundamental flaw in ah with regard to what Mahler is doing\nIs the mandate which was simply a letter or\nNot like Ken stars case where he was appointed by the court a and have\nThat authority and that\nUh that process uh operating\nBut in ... case it's just this letter that uh supposedly provide some limitations on his investigation or to look at the so called Russia collusion\nBut ah if you read the the letter and I don't have it right in front of me but if you read the letter it goes it allows him to go pretty much anywhere he wants to go\nUh spend however much money he wants hire as many people as he wants to go on for however long he feels it's necessary and to look at anything and he's come up with this case involving Manafort ah bringing\nCharges against Paul Manafort that they have nothing whatsoever new it's Trump is really very little even to do with Russia at all\nYou outlined it very well I remember let's look at the tactics that scoop\nThe knee just an ethical and brutal tactics practice by more what he's doing with Michael Cohen the way he's got all the way you got ... ... ... uh to flip against Manafort had ... any techniques like this you would have been run out of town and do you agree\nI Do now part of the problem is of course that\nA a favor tactic of federal prosecutors in state prosecutors also but less yeah we're talking here about federal prosecution's a favorite tactic of federal prosecutors is to find\nThe weak points or the pressure points and use those to squeeze individuals to then get information for\nOther people a a a king pin for example a show as a general rule that's a tactic that is sort of time honored shall we say about it can be abused and I think in this case involving Muller it is being abused\nAnd unfortunately there's no judicial check on that the judge in a in a a Manafort investigation and case for example a\nRevolt a Manafort's bond a for no I don't think any real legitimate reason shirt late ah and I think all of this boils down to the simple fact that the Manafort ah had something to do with Trump he ran it was a campaign chairman\nOr nothing or other male only ... only about forty five seconds left I Want to get your that's an issue in from fire moment there come a time where you should do that should do it after the election how would you advise them on that\nI Would do it at a checkpoint as it becomes crystal clear that there was no real point to this and that is simply a process of going after individual after individual after individual to try and find something on Trump and that becomes crystal clear the system is clearly being abused\nAnd Trump should at that point step in and say enough is enough bond order style\nAbout our friend Bob Barr for the next attorney general of the United states [laughter]\nWell I Am not holding my breath for\nThat I Will I'm going to give them ... thank you so much coming up next we're going to plunge into what else the armor oh so few states [noise]\nGoing back to the wall for a minute on immigration do you think that Trump will fight over the wall with the budget bill this fall how how intensify you think we'll see\nDefinitely think he's going to fight I think he is running out of opportunities to really funded assuming that the midterms go ... you know more or less well for the Democrats it's going to be tough\nI mean that the midterms go ... you know more or less well for the Democrats it's going to be tough for him to have a better shot and fun to get a you know in in the first term at least assuming that there is a shock and\nAwe you know if he doesn't get it done while he's got the house bill so I think there's going to be some degree of fight the question is will listen to people both on Capitol Hill and inside the\nWhite House are going to tell his wise I'm going to shut down it'd be really bad nobody's\nSure about that are you sure about that does that maybe that's exactly what he needs particularly if we think the election is going against Republicans\nWell not necessarily sure how it would play it but I Know that that's the advice that he was going to get it started with play badly and you know in in in many cases they shut down to play with the Republicans earlier this year uh I think they won some shutdown fights over immigration so that might\nEmbolden Trump's try it in the these red state Democrats in the Senate cut it back down and then maybe they backed down this time\nYou know it's a hard one I I you know in the age of thinking about Ryan and Obama and McCain and Obama I mean of course we Republicans lost all of this shutdown\nShowdowns but I'm not sure how it would play now I'm just thinking about how this goes it might do differently I mean I guess we lose swing voters we will lose some swing voters but we might pick up an awful lot of base voters from doing something like that\nWhich we quickly before because we really didn't have a leader with Ryan in Maine or the head of the party and you really couldn't pick up many base voters because there wasn't any excitement so with a with a shutdown oh you did was essentially lose swing voters right now is it different right\nYeah I mean there there are so that certainly you know you did lose a swing voters there's also the fact that the media coverage would be so unreal ethically hostile and the event that something like that happen and I think you know there's a wildcard here is that Trump has been more effective and pushing back\nAt some of that at least with the base a than a prior Republican leaders have been so that that\nMight be something that we're asserts that picture a little bit\nMedia coverage as we reached the point\nWhere it already is unrelenting hostile and never stopped paying right it's in the middle of August and it still unrelenting lay hostile with Cohen and Manafort and obviously that will continue after Labor Day I mean maybe Trump is just completely written off maybe the White House has written off the establishment media doesn't even try to influence that cycle anymore\nThey may not try to influence the cycle but they certainly try to use it to their advantage so they they definitely want to counter punch\nA when they see particular story is circulating like the you know the person who is with detained by ice to the initial viral stories about how he was taking his wife's pregnant wife to the hospital\nLater came out that he was wanted for murder in Mexico\nOr so a lot of Trump allies really highlighted that a fact so you know I think he still has even if he's not necessarily rely on the media to ... to get his message out I think he still has a sort of symbiotic relationship with the media where\nYou know he needs them to sort of fire up his base point out two things that are going on in the media doesn't like in the media really\nNeeds him to a gym about ridge and and and ratings\nLet me let me ask you this would seem to me on the immigration issue the president met a couple of minutes remaining in the segment the president has the numbers\nOn his side I'm looking at numbers since two thousand one since nine eleven sixty three thousand American citizens have been killed by illegal aliens\nThat's essentially eight to one because the illegal aliens only make up about three percent of the population there they they just ... partially do a lot more killing by anyone's numbers seems to me the numbers are on the president's side\nOn Trump has done more to highlight the victims of illegal immigrant crime that I take any major Republican leader has ever done I think ... you know you have one side you know the Democrats and and then some of the the John McCain when other party that really emphasize\nImmigrant success stories or you know the high school valedictorian and the store owner and the entrepreneur and those you know are all true and and fair enough Trump has pointed to some of the negative side of the ledger\nA far greater degree than I think we've ever seen in recent years\nJim mantle Washington Examiner talking all about immigration Jim ... he will be able to have you back again thanks so much for coming up next our friend

Republicans had hoped the FBI would finish its investigation early allowing them to vote on Kavanaugh and by the weeks\nAnd at ... why are they able to finish early because when I go to drop what are they supposed to do I mean since you don't know the house where this allegedly took place\nWhat are you going to try to see if their DNA sample I mean what how what all you can do is talk to the people who have been named to the people\nWho have come forward and said well I saw similar behavior or something like this or something like that\nAnd uh that's it and\nBy the way apparently um for\nJulie ... uh no this is not part of the FBI investigation because that just ... Michael ... stuff and uh that is not considered one of the credible stories\nThat they were called upon to investigate and it is unclear how much they've investigated a doctor for its background\nUm meanwhile [noise] there's this um\n... what you hear again and again and again everywhere\nIs that somehow Brett Kavanaugh should be disqualified because of the tone of his testimony that the one thing I I Want you to knows that virtually everyone in this montage\n... everyone in this montage was opposed to him before his testimony there were opposed him before anyone and heard of Christine Blasey Ford they aren't opposed to him because of his testimony they are opposed to him because of\nHis allegations against him of a sexual assault they're opposed to him because he has a constitutional is conservative listen\nHe had exchanges with Senator Feinstein was that are close our with others that I felt when over line [noise] um he was clearly a Pulitzer and aggressive angry\nMajor wonder about issued a building\nIn my case yes to me it was to have you that was not a suitable for a person who would be a judge on any court much less the Supreme Court when a judge Kavanaugh with all partisan left wing conspiracy beyond everything\nI think that was the disqualifying moment Jordan show the demeanor of a judge at the hearing what\nHe was angry with ranting he was ...

the Michael ... shows so much discussion recently about the Supreme Court and the direction that it's going and what can be decided and what can be decided and not all about to Brett Kavanaugh's personal life\nBut look one of the things is clean court has decided is that believe it or not we in America still have a right to read the Bible and even to talk about and that right\nIs being defended and champion even for students in public schools it's a tomorrow October fourth is going to be bring the Bible to school day it's sponsored by focus on the family\nAnd it is the fifth year that they're doing this last year they had five hundred thousand students who participated across the country\nAnd uh this year they're hoping to have even more it's my pleasure to welcome gym daily who's had to focus on the family which is an international Christian communications ministry a base in Colorado Springs Colorado I've had the great pleasure speaking for focus on many occasions\nA gym of first of all and people are hearing this and a lot\nUh Jim\nFirst of all and people are hearing this and a lot of people are saying is it illegal to bring the Bible to school\nAnd Michael it's great to be with you absolutely not that's the thing in our culture today these religious liberties that we have had for over two hundred and forty years in this country or they're simply not exercised every student has the right to bring a Bible to school if they wish to read it during lunchtime and free time\nNot during class time where it's disruptive\nBut you can do that and it's completely legal in fact we provide a one sheet illegal statement for teachers and administrators who invariably come to the student on this day bring your Bible to school and they'll say hey it's illegal for you to have that you're giving your Bible we've had teachers confiscate Bible\nInto the student shows that once she legal brief and they read it and go oh okay it looks like it is legal here's your Bible back it's almost like this a head in the sand kind of environment where we don't understand our religious liberties in this country anymore\n... yeah and what's strange year as I'm sure a lot of the people on the left who would say oh it's terrible to bring a Bible to school would absolutely defend any child who wanted to bring a caller on\nThe school board or wanted to bring the communist manifesto whenever they want to bring\nRight absolutely and we get that question off and why why don't you champion that we're we're Christian ministry we champion bringing the Bible the Old Testament New Testament to schools for Christian kids to read on their own or with others and invariably this as a lunch setting typically we're a little Thirteen fourteen year old girl or a boy\nOr has four or five friends around the table and the reading the book of John or something from the Old Testament it's completely right I mean you think of Michael what's so frustrating to think of the impact of the Bible on western civilization\nAnd here in this country people are wrongly saying teachers school administrators wrongly saying hey what are you doing with that that's illegal here that sounds like something from the old Soviet Union\nNot know it does entirely and see what what I ah I see from the materials that you prepared for this\nYou are emphasizing for kids they shouldn't be brandishing the bibles in front of people and saying unless you read this book with me you're going to go to hell a war I I hate you unless you come in and joined me and my face\nI you you're also emphasizing to kids who bring their bibles to school to try to bear witness you know winning and kind and a friendly way\nAbsolutely I mean one of the things I often ask friends who you know have difficulty believing in who Jesus was I say you know what what's he missing in his resume he was a person who exposed\nReally espouse loved joy piece goodness kindness mercy and those are the value of traits that we like to teach the kids to express to their friends and to the people at the school that they bring their Bible to one of the great stories last year we had a girl who was a little shy little embarrassed to do this but she did it\nAnd to her surprise all twenty eight kids in her classroom at a public school ... bibles but they didn't even know each other we're Christians but the whole class was\nAnd she was astounded and that's the kind of thing we're hearing across the country that you know three or four or five or even the whole class will end up bringing their Bible to school and they're going wow we never knew\nAnd I think Michael part of the problem here in our culture today for the left in the progressive to talk about the um you know the harm of shaming which is good that's a good message they sure do a lotta shaming for people of faith\nTo the point where these kids are embarrassed or feel they can't bring their bibles to school or talk about God and that's not a good in that environment for us to be in today everybody should bring their ideas their thoughts their opinions and their faith into the public square\nAnd again it's can only enrich a at the exchange of ideas which is supposed to be part of education I take a gym daily a focus of the family you would have no objection if some other kids on bringing the Bible to school day which is tomorrow\nOr if some kids wanted to bring in all up ... Christopher Hitchens' book God is not great or some other atheist quote classic ... child one of the counter bring the Bible to school day was that kind of book you'd have no objection that would you\nOr Roger you by Feeding America\n[noise] W O O G o highly Chippewa falls over Blair\nWay of saying hey\n[noise]\nUSA you're waiting on the news was Chris Barnes\nJudge Brett Kavanaugh now justice Kavanaugh's taking his place on the U.S Supreme Court after a very close vote to confirm him by the U.S Senate yesterday\nOn this vote the eyes or fifty the Naser forty eight\nRepublican leader Mitch McConnell referring to that close vote was ... or kind of boring anyway right after the confirmation vote the top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said\nJudge Kavanaugh's confirmation is a low moment for the Senate for the court for the country\nIndonesian authorities there there'll be wrapping up the search there's Thursday for victims of last month's earthquake and tsunami Seventeen hundred are known dead thousands are still missing\nWhat's expected to become tropical storm Michael later today could threaten the Gulf Coast by Wednesday Mrs usa radio news\nThere's no question you need omega threes but which forum should you take\nFish oil or grill oil scientists have debated this for years luckily there's a new solution to satisfy everyone gets called Carrillo may go fifty plus it combines ultra pure fish oil enjoying soothing crew loyal to gather in just one tiny feel\nIt's so powerful it can promote the health of your heart and your arteries and if that wasn't enough it could also boost your joined comfort in ... days we're ...

picturesque scene as more than five hundred hot air balloons from over a dozen countries Sylvia risk guy\nAnd to give you a taste of what's transpiring now right now as we speak and why it is such a popular overhead joining us on the show hotline is tight young president of the Albuquerque fiesta\nHello tai thanks for joining Mary ...\nHello there my pleasure good to be with you\nWell good to have you here with us I Know you've got a lot going on right now we'll get right into it you know as we speak right now just after eleven am eastern time a little bit after nine AM mountain time on October sex set the scene for us on exactly what's happening right now at the forty seven annual Albuquerque international balloon fiesta\nWell it it's art kicked off day and we had a full mess ascension today with nearly all of our five hundred and sixty seven balloons and a box wind effect will join plate today so it really kept the blues near the field you're still a few up even though it's warming up quickly and it is just been a perfect day for us\nWelcome to the show ... nice to connect with them that they threatened me\nAppreciate it a less we've got a lot we want to try and cover with his I'm going to get into this I guess really depending on who or what you want to believe\nMost of the sources out there that we've seen their own projecting commercial airline pilots shortages somewhere between twenty five hundred and five thousand as soon as twenty twenties so you know here in change we already have major shortages that we're seeing impacting most heavily the regional airlines an example is green links airlines\nThat shut down completely earlier this year\nSo what are you seeing and hearing out their path and do you agree with us that this is a serious issue that's going to impact all of us who fly in some way\nBut it is a very serious issue because we're going to need a lot more pilots the uh the pilots population is aging or we have a significant wave of retirements coming up which is making this pilot shortage and we also see that the number of new pilots has dropped off some of that is then because the or\nThe airlines in previous years has been in a little bit of a wall and people didn't want to go into the that area in that situation and those two things overlapping has made a significant shortage in the in the pipeline of putting piled true as commercial airline pilots\nAnd another thing that we want to hit on a top reason for the commercial airline pilot shortage is the FAA change back I think it was an twenty Thirteen\nTheir rules to require a minimal Fifteen hundred hours of flight time to co pilot a commercial flight it's been a controversial rule and result in really think about it and about a six fold increase from past requirements\nSo there are some exceptions obviously at the new military pilots will be seven hundred and fifty hours there's some others\nHow do you feel about the Fifteen hundred hour rule and where do you think about some of the chatter that's out there that they may be looking to make some adjustments\nSo it's a it's a very interesting controversial rule as you said one of the things that it impacts all over the country is the fact that airline pilots can go direct from their two hundred and fifty hour pilot rating er into an airliner and that has some good effects and some bad effects\nAs it turns out it might be better from the safety standpoint\nUh although we're still working on the data we try and be data driven about those kind of decisions are looking at how that impacts on an airline good impact that it has right now is that those folks\nHave to go from two hundred and fifty hours of the requirement for the airlines are going to end up being flight instructors and if you think we have a shortage of airline pilots we even have a a more difficult problem with a shortage of\nPiled instructors and so that population would probably be significantly smaller if this Fifteen hundred hour rule\nAnd so that population would probably be significantly smaller if this Fifteen hundred power will warn\nWouldn't be there and people were jumping direct the airlines so it's sort of a double edged sword\nInteresting Hi I'm pat I'd like to talk about and bring ran off clearly college leader and aeronautics and an aviation I can certainly think of some other and thank you think of preview that comes to mind\nEvery rental clearly a high standard is your university expanding to allow more students into the school when are you seeing a noticeable increase in enrollment students that are looking to become pilots\nYes so we've been lucky we are at increased enrollments for quite a while or those have been small but noticeable increases this year we have a a very large upswing\nIn the number of aeronautical science students which are a pilot track students and we also see that in engineering for aircraft so aerospace engineering any other engineering associated with the whole aerospace community of building up the infrastructure for airports in our lives\nSo all sectors of the field that's good that's all right I'd like to get your thoughts ON Technology and the use of technology and whether it's attracting um\nYou know and your students as well to help with the shore and a chance rapid and I actually have a son and he's in a Tech University in New York state and whenever we're on campus or even talking to him he's always so excited and engage with what that school is dealing with the technology and it's really impressive tonight with ... it is and I would think it's a good time to be\nInvolved in this field and getting into aviation and so what are you guys doing it and we're able to connect with your students and and attract future pilots and as you said um engineers and smiling aeronautics\nLike I tell you it's a really exciting time and when I go in and teach classes\nOr I'm sort of a little envious that I'm not sitting in the seats instead of being up as a board because uh the new technology is going to bring about changes to to aviation uh that hurricane to some of the movie as we've seen like avatar and your vendors\nAre some of these vehicles that don't look like classical airplanes are going to come out because of advances\nIn technology so it's it's a really vibrant areas design new airplane\nBut I think the first one you're going to see is is urban era mobility which is the idea that we can take a water essentially very quiet a resounding automated helicopters and use those to replace a taxi isn't over Lake Michigan right being able to fly in urban areas wow\nYou know I've seen some of them out there I said let's unpack that a little bit more here because back in may Bonnie sent me the president of Jet Blue ventures she's an act upon herself she was on the program with us and we talked a little bit about one of the companies that they're supporting ... which is centrally is developing regional electric aircraft\nSo with what you just said combined with what junior heroes doing how far along as this technology ... you know in a world where Tesla electric cars are now navigating our streets\nYou know will it be that long before we're seeing electric and a ton of planes flying or ...\nWell we're at the beginning of it but a lot of factors are are racing this to an end point very quickly much more quickly than I've ever seen in our industry so\nOthers even type thing is a a an airliner it's what we call it in the whole electric airplanes are in that promises to bring down direct operating costs things to emissions are and then the other side of that is a slight little helicopters\nAnd what ties both of you together is we're point in the stuff that we've learned from the automotive industry in hybrids and electrify propulsion and using that in airplanes to do sort of the same things where we're reducing the cost and emissions\nAre though Ross are doing it to make a mission that we couldn't do before so these are little helicopters it might have a whole bunch of little rotors we we couldn't have gas engines that would do that so liquor five propulsion and many different ways is allowing this really large expansion into new fields of aviation\nI find that fascinating side would think that reducing emissions is one of one of the items ... what are some other overriding implications that some of the electorate can autonomous technology is going to have I guess in aviation awesome for all of that here on the ground\nWell it's kinda funny um yes a a a has been classically\nConservative in the certification of autonomous flight controls and when you move to electrify propulsion that has to be baked into that high already so it's a little bit of a Trojan Horse toward moving forward or the automation airplanes that I'm Talking you know relatively sophisticated automation because\nUh most airlines right now have the capability of flying from as soon as they take off to when they land by themselves so we're talking about automation is a point of the airplanes making decisions on rooting and stuff like that I find themselves and that was brought on by like five propulsion as well\nI I Love the technology is exciting you can hear the personal connection that you have to imagine how so how about it and I thought really ... it was interesting your comment about wishing that you were in the seats versus a from a divorce but\nI wasn't really nice to connect with the day we thank you very much for sharing your inside some thoughts we'll look forward to staying in touch with you and have you back in the future because this clearly is going to continue to unfold I'm\nProbably a little more rapidly than most of us like\nVery exciting time thanks for having me\nTo pat ... alright mariners are overview on the pilot shortage situation and also just the technology we have an air minutes on a Friday Saturday and
