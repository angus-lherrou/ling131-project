hit by a bus with millions of dollars in a trust to be good used only for their good are we did not leave the money to the guardian we left it into a trust which is the proper thing to do the trust is formed only at your death\nWe put in that trust exactly how the money was to be invested the four types of mutual funds for instance that I recommend we put in that trust that the income off of the investments could be used for the care and feeding of the kids and the use of the guardian if there will beyond that if they needed money out of that trust\nIt has to be for a major medical thing

am both dependent on overtime we make about forty grand a year or forty forty grand a piece a year which are typically what's your take home a month\nOkay I'm gonna try to get to the point as fast as I can um I I call you back in January um about a a one point eight million dollar inherit and\nThat are asking you how it should handle that and he told me how to do so and I take my time and be patient with it and it was very helpful but now I'm having another problem whereas\nI'm so basically since then I bought a house remodel the airplane be making a lot of money about fifty thousand dollars a month on gross [laughter] um but about yeah about Fifteen thousand dollars a month and I'm just blowing through that crazy sex addiction\nUm I'm spending just in the same amounts of money the ten thousand dollars a month on prostitutes and strip clubs and become therapy all the above and I don't know what to do have tried everything sex addicts anonymous\nAnd but I I I I Want to know what you would do in the situation I I've done well I spent about how that money on buying a house in an airplane being it now and I'm doing well with that and that since then\nIt's been a long project I finished but I don't know what to do about this hour should handle it ... ... anything else that you would try that I Am [laughter]\nHow old are you I mean twenty income ... and um\nThe inheritance came from who passed away\nSo my dad passed away about two years ago and um he was missing plane and I might be coming into a lot more money because at the shelter wrongful death situation is um ... it's a long story\nAbout your mom\nMy mom she's out of the picture that divorce decker we talked to her um right cheat sheet at the picture\nI ... as you know job and I'm not a therapist I'm not a are trained to kill more um I have worked with addicts for Thirty years\nBut goes one hundred percent of the addiction to broke\nIf if they don't feel their addiction and so you are going to

their help and\nFight to win against the addiction um sex addictions and pornography addictions are the fastest growing addictions in America that we see that in our offices with financial trouble um people in your situation more than any other addiction\nWe see we still see cocaine we still see 'em and we don't treat for that but we ended up helping them with their finances we still see alcohol\nAnd uh but gambling and sex are both just ... the the\n... is a is a is gone crazy because of the Internet access and um uh it's affecting every part of our lives and the good ways and bad ways but the access in this case is causing excess and gets people in real trouble with gambling and porn\nSex addictions um\nSo you're you you know you named off a couple of the right things and that's getting an essay getting in a um a an anonymous group I'm getting in a with a therapy\nI'm a an anonymous group\nI'm getting in a with a therapist is the second thing I Would do um the third thing I Would do\nIs um [noise] it it sounds to me like just a guy talking to a young guy an old guy talking to a young guy that all of your family structure has gone it's just you didn't have it with your mom and then your dad died and so you're you're just left without any authority\nStructure as a twenty year old young guy there's nobody in your life kind of standing over your shoulder is going to dump you when you grew up your life\nYeah I I I Do have a family on my dad's side that I'm actually a good way but\nThey know what's going on now so I Know\nThey were asked for problems going on like over a year ago like effect and that's just a and I I never and whenever I tried it with them they kind of they were like a huge meal you're just going to pick on this that and I never kind of trust again okay with them so I just kind of put off the illusion that\nYou know K. everyone's okay but that's fine so that there are no help is what you're saying yeah OK\nOr no help but they they ... they're they're good but I just I don't know how\nWell I Know that all behaviors obviously have psychology involved um as a person of faith as a Christian I also believe behaviors or spiritual\nAnd show to treat to something like this only as a psychological thing is usually a half treatment\nTo treated only like it's a spiritual thing might very well be a half treatment but um there there's something that you're obviously searching for and there's something that you're missing 'em that's causing you too I'm literally go crazy in this part of your life right\n[noise] yeah I I I think it like I'm just beyond lonely I don't know if it's that um but um [noise] I I I don't know honestly I\nThink that's probably right that doesn't sound room [noise] how can I can resonate with that I can imagine you being there in that situation and it's amazing you can be in one of the largest cities in the world and be lonely\nYou know but you can be it's very very real um the show the last component I Would add to it um\nAnd you're asking me so you always get my opinion when you're asking me in that I'm an expert on my opinion [laughter] so ah what I Would tell you do is find a great church and will help you do that and and sit down and get\nPastoral counseling to go with your other counseling get with some\nYoung guys in that church\nAnd become friends with some people who have some character have some integrity and that are walking a straight line not perfect there isn't any perfect people over there are at that church ... churches got people and um so you can find that out pretty quick but you will find a book\nOr synagogue or no you're Jewish okay cool that's going to affect then let's get whether I buy do let's get the spiritual element of this going because there's a there's an aspect of that that goes with this and if that's your heritage and that's your your your face in wonderful on the bike cause the town that has a lot to say\nAbout the issues that you're dealing with um a lot\nAnd um so yeah I that's the only thing I Know how to tell you though because I Can't just yell at you stop it or you would have already stopped it I mean you're smart guy you've already realizes just ruining your life\nAnd um you know that I Know that um but the nature of an addiction is and you're finding this from a twelve steps is that one of the thing is you realize you're powerless\nAnd you know God has to step in and I've got to push them structures in my life and I've got a you know figure out uh do do some careful psych self analysis and say\nWell loneliness is the issue so how do I fix loneliness well obviously I'm fixing it inappropriately and so how do I fix it with more wisdom and that would be hanging out with good people are that are lifting you up I'm\nObviously not hanging out with paid friends which doesn't work for anybody whatever version of paid to friends you have and yours is one of the more gross so um but that's you know that's the only thing I don't know how to tell you I I I Would make sure I'd really lean into\nGetting a group of people around me that I can trust and if there's a group of people that um are are working on a social project that is worthy and you've got to get with a bunch of young men doing that and\nYou had some good guys around you um then that's very important I've got a group of guys I get with once a month with them last night as a matter of fact I'm fifty eight um that group of guys got all our son's together that are in their twenties or the other day and we all encouraged them and they all agreed\nThat they need a group of guys you ain't got a what my friends the the man's bill calls a band of brothers\nIn your life a talk with you in these situations so I'm a man I'm just a guy I don't know how to help you um I'll pray\nFor you to tell you that hold on I'll have to pick up we're going to send your\nCoffee Mansfield ... book [noise] uh he's got a lot to say about this kind of stuff and the movement Mansfield manly men or whatever it's called [noise] and I'm just up and you need some guys around to do that's what I'm thinking and and you need some spiritual woman had it as a component to this this is the day Ramsey show\n[noise]\nYou know what I've learned after talking to so many people who have been victims of ID theft they feel violated and they have a
