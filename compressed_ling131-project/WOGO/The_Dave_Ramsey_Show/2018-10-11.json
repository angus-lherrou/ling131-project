that's AAA eight to five five two to five Joshua is with us from British Columbia Hi Joshua how are you\nAn arrow Yes sir how can I help yeah\nI'll Try and keep it straight to the point I'm I've been living in my car on and off for about two months I was homeless for about two weeks since my car broke down\nI'm at I'm just wondering\nMoney has one of my biggest tractor\nAnd I'm curious what advice do you have some never in that situation again like by family and the I've actually able to support maybe always struggled with money I'm currently working to restaurant jobs how one of them just caught by ships on the other one I don't make a ton attempts has a survey\nAbout I'm just wondering I'm twenty three year old I'm\nAt this point in life I don't really want to\nEver be in a situation because my physical health spiritual health mental health it's all going down and it's and I lost a home help I'm just wondering for coming by the way I don't think that's what happening again\nYeah sure you're single okay and when did you leave your parents from\nWhat I've been living or what happened is a bit on my own for about a year and a half but I moved to BC and once I got to be the Alice in a car accident mhm\nBut my money that I had for a place one war my vehicle [laughter] buy me a call ... and then it was great in the middle of summer\nAnd I wasn't able to secure work until shortly maybe later I was living in a homeless shelter mhm and now recently the shelter extended by like it's been hard but um\nWhere is home yeah I I parked by the ocean and\nKnow where where do your parents live\nBut if the train is coming at you and run to that obviously right\nAnd and what's the difference in those two events are both light both a tunnel both the situation one is you believe that if you run to the light you're going to get out I Wonder if you believe you run a lot you're going to get killed right I mean so that's hoping hopelessness\nAnd all of a U.S me included face that or have faced that at times in our lives\nAnd it's amazing to me the power of our brain and our spirit that God gives us to do things that are way beyond what we thought we could do once we believe that there possible\nThat's called hope and so when\nI show you look you know you make a hundred thousand dollars a year you got thirty thousand dollars in debt you feel stock but gosh if we did that at a thousand dollars a month you're going to be out of that in my ... and a thousand dollars a month out of a hundred thousand is nothing that's twelve thousand dollars a year you're going to be out of debt and little over two years\nAnd you suddenly go oh I see it ... it's the same situation you were in but now you can see it\nYou see what I'm Talking about and once you can see it that's called hope I can see my way out one of the things that steals your hope is when you have lost your perspective perspective is of course your point of view the way you're seeing things\nIt's happened to me it's happened to you\nI remember one time one of my daughters when she was in high school certain boy did not call it a certain time that he was supposed to call and she was a very upset walk the world is coming\nTo an\nEnd her mom and I are trying to quit laughing so we can walk in and comfort\nHer [laughter]\nNow why are we standing in the hall outside her bedroom laughing and why is she in their\nHopeless\nWell we've got perspective we see things that she doesn't see because we've been places she hasn't been and have experience is that she doesn't have right\nSo in other words we've been to our twenty year class reunion we know she'll be glad he didn't call [laughter] that's what we're giggling about standing and All right so we have perspective\nAnd so we you know when you don't have ... when you cannot see the other side you're standing in poop up to your knees but you can't see the other side of it\nThen you know it's not fertilizer at that point it's just poop but\nWhen you can see the other side of it then it's fertilizer\nAnd it it's going to grow some things in your future you know when you're walking through garbage in other words you're going to you that there's some good is going to come out of the garbage that you're in but but when it gets right down on you and your vision is just the end of your nose and not the end of your life\nWhen you look out ten years you see stuff different than when you look out ten seconds\nAnd the young man I was just talking to an end folks that have dealt with an homeless situation so it's one of the problem was the the desperation just to eat and not be cold\nCauses you to have ten second increments of thought instead of ten year increments of thought gee I can stand back from that sitting here warm and with a full belly in my studio several thousand miles away and look at him and go to just go work more\nBut he can't see he couldn't see that you don't care that you wouldn't get like coke go go deliver pizzas go blow leaves go walk dogs go shovel something somewhere you know go do something go you know work all the time because you do that money comes from work is where it comes from I Can't get enough hours woven work someplace else\nWork more work all the time\nBut but because I've done that kind of stuff and I'm the other side of it and I've seen what it does\nMean when we were going broke two babies and wife houses in foreclosure were that close to almost ourselves so how we get out of it\nThe houses in foreclosure were that close to almost ourselves\nSo how we get out of it worked our mind off and well you know you\nCan't work your way out everything that I didn't work my way out I went bankrupt but I didn't lose the house\nAnd if I had lost the house on a pound someplace living out of work my way into their own apartment and we lived in that well you know and and it's not that I'm Better is not that I'm smarter only thing is just perspective it's like I didn't grow up rich but I had a friend that grew up rich\nAnd\nBecause he grew up in a wealthy home he had the perception that everything was going to work out because it it always worked out and I had the perspective that ain't gonna work out [laughter]\nIt's gonna be awful and and but because he thought everything was always going to work out you know it all worked out a lot\nBecause I didn't think it was going to work out sometimes it didn't work out you say you set yourself in these traction these rockets with this thing\nBut when you can see the other side of it it's easy to work through it\nIt's when you can't see the other side of it that you don't want to work through it 'cause you don't believe it's going to work that's called hopelessness the situation is exactly the same they only different issue is your perspective and some challenge and some of your another think you're stuck you think you're stuck in a career you think you're stuck in this\nMarriage it's bad it's always going to be that way you think you're stuck with whatever behavior you're stuck with you think you're stuck with your money you think you're stuck in that you're not stuck\nYou're not stuck life is not a snapshot it's a film script you're going to turn the page and something else are they going to happen better or worse tomorrow it is not going to stay the same you are not stuck\nSo look the other side of it look out there five years look out there three years look out their ten months in say one of I got to do what's got to be true that is not true right now for me to never be here again that's a question he was asking but he was having trouble emotionally buying it\nAnd I don't think I helped him I was kind of bothered me that's why I Want to talk about a minute I'm not sure he heard me\nBut if I woke up in his shoes tomorrow if you took my wallet away where everything I have been through I had no identity no I ... you know my driver's license was gone I didn't have a car and you just dumped me on the street I wouldn't be there long\nBecause they don't believe that about me and my future and I know if I Do this this and this that I'll be out\nAnd I work my way right out of it I don't I don't know how I Would say but I Would get there I pushed my way through it and um and I haven't always been that way there's been times that I was so scared so beat up and so hopeless that I couldn't breathe and I couldn't see what I'm Talking about here is is is vision site\nThat gives you hope when you lose your site when you can't see the other side of it\nThen then there's no you know that it's hard to take action it\nIt's hard to fix it and the problem is there's not a magic wand there is a series of things you've got to do a series of steps you got to take to become an stuck wherever it is you are stuck wherever it is I'm stuck\nI think that guy's gonna be okay I really do I think he's going to be better off than he thinks he's going to be I think it's going to work out\nGreat book to read if you already called pizza tiger the guy that started um dominos pizza Monaghan came out of the army made some bad mistakes and ended up living in a homeless shelter\n\nAnd then he ends up owning dominos pizza\nSo it's going to be All right [noise]\nYeah it can be [noise]\nYou can choose for it to be All right ... and it's not magic is not positive thinking and it's not easy [noise]\nIt's hard [noise]\nBut it's ... [noise]\nAnd and it's one of the reason I re biographies of successful people is he lets me know that they went through crap and they made it [noise]\nAnd it and then if I'm going through crap I'm going to make it [noise]\nAnd that that's what I'm you know that's where you are it's where I have been and sometimes\nIt's gonna be okay\nIt's going to turn out okay [noise]\nThis is that Iran [noise]\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have\nTo be intentional with every decision you make as an example if you're a business owner and needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full\nOf resumes that aren't right for the position you're hiring the smart thing to do is to go to zip recruiter dot com slash Dave to hire the right person zip recruiter doesn't depend on candidates finding new\nIt finds them for you\nIt's powerful matching technologies scans thousands of resumes identifies people with the ride skills education and experience for your job\nAnd actively invites them do apply\nSo you get qualified candidates fast and right now my listeners contrived zip recruiter for free at zip recruiter dot com slash Dave that's zip recruiter dot com slash Dave zip recruiter the smartest way to hire\nOh my gosh you guys went crazy you name it ... the heart and God yes where are you on your name around all the time [laughter] oh\nMan yeah you know you had to be careful what you and I have a pet we named one heaven\n'cause the one before her went to heaven and so I'm Out in the front yard yelling\nLike I've lost my mind right up there for him at the top of his lungs he's a Pentecostal I'm going crazy right [laughter] [laughter] well good for you guys well done\nWe've got a copy of Chris ... book for you retire inspired and that's the next chapter in your story for you to be millionaires you're on your way my great money got great occupations get lots of things you can do now and you brought the ... with you all the way from Cedar Rapids what are their names in ages\nHave hated he's alive and we have enough he's eight mhm well I think and what do you need to\nI saw a lot when I was walking in a while ago with his T shirt I Pretend I'm ...

I have never seen anything that indicates that scary North Carolina is thirty percent more expensive than the rest of North Carolina I mean now maybe you need to move twenty miles from there and sort of a hundred and ten miles from there to get something cheaper but I'm the numbers are giving me just don't work I I just ah truthfully I think you haven't\nLooked in the right places I think you're looking in certain neighborhoods or certain types of apartment complexes or whatever I'm going to continue to shop and learn and I'm probably I mean you mentioned the dollar it out and back a little bit and\nDial out just a little bit mileage wise from where you're looking to get you might be in the most expensive in the town I mean I can imagine that there is an area of carry this that expensive\nBut overall this I carry North Carolina is thirty percent more expensive rent than Burlington no that's just I just don't believe that um I can be wrong but I I don't I've never seen that indicates that\nThe you know one end of North Carolina is that much more expensive than the other and now you want to compare Manhattan to apple in Texas we can talk about this but that's a different issue and that's not what you're proposing so I think you're\nUm you're looking at different into town of Kerry or you move a little bit further out of carry but not a hundred and ten miles out of Kerry and let's see where we are at that point\nUm but I don't think you can\nUm what your your numbers just don't work I thanks for the call Sharon is with us in West Palm Beach Florida Hi Sharon
