of pension funds of going broke and the problem is you don't own anything you're just depending on the stream of payments so that's yet another reason to take the lump sum\nAnd almost always and you can you can uh get with a financial advisor get one more ... more of us are pros and run the actual calculations which are are there there are about five steps too complicated to do here on the air okay\nBut basically you can put in the amount of pain but you would receive and put in an average death age of uh Seventy six for a male Seventy eight for a female\nUh-huh that's how they're calculated typically on actuarial tables and uh then you figure out what the president value of those payments are because that's what you're going to receive and\nThat's what they're saying that

on your money and if you die you lose it\nWhen you ... when you die\nPercent on your money and if you die you lose it when you die if you do when you die you lose you know and so if you took the lump

I'm Sorry oh what a horrible thing so how old is your grandmother\nOr Seventy okay\nWell what you needed to get off the phone is you need to take back control of all your finances\nWould be for the next hour rings twelve\nYou have thirty minutes get it done okay if you have to shut down the checking account if you have to shut down the credit cards and if you have to freeze your credit that's fine but you need to get control of your finances because your grandmother for whatever reason is misbehaving we wish that Bush that correct\nYeah it was never money with your grandpa was money and with your sisters id and for all we know she is open up credit cards and your name as well correct we don't know\n... I'm not sure yet\nI'm trying to you need to check your credit and see if she's done that to you as well but you need to shut down a so did you get your checking account or is that what you're getting ready to take over and how how does she handle their money\nOh I gave my checking account my debit card um\nYou just go down to a lot of credit oh you don't just go down to the bank enclosure checking account just close and whatever monies in their ... use it to be moved over to a different account and have that bank are told that bank what's going on that this lady is um\nYou know she's she's misbehaving she's mentally ill sheets of the we don't know what it is but we need to get all control taken away from her aunt is that all she had was your debit card in checking account and that's\nAll I have ... and that's all she had of your money or your stuff so you get paid it's ... is a direct deposit into your account\nLooked so okay\nSo you need to change that as well right to the new account number two a day later\nToday you are you going to do it today I Am going to\nOkay good and then you just call her up and say a ... I got enrolled in a financial clash and so I'm going to take over my financial ... thank\nYou for your help\nTake it from here and then you need to call like sure your bills are being paid call every one of your bills how much that have you got\nAll my bills total that added up a minute ago it's a running around twenty all on\nHow many different creditors to you or\nA ... regular ...\nAh that's like utility bills and that kind of stuff he a serious sheen on how you don't have anything to you don't have any debt well OK okay\nThen you just need to call your utilities and make sure where they on\nWell OK okay\nThen you just need to call your utilities and make sure where they on auto draft on your account\nAll\nDay then you're going to give them your new account numbers\nAnd get all that switched over to bay show that you take over the handling of your money and you can just like random mother know that you know with grandpa was passing out in what you have to fool with this honey so I won't take it over I and I'm I'm enrolled in a financial class and I'm going to get control as a twenty five year old man of my life and I'm\nIn I'm Sorry\nShe actually in a row now\nShe's in jail why she in jail\nOr my sister clashed drug is called hard on me leading\nWow okay well you can let her know that you took the bank account or a due to all this weird notion of family then\nAre interesting wow\nSo people in the family are not real happy with grandmother right now I take it\nAnd know that at all you know\nVery sad sad to be Seventy years old and the show and then the next thing you need to do is you need to pull a copy of your credit bureau report and you can do that for free once a year with each of the three credit bureaus and see if there's anything showing up on your credit bureau report regarding identity theft\n... she has opened cards and your name as well\nOK\nAnd let me help you to your sister may or may not have been really mad\nAnd she may or may not meant for your grandmother it'll be picked up but here's the thing the only way if someone opens on account and your name\nThe only way to get that account cleared other than pay yourself which would be pretty stupid to pay an account that you didn't open when someone stole your identity the only way to keep from doing that is you have to file a police report\nAnd when you're filling out the police report they always ask you if you know who soldier identity and if you don't tell them that would be breaking the law and so your sister followed the law properly when the police report as being filled out and said yes I Know who the identity the ... my grandmother and I'm I'm surprised that actually that they went and picked her up but they did\nAnd uh you know show 'em 'cause it is it is a federal law is a federal offense now to steal an identity\nAnd so um she she is in trouble [noise] she's in real trouble but your sister ... could maybe accidentally activated all of this because she just had to do a police report to get the identity theft removed from her name\nRight and but she may have been just mad and gotten arrested I don't know either way is fine with me but um\n'cause Mormons definitely a thief but oh my goodness what a sad thing though\nWere horrible thing you guys are going through not Cody um we're much how much do you make what kind of money do you make\nForty thousand a year\nOkay All right are you really ready to take this over and learn how to handle money if you are I'll show you how which in our clash\nAnd say\nOkay you want to wear your shoulders back

left is student loan debt mhm um\nAnd so we we between my wife and I we oh about a hundred and fourteen thousand dollars in student loan debt [laughter] um so what is trying to figure out what we can do between the upgrade of the new house and the are the laws that we have our\nWe get paid off for me to try to just figure out how to do that [noise]\n[noise] uh spend less than you make and put it on the student loan I mean what are you thinking about and I don't understand\nWhy we're just we're just trying to figure out like a little bit there's three of them between us I'm a teacher I Know the built our loan forgiveness programs but I'm just trying to figure out\nA loan from his programs don't work there ten years long you don't want to be in debt in years what's your household income\nSo take home between my wife and I we um we make this about fifty seven thousand a year\nOkay and uh how much is your house primary\n[noise] so we haven't gotten our personal we just moved um so the house payment will be around sixteen hundred a month\nOkay you're right at a fourth ... right and you have no other that except the student loans correct okay and so if you put twenty thousand dollars a year on these is going to take you five years so I think I think you've gotta look at ways to increase your income\nOkay you've got a lot of student loans for two teachers where do you go to jail [laughter] where did you get your degree\n[noise] um so she has her masters I got my bachelor's should we we both worked in a northern Arizona university\nWow you must have put everything on

you can attack the next one down but you got a five year plan unless you had some income to this\nUh and it's going to be a tough five years really hard and so I'm probably picking up some tutoring some coaching some something things that teachers do on the side uh to earn extra money you probably make another twenty grand tutoring and\nUh the only reason I'm considering it is because the the benefits are a lot better mhm um they offer for one came or hate holidays more vacation um they also pay one hundred percent of my health insurance from\nThe soil is your health insurance costs now I don't have any I Can't afford any mhm okay oh okay\nThe company that I'm In company I'm with now it's it's like five hundred dollars a month or something just for me mhm never\nShow oh five hundred dollars or five hundred dollars a month or six thousand dollars a year you're talking about taking a pay cut of nine thousand dollars mhm you're going to trade six for non\nIf you're doing it for health insurance four one K. benefit is worth very little and the other benefits and you know more time off is not what you need you need more money\nMhm well that and the potential to grow at that company would be a lot more quickly I'm On the next year or two what'd you double your income\nI don't quite know but now a quick which will be like I couldn't I couldn't be looking at the next two years that can be looking at like maybe maybe another ten thousand a year\nBack up to where you were um yes plus the health insurance yeah yeah\nWell the the the benefits are worth very very little in this equation um I Would not do it for the benefits\nOkay I might do it if it's taking one step back and I get into a career I Love shark and takes six steps forward 'cause we had I Want to hear how old are you\nA twenty three so the question is when you're forty three Twenty years from today mhm does this take you where you want to go Twenty years from today\nIf it's not taking any new in that direction then you're doing this for health insurance benefits and that's a dumb idea\nOkay [noise] um I mean maybe maybe not this job in mind I don't I don't know exactly how I mean I don't know that much about the company quite yet but it it does open the door for for the [noise] it ... it it can turn it could help\nTransition me into the career I Want to be what do you want to be it is I Want to
