money that home improvement show I'm Tom Chrysler in Jamestown Rhode Island today\nI'm here with our friends from this old house they've invited me to be a part\nOf the final day of production here and James down as a complete and really unusual house they've taken one hundred year old seaside house that one it was originally built was probably never intended for anything other than summer residency they bolted on a brand new addition and they've made this entire structure so energy efficient\nIt's now known as a net zero house which means it's designed to create the total amount of energy it needs to operate so coming up this hour we're going to get all the details on that project straight from the chia which team\nIncluding Kevin O'Connor Roger Cook plus norm ... will be by to talk about a very special mouse so rich by very few programs because this is these forty in season of this old house so let's get to it to get things all I'm very pleased to welcome a great friend of the money pit Kevin OConnor welcome Kevin\nAnd I mean that's the year ... and literally because not only are you are how but you've been a friend too many homeowners now for many many years and you're all his host and congratulations on the forty a student at this old house wow\nYeah well he's forty sees it forty years it's something we're very proud of his you know I Can't take any credit for that I've only been doing it for the last Fifteen or the other boys are twenty five years ahead of me on that one but it's a testament to\nWhat norm Roger Richard in time he started back in Nineteen Seventy nine um that it's still going that it's still popular that we're still doing beautiful buildings like this and we're taking it for a little bit of a victory lap are proud of it\nAbsolutely so tell us about the Syrian Jamestown now we're kind of right across the river from Newport which is famous for mansions and cliff walks is this where you moved if your name wasn't Vanderbilt\n[laughter] I'm not sure it's an island I'm right in there against it sounds so to the west of us with the mainland of Rhode Island and into the east of us as you say the peninsula of Newport we're all the mansions are all the sale\nAnd then to the east of us as you say is the peninsula of Newport we're all the mansions are all the sailing\nOr it's a smaller island community back in the day people had to take the ferry to go to school for the year to the mainland we're now connected by bridges but it's always been sort of you know one step removed from the ... of of Newport for us it's the home of architects is also a homeowner right who's\nFall in love with the area they had been vacationing here for\nMany years and they decided no this is where we want to raise our kids and we want to live and so that is what has sort of started this project to begin with\nNow this is a net zero project and that probably had a lot of challenges behind it is a very old building and on an addition and significantly increase the space of it I had to bring us together and are not as a trick when it came to the energy efficient\nGet nets here has two components to you've got to make your own energy and we do that with solar panels and that's kind of new beautiful technology but you also have to try to reduce the load that you use in the house and as you know these old houses the original when he was built in the Nineteen twenties um ... like a sieve\nA kitchen backdoor entrance where they come and go most of the time in a trash comes in and out we place to grill near the back door a there is a barn or that they're in and out of the new projects it's a it's a family of of of ah\nConstructors right this ... stuff yeah they definitely bills yeah\nSo we created a working yard off that garage in off the kitchen with a a with an old flat open space a little area of of paving little vegetable garden and there's a sliding door between the garage in this open space so it's kind of the overflow workspace\nSo and so it's kind of like I'm bringing the indoors out in the outdoors in English and airy space where she's very comfortable moving from one zones and the ... exactly that's where the design comes in in his side from the design\nNow you've got to actually play in the physical elements actually perform what that intent is yes oh yes so\nWe gave them both are in an area of heart surfers in an area of grass a design defense\nOr this kind of the back wall of this space put up a hedge between the house\nAnd the working yard which takes out some of the view of the mess that might be there in the back yard right out of the out of the kitchen windows ... uh and then that's also the circulation space in the back into the back\nBack yard a which is a larger grassy area for their two young boys to get out and do what young boys do\nNo if folks are listening to this thinking you know what process show I go through if I Want to improve my backyard space what kind of chips would you give them to kind of get them started will\nEither which you mentioned before about relating the inside of the outside is vitally important okay so you can have a great space outside but you can't get to it it doesn't do a lot of good right [laughter]\nAnd and you want to go inside and look out all the windows you know because you're going to live in a in this New England we live inside quite a lot of the time but I owe a lot of views out the windows are just as important as the views of the house or the news in the open space and then to zone those different areas as they relate\nTo the house and then as they relate\nTo the outside property lines we don't really think of the outside in the room splitting sensitive to exactly the ruins\nAnd and the smaller the house the more useful those rooms are more important they are right\nIf you got five acre lot you have a house in near ths usually in line and you know everything kinda bleeds out when you have a small house like this those outside edge has become more defined and they become more integrated into the living in the house\nSo all really important things to do you keep in mind if you're\nYou know if you just completed the summer and you're thinking about now\nSo I'm gonna start planning for next year you got about six or eight months now and start staring at those windows and pick it up spaces and you know really living through it and your head ... may be making a paper model of it I always just because people sometimes can't imagine space mixture\nOf sets sack but now the time to do that and that's great information so congratulations on Wheldon project\nHere Tom Ryan landscape architect on this project thank you so much for stopping by the money that great thank you and you'll find this old house and

Jamestown well as you\nHeard there are many many things about this home that are special and that includes the law now there's actually a very unique type of turf called micro clover here\nWith us to talk about that is this old house landscaping contractor Roger Cook and pat Hogan was sod co welcome guys welcome you so this is a house where the environment is really at the forefront and you've chosen a type of Turks here\nThat is extremely sustainable and pretty much defines a environmental sensibility for for a landscaping\nLet's talk about you call it micro clover what isn't the micro clover is just what it is it's a covert but it's not like the Dutch clover right a minimally flowering non colonizing\nNot like the Dutch clover right a minimally flowering non colonizing clover okay that we've mixed in with a call to ask you mix in his very trout tolerant the clover takes the atmosphere nitrogen converted into nitrogen that the grass can use so you don't need to fertilize\nRoger when it comes to fertilizing and getting the the one chemicals just right that's up to ... people up right\nWhere we spend a lot of time on our lawns trying to get them just right and usually it's in the past it's always been a bluegrass lawn right bluegrass lawn flew out of water and a lot of the ... and then you go to spray the weeds and bugs and everything else\nSo this type of tournament you see a lot of commercial is it unusual to put it in a resolution well we just started growing this in the past few years in right so it's something that's going on we see is the future just to keep going ...\nHow does it stand up in terms of like wear and tear me this house has has two kids are growing up in it you know the top of that\nIt's tough for that at the idea house a couple of weeks ago here for this old house so that quite a bit of traffic and cross that lawn and no I was back there last week with the professor from Penn State research on this stuff look gorgeous he was a very happy to see\nSo when you put down a side Roger as opposed to you know growing along from scratch once the prepping ball\nOr they think it's the same as we've always been doing right we take what soil is here and we wrote a to scare by and losing it all All right so that the roots that are coming in can get down into a tank of themselves that get whatever moisture Zia\nThan we find greed will ... will put in some lime and said needs it and then the seed Assad\nNow we're in the midst of a torrential rain storm right now I I had to eat off as a health issue with irrigation today but does it take the same amount of water or less or more than you wear traditional long we'd get\nAnother one of the beautiful things about it it does not use a lot of water and ... yeah we have to get in fact we have to educate people who are not\nWatering so much that's right yeah at the idea house I've already had to contact the irrigation contractor and say shut the water off the I had enough [noise] so\nHow can you add this to an existing longer you always have to start from scratch with San ah I think\nWith the micro clover you can over seated into it\nBut I Would say you wouldn't want to do it into a bluegrass lawn because that's not really a drought tolerant were more than a century right correct and that's just not they're not going to get along those two types right yeah we've\nPut it in with the top ask you this more drought tolerant about this is a harsh environment because it's right here on the coast or appropriate product for a seaside community are yes it is you get lost salt in it all down to actually more of\nSalt resistant than blue grass is qualified I Love about this old house I mean you know you were things that you just wouldn't imagine really exist I mean the fact that here's\nThis very specialized type of side that has all these benefits to it\nIs is so cool I'm In a while you guys\nYou know always sort of pushing the envelope and coming up with this stuff for projects like that it just you know it just keeps fascinated me already that's probably why they're around for for forty years now is the end of the forty a season so congratulations on all the good work you put into that Roger bank some around here\nYeah well you talk about pushing the envelope pushed to hide in the wrong direction by you know well\nYou guys have done a great job with his house

certainly the case with this old house as well lots of wiring that had outlived its usefulness including what would have been probably the original wiring for one hundred your home it's a tie called not into\nIt with us to talk about the safety of all that old wiring and what needs to be done with it is electric ... been Giles welcome Ben Adler you we're good thanks for stopping by the money to this is a interesting area lots of lots of history right here\nLots of old homes and would you agree that number two is probably the first ... than as these buildings\nYeah for sure that was the first modern type of wiring that could be afforded by your average person it wasn't as steel pipe installation are saying that was highly labor intensive to install so it was pretty widely used in the early Nineteen hundreds as one of the first real residential methods of wiring\nNow interesting for those that are unfamiliar with not been too We're actually talking about real knobs and real to cheer when it was run through beams so you drill hole they look like a ceramic tube through it\nTo sort of inflate the wire from the wood and then when it went perils of the themes that would be strong on these ceramic knobs and it was essentially an air cooled system so air had to circulate around it\nBut then we decided we were going to eat these homes in an insulation and what happens\nWell it eats up the other thing I think that happens to a lot and he's older homes is you know when the holder originally built designed they weren't designed for things like vacuum cleaners dishwashers air conditioners all these modern appliances that we have today\nAnd all those things these days are grounded a lot of the time so what you get is ...\nAnd all of those things these days are grounded a lot of the time so\nWhat you get is people kind of tagging new wiring on to the old system in unsafe way race\nAnd using it incorrectly a and again those systems were never intended to carry those kind of loads coupled with poor installation techniques of newer wearing and the and the increased loads of the homes that just create some dangerous situations but the original installation the way that it was intended to be used was actually not a bad one is fairly safe\nIt was it was the environment changed around it now for this house here in Jamestown did you find any existing nominate two that were still active\nOh yeah there were definitely most of the house had some now been two minute there were a lot of things tapped off of that now and to just like I just said people trying to get something that they didn't have and make it work with the existing system\nI'm so it was definitely a relatively dangerous situation in this house you know the things that definitely needed to be taken back to

influence patch young life I mean today's folks um it's public knowledge he's well placed on the Forbes four hundred lifted a couple of billion dollars of net worth it's public knowledge but the point is how did he get there and what does he do with the money as a steward we're going to find that out a little bit later to\nGo back in the beginning of your life was a young man young a boy pat\nYou have um I call you a member of the influential mothers club a member of the health check the wrong the other two members were Jack Welch Bernie Marcus both of these guys credited\nJack Walsh of course the legendary she'll G. E. and burning Marcus go Home Depot they both predator mothers having a strong influence that impacted the life for\nMany years to come you found that is well did you not\nYet has certainly in my case as well uh my father was a manager of construction projects by buddy many of them were you know in Europe or in Asia and so he was gone for you know six months or\nA or nine months or so at a time though my mother probably the biggest influence and I'm telling my goals and values and one thing that she really is built on me is that knowledge is key to progress you know and you should learn as much as possible you should do well in school and you should\nUse out of your other time to learn and so I became a very active member of the local public library and going in there for the for all the exciting new bucks it would come in and I remember one time I tried to read all\nTwenty volumes of the way they pretend to be on the basis that you know I Would have a database of everything that has happened in the world but then I realized that uh that I was only have a river mirror would ... everything that happened before or the book was published though\nI realize the important thing is keeping up to date with a new trends in the market\nI I Would tend to think that that paper route also talk to the value of delivering information ahead to influence you a little bit\n[noise] yeah I certainly made me impressed by people's enthusiasm for the information I was ... you know they were I was actually working for me to come around and drop the newspaper of the day off their on their front step um and and then I could tell from um you know when I was coming in to make their collection on Saturday to\nUh for the deliveries they would be polite and say thank you and I you know really\nA greatly value getting in the newspaper a timely basis or every day every week\nWe're moving on 'em you went to parochial school as a as a young man is a boy and um tell me a little bit about St Martin in Philadelphia was advantage or disadvantage going to a parochial school would that do for you\nWell I think the um the nuns were very dedicated to education and so they put a lot of stress on\nThe quality of education and I'm making sure that we were learning and doing well and are are are ... I'm going forward so that was a\nHelpful and they hurting instill the no belief and the importance of living a moral and ethical wife and ah you know and that really is a God is an important a factor in your life and that you should follow the commandments and\nShould treat people with respect and um you should make sure that you do nothing that you wouldn't be a you know that you're not going to be proud of and I do it right in the long run you'll\nYou'll wind up having to resolve\nWhat you're saying to counteract a lot of the scandals rather unfortunate through there but there's so many more stories pat or they're not of people who do the right thing to make it to the top\nAre exactly and that usually a pay it pays off I think you know what goes around comes around with you\n... have you always start to to see other people pretty soon that a deception is known and then people you know you lose your confidence and you and if they\nLose your confidence in you then you have a tremendous a weakness in terms of they're not willing to trust you and follow your ideas and so\nUm it is a very counterproductive to you know take shortcuts that are unethical or in Morrow\nHad during your time and St Martin ... um that was uh\nEthical and moral\nHad during your time and St Martin school um that was a pretty competitive environment was not\nA oh yeah it was they had the various towards the medals for the best in each subject than the\nUh the star list on the wall so there was a lot of the rating and ranking and er because I was a you know wanted to uh get on the top of all the oil is so so it was a good motivator for me to study extra hard\nWell one of the things as you allude to eventually you went from St Martin's and you've got accepted\nTo MIT my records told me you were the first student from St Martin's to ever get accepted to MIT tell the listeners what you did a sister so creative um the project they got the attention that got you an MIT\nYeah as I mentioned I go to the public library or several times a week and a one day I went in there and Nineteen fifty three and there was a new book that has just been published and was available called giant brains are machines to think it was\nFirst book that tried to explain how ... the the new computer technology but really enhance the power of the human mind would extend the memory\nFacts available to people greatly with to be able to see patterns in data super high speeds and how to make more insightful decisions and be more productive\nSo I got so excited about this that I took a about two months of savings on my paper route to the radio and went down to the hardware store\nAnd bought strip civil Newman them for oil and a bell wire and a small light bulbs or from flashlights and plywood boards and\nAnd a bill to pay a handmade computer system are made up little relays or that are played an unbeatable game of tic tac toe\nAh so ah and then I found that when I gave it to my friends are so excited about this apparently interact intelligent interaction with a machine but then they notice they could only time they would never win so\nI put a little counter in the back of every uh forty a move would be random occasionally they could win that found that ah that factor of hope I made the machine very very popular and it was always lots of people queuing up to play a\nBig us would love you [laughter] and\nIt was added into a science fair and water prize and that attracted the MIT alumni association in Philadelphia [noise]\nUh you know to get me a full scholarship to to go to MIT to study a more seriously computer science and particularly uh uh I was excited about the idea if you if you understood the organization of human mind\nThen you could actually designed computers more effective for more effective and they use for people because if you would see the analogy between the human intelligence and and the intelligence created through a V. electronic design of the system now\nPat when you got accepted to MIT prior to that were you encouraged or discouraged from director or the new specials at your school\n[noise] uh well that was it's an interesting point when I did a get a scholarship I previously um\nGotten scholarships to a number of the Catholic school and the crust the record says you know why didn't you go to Notre Dame or a villain over other schools that are\nIn the Catholic tradition and ah I said right now appreciate that but uh I Would like to know ... get myself I'm interested in technology and I wanted to go to school that has the best reputation for teaching technology and you know the the course they'll have a chap when there and I'll be able to continue\nTo attend religious services though I ah I said I wanted to follow that course to get the best education I could of the subject I was interested in and they just try to discourage me a little bit but uh I just stuck to my commitment\nYou being kind my research said that the way you're going to get in [laughter] you want me to a ...\nThere were um [noise] I think uh I'm uh twenty thousand students before me that are in several had applied but has ever been accepted thought it was the first one they have to to MIT\nYou are very humble man of folks are going to find out you know packets accepted an MIT he takes biophysics how old is a ... student make the transition in the business and build up what is today a multibillion dollar diversify business\nFrom a self made man building up an organization is a powerhouse how in the world did that happen will tell you about his first big deal when every but when a second time in his life they told them it couldn't be done I'm John\nResident go visiting in hearing a fascinating story of passing governs life the founder and chairman of ... will be back right after that so much as I was just [noise]\nTo my amazement within two weeks I got a check for twenty five thousand dollars each for half payment\nOr from a nine companies so uh so I had a two hundred and twenty five thousand dollars and checks I rushed to the bank or because I had made up a name called international cooperation\nEx I rushed to the bank a because I had made up a name called international data corporation or for the proposal purposes it was just going to be a shot in the dark\nAnd then the bank said oh now that's a corporate name you can't put that in your personal account you have to form real corporation get by laws have directors authorized the bank account if I thought oh my goodness what happens if all this name has already been registered how heavy duck\nFortunately it was in the form the corporation and and that that was all the capital that we ever put into the company was that two hundred and twenty five thousand dollars and so I've become a big advocate of what we call customer base financing if\nWell you can go out and present an idea that people interesting enough you know they will they will make them advance payments and uh when they do that they become a real advocate for you because they want you to succeed and they encourage their friends to buy the same thing\nAnd that so they become none equity investors they uh they don't show up at shareholders meetings and ask a difficult question they don't charge interest on their caches cetera so well I Would say for an entrepreneur\nYou can do the proof he can prove that market validity by going out and getting events payments from customers his most our situation\nAnd so what we learn from this that was another rejection the pat McGovern had another one you had split the other thing pat when they're giving you money to it on an advance\nSure puts a flame onto your but to make sure that whatever you make it better be darn good range\nOr exactly real vocational perform a you know the highest level of these people are expected\nThe ads all responsibility we get back folks that's just the first of all we're going to talk about another opportunity that again a pat was told this will never work don't you just love when they tell you it's not going to work at the first time you're on to something doing great I'm John residents
