V. or maybe you're watching a CBS stop or you're watching Fox so app I mean I've watched both you know what they're doing is\nThey're selling airtime these commercials in those things too but they're much shorter okay yeah\nThere were actually twenty seconds on like you have to watch to shoot him you know I don't actually have\nThree commercials every minute and they actually show how long twenty seconds then the next book starts twenty so I guess\nThose are different commercials and that was happening today is guys like you who are trying to sell something to have less time to do it in\nMy son Peter is an analyst at one of the biggest digital advertising agencies in the world he handles accounts like American Express them to bed and big big corporate accounts and he tells me that his dad nothing's changed people are still buying stuff right now\nBut they're just not watching TV is wrong to buy him\nNow what's interesting is a lot of the digital TV advertising is feeling the customers and stealing the eyeballs\nFrom regular broadcast television so cable TV and broadcast TV [noise] satellite t._v.\nPart diminishing well digital television is increasing right so if you want to get part of a digital crowd you're going to have to think in twenty second well we call pre rules\nYeah you can do a lot of traveling in twenty seconds but you certainly can't do a CPA in twenty seconds meaning drive them to buy because it's way too short so you have to\nDo what they do nowadays they try to hook you up with some really cute twists pride\nThat drives you to our Web site and then they do all their selling out you're on the website\n... TV you can hear you know ... you know when I'm you know of course when you're looking for somebody searches on the opposite but then all of a sudden it was a commercial Fifteen or even a ... a little bit and then all of them is that you know you could shut the commercial off all your audience here and then you can also say learn more\nOr click on it and then they will do to help drive into some kind of website driving\nTo some kind of a hundred percent right this is a very commonly used a technique now I think even YouTube they had pre roles rats when in the beginning the Everytime you watch a video you see that as they call that a pre role and sometimes when you finish our video they have a post trolls wing cheaper\nHe don't pay very much for the video at the end 'cause almost nobody ever get the ...\nAnd now what they're doing YouTube is not breaking into the video yes and calling it mineral which is really annoying [laughter] I Am I'm into I'm into\nA concert here in Washington is ... you know I'm Washington famous concert there at all of a sudden after the first time is advertising I had to wear this come from why is also why the hell do jaw and allow your average I live a warming you know\nBecause because what they're doing is they're cutting and not to because you know somebody has to pay for this stuff writes a lot of his digital t._v. is out in the world for free right right so now you know even this show here this we we pay a fortune on this show and we need a little income to offset it\nThat's why the last segment that we are going to do after this segment is called the daily wagon we sell that airtime is a great eight and a half minute segment we featured invention or a gadget or inventor in there and we try to sell stuff in that air time and you also noticed that we have short commercial breaks for two reasons because we're also on radio we have fifty three radio stations calling us\nAnd they take breaks there to the top of the hour bottom at the new news and stuff like that so we have to give them that three or four minute break so that's why when you're watching the digital TV station here we take the commercial breaks and we actually put ads in there that feature gadgets and ... and the inventors we're doing right now\nAnd we try to drive a little income there were so even though we have to grab a little bit of an income because it's hard to keep the lights on we got to pay our Tony and everybody else in the rent and we've got a digital t._v. feeds and you know light light life's dream and light cast and all that kind of stuff because of money to stand here and do this program every day so [noise]\nSo when you're an entrepreneur route there okay I think what you should do is I Want to tell you this one sentence that\nSo important video is king king king king yeah I don't\nCare if you're doing it twenty second pre role and you're on YouTube or Facebook or even on Amazon that little triangle you can put up there now or even at the end of your email strength or whether you're investing in a a thirty seconds or sixty second proper television commercial which can be very very positive the good thing about TV right now the rates are coming way down\nSo yes people less eyeballs but they're adjusting the price to the eyeballs and right now actually there's ... there's a there's a in the TV market there's actually a bull market\nMeaning that meaning that it's kind of attractive right now because the rates are so low that they are lower than it should be so you can actually get a better return on investment today on TV than you could like\nTen years ago because they are fighting for every dollar okay so whether you're thirty seconds to that can commercial or if you're doing a two minute infomercial specialist at it if you're doing it for twenty last minute infomercial long form infomercial specialist I Would do it all the time those can be really really productive ways\nTo sell your products or whether it's a ... year old\nOr an old school overnight infomercial video\nHis king baby and if you're not out there\nUsing video to sell that to selling secret video a video of any of these things are on your picture up on Amazon or Facebook is we're actually going to be effective luck with that because you want to do video by the way and my partner or something he wanted to help you with your video all you have to do is email me I'd hate costs a gay oh as\nMy cool inventions dot com and we'll give you some clothes on your videos helping do a video strategy whether it's a commercial minutes Bob are full fledged infomercial there's you're selling secrets videos [noise]\nHi I'm Dr Bill legal M.
