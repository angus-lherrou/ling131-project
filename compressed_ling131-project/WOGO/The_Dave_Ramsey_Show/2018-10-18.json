thank you for joining us\nIt's all about you the phone number is AAA eight to five five two to five that's AAA eight to five five two to five joy is with us in Denver, Colorado Hi Joyce how are you\nHey hey hey how are you taking my call\nSure how can I help you and\nI moved here ... cats regularly for about five months and got curious about three months ago my husband and I said I don't care about the dollar to that and and we have to fight it to you you know you had if he wanted to take up here and I think part of Africa in our area but actually at a moment we'll hear him\nOn that we decided to retire and our current course might say thank you\nI did I Do I think you have any rocket white people and people like that that there have been at the Yale and we're starting out by meeting of course you have a rabbit ... find that wow you know I'm really excited so\nWhy did eleven people sign up but they knew you were interested you\nKnow send them I Know and yes I Would say yes to that and then they were ... recruit from I advertise it with our local church it will keep her elementary like\nOkay I'm going to guess inside of the ones that know you signed up because of who you are as a person\nAnd my best encouragement would just be be that person because they already trust you in other words don't try to be something you're not\nI don't think you're going to just in talking to you I don't think you're that person you don't need to\nAct like your financial genius you don't need to act like you or have all the answers um you you know all you got to do is be able to turn on the DVD player play me\nYeah about whatever it was less than I Am yep and about that night and then put shares in a circle and a lot of people and be yourself the other thing is always just talk about the times that you\nFailed or that you were unsure or that you goof or whether it was ten years ago or ten minutes ago\nOr they you goofed or whether it was ten years ago or ten minutes ago um because that gives other people permission to not be perfect and there seems to be this illusion with people that everyone else has got their money act together but me I'm the only do for ...\nAnd it turns out we're all due for says\nThat makes sense for me to the primary barriers to people receiving financial teaching is guilt and shame\nAnd ... and if you can remove those by just that's what I Do tell my story all the time you hear me don't what if you've been listening a podcast that much how many times I've screwed up and you know I went broke I lost everything had to start over and all that and that's where all this came from this passion for helping other people came from\nThis idea that I hate that that's where it came from was for I've got a PHD and do you and be and so what that does it makes me approachable right and I'm not I'm not some guy drops his glasses on the end of his nose and looks down in the south was looks down his nose at you you know\n[noise] uh I got in a pretty bad motorcycle accident Mm how're you doing ah\nI Am I'm blessed to be here I'm actually a K you're\nPhysically coming back\nUh yes um my body recover great so I'm happy I can do this a little bit of a um a movement issue they my shoulder but besides that I'm fine how\nAre you getting a future surgeries coming up a no okay well good well I'm Glad I'm Glad you're doing a good that's awesome okay same so uh what what are you are thinking of putting the money on [noise]\nSo me and my wife have agreed that we want to use this money to buy a house mhm but she um [noise] when we were not agreeing on that she wants to put the majority of the money all the down payment and save about twenty thousand for emergencies mhm\nAnd I ain't the perfect time to get rid of all like that and also have a good amount for a down payment on a house ...\nAnd still have some leftover bushy agreeing with me with that\nAnd I just want to hear your opinion on what you think would be the better move well she's not agreeing with you I don't know why she would agree with me [laughter]\nBut anyway the uh uh we tell people not to buy a home unless your debt free how much debt do you have\nTo get it we have about forty five thousand dollars and ...\nI Would pay that off and I would hope twenty back for an emergency room but the rest of your down payment\nIf I were in your shoes I Would not buy a house with that still laying around I think that's dangerous you're asking for trouble\nAnd so on and so my vote is going on your side of this argument I'm afraid but I don't know I honestly I don't know why she would answer to listen to makes no let me tell you this I Will tell you that I Would not do any of this unless you guys get on a budget and you agree to never borrow money again\nOkay yes that I have a track to talk to her about that I'm actually a new economic trying to get her off or ... she's not really to come ... also having trouble getting her on board with the plan has well you know\nI can imagine so um I I highly recommend you don't do anything until you can come into agreement okay\nBecause you're going to make a mistake when you Shannon I when we have an argument like this we uh we have to we have a rule we have to do nothing until we can come into agreement\nOn large purchases large gifts large decisions we decide nothing is the only thing we can do until we're in agreement\nAnd ah so I recommend you do nothing until the two of you can get on the same page um do you think that she would go to financial piece university if I gave you a one year membership\nI honestly do think I've been talking to her mother trying to help me out just because she's so stubborn about this and her mother is on my side as well\nOr hasn't won I ask what I asked was can you get your wife to go to financial ... university to the nine lessons and if I give you the one year membership\nYes there you think so why she pressure upper\nI think that might mean her mind would sit down with her and explain to her um\nGo to the climate is free okay I'm going to give it to you but I'm only going to give it to you on the condition that she attends with you\nOK because if you go by yourself or the cause of divorce does you're going to get more and more and more and more excited about getting out of debt and living with a plan and you get it's going to drive a wedge further between you own I don't want to do that\nSo I just if you can talk her into just attending one or two classes with you I think she'll go on and go to the others I'm pretty persuasive but uh but\nDon't go by yourself do it'll cause problems hold on I'll have Kelly pick up I'll give you the financial ... membership for a year and that includes the nine lessons that you can attend and you can watch them on line and everything else um but do not do this without her it's a it's contingent upon that my gift is\nAll right Dave is with us from Stockton, California Hi Dave how are you\nOh good afternoon date how you doing Jay better than I deserve what's up with that\nHi Dave how are you oh good afternoon Dave how you doing today better than I deserve what's up well that that's good faith um\nWith my wife and I are few coordinators had looked at St get free\nAnd we major wisdom and guided something where we also have a little disagreement um last year she had her son got married we loaded with money to help them out really knowing knowing that we would never probably see the money again okay um\nWhy would you do that you're ...\nYou know what that's a good question [laughter] that's a good question I maybe it's because I haven't talked for about a year I\nLost touch with every with that aspect of it but um we volunteer to pay for true to class which they did but in the end they didn't just from the ... or\nAnd or building a ... kind of at all mhm well\nAfter six months we decided to see what kind of make the U.S back anything we kind of like no we weren't going it alone and me more money because they had made no effort to to reimburse anything of it and and there was no communication command indicate me on her famous back\nWell you know life goes several months later only vehicle broke down\nAnd um and it could not be repaired and my son had no way to get to work this is where it gets sticky let 'em knowing it my wife has a good picture of her parents trustworthy dispersion funds to all the fisheries\nRecruited him we both agreed to Frank about Ninety percent of what the what we see with the understanding that he would immediately pay us back when the checks for it and\nSo the logic was it they were our income is under they were already ... her parents trash\n'em as it today we have not distributed that money but it's getting it's getting a little stick here here it's going to be distributed next couple of weeks\nWe wouldn't do what you do in the meantime they did they took out I'm a ... a a a thousand dollar loans to pay off for months of overdo rent the otherwise they'd be um evicted and I got her life just does not want to work to help out\nSo my English in ... mirrors and because they have not demonstrated responsibility and came back yard alone I have strongly suggested ... and I think that's about as far as that goes into my wife's side\nThat my wife write the check to them having come over and sided with us and we would write them a check for the balance of what what they didn't ... how do we didn't we didn't find them and it seems simple and we know if we approach it that way that would be successful\nAnd lemonade the temptation then using the hunt and that's certainly not clean his backers agreed and be in my opinion to be more proactive to solving this sort of\nA show that much from a non thousand dollars\nRight ... right now what's your network now what's that what's your net worth\nA ... [noise] I don't know five hundred six hundred what's your household income uh I'm thirty maybe\nOkay right and let me just say oh you know here's my opinion this is all your fault\nMy fault yeah OK you loan people money that we're broke and don't handle money well and went against everything that you were supposed to have been taught by us which would you loan family money right you're the one made this mess\nI okay I take the job now I Try to correct that they're not making it worse yeah and so I'm Wondering you\nCan do is say forget it I don't pay me back forget it I'm an idiot I should have given your money I've never given you any more ever under any circumstances\nRight right and she she believes that that we should just be trusting meal the check to them and then hope they'll reimburse\nUs either ...\nOr ... that's ... ... they're not\nGoing to ... assumption that is not gonna happen you mail a check them you're never going to see this money and then you don't have the shot if you're going to speak to your own shoulder over money or not it's just the crap you get into when you're alone family members money all your fault\nSo maybe you want to if she wants to walk you through that that's fine but don't ever do the skin\nAbsolutely ludicrous you're asking for all the rumble your cost you cause every bit of that [noise]\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family is the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't\nBig difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed\nPaying for the mortgage utilities\nFood and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement that's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting term life insurance\nJust go to ... or insurance dot com recall eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two and see

clients so I've been applying to finance jobs and I can't get anything 'cause every once in a moment you have experience and\nI don't have the experience and I I graduated early so I did other summer classes and it can get internships hospitals are kind of on hold on I'm going to answer all job or you try it into\nFinancial analyst financial I'm like I've I've been even doing accounting like account level any ... receivable [noise]\nYou know entry level stuff mhm are you there is get your foot in the door\nI'm OK well here's here's one thing I Will tell you and Ken Coleman will tell you this as well go to the Ken Coleman show dog Tom and download his free PDF on how to put together a resume but resumes and applications without relationship are useless\nUm I'll give you an example uh we have eight hundred people here just under a hundred people work on our team we hired a hundred and fifty to two hundred last year we had Fifteen thousand the applications\nFor those moderate hires\nYou get lost in that ... and ... there's not that I don't wanna answer and talk to every one of those Fifteen thousand people is just logistically not reasonable\nAnswer what ends up happening is you get lost in the stock of that stuff unless you know someone that works there and you don't have to be best friends with them you just cause I got to tell you we don't ever hire somebody because somebody called me and says are ever [noise] but we would give them an interview\nAnd pull their pulled the resume out of the stack\nYou got to get out of the pile you know and so some of these places are trying to get on with you need to figure out if your sister that's married a kids play soccer where the guy that works over there or something like that where you can find someone that will put in a little bit of a word for you\nTo at least get the door open\nAnd that'll get you in the door again you're you're not going to get hired because of that kind of a reference matter of fact there are very few references where you just calls up somebody and I get your hired almost never happens that'll decent job anyway\nI mean if they're hiring just bodies you can get something like that but at a good job they're really going to want to interview you and learn about you and that will be true here so we don't guarantee anybody a higher but we will at least talk to them\nAnd you know what might be a very short conversation no you don't qualify than setting or looking for but at least we'll talk to them and give the resume out of the file [noise]\nIf somebody knows I'm Sorry go download that and listen we can all mature we'll help you with all this stuff it's very very difficult out there but I think you can leave some [noise]\n\n\n\nWhy in the world would you trust some random guy and

biggest cheerleader I Know you had to have good tractors that was easy yeah\nBut who is the biggest cheerleader\nOr I Would say my parents or my mom had followed you for years and also people in my church family as well because they are I talked a lot about you and we're encouraging me to look into because they knew I had a lot of student loans\nYeah yeah so I mean you went from being completely crushed by student loan debt to completely owning it\nYeah I felt like I was suffocating under the debt I remember being so scared when I was sitting there and actually looking at the balance is and I didn't know if it was even going to be possible to get out but I didn't really have\nAnother plan and so I figured I'm just going to go with you know Dave Ramsey and stick with it and just commit to it and see what happens in twenty two months later I Am a final payment\nYou know you probably know almost two hundred thousand a year for two years ... ... you were on\nWhich is pretty incredible but you're making four Fifteen modest taxes which takes a big chunk of it so you weren't living you weren't you weren't splurging on anything now are you weren't starving to death but you weren't splurging and just completely into show as you're going along you're you're hitting this thing\nWhen you're hitting it almost twenty thousand bucks a month yeah a Fifteen to twenty a month on a given month at what point when you started doing that did you go wait a minute this is actually going to work how far in war you before the before kind of the ... which kind of flip for you\nWell I paid off all the smallest ones first I had a total of twenty different student loans and so they wanted to attack the smallest ones first and then once I saw how easy it was to do that and then I started to have\nSome more hope that I Would be at what a pay off the largest ones I think my largest individual alone was right around fifty thousand dollars and prior to that I had just looked at it and I was like there was no way like there's I'm not going to be able to do this\nSo your trunk and some of these like one or two a month yeah knocking them off the little baby ones when you first started yeah and that yeah but I had to give you a lot of emotional boost deaf in his debt snowball really kicked in for you than they did what he was supposed to do that let you know that this was going to work\nMhm wow wow wow wow wow wow\nAll right so what is the big takeaway when someone says oh I'm I'm a ... year hundreds of thousands I Can't get out of debt you say yes you can here's what you do you do this\nI think the most important thing is\nJust to stop burning from it stop trying to hide from it like I was trying to do um I was I just felt crushed and it was you know so afraid that I Would never got to that and I once I faced it and once I took personal responsibility for it\nAnd realized that I'm the one who signed a paper ... you know I Need to get myself out and then I just made a plan and stuck with it and made the commitment to change or your parents' good with money\nAnd they are their income is much less I'm sure they know what mine is but I learned most people's\n[laughter]\nYeah I definitely learned how to live on a budget that from my parents and also um they had been in quite a bit of a credit card that in the past and they always told me you know don't be stupid with credit card ... I'm ... smart purchases and so I think I learned a lot of those principles from them\nYou know there was a there was a sense that character that came from them that they cause you'll be able to do this that's what I was thinking\nYeah very good very good one proud of you know they are well done very well done what a great great story we've got a copy of Chris ... book for you retire inspired that's the next chapter in your story\nAnd we want you to go and be a millionaire you'll be about twenty minutes and uh and outrageously generous as we go along well done very very well on\nTouch down April from state College Pennsylvania the hundred and eighty thousand dollars paid off in twenty two months making four Fifteen E.
