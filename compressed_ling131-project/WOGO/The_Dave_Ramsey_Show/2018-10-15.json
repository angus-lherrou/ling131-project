thousand dollars and only costs you two hundred dollars\nRight and so it's still a good deal but your yeah your I have about two hundred dollars per thousand\nSo that is forgiven that hit your taxes if they ten Ninety nine you if they don't you have no obligation to list it and I would just wait until you know they do that if they follow through on that but in the larger the forgiveness is the more likely they will follow through with a ten Ninety nine\nAnd send you that but as you get that then you will do the taxes so\nYeah I'd I'd get ready for some taxes at tax time that I'm by April

talk about your life and your money it's a recall that Tripoli eight to five five two to five Daniel\nIs in Fargo North Dakota Daniel welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nThanks for taking my call sure what's up\nSo my wife and I are relocating for our job we currently live in Grand forks and removing the Fargo and um when we sell our home will have roughly fifty thousand dollars inequity after rebate real turkeys and we're wondering what they would do would you put the fifty grand down on the new home or\nPay off something down that we did and that is a thirty one thousand dollar car loan and put the courts so\nI Would sell the car [laughter] you fill the car okay [laughter] I thought that's what you might say I'm okay what's your hospital in\nA one hundred and\nBought a hundred and sixty five thousand\nHuh All right so let me let me let me kind of walk into the equation went there so clearly okay let's say that we pay off the car with this money and then loses twenty thousand are split down our house\nAnd if you are the exact same house you're talking about buying earlier I'm a ... actually you have financed your car\nOn your home mortgage would you agree with that\nYou are correct\nAnd um that would take a dumb car purchase and make it even worse\nOkay\nThat's where that's how I got there so quickly because okay basically we're financing at Cornell over Fifteen Years\nWhich I'm not going to ever obviously what ... what a refinance my house in order to buy a thirty thousand dollar car not in a million years you know and it's basically the same equation were just saying it in different ways as we continue in our conversation here\nAnd sometimes you just look at it through a different different stand over on the other side of it and look at it from the left rather than from the right you see oh my God that really is dumb you know and so it's not\nIt's not as a you know it's not just Dave says sell the car it's do you really want to finance this car over Fifteen Years\nYou know why don't want to do that so and it's a car I Can't afford I Can't afford it 'cause I didn't pay for it um if you didn't pay for a winner you can't afford it so yeah I'm Sorry dude I Know it's a sweet car my car guy and I like nice cars but\nI'm too many times are nice cars have us instead of us have them Shannon is with us in Atlanta Hi Shannon how are you\nHi\nHey what's up they're good to have you how ...\nI I I Am I'm trying to figure out what to do my [laughter] and an apprenticeship program that's paid off for about ... here\nAt a local electric utility company very cool well congratulations gosh so what kind of that was the one hundred and forty thousand dollars\nWell answer this question because all of it was mine yeah unfortunately I'd Fifteen five and a vehicle and then a hundred and twenty seven thousand to good old Sallie Mae that wow\nHow long have you guys been married three years three years and so shortly after marriage the two of you look at this pile of debt and something happened tell me what how many are story\nWell we were just kind of doing a normal thing um we were actually started out on the the ten year forgiveness program and I actually heard you come across the radio um while I was driving around in my work track and just was always interested in finances but really never knew\nUm where to start it where to begin and we picked up on your program and within a few weeks I purchased a total moneymaker ever read the book I talk or and I said we got to get on this I said we're doing it all wrong or or no\nAnd we started it out and uh she just kind of followed my lead on it oh I Would just lie about it was it was I mean she's a follower and she\nWas really good I have found leadership [laughter]\nShe or he or she didn't read the book really at all um and then eventually uh after I don't know about a year into the program she was starting to get mad at me because of the program and everything I said we just need to\nUm instead of yelling at me we need to go the financial peace and then you can hear it from the source right from Dave ... and and you can you help you take somebody does my back exactly\nYell at the the video guy yeah very cool okay so you got in there then and you saw it for yourself rather than just going oh the engineering over the numbers you know because I kind of how it started right yeah the engineer guy he's going to do the numbers I'm the\nMedical personnel let him do the numbers and then you get in there and you see it for yourself so what happened when you went to the class coordinator gave you a emotional ownership really in this thing\nSure I think it made it very tangible for me something that I can see and that the leaders of our class they were very open about their debt and how they had read it and that was something motivating for me\nFor me it felt like it was this constant uphill battle and I had this crazy burden because it was all mind yeah it's a little bit of a guilt trip yeah lately and so that class honestly made me feel a little more support it and just give us the opportunity to truly jump in and know that actually getting out of debt was realistic\nWhen you first started you I mean I Do do do it this fast we a lot of debt and twenty I it was a long\nYeah it was hard we started the ... the very beginning of January in two thousand and sixteen now and uh it was it it it was hard\nMe two years and four months run and yeah and that's what that is a long long time but it's a hundred and forty three thousand dollars and you killed at all if yes how old are you too I'm while we're both twenty eight and you're not even Thirty years old so some of these rockstar also millennials I talk about all the time [laughter]\nVery good good for you guys thinking well Tom are cool how does it feel\nNow that you've climbed the mountain it's so great it's incredible [laughter]\nI think it's one of the best feelings it's nice to know that we can move onto the baby steps now and we just want to living if like no one else when they were excited for him to keep travelling through the baby steps yeah women\nYou're making a hundred fifty thousand bucks a year and not even Thirty years old you know what I mean pretty much in the world in life is pretty good\nYeah that's awesome show or who are your biggest cheerleaders I think it was kind of each other and the very beginning we we didn't talk about it a whole lot um and we kind of had some friends and families that were saying like what what are you doing and I think after we got\nRolling through the process and we were getting some traction paying off quite a bit of money ... are quite a bit of debt people started to come around now when you look at somebody go already paid off for a hundred thousand dollars a comes shuts 'em up you know an absolutely how\nYou know it's like you don't have to shut up it just says it was good yeah that's great very cool you guys very very well done which the key to getting out of that\nFor us I think it was giving it together first of all the also being willing to work very hard I work three jobs and worked overtime but um and also never really strengthen the path I feel like once we decided to jump into the plan\nWe did not stray from that and honestly whenever I Would buy something like if I spent too much on groceries I Would feel bad because that was money that would be knocking on my lens Mm\nMhm yeah I gave you gave your boundaries on process you know what about you oh I think the the the\n... it was it was it was good I mean we we we were the key for him for you what was the main thing that got you out of debt you know work extra hours or if the if you raise your income over fifty thousand dollar\nCourtney finished a residency program that was huge for her um since she got a big raising them you know I Would I Would say call 'em and and be dispatch at the utility company and just uh the extra income any chance you could get extra overtime home do it you know it it really helps with the snowball just pull out\nThe business ... book it's almost like a work but that helps you put it in
