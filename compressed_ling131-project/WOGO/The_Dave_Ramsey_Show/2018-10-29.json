I'm not exactly sure what the ... ... if I'm not the beneficiary to that it or how to handle it\nMhm okay so he took us out when your husband was a trial yeah\nThis is not a term policy it's a whole life life insurance policy\nAnd it's close to ... million dollars\nWow it should be canceled okay\nIf it's a whole life insurance policy ... million dollars is a very expensive\nRight and and like my main concern you know I found out the beneficiary and I don't I mean he's a great guy I'm not worried about you know that it's\nOut on my own view it as a guy doesn't matter of a good guy that's it's it's really weird that it's continued to have the parents are the beneficiary and this was a grown man with family of four with four kids\nYeah there was a ... and like the greyhound on you know a wild one\nBut it's strange how\nLong have you been married a long you been married\nFive years you know\nFive years they've not address this issue\nThat strength is right you know\nReally I mean they should you should address the issue and they should not be the beneficiaries anymore you should be and really the policy ought to just be canceled\nBecause I Would I Would not want to pick up the ... I Would not want to pick up the premiums on the half a million dollar policy that's a whole lot policy because it's new twenty times more expensive than term to create an investment inside of it called cash value that has a poor right of return that when you die they keep your money\nSo our whole life insurance is a horrible financial product\n\nAnd so if you just called me up and you just owned by half a million dollars of whole life I Would say cancel it as soon as you got your term in ...\nBut you're not paying for today anyway so today you get your term insurance symbolizes proper on you and on your husband and I I think your husband should have a discussion with his dad and say dad\nOr I'm going to go ahead and suggest you drop that policy now I Will not be taking over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you ought to drop it\nRight yeah that's so like I don't want to be paying for something you know and it cuts but you have fallen time\nIt's not only nah needed because we're not going to take it over and that was the original plan plan has now changed\nYep 'cause you can make decisions as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve how are you\nDavid how are you today better than I deserve what's up\nI'm I'm a question uh regarding up part of my retirement savings should come as a thing called a pension from my company [laughter] and that overall is about\nEight percent of my total as a\n...\nWell it's I mean a person it's projected to be a at a project that retirement they are two hundred and eighty four thousand dollars and that is that would be about ... percent of my total assets you know and and\nMy question is whether it's an ... a lump sum yes or no\n... ... ... ... yes or ... okay\nHere's why okay if you die or not if you die when you die [laughter] 'cause we're all going to die or get when you die or that money's gone\n'cause it's a pinch and you get your ... and you if you have a survivor benefit or something there it might it might go to your spouse for a while but when your spouse you and your spouse die even if there's a survivor benefit the money's gone ...\nAnd if you live are as long as you live it's going to pay at a rate of about five percent in this current market\nSo it's ... if you had an account and the investment advisor said OK stable got an account for you over here two hundred Ninety five thousand you can invest it you can make five percent on your money and when you die the money's gone\nOr you could think that two hundred and eighty five thousand you can roll into some mutual funds in a good IRA roll over and mutual funds will perform better than five percent and when you die the money stays with your family well that'd be a better deal\nYeah I did [laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah versus a hundred percent joint and survivor annuity but uh\nSo it still love you die then yeah you got survivorship on it but when both of you know the same concept ... so the bottom line is it's got a decent but low rate of return while you live but the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you\nDie makes this a bad deal\nAnd so you always take pension lumps on almost always take Benjamin lumps arms enroll them to IRAs and invest them and good roast our mutual funds which sounds like your net worth ... million\nUh yeah it's a closer to\nClose that and that's probably about four oh well they're total total man where the assets house so forth\nYou know to ... congratulations how old are you I'm sixty three way to go\nHow much of this did you inherit\n[noise] um probably somewhere in a hurry to four hundred range from my uh my family and my wife came on forty a millionaire or that was before that happened a\nMillionaire or my wife's mother passed away yes uh when my mom my my parents type relatively young at that point in time not a millionaire no\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar net worth because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\nA holding pattern or because of the amount you inherited is ... maybe ... percent maybe ... percent\nOf its lowest irrelevant yeah OK cool yes I'm I'm always researching and asking millionaires how they did it for the benefit of our listeners because I got a twenty four year old listening right now that's got the opportunity of hearing from an actual sixty four year old person who actually has a four million dollar net worth what would you tell that twenty four year old how how should they be you when they grow up\n[laughter] [noise]\nWell I certainly you got to a live well below you mean they are a modest lifestyle which\nWe haven't done and I think also too I I I Know when I was new people do stupid things I've done a stupid thing which I think if you can limit\nStupid thing that that should do along the way that's good I like that [laughter] big\nBecause McCain every every everybody listening right now is has done or will do stupid things but then you can minimize those things should along the way\nAnd we have a modest lifestyle with below you mean um yeah Lloyd\nSo do you think there'll be done and that twenty four year old still have a four million dollar net worth forty years from now if you're listening to me right now\nBut he is probably probably even higher if they if they minimize those stupid it maybe I get minimize or as much along the way yes\nVery well done well congratulations sir menu done very very well\n[noise] so yeah I Would roll your pension into an IRA and that way it survives you and the ... all the math on that works to your benefit a at a Wal alive if you put it in mutual funds and upon death\nFor short you come out three hundred grand ahead\nSo the question about it a thank you for joining us and thanks for letting me interview you for a minute there\nIt's always good for people here how to be a real millionaire [noise]\nOh I Love this

should ah you know at two twenty five K now I can afford something up there\nWith how much do you have in non retirement is that all you've got a to point hiking on retirement talking about a half million dollar house them yes or what's\nYour household income\nOr about one eighty\nOkay the reason we tell folks to not buy in the military in most cases is because you're not in the home long enough for it to appreciate enough\nTo sell it and make a profit and also sometimes some military markets have an oversupply of homes on the market they're hard to resell\nSo you get stuck in it and you lose money on it in some markets in Pensacola would not be one of those markets usually and certainly San Diego would not be one of those market you're going to she incredible appreciation and incredible market activity in both of those markets you should so\nSo you should be able to get out of this and make a profit on the one you bought there and that's what it sounds like you're doing\nAnd you should be able to do the same in San Diego and I do agree real estate prices are up substantially um\nI'm not sure that you have to use all of that I Would probably if I were in your shoes what would I Do if I woke up in your shoes or I Would either a your rent or be I Would pay cash for whatever I bought in San Diego\nAnd that would mean one or two things that neither one of which are going to be comfortable one is I'm not going to I'm not going to spend as much as you're talking about spending instead of been spending five hundred maybe four hundred and leave a hundred and non retirement\nUm or I'm I'm just going to get comfortable in order to have a house like that with having no non retirement investing until I re sell this house now\nIf you re sell this house let's say you bought it for five Seventy five or five fifty use up all your cash or non returned my character and money from this other home\nAnd it goes up to seven hundred when your salad you're probably next move moving to a cheaper market\nThere's not many more expensive markets for you to move to in the military than San Diego\nThat's about the also I mean Hawaii Hawaii maybe okay by a there's a couple of other main there's one or two but most of the markets would be well most markets in general not just naval markets but markets in general would be cheaper in the San Diego I think we all agree to that so if you make some money and you're there are three years\nAnd you sell out you're going to put money back in non retirement investing in by a less expensive home may be a larger home but less expensive home the next by and the next station does that make sense yes or the\nIt's not really a permanent decision even if you use all your non returned my cash although I'm with you I don't think I'd want to use it all I'd probably try to buy something\nIn the foreign hundreds instead of in the five hundreds leaving me with some cash in non non retirement investing a but the point in your point you're making is from my portfolio standpoint I don't like it all be in the morning\nBut the point at your point you're making is from my portfolio standpoint I don't like it all in one house and I don't like it all and I don't like so much of it being um I don't like using up all my non retirement investing from a portfolio standpoint my answer to that is is not for that long\nYou're not going to be there ten years\nAnd if you are that that makes us going to change during that ten years\nUm but if you're not then you're going to reset your mix when you buy a different type of real is different expense of real estate in the next next location that your station I thank you for serving your country sounds like you're doing a good analysis on it I'm just kind of joining you in the discussion Jason is with us from Tucson, Arizona Hi Jason how are you\nHow you doing better than I deserve what's up\nI I own my own business and I'm not trying to figure out how not to be a crime and under or ... years old ... retirement should I go or oh\nOkay well you know I started a retirement and I guess I\nDo you ... well the first thing we teach folks to do is to get out of that and have an emergency fund before you start retirement and the reason is because if you don't have any payment you are more money freed up to put into retirement and then we want you to put five Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement Jason what do you make a year\nA and about around a lot of average probably right about a thousand only\n[noise] okay so somewhere around fifty grand a year okay the affair and out are you\nI'm thirty four and okay good do you have any debt no good for you or you're single okay okay does your wife workouts are home\nYeah yesterday she and her mother she make a right about that and get all kinds aren't so you've got about a hundred and twenty thousand dollar household income and no doubt it\nAnd you're thirty four years old well done well we want to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses that grandma's rainy day fund and then we would tell you to put Fifteen Percent of your household income\nInto retirement and that's going to be about Eighteen thousand dollars a year in your case going into retirement and now you're asking how to fund that if if she as a nurse has a thorough three or four one K. available at our hospital or a doctor's office you would put some money there especially if there's a match\nAnd then you both need to do a Roth IRA you can do five thousand five hundred each that's eleven thousand dollars of the Eighteen that we need to be putting in right there\nAnd put that in good growth stock mutual funds and Jason to help you set that up and teach you how it works just 'cause you need to learn how it works you don't do it because I said do it or someone else said do you do it because you understand it and you don't buy something you don't understand when it comes to investing\nThat I recommend good growth stocks mutual funds for your long term investing in your ... in your Roth IRAs\nAnd if you want some help with that go to Dave Ramsey dot com and click ...

go friend's\nWedding our money kind of flow out wherever and to really nail down a budget and in the envelope system and that was hard for me to\nThink for me it's just the the sacrifice\nUm you know the world we live in just the spirit of comparison and just seeing everyone around you spend money and buying new the nice things and I'm just constantly you know telling ourselves that will be later and you know when we went through the class and I know it's kind of what you always say but\nIt really it's been embedded in me is just you know live like no one else so that you can look like no one

trying to figure out whether or not to pay down uh\nMy house or my wife how [noise]\nUh and we also have a some equity that was given to me when I purchased my home I'm actually a kind of paying my father back or just a home from my father um the interest rate that I'm getting a mortgage [noise]\nUh so where we I'm I've been on the program for about two years ah everything's paid off and we I worked for the government and my wife's a teacher [noise]\nUh so we're already putting up and to Fifteen Percent of our income into our a shirt myself um I actually am a I went to the government version of a financial ... university [noise]\nUm so where are you talking about the ts eight oh I have my job my wife has a ... a free day I'm funny thing is I'm actually one of the uh coordinator for\nFor for that okay so you're working on those four or five and six you got your return my going your debt free you have your emergency fund inflation you have a house that you live in and you have a I guess for rental house was the second house but one of you used to live in is that correct\nCorrect and there's the other house rented\nIt her her brother is living there um he is living there by himself he's paying us a openly after the mortgage and the uh association fees and the taxes are paid we're actually losing about a hundred and thirty six dollars a month on the house\nAnd ... and her brother\n[noise] well it's not that we're subsidizing him I'm openly I Would just rather or at least this with the mindset was that I Would rather have him there\nAnd uh we get some tax benefit from the house so I assume that the hundred and thirty six dollars a month that we're losing our actually getting back at the end of the year to at least break even or maybe still make some money on their own\n... even I'm All right so you got this is that her house or your house like a person says her brother living there correct okay if you didn't own not how she wouldn't go buy that house and call tax benefits and subsidizing brother a good plan\nYeah we're actually ups and downs in the house she bought it for two and probably worth about one Seventy one eighty\nOkay well we'll probably hold it and break even do we can get it come on up in value what's your household income\nUh between the two of the about one between one eighty and two hundred and cash or your question is what\nMhm okay at shower you I'm Sorry ... show you how old am thanking you told me that I'm sure now and you stayed there because of a scholarship to nursing school\nYes sir it's ah it's thirty eight I graduated here parents may get a job opportunity\nOkay so the scholarship is partial Yes sir how much of a scholarship that you get\nTwenty thousand every four years that it wasn't a large line\nTwenty over four years and it's a four year old program I take it there and what does it cost\nIt back in ... nearly\nOkay of which you have five it's actually need eight Yes sir plus you need to eat yeah there's that detail right where are you living with friends family what\nI'm living with frankly I bought a house out in the country because it's cheaper\nYou and some friends were roommates yeah okay and so you have rent and electricity or share and you have food and you need to get out and you need eight thousand dollars a year [laughter] okay so when we had all of that up what does your rent and other stuff cost you a month it\nCost me about nine hundred dollars and looking out my dad and I work minimum wage and things like clean up the holidays and things like that trying to make a little bit of extra money\nMhm okay All right so let's let's kind of had that up then I get about twelve thousand dollars a year for that and I need a thousand dollars a year for ... for tuition and some other are probably some books some stuff too but we're pretty close their show twenty thousand dollars a year is what you need to earn\nIt there and minimum wage doesn't do that [laughter] sounds like you need a new job\n[noise] and I have an opportunity to start a whole failing family name brand clothing at it now I don't have the money to put up right now\nNo we don't need to get into that you have a job you need a job you need to show you can make more you can make 'em Fifteen twenty dollars an hour babysitting and manning you can make\nGood money cleaning houses Fifteen dollars an hour ten dollars an hour cleaning houses I'm walking dogs uh other stuff\nSo I I think we need to get your doing something along those lines and the other benefit of those are not only do you make a lot more than minimum wage and by the way you make enough to work your way through with the numbers that you and I are discussing here I'm In um you are gonna be working all the time though\nAnd if you but if you can get a situation like that the semi self employed where you're cleaning some houses you're doing some nanny and you're doing some whatever um and you\nUh you can control your time and you can make more money you can control when you work and how much you work now you are going to struggle\nBecause you're going to work and study and go clash and that's all you're going to do\nBut you can make it if you do that\nThe other thing I Would do is I Would apply for a bunch of scholarships the third thing I Would do is investigate some of the hospital companies that are out there particularly in your immediate area talk to the nursing school\nAnd see if there are any of them that if you agree to work for them for a couple of years after school how much of the nursing they would pick up for you\nOkay kinda been indentured servants type program if you've ever heard of those\nIt and I know there is a hospital and actually planning on working at a time that they will forget all light the light at work but in her body\nWell let's see if we can get a job over there now and let them just pay for it now\nOkay rather than have to pay you back for student loans because I'm trying to keep you out of student loans with the mouth where you are doing here\nSo I Want you to apply for a hundred more scholarships you'll get turned down for most of them but if you get another five thousand it really helps the situation a lot I Want you to think about doing different things for work that make you a lot more money and you can control the time\nAnd I want you to investigate with this hospital or what they will do and talk to the nursing school about ... anything they can do to help you as well that you're working your way through but\nYou you sound like you are to me just talking to you you're you're very very mature for Seventeen years old that sounds to me like you're a rock star\nThinking and so I don't think you need to play beer pong his real hot [laughter]\nI I think you don't mind working and and grinding and hustling grind to get your way through this and not come out of this with you know forty fifty ten thousand twenty thousand dollars a student loan that you don't need to it but you're going to have to make some\nIf the ten thousand twenty thousand dollars a student loan debt you don't need to it but you're going to have to make some very distinct and very careful choices to do this and the good news is you're living expenses are very reasonable Andrew tuition is very reasonable and the third piece of good news is you've chosen a fabulous career\nIn terms of employment you will be able to get employed instantaneously\nI'm mean nursing is just there's always a shortage\nSo you're going to do very very well but I Would do talked about the talk to the hospital administrator at the local hospital just shut up an appointment with them and just walk in there like you own the place is a kind of a you can do that\nAnd uh just tell them that they need to pay for your school and then you'll promise to work there how's that work\nAnd how can you help me get through school because I don't want a bunch of student loan debt I'm trying to not be a statistic and you know get get him impressed with you and and let him help you be a hero in your story and a him or her that a hospital administrator\nWho by the white needs nurses so they're going to be very intentioned\nA very very inclined towards helping someone in your position especially someone who walks in and ask for help and walks in and says what can I Do to earn some help and so on and um you know get get some people on your side helping you accomplish this um\nThis task glitch in front of you but you're on your way you're doing really good congratulations very proud to talk to your call me back if you need help as you're fighting through this Greg is with us from Milwaukee Hi Greg how are you\n[noise] Dave thank you for taking my call how are you today\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] well I just have a question for you I'm On a way out our portfolio and get your opinion on a couple of things here um my wife and I don't have any debt out with the exception all\nOf our house um we do we use our cars and um [noise] we do that um I have a customer and that and a good client of mine that\nI reciprocate or the money that they spend with me back with them so it's kind of a win win situation um for both of us share the main question that I have is we have the\nUm [noise] ... invest bench I'm over a hundred thousand dollars with\n'em too off IRAs and some mutual funds and that type of thing ah she has four one K. I. about four one K. actually has a pension I'm actual wow and right now we are\nPaying above and beyond our mortgage I'm bought our house by about ten to twenty percent and and putting that toward the house with the amount of investments that we have diversified compared to what we're putting into our houses is that the right formula\nWe tell folks but Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement once you're dead free except the house and have your emergency fund and above Fifteen Percent of your income and going into retirement and your debt free except your emergency fund them I Will put everything above that towards the house till the house is paid off\n... took your income sounds point one five\nMake sure the total of all the Roth IRAs four one\nK. close to reaching you're doing is essentially that I'm not ready to them that much greater than that back some of the contributions down a little bit to throw the balance of our surface not up for that has to get it up to that and throw the balance of the house\nThen we suggest you're listening to all forms of categories gross income aggressive growth and international [noise]\nI get asked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance is not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family\nHas debt and not enough savings to provide for their financial\nAid that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where you are in your baby steps it's a necessity\nNot a choice this includes working husbands and wives as well as stay at home parents it's pretty expensive to replace a stay at home parent responsibilities I only recommend term life insurance since is the most affordable\nWay to get the right amount of coverage and not break your budget go to ... dot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two these are the guys I personally use the term life insurance is inexpensive and your family\nKnow they said how are you know good how can I help\nUm I have a question for you it with all your data for a little less in the air now and I feel like we are on the head on retirement we're behind\nWe are on I had already Hyman we're behind on college savings search you can show how old are your kids you and they are twelve and ten\nOkay and how old are you guys we are forty six okay and how much is in retirement\nOn a limb or very rarely\nDo your head congratulations ... so what's your household income\nAs an only child that way I can make yeah we\nWe are I mean when you have on our million dollars you're millionaire yeah okay yeah you're you're a ... ... what is your household income\nA little over two hundred\nOkay so why can you not say Fifteen Percent of two hundred and still catch up and get have plenty of money for college when you've got eight years before college\nWell we're paying for private school right now as well\nWhat are you paying for ... how much cash how much ... than a year per kid or total total okay you make two fifty when looking at you like it you don't have like two hundred I leave me one eighty\nOkay\nAnd if you can cash flow twenty thousand a year for private school that's ... ... that cash flow can return towards cash flow in college too if they choose a college that's a reasonably expensive\nYeah OK okay that's a good point and yes Hi\nSo I I I you know Fifteen Percent of your household income going into retirement you don't need it you're in good shape I agree with you if you want to stop it's not the end of the moral\nBut I don't think your house to stop if you'll just sit down and actually do a written budget on a two hundred thousand dollar your income twenty thousand out for kids to school today we're going to offset some of that was cash flow in some college but some college we want to immigrants and set aside\nAnd put Fifteen Percent ahead side so we're talking about thirty thousand dollars that's fifty thousand bucks going into these two things\nCollege in return I mean I'm Sorry a private school in retirement and then we got to say something to college you shake\nTen grand a year per kid another twenty grand you can do that\nA front for from now until I go to school they'll have plenty of money\nI mean you just Jack up to five twenty nine and pick out good mutual funds that you control and saw that five twenty nine get or the one of those more investor pros and they'll help you do that ... ... dot com for a list of them in your area there are people we recommend them sit down when you were there five twenty nine together\nAnd pop ten grand a piece in those two I don't think you have to cut retirement back but if you're putting more than Fifteen Percent into retirement than you are not working our plan at this stage\nBecause you put Fifteen Percent into retirement until college and it was done and houses paid off only when those two things are done and then you're a baby step seven to increase returned might be on Fifteen Percent and Fifteen Percent or two hundred thousand started ground\nSo that that's what I'm doing this map here I think you can do it I think you just gotta sit down and not have this vague worry about it\nAnd instead of having an actual game plan will lay out and go this was important this is more important than other things that we're doing that we need to stop doing so that we can do this and that's ten grand a year per kid for college\nTo kids at some point granted if that's what I mean you got is where you are so good questions thanks for joining U.S Open phones a
