the you know what happened to them I mean do you think the market is growing or is it shrinking is are companies like I noticed you didn't see Amazon wish I was really happy about ... are you on Amazon\nOn it and I remember that we have from\nYeah 'cause I'm kind of an Amtrak train but you're really playing with people like advertising\nKnow I'm I'm an anti Amazon guy I kind of in fundamentally don't like Amazon only because they don't protect intellectual properties and they are in fact I've noticed that damages on basics there's there's evidence I don't know\nProperties and they are in fact I've noticed\nThat the Amazon basics there's there is evidence I don't know if it's true and there's evidence that they are actually knocking off the people themselves they're not even not just about allowing other people who are knock off artist but the company or knocking products off and got a sourcing center in ah in on the orient or called Amazon basics and if they notice about an item is really hard to go knock it off\nOr one of my friends I was the ... guy and it was the hardest selling item on Amazon last year and then everybody's buying into the parts except now from my friend these actually soon as the cross to a certain income threshold at which they took away the buy button and the copy them and put their own product and it's indistinguishable say look the same name same everything\nAnd I ... I've heard that story three or four times now so I'm I'm into I I I like platforms like ... are you on E. bay into\nPower factor that I like ...\nBecause they protect the end they protect intellectual property and there's more and and uh it's it's I think it's a better value better price costs less and uh I think I was watching their numbers are actually growing again this so I think they've turned the corner\nAnd I love the pay pal platform um which is which is kind of gets to way 'cause when you're on the online platforms we've noticed that a lot of a\nLot of fraud artist come out of the woodwork right yeah yeah I mean we we uh you know ah we we dabbling some musical instruments I was in the piano business sort of course I Can't you know can't let go the piano because I've got some special items and as soon as you put a decent item up there all these frogs to show up to your money\nSerious serious products are so I I like the fact that the pay pal protects you so that's interesting I Love your ... I Love your approach now the storm approach you said you wanted to get into stores how are you going to do that\n[laughter] [noise] not part of that fire but now I don't want to hang up on line right

airport in ... there was only there for them I think is\nIs there for them as they're there for them it's kind of an interesting experience I I Wish you all the luck I I actually believe from what you've told me they are doing a couple of hundred units a day on Walmart dot com it won't be long 'til you're on the shelf and when you're on the shelf a whole new set of problems shows up how do you start three thousand stores how do you\nKeep human dory turns how do you keep that going how do you do the ET I there's all kinds of threats shows but there's all kinds of easy ways to solve that

prescription\nNavigating the health care and has become I challenged control your own healthcare Huh Interesting with liberty healthcare ripping health care not insurance agent of temptation queen night with like minded people as soon as possible medical needs neighbor helping neighbor\nWhen more now that going to be on call dot org liberty uncalled dot org\nThing is it's so funny that you bring that up because what happens if you're doing a pitch\nAnd somebody interrupt you for the clothes I Know ... each person to go down to the question I never answer yeah peace that what we're talking about because here's another point I Want to teach you you don't want some of their money\nThat you want everybody you want to all of their money they work hard to get that bill ... yeah you're working with a heart attack and then have a you don't want to take that guy's twenty dollars that you want you want to take all fifty people twenty dollars so how do you do that\nAll in the first person comes up there and says how much is it\nYou say you tell the whole audience that he's ready to buy\nThem all your money is or what does that mean guys got money money have you with that kind of got money up his money on already how how much of a hold of your money\nIn fact when he says I never saw that he's not going to twenty dollars in his hand and he actually literally told him to hold the money he's told the hold up the money and it was a guy standing in the eye is holed up that much money or bill because if you do I'm going to double the opera for you\nTo lose a guy holding money next you know other people other people are starting a whole month you want to pigs clothes and then you want to roll\nRight pitch closer to roll that's a big thing so what you want to do is if you're selling item at a trade show you need a cashier because the person pitching shouldn't be taking the money that the person pitching is building a tip building the audience pitching and closing and rolling them off to a cashier why\nWater tracks the crowd more than people standing in line to buy something\nBecause if you don't write your pitch closer to rural you don't have to build a tip again evidence ... right but if you took the money\nThey all scattered around he'd have to start building the presentation again and that's now you've got your time now now you're now you're deluding how much money you can make in a few hours because you've got to do it all over again but if you do it right with the cashier that's why it's worth paying even a minimum wage to person to take the money because the accident taking money building next crowd right\nSo there's a report in things and if you're going to a trade show I got to tell you the strategic locations really important to so when you're pitching at a trade show one of the most important decisions you'll make aside from going to the trade show is aware and the trade show will you be set up ... give us some ...\nSome of the tips of vi V. either on the outside rose in the corners yes those are the biggest those are the biggest the most the best areas to be\nSo listen to what he said the outside perimeter rose why when you walk into a room you never walk into a room and walk straight you know\nMost people will walk into the room and his running right now thinking about that first time I Know um show and turn right\nSo where is the best part to be right there on the right out\nSo the perimeter Ohio usually the first perimeter wrote this way is the best location because mom and dad are going okay there we go all the way around or do you go up and down the aisles think about when you walk into a grocery store to even think about how a grocery store is laid out\nWhere's the meat section in the grocery store the most expensive yeah we've already met her aisles maybe you're always on the perimeter riles your best selling stop and think about it and\nHow would they be gross republics that we have and you walk in your turn right yeah they actually live in or out like that they make you do it right and that's what you're going to do every single time in a room so you want to be on the perimeter out on the right hand side\nAnother good spot is and you pointed out as those corners on your lap cat or a cat yeah so those and capsules corners because it says on the right stuff but the website because we I don't know why I can call you over from those corner so and the quarter is good\nBecause you've got to lay down their faces and yeah you can build a big trip yeah there's a big dip in ... then I think you should do when you're at a trade show you're probably going to say why you're not going to have the guts to do this but you have to have the guts to do this you have to do two things\nNeed to get a microphone little microphone megaphone you're not you're not a rock concert you want to elevate your voice just a little bit more and I'll tell you why because he will lose your voice pitching twenty four hours or ... hours a day for four days you know I have a voice after the second or third day especially if you're just new at it right\nOut of you can get the voice on a make a little bit little tiny speakers not big on\nJust to build that don't don't ruin your neighbors experience they build them up a little bit that's important\nAnd the second tip I Want to give you you should be standing on a box\nYou know what yes you should be higher to her article a little bit higher because you look over the audience a little bit you can call people over from the back tips on there in front of you you can build the crowd a little bit bigger [noise] those are some tips for you to help you out a trade show so what what's the takeaway\nGo to a trade show number one number to be elevated a little bit your table should be elevated shouldn't be like a lower table should be able to come up to hear other person standing and you should have it coming up to hear about pitching behind you have a microphone you should be on the\nPerimeter core perimeter our right here on the right hand side is the best part to be in the building or those corners on the other side get the corners\nRight and you should build an audience pitch the audience close\nThe audience in rolling over to a cashier and start again\nRents and repeat this right on your shampoo bottle you should be doing that all day long and one more tip I Want to give you never worked a show alone always work with a partner do our up\nIn an hour down they beat your cashier you go back and forth with why because you can't work eight hours focused on a rope but you can work for our focus for one hour at a time you put that clock in front of you and you work that audience every single moment of that our\nAnd that's how you maximize trade show experience at a trade show we've done a few of those absolute\nTens of thousands of hours with him so that's how you do it and you want to get big money
