in and we'll talk about your life and\nYour money Amanda starts off this hour in Los Angeles Hi Amanda how are you\nThere I'm I'm doing really well on your cell\nAnd better than I deserve what's up\nSo my question is ah my parents died when he didn't know that and I said why don't just look for that\nIf a ... who is the student loan debt on and did you sign for it\nUm my mother and my mother's I actually don't know how much it is\nOkay so she borrowed money to go to school and she signed for it you didn't sign for it you weren't the student\nOkay is that what you're saying is that what you're saying\nOkay if that's the case you are not liable for it now when a ... ... when she dies if she has that that that will be paid by the sale of the items that she owns before airs receive anything\nShow when you die what you own is sold to pay off your debt and if there's anything left\nThat's distributed to the air's\n\nBut you are not let let's say she dies penniless and she has three hundred thousand dollars a student loan debt the student loan debt people getting\nNothing no one will pay them\nNo one is liable to pay them\nBut if she has a three hundred thousand dollar paid for house it would be sold and we would pay off the student loan debt before you guys got anything in that example if there was a three hundred thousand learnt that throughout all of our house they would you would get nothing they would get paid\nOkay ... so I'm refinanced our parents um I'm\nTrying to get into the chat for houses\nAnd I'm On top of it you didn't learn that\nYou know sort of your your basically saying she's doing stupid on parade\nYeah my father and I'm kind of given up trying to see\nI'm kind of given up trying to teach and he can get kind of keeping their eye Nancy ... from what I understand yeah my parents at home and not getting him back together you know\nThat's a lot of bad news for all of those folks but it won't affect you okay unless you choose to write checks into this madness which I Would not do\nNow I'm attempting to get my affairs in order at that it's possible I plan on 'em I plan I like hiring a millionaire so I didn't\nTime I mean I I'm right by her sad how and how they I had a full term policy on hand when he was younger he why here and then they take that over and make the\nPayments um I don't know why that is a pound leader for ... I'm not exactly sure what to think that there is not the beneficiary combat it or how to handle it\nMhm okay so he took the shot when your husband was a trial yeah\nThis is not a term policy it's a whole life life insurance policy\nAnd at ... ... a million dollars\nWow it should be canceled okay\nBecause her whole life insurance policy about ... million dollars is a very expensive\nRight here they are and like my parents you know I found out the beneficiary and I don't I mean he's a great guy so I'm not worried about you know that it's\nOut on my own career as a guy doesn't matter if we had a good guy that's it's it's really weird that it's continued to have the parents are the beneficiary and this is a grown man with family of four with four kids\nYeah there is a very like going down on you know a wild one\nBut it's strange ... long you been married for a long you been married five years you know and then five years they've not address this issue\nThat's strange yeah that's correct yeah really I mean they should you should address the issue and\nThey should not be the beneficiaries anymore you should be and really the policy ought to just be canceled\nBecause I Would I Would not want to pick up the ... I Would not want to pick up the premiums on the half a million dollar policy all this is a whole lot of policy because it's twenty times more expensive than term to create an investment inside of it called the cash value that has a port right of return that when you die they keep your money\nSo our whole life insurance is a horrible financial product\n\nAnd so if you just called me up and you just owned by half a million dollars of whole life I Would say cancel it as soon as you've got your term in ...\nBut you're not paying for it today anyway so today you get your term insurance in places proper on you and on your husband and I I think your husband should have a discussion with his dad and say that\nI'm I'm going to go ahead and suggest you drop that policy now I Will not be taking it over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you ought to drop it\nRight yeah that's like I don't want to be paying for something you know and then it cuts but you have fallen time\nIt's not only do I need it because we're not going to take it over and that was the original plan plan has now changed\nYep 'cause he's\nMade a decision as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve how are you\nDavid how are you today better than I deserve what's up\nYeah I have a question uh regarding up part of my retirement savings shirt comes as a thing called a penchant for my company and that overall is a bad guy eight percent of my total as ... or\n... or ...\nWell it's I mean a person it's projected to be a at a project that retirement they are two hundred and eighty four thousand dollars and that is that would be about eight percent of my total as heck you know and and\nThe question is whether the cat hair a lump sum yes or okay\nHere's why okay if you die or not if you die when you die [laughter] 'cause we're all gonna die okay when you die a that money's gone\n'cause it's a pinch and you get your ... and you if you have a survivor benefit or something there it might it might go to your spouse for a while but when your spouse you and your spouse die even if there's a survivor benefits the money's gone it's gone\nAnd if you live I or as long as you live it's going to pay at a rate of about five\nPercent in this current market so it's as if you had an account and the investment advisor said Okay Steve we got an account for you over here two hundred Ninety five thousand you can invest it you make five percent on your money and when you die the money's gone\nOr you could think that two hundred and eighty five thousand you can roll it into some mutual funds in a good IRA roll over and\nAnd I got two hundred and eighty five thousand you can roll into mutual funds in a good\nIRA roll over and mutual funds will perform better than five percent and when you die the money stays with your family well that'd be a better deal\nYeah [laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah versus a hundred percent joint and survivor annuity but ... so\nIt's still love you die then yeah you got survivorship on it but when both of you do the same concept applies so the bottom line is it's got a decent but low rate of return while you live but the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you die\nMakes this a bad deal and so you\nAlways take pension lumps on are almost always take Benjamin lumps arms enroll them to IRAs and invest them and good roast duck mutual fund so it sounds like your net worth ... million\nAh yeah it's a close to too close to ... and that probably about four oh well they're total total man where the assets house it's hopeless\nNo ... congratulations how old are you I'm sixty three way to go\nHow much of this did you inherit\n[noise] um probably somewhere in a hurry to four hundred range from both my ah my family and my wife came home\nWhere are you a millionaire or that was before that happened\nA\nMillionaire or my wife's mother passed away yes uh when my mom my my parents type relatively young point in time not a millionaire no\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar net worth because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\nA holding pattern or because of the amount of heritage is ... maybe ... maybe ... percent\nIt's home lowest irrelevant yeah OK cool yes I'm I'm always researching and asking millionaires how they did it for the benefit of our listeners because I got a twenty four year old listening right now that's got the opportunity of hearing from an actual sixty four year old person who actually has a four million dollar net worth what would you tell about twenty four year old how how should they be you when they grow up\n[laughter] [noise]\nWell I certainly you got to a live well below your means when they are a modest lifestyle which we have done\nAnd I think also too I I I Know when I was new people do stupid things I've done the stupid things so I think if you can limit\nTo thing that that should do along the way that's good I like that [laughter]\nBecause because every every everybody listening right now is has done or will do stupid\nThings but then you can minimize those new things along the way\nAnd we have a modest lifestyle will blow your means um yeah void\nSo do you think there'll be done and that twenty four year old still have a four million dollar net worth forty years from now if you're listening to me right now\nBut he is probably\nA probably even higher if they if they minimize so stupid it maybe I get minimize or as much along the way yes\nVery well done well congratulations sir man you've done very very well [noise] so yeah I Would roll your pension into an IRA and that way it survives you and the ... all the math on that works to your benefit a at a Wal alive if you put it in mutual funds and upon death\nFor sure you come out three hundred grand ahead\nSo the question about it a thank you for joining us and thanks for

to run through your six thousand dollars a duck double every year then that's five hundred bucks a month if it's three thousand dollars a year this is going to cost me out of pocket that's two hundred and fifty a month and I just put a you know\nA whatever a line in your budget for medical expense all new Enron ec medical when just call your call chronic or whatever just give it a name and the money set aside for that so that every 'cause it's kind of like we know it's going to come up\nAnd leave a little while now someday hopefully you'll find a cure and you know it's not a lifetime of this or something not yeah but for now for now you're saying it's predictable\nOr that you're going to have issues we just don't know how severe or expensive they are going to be up into your future and so so much for the next so many months we need to just be budgeting is if we think we're going to spend X per year divided by twelve in your monthly budget\nI mean my issue is is that I'm literally on like penny pinching\nI don't like seeing where I can make that happen so what I've been hearing is I mean I decided starting next month I'm going to kick out fifty dollars that you really like it here right now on what I I'm I'm hoping overtime on the opposite you know take out more\nSo why are we any danger memory that an income problem a debt problem or a spending problem\nWhere I got minded that problem [laughter] I'm I'm sixty thousand on that\nI make I don't think a lot on the lights and social worker and because of my condition actually switch that job I had more ...\nOn Sunday the fee for service division as opposed to salary position mhm and I make anywhere from Thirteen hundred Fifteen hundred ... a paycheck on\nAnd you get ... you back twice a month okay and you said you're living with them\nI guess I'm I'm living with a roommate I pay nine Seventy five or rent it give us a lot um and I do that somehow from ...\nTo them and what is the nature of the debt it's been one\nThat is everything credit card also because they catch it I was trying lot of holistic things on medical and then it's student loan most of it is like a ... a thousand that fabric a total of sixty thousand\nOkay show for the short term we're going to make sure you take care of the most important things and that's food\nPantry not eating not eating outside and you're paying more than half\nYour life your lights and water and your rent and your transportation so food children's clothing and transportation and utilities the eighth grade we used to call that a civics lesson what's in the city in the city is only the debt you've got is not necessities\nYou take care of the debt only after you've taken care of the necessities in the new work is about end of the dead as you can\nAnd here's the thing you're either going to repair for these medical expenses or they're going to be new debt\nRight because they are coming you told me that that's why you're called yeah yeah yeah\nMean it's not me declaring it I'm saying right actually I've I've got an ongoing medical how do I prepare for it you save in coverage so now that's our short term long term okay we gotta get your income up and you're out go down and knock this debt out long term\nWe got to get your income up and you're out go down and knock this debt out long term but that has to do with your medical condition and has to do with your career and has to do with a lot of different things that you've got to face\nAnd so um but that's how I Would you begin to look at a gift take care of the short term make sure you're taking care of you so that you\nCan you know be\nPrepared to take on the long term which is get your income up but uh we got to get past some of the medical stuff and you got to really start looking at this career really hard chop up those credit cards is Trump or plastic surgery Tucker is with us in Atlanta Georgia Hi Tucker how are you\nOn ... how are you better than I deserve what's up\nWell me and my wife I'm going through baby step here right now I'm In fact we gets paid off our second credit card today though we are dollar credit card and moved on the line\nThat is good news um [noise] but um so we're walking through that too and we're looking at our budget and yesterday and um after church we had a big argument about hiding I don't know what we want to ... percent and um I ... that\nWe were not in a position to give right now we're trying to pay all that we can get later\nOn but what I'm saying what economists model that I'm kind of a ... law and get your input on here\nWe have our ten percent but it but we want to live without thinking about putting data and given back to the church and then having that extra five percent and kind of giving it to um other\nCharitable organizations that we believe in that are arguing day the ... you know when the crisis mission and so we're trying to do what we can try to do what we can to people who need it\nUm but if she don't have an aunt straight and pretend a church and then you are or what we don't what we can't give you know we're not of media and she wants to give it to church and\nWe had a big argument about high then yesterday I was\nOut on you know the the definition of dies the definition of the time is when you look it up in the Hebrew it's an Old Testament term and Jesus reaffirmed given the New Testament is chance it literally means chant the word means tamp\nIt doesn't mean steal that doesn't mean twentieth it means to him\nNow you can decide whether you want to tie the knot you get to decide that um but if we're going to walk with Christ and we want to and we I'm an evangelical Christian which means I look for what the scripture tells me to do\nI'm doing my best to follow what the word of God says his or what they rammed his opinion is doesn't matter what Tucker plan is er Tucker's opinion is doesn't matter\nI'm looking for what God says to do in his love letter to me and he says Tucker and Dave I'm I'm you're my kid I'm Crazy about you I Love you and um you can give are not given all still love\nYour best way to live your life is to to gifts\nAnd all throughout the Old Testament and Jesus reaffirmed as in the New Testament is a time of year in some evangelicals have taught and believe for Fifteen hundred years that that private is your baseline minimum giving and it comes off the top before you do anything else and it goes to your local church [noise]\nSo if you want to biblical answer\nYour wife when's the argument [noise] that's the biblical not your wife was argument but she was correct to biblical [laughter]\nActually both are probably true [laughter]\nGood luck with that rather [noise]\nIn order to be a successful business owner you have to be prepared for change as

... a year\nWhere did you use to mildly old job\nThat that's what I was making before a yes before okay um what do you make now what now I'm In real estate I'm actually I got my license in March in June ... Utah was my first day in real estate mhm I've got to choose a health is so thick listings and extending clothing\nMhm I've got to choose\nA house is so thick listings and ending clothing bought into uh the second week of November So\nWhat is your projected income for the uh the that's six month period of time\nI'm I'm thinking maybe like twenty five thousand\nBy the end of the year and now what does your why didn't make of the one who makes\nFifty a she made a fifty one dollar\nOkay so basically it sounds like in real estate you're going to make as much as you used to make\nYes okay good news right\nI guess right now what she's worried about is that she's bringing in most of the income because of course it's slow when you first start out I'm only selling to houses that between that long span 'em and everything is she wants to keep her car because she thinks she's making money to pay her car [noise]\n'cause that's not how it works when we're married that's how it works when your roommates you get to do whatever you want when your roommates but when you're married it's for richer for four and sickness\nAnd health and onto the all my worldly goods I pledge is what the old marriage vows said\nAnd so it you know if you want to be divorced you get to keep whatever you want to Cape but if you want to be married we are doing this together\nIn other words if she gets cancer you don't look at her and go oh you just give them hell that cancer thing there by yourself and those trips that came out you get to do that by yourself you're not going to do that to her right no no you would take care of her because we are now one\nWhen we were married in ... in the Senate health and right now the house a sick and so we don't get to be a princess somebody selfish and that's not an option sorry\nYes and and um that's what I was trying to explain to her that we need my my truck is for sale already I have it on the market good home that's in it as soon as I Do some of these cold in the courts will have\nIf I can get what I was asking for what you what would I oh I'm going to pay the difference to get rid of it completely good um what is clothing and that's what I was trying to tell her to as I'll get a car cash and then she tells her car and they have at least one car right now [noise]\nMm well I don't know I ... I don't agree with that I Would get her a car and I'm not sure we're going to move down and out of her car if you can make fifty five thousand if you can get these closings and everything you've gotten the pipeline it sounds like you're pipelines pretty good\nIt's just it's been tough from the lay off in other firing until now but here's the money that you've got piled up the business that you have coming\nShould create the income they used to have if I heard you correctly\nYes and and like I told her like she's she's worried that it's not coming in fast enough and I told her there ending for clothing by then the second week of November everything should be closed do six\nMonths just to you guys you three weeks from now here I mean so three weeks from now all this goes away so here's what I Would do I would not sell her car today I Would show your trial today\nAnd I but I Would I Would say I would tear this this this ridiculous philosophy that she has all the ...\nI'm not putting up with that crap okay this idea that when I make money I can keep ... that's your if your roommates that's just BS okay I'm not going with that\nSo uh but but but the idea that I think she should keep her car and I think the two of you and I think you're going to be making enough money that then the two of you could work through\nA budget that has not a hundred and five thousand dollars worth about making about a little over a hundred but instead it has about Seventy five thousand dollars of debt making a little over a hundred if both of you are willing to roll up your sleeves and\nPay off thirty seven thousand dollars worth of debt a year for two years we can keep her car but if you're not willing to do that as a household then you don't have a financial trouble your marriage trouble than\nShe is not willing to join armed with you and fight and outside enemy that has come at your house and instead she goes to her corner with her toys you ever marriage problem\nOkay but hopefully you guys can get on the same page when you back all for her car a little bit\nYou run around started selling mama's cars not weigh a good way get mom on board halo so let's try that other approaches I think it's reasonable financially to keep her car if your income goes right looks like your income is going to go\nThen you might be looking at a different career and she's
