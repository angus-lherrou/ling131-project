Spanish Ramsey your host thank you for joining U.S Open phones a\nAAA eight to five five two to five that's AAA eight to five five to two fine thank you for being here Barrett is with us from Gainesville, Florida shirt off this hour\nHi Barrett how are you I'm good how are you better than I deserve what's up\nHey thanks for taking my call me and the wife or twenty five and twenty seven when we moved from San Antonio Texas again look like a kind of law school here\nUm and I'm getting up by the whole right scholarship we have zero that um we currently have fifty thousand in the bank about forty five thousand and retirement a minute we're taking Fifteen Percent of the white income and putting it into retirement but after we do all that\nUm we're kind of have about like the euro not quite there but very little for us to have fun with and I was wondering how much should we be allocating to enjoying our time years until I got to be or to or [noise]\nUm three years is it okay to eat and are saving a little bit or should we be living like or college students\nIt's up to you I mean what are your goals and where do you want to be you're kind of writing to horses at once I mean her careers up and going and obviously she's making some money or what is her income\nUm she's making about fifty five okay\nObviously that's carrying the water for you guys right now and so you are and you can take two approaches to what you can say do what you're doing right now and live like you know Fifteen Percent going into retirement and that is heating up money that would be used for fun um or or you can just say\nBeating up money that would be used for fun um or or you can just say you know\nWe're in a a transition time while I'm In law school and so were you know we're really not walking the baby steps right now we're just going to be on hold\nAnd her income is going to use to make sure I get through law school and make sure you know that we enjoy this time here in Florida and and when I come out then we'll be with both incomes will be game on when you can take it either way or you could take anywhere in between if you want um\nYou know obviously the more you live like no one else the more later you live and give like no one else obviously a by right and and so those are ... there's the choices you do um the the point I think the good I did the good part of this discussion is you're actually thinking about it and whatever you do at least you're going to do it on purpose\nThe the danger of backing that retirement off substantially and a ... is that you might not ever go back to this\n... you know you gotta really commit to if we do that\nSo that we can quote unquote have fun while we're here or enjoy our time in Florida or whatever the phrase was if you do that you have to really almost right yourself a letter and both of you sign it and blood that says in two years it's game on them you know when you come out of law school pass the bar\nSettling in the new location okay now Fifteen Percent or walk in these baby steps and we're going to do this right I mean if you're going to do it you have to commit to really going back to it that's the danger of walking away from it is it may\nIt may come back you know you might not ever get back in the groove again that that's the scary part\nYou know they're joining the academy they're posting and they closed academy group saying I'm doing it scared I'm going for it a couple of women have already been exploring the training videos and saying things like I already got my money's worth an up and it today so it's just incredible it's been a lot of fun a lot of energy and ah and you have to work but it's so tonight eight PM\nCauses so we got a few hours as their last chance to get in\nBefore we causing them on a ship my focus and work on coaching them and walking with them and training them step by step so billions on what you could go to me what is what we're talking about so isn't Missouri includes sure this is my online training group so for women but for women in business I Want a shorter but that's right and I keep getting asked the question was this for filling the blank business I'm a freelancer I have an empty shop I'm a\nProfessional organizer or an architect or I have a dental practice or whatever\nYou're all in business and that's what we do we help you build your business so some women may want to start their business and we have a foundation of course in the academy that showed them how to start\nAnd then all the other training videos we have a over a hundred training video ah teach them how to grow their business on a variety of topics and then every single week rolling out a new training lesson and I'm In their coaching them step by step\nAnswering the questions holding their hand showing them what to do next and it's been really really fun to see the success stories of women that have been in the academy for the last year and a half since we started a winter saying things like you know I've grown a three times as much my business to the year before one woman said I'm a twenty thousand dollars more this year than a year before the academy\nSo just seeing the growth one woman her husband quit it full time job to go work for her\nAnd so these women are surprising even themselves but that's what happens when you get to help you need that that helps happens when you have ... when you have a trainer right by your side so it's been fun to watch ...\n... actually learn something new right you're going to have a coach and you need a community yup you people are under to encourage you and Dr you what to do and\nA true you own any cheerleaders because I got ya ya when you try to do something different ah there's always some cow ... wrote chewing looking at you\nLike like you know what you've lost your mind when you start a business there's always somebody who\nSecretly wishes they could ... down what's right and so you need cheerleaders remain and people you know shown up and jumping up and down and go and you got this you can do this she's right yes it's scary us we don't know what to do all the time we do it any way\nOf doing it for Thirty years and uh you got to put yourself out of that comfort zone and bust up and do that and your knowledge and community or the two things are called your body will do the\nThe life changed the transformation that you've got to do\nThat is right and it's interesting because you also you have those outside people like you were talking about that may not get it and they may not believe in your dream but you also have the fear in your own head that can be really loud and that ... that ... that's right I had a woman a write in just this week Emily that joined the academy and she said\nI have always dreaded business I don't have a business mind I don't have a business background the mere thought of running a business seem overwhelming but I had this dream that I wanted to do something and she said just two days now and the academy I've been watching these training lessons\nAnd you have me laughing and nodding along I never thought I Would actually look forward to learning business you take all the intimidation out of it and make it fun and what a great compliment 'cause at the heart David to take the intimidation factor out of business and show women you can do this you absolutely can do this you just need when anyone needs you just need help and that's why we're here that's all we had the academy\nYou know the interesting thing is is that sometimes when people were standing on the sidelines looking at the idea of opening a business or even if they're running their own business or you know and they're in the beginning stages or the or they're stuck at a place where they just need extra boost their niche knowledge they didn't have to go to a different level in ...\nStuck at a place where they they just need extra boost they need some knowledge they didn't have to go to a different level in any of those situations the interesting thing is is that people\nTend to think that business people have some kind of special DNA drain right or or like you have to be like this math nerd or you have to have the entrepreneur dream or you have to dress a certain way or think of survey or whatever and the interesting thing is successful businesses are run by\nEvery type of person on the planet there every version of wild animal runs [laughter] I mean it's it's amazing\nWell I use that example with selling because I think people have that myth about selling like I'm not sales person I don't want to be pushy and so on like a sales person at a certain type of DNA it's an extrovert it's a social butterfly someone that's a talker I use my example my husband all the time he's an introvert he's quiet he's steady\nBut he got me to marry him because the sale right are are seven and a half months and he was confident it can be a and so it's just you know selling or running a business is like anything in life it's a skill that you can learn like cooking or riding a bike and\nAnd that's all we built the academy with all of the training lessons that you need to learn the foundations to build your business to grow to the next level and then we have that customize coaching and say oh you've got a weird situation money help you walk through that situation and really the best products and services you can put out there is a response to the market and what they tell you they want\nAnd for two years people said I Need a coach I Need a mentor I Need help\nAnd this is our solution saying we're gonna help you were gonna walk with you and we've already seen the success stories of women absolutely\nExceeding their own expectations making far more than they imagine they could and so it's proven now it was an idea two years ago but it's proven now and it's working and I and I'm really excited for this new class of member of funding in hundreds of joined us meant Oh absolutely that's right and we're close in age tonight we've got a kickoff party at eight\nSo I don't want people to metrics once it causes it's caused till next year and we're kicking off tonight or start first thing Monday morning on our next curriculum so I'm really excited to have them walk with me and be able to help them when\nChristie

you get your all I back some ladies are saying they get back in a couple of days so it's absolutely worth the money to invest in yourself and your dream for a full year of training but you got to eat tonight to get him\n... ... ... we mentioned that the community is a is a big part of this and so what I've found is is that um I might not know the answer and I'm pretty good business to someone's question right here on the air but if I put them in one of those communities there's probably somebody in there that notice yeah sure\nThat's right and they're connect because women are so relational\nThey're already connecting just this week seeing the connection is being made hey who's in Florida I'm In Orlando let's get coffee hey here's an interior design I'm an interior design hey let's get together and talk about best practices Haiti how do you ah source you know your for your vendors for your product\nThey're already connecting that allows her to be a compound affects the
