not arrive the ... are now here's one of the challenges for McDonald's\nBy now they would be Don warming up they were warming up as well as per usual but are now you don't want to run the risk of overdoing it right right yeah I mean\nThat's what I always tell the kids do get a get a good little sweat gone and you know so you got a little sweat on your body heats up a little bit when the game starts you're you're ready to go your body is ready to take some yet you don't you're not cold in the muscles are stretched out and you're on the kids when they're running around for quite a while at some point you just gotta\nEither either take 'em in somewhere or get them out of the cold but\nThe problem that eventually when my daughter does come right you're going to have to start over extended that energy you can't get it back\nOr you're not going to be as warm or fresh and and then they will be because we're going to defer to them because they're traveling along this house in the late

I think a\nParent will do our best and so that is a story for now from camera and again I I Hope maybe even during this update that maybe with the mountain view a show again one of the rumors here at

fourth down so now I'm Out in our view of picking up they've had a couple of different quarterbacks and this is going to be the young eighth grader again he's going to have a long pass weight outfield an incomplete intended that time for a number of Nineteen ah Aden Bissonnette but again ... sort of in disbelief\nBut again I guess if you got to see her quarterback in the fat out why not give her eighth grader know somebody that they're eyeing for the next four years because those are the only two with quarterback on the roster\nYeah and he's got an arm that he does throw the ball that one should have been caught the it looked like the number Nineteen there goes for trying to one hand that\nYeah and now again do back is going to dump one off and all that but that math not able to

actually their official first down I mean they've had other long touchdowns remember early on the sixty nine year round and now comes this way and he used it across to a teammate announced I think it's a actually both out of the better the fifty or forty five ... farm the McDonalds the fender ths alec her and it gets down to about the forty forty odd life\nTo meet with me directly and you were

there's a line [laughter]\nAll right so forth and Thirteen McDonald's on their own twenty six one plan to the second quarter get no running clock I just remember running clock is thirty five point a greater lead in the second half\nFourth and searching the snap and trying to boot it is our style and he does its gonna adjust it into the territory it takes a McDonald's or all the way inside the forty to thirty nine where it will\nBe down [noise] downed out there about a Twenty one Trevor rent down so\nFirst in Cannes for again to this\nOne can imagine the score could continue to grow in undesirable weighs let's wait and see here how their Donald defense can step up again\nDown a number of players and\nThings people are going to ask you mark is a marvel only\nIs the idea of numbers I mean obviously anybody goes to eight or nine man football 'cause he's like at McDonalds you don't have as many numbers so like well what if we could play football what's your guys but if all of a sudden you start getting a lot of people turn out you might be tempted like it looks like here they've got I don't know twenty five or so players and seems like\nThere's there's a hand off up the middle a good job either ... as a a sort of back so I think that's that's there's kind of a tension there that's that's a little bit and wonder if you could speak\nTo that yeah I I again I mean Wisconsin has the eight mayor lost when I think there's some some rules there as far as your living room with of your school I think they're looking at you know if you're over two hundred and you're in room with that I don't think I mean obviously you can't have like three hundred fifty of Rome at school going with an eight man\nYeah football the okay you got to have the numbers there to have the Colorado for football okay um so I I think in Roman plays into the factor and then just getting the the kids all for football\nWhen things we were talking they already have a eighth grade quarterback in the game so I'm not sure how much younger they can go in that position and there was a hand off going off the right side and a step farming is way down the field is Sam locking\nSo knock it as an eighth grade running so they've gotten with rocket now to eighth grade running back in eighth grade quarterbacks but these guys are pretty big and strong for eighth graders yes it's an eleven year old game for them\nYou know and then the you know the ... bill coaches nice job they they realize that you know McDonalds or a little ... match tearing these these given his young kids from some chances to play\nRight and so there is the first time that's the fourth of the afternoon for\nThe raiders as they move it left or right from the pistol and then the quick hand off from work and a good job either max defense wrapping up that time for the last number one a hunter why go and it looks like the attack over say eighty five chase birds they also sophomore\nPlay nice job there again is that this was some you know Jim kids getting some experience their fire me like we talked earlier mark I think a merchandiser was the only senior are out there playing for McDonald's or in and he's not playing defense so the U.S all young guys out there playing\nVery much so yeah but now they're playing against maybe they've got a young guy them and sophomores or you know anywhere from eighth grade to sophomore\nAnd now scrambling around Xerox is going to fire on down the field and oh almost completed and no flags thrown so the incomplete pass\nTrauma room on the defense there\nAt his job anymore [noise]\nI don't know who is a crusader still in a quarterback I Believe\nYeah Zurich has stayed out there with the pet I did have the early right and I believe ... unless we could have been wrong actually now that I think of it but uh because I think I was just this belief that we were like really an eighth grader when ripped off a sixty nine around but we haven't seen him running right that there is a hand up around the hip\nHop\nThanks to the way that the two yards red touched down there are some\nGood block it on the outside edge here that's wrong him when the young men had some
