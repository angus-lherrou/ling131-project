I like his perseverance he's always persevering with his invention would I think that's a good thing to typical inventor right always persevere and try to make good and it was a poster pro\nOn the go ... coaster pro um the goal is a coaster for your ... drinks in your car to prevent all the moisture from you know because it ... the sweat in the car especially in the hot weather in the summer it'll

listen to regularly invention right yeah it's like a light light blue light and we'll ... we'll talk to the to reduce about that a little bit on the shell but yes they were basically you know and cures with light\nSo when he wants to see but the glue on a plastic or metal or whatever yeah glue and getting anything would leather went out and then when you ... what kind of like a like a UV light hello inside of a low violent light or one of his alter violent but\nYou don't really that cures to go faster so here's the grave and that kind of like my dentist plenty of filling in\nExactly yeah yeah that's what we're we're playing around with it yesterday oh you got rid of all different kinds of ways you're glued together what does that what is that plastic Iraq what does that like at ... ... what is that like an ancient bones hospitals what would have waited willing to the editor of T rex held that\nOh my goodness gracious are bruised dose of the guys are glue and they got a video going\nFell off a part of al fell off of it what is that it's a dollar bonus okay\nBack together okay All right so you got the horse ... those are two different ports material rocket literally buildings are falling apart and follow his body together I worked as a Catholic school so it's a little different than you can see that but what are you guys doing like rock\nAnd bone together so all kinds of ... all kinds of surface as you can sort of glued together so last rocket plump piece of plastic break your comedy club you bring your brain can be applied to something\nOr something breaks

product your whole white locked glue the jury welcome to the show\n[noise] [noise]\nSo what what's the premise of this rocket ship ... what's the deal here\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] and [noise] kind of like a [noise] okay that's kind of like a fan [noise] Iraq [noise] you're right here at all [laughter]\nSo so are you there Geri okay one of the things that I mean we pitched a lot of things I mean I think I've I've sold a billion dollars pitching and I think John sold them\nTwo or three over or something that we're more than me so when I when I noticed about your pitch when you're in to a one minute pitched okay when you're into a sort of defined put you on TV we have very defined timelines because our time runs out then we're you know it's not like an elevator will have to folks ability we have are starting to stop point and they cut us off\nUm what I Want to do is I felt that you had more of a I think you had what I call a brochure pitch do have a brochure pitch goes as you were doing a lot of the features and benefits I heard about acrylic and ... and different sort of you sent me an sort of features and benefits\nAnd it kind of a list it's kind of what drives me crazy on television is one of the hosts grabs their card if you've ever watch like shopping they grab a card and they start reading off the car because they're selling a steamy where to go\nIt takes a car oil great subsidiary scanning man sitting right here what are you doing you know why they just really Africa so I tell you had a little bit of an elevator pitch and what I'd like to do in my pitches okay\nThis business\nFor anybody who has a product I always want you to start off with the problem okay so and I always have these words that I always use when I started ... go to Google me almost all my pictures started like this\nHere's the problem and then I set up the problem the problem is that glued to drive fast enough and spills over here and I know you're a good specialist so I'm sure you can come up with all kinds of problems with normal going systems right\nSo you set up the problem and then we I Want you to do is here's this solution\nThe you know they'll do white block glue rockets speed put it on to stop in Boone solid base and then go to that then that's the solution to the ... you got a little technical form of you've got a little you got into the start talking about how the clock was working and really all I wanted to know is what time it is right so\nSo I Want you to set up the problem and then to the solution and then get to the CPA now what is GPA is is a call to action\nEvery pitch has a call to action if you're on a date if you're if you're selling a client if you're on us everything ends with a cold out and you ask for something\nYou're looking for something you want to close the deal call to action I never heard for example of how much money as costs to buy I never heard where I could go and buy it you know so so let me ask that question how much of this stuff [noise]\n\nOkay so so um so I was probably the rain just because you have different sizes [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] okay [noise] so\nTen bucks All right ten bucks so and you have do you have a website you can go by that\nI find so\nLight lock dot U. S. sorry Johnny go out among the website let's see\nThe light lock dot com not available\n[noise] it wasn't\nThe only we're always trying to look for you know the the the top ... what a what a top level domains a U.S I mean granted if ... if you're markets only in the U.S maybe for my work and who who owns light log dot com\n[noise]\nAll right so here's here's here's a technique that we would use so there's some other doesn't so I always tell people there's the pitch you always hear is tell us problems to loosen the T A N K problems to ... that's kind of the format on among the pitch the second thing I always teach people you should always\nBe prepared to do your company right we do all this nonsense because we want to make you know we want to cash in on the invention of cash in on the product\nAnd I find that when you're trying to sell a company the websites important really important [laughter] so I think I think you need the dot com website and another or if you watch a lot of these guys on TV you'll notice that when they can't get the website 'cause they you know I was I was watching a car preparing ethic\nI was watching ... watching ... and the ... so what these guys do they say by corporate and get ... get like block by block dark up [laughter]\nI ... and get ... get like lock by like lock dark up\nI think you should send them to a landing page on the dot com ... us because otherwise if you get you let's say you get successful at this and you're probably going to get successful does it really awesome product\nYou know I think what will happen is that white block is going to skim off some of your business in the future you have that with and it's just a few teachers tutors for your company are not going to want to take that risk I think John is now up to the ... locked\nOut you also know actually it'll actually I'm buying like log dot com is available by like locked up ... light law get talked\nA little advice for you on the on the ... they just know so when you sell them to stores you hire someone to electronic stores right\nHere on your website so where else do you sell them\nRight now we're hearing area is so\nTrue value in a those are those are good clients to evaluate ... hardware stores is actually my favorite hardware store to shop at\nBecause uh you know you got I got one in ... in the neighborhood they're really knowledgeable people or the illness stores in ... but typically dogs and cats running around the store to I just loved entrepreneurs like that so fast well how many units do these cell a hundred thousand units that\n[noise] thousand\nTwo thousand okay so what's your goal was to go [noise]\nAn hour [noise]\nSo how do you feel about this company is seen as part of the type of probably not yours but I've seen this type of product on infomercials stuff how do you feel about those other products that are out\nThere [noise] [noise] right [noise] travel around ... currently [noise] one corner on heroin or why\nI say here so that's why I kind of out of pocket [laughter] [noise] [noise] what is the twenty four hours from here\nWell that's a great point that's a really good point because I didn't even consider that so you know if the UV light can hit the surface those other products can can cure the glue where you have a dual function you have the lake curing system in was time middle also ... I guess that I read that directly\nArea\nA shadow shadow care I liked I liked that so I Would have by ten thousand units from you what would you sell them to me for [laughter] thank you for that that is okay let's do the other way if I buy ten thousand\nUnits from you to have them as a chance to buy hundreds of thousands of unit and I you know I Need a profit margin to support that marketing campaign to maybe I go on live TV [noise] maybe I Do an infomercial or commercial what would be like if I were to do a master distribution agreement with you uh what would that be costly per unit

it's picked up that a human has answered and they're transferring it to an agent that's ready to take the phone call I thought there were laws against all this\nWhen I remember a year you know years ago they they they were going after every telemarketer no demand robo calling\nIs illegal in most states three how many robo calls do you get a day\nI Would guarantee you know just by the book by that by boy they example you just gave that it's happening a lot sure I'll I'll see a lower I won't answer I'll just sit there and wait and wait and they hang up\nIf you sit there and don't say anything it doesn't know that it's a live person so it won't put a person on the phone so so\nSomebody watching us on the show today in their state has probably illegal to do\nBut we'll go most states any as illegal or not all states but you know where most robocalls originate his overseas what do you do about that really so\nBus ride every once in a while I get one of those calls from them by and it sounds like somebody's trying to talk to me but it it was about two thousand people yeah hello this is Bob\nBob how and why is your family back there why don't want your cows Louis in the background it just it it happens that way I mean you got that going crazy back some got a few of the way did actually they hurt me I've actually had caused our our business climate here only\nI Know you're not you know you're in Texas right on I can tell I'm In Tampa or your rent somewhere I mean that's about a bottom among two thousand people behind you in a closet all answering phones and you could hear

there are literally millions of complaints coming in a year now in fact just in the month of January there was over a couple of hundred thousand complaints that came in and it's okay to the FTC related to some of these things\nBut you know one of the things that I came across when I was researching the story\nIs the worst thing that you can do is waste the telemarketing system time\nOkay do you have a way to waste their time that the money back where they're making their money really so there's a gentleman uh it has a company that's called the jolly Roger telephone company has jolly Roger because he's the pirates of the telephone world\nOkay so you know I'm going to bite on as to what is the jolly Roger ... company do so you'll love this as a\nMatter of fact on top technology tips on Facebook website I got a link to this guys\nTend to talk it is hilarious but what he does his best All right he says\nIf I've got robo callers calling me and then they put a live person on the phone I'm going to take a bought an automated system okay and I'm going to let that automated systems have the whole phone call\nI'm not going to have the phone call and I just hit the button and it goes to the bottom that you know what the ... the ... just what you would have imagined it at first thing it says\nHello hello hello\nHello are you there oh wait wait I just feel copy on me hold on\nHe he goes on he's developed scripts to do this do arise and then ran out of the random they just come up with a grand random scraps he's\nHad telemarketers on the phone for over twelve minutes the hot spots now after they figure out a lot\nThey don't want this call and their system they don't want to call it again because\nYou're caught between these these like robocalls these telemarketing calls they're they're they charge by the minute\nThey're charge by the minute so when you got to do things to get this now if you get you get an operator or you have somebody just manning that call is on they're wasting time and it's called time away you're not getting into what they wanted you to get you to be able to build so you whatever [laughter]\nI Love this idea so I only Roger ... telephone company I met the guy uh he actually got charges for the services like two dollars a month or six dollars a year but\nAll of a sudden you stop getting a lot of you know a marketing ploy yet because your costs them money but wait a minute so is it do you have to have like a a line so I'm going to be able to uh he has just like all these other programs we've talked about different set up options that you could use\nGoogle Voice or where the transfers automatically to Google Voice transfer the call because on a business line when you've got those coming in and they ask for the owner of the company or something that if you transfer it\nTo the jolly Roger telephone companies system and lo and behold you've got a pot talking going to get that on my regular phone though Oh absolutely you get it on your cell phone your hand\nAnd it's not an app\nPer se but again I've got it up on my website we've got a a graphic there if you go to jolly Roger telephone company I\nI'm not endorsing a I
