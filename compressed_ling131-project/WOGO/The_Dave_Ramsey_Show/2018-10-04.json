going to be Jay in San Diego Hi Jay welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nMore than they are\nBetter than I deserve what's up in your world\n[noise] uh so recently this week uh found out that ah my wife had kinda racked up about forty can a credit card debt behind the scenes a of a kind of slap to the face you know kind of found out this week but this last weekend\nSo pretty pretty tough to swallow\nMm [noise] so she was hiding it from you\nI'm ... and I you know I Can't just blame her I mean I I got to take some credit because I never kind of went and look I'm kind of a\nPaid any attention and this is the second time so about two and a half years ago kind of the same thing and I kind of laid out a budget and then kind of slipped away from that budget and I think it was it just kind of roll back into it I filmed everything was going okay but it just kind of wasn't\nOkay so you gave her a all of the responsibility of handling the money and you weren't involved in the money\nA hundred percent okay yeah yeah it is your fault you know yeah um\nAnd it's her fault or but basically she was out of control didn't know what to do and uh just borrowed her way into a mess and\nNeither one of your head your head and the game correct okay\nSo ah are you already to stop the cycle I'm show you how\nYeah a hundred percent and as a this this week and so there's a lot more\nThe problem with that kind of a solution but\nA on Wednesday this week I got a I've received at twenty nine thousand dollar inheritance check that I haven't put in the bank yet because I wanted to wait until I spoke with you to see how I or go attack us I don't want to I don't want to do any other dumb things I Want to continue I Want to start from scratch about the debt but I got to do it the right way\nOkay let me ask you this then it sounds like you're taking ownership for having kind of a dump this on your wife and uh\nIs that um it sounds like you're taking ownership for having kind of a dump this on your wife and abandoned her or is she taking ownership for the shame in fact she was ashamed and so she hid this from you because she didn't know what to do but she knew she was screwing it up\nWe we had a couple of conversations or for a church and we have some a marriage and Richman stuff and we got to look into doing some more of that to kinda get up in fact I mean I I don't want to send the you know he's got to talk to but I think that yes we accept the responsibility\nNow I don't know that you are necessarily hard to talk to you just abandoned her\n\nYeah you ... your laughter out in the old she was doing the best she couldn't she screwed it up really bad and was really a shame to tell you it sounds like that's the way it goes the reason I'm asking and the reason I'm poking at you a little bit is because it changes what to do with the twenty nine thousand okay now the other possibility is and I don't think that's what's going on here but you tell me because I'm asking you\nIt can be one of you is running a business and is running up debt down at the business and not telling your spouse because you're trying to live your dream and it's turning into a nightmare\n\nLet me just kinda clarified this for you there is no positive effect to your marriage when you lie to your spouse\n[laughter] was that helpful you don't already know that did you [laughter] well\nI'm trying to avoid it by ear you're all you're doing the cooking it up it's going to be a bigger fight once it cooks up [laughter] she was one of a smaller fires quickly\n[laughter] so here's the thing if you're afraid to discuss with your spouse a purchase\nOr a financial issue that you want to discuss that is not a financial problem that's a relationship problem\n\nNow I got to tell you there's times I I mean I I have a ton of money I'm a multi millionaires times though I think I Want to buy something and I'm also down talk Sharon Hi Eleanor bothers toy\nI Want to buy another gun she's like you don't mean not again you have too many guns already people already would think you were crazy if they know what I mean and you and I collect guns by the way so\nYeah if it ever comes out you know they're they're going to find out that I was like one of those crazy guys or something I'm not but I I collect okay I collect so you know you don't need another car you don't need another ... you don't need another inner tube to pull behind the bar actually collect those I got too much too many like toys right\nAh for the grandkids and for the kids to play on and so you know I I get ready to buy a toy and it's it's not it doesn't even show up on our\nBut I still have to have this moment and I go I I actually got to make sure I talked about this she gets ready to buy purses too expensive which is one of the few things that she buys this too expensive\nBut like she says one of those purses is equal to one of those\nGuns [laughter] uh well maybe maybe two guns [laughter] but uh you know isn't it funny how as adults that have the money even\nWhere there is a lot of stress on the finances have it a little bit of a dread about talking to each other so you really have to push yourself and make yourself and Rachel talks about this in her book love your life not there's one of the seven habits just talk about money even when it's hard and it's almost always hard\nTo talk about it keep it clean and\nIf your spouse is hiding money from you it generally does fall under one of three areas one is you've got a broken relationship and they are intimidated by you to the spouse is an arrogant\nRebellious immature prints are princes that just wants to do whatever they want to do with their lips stuck out and they don't like being told no spoiled child and the grownup body and goes and buys whatever they want to buy but know that it's wrong so they hide it from you\nMost often we find hidden that though it's the what the guy was on the last call one of the spouses has been given\nAll of the responsibility all of the weight of all of the decision making isn't doing the money handling well ends up running into debt because they're not doing a good job with it and now the shame is multiplied\nAnd its shame based hiding its guilty condemnation base hiding so they're hiding it 'cause they don't they're they're ashamed that they haven't done a good job of handling the money in which case if that's your spouse you are partially responsible just like that guy said\nHe was he on that because he should have been more involved you should let dumped this on his wife and you shouldn't dump it all on your husband\n\nYou shouldn't dump it all on either one of your both of you should be involved now whenever you again can carry the ministry of weight once all the decisions are made but every body ought to know where every dollar is going\nPretty simple stuff\nSo you probably never heard the story but I actually was the guy who would almost been on Oprah more than anybody Oprah called like five six times their producers did and would tease us like we can get all I've been on every other show back in the day you know I've been on a sixty minutes I had been on Larry King remember Larry King was on the air and\nAh sixty minutes I had been on\nLarry King remembering Larry King was on the air I'm Sally Jessie Raphael you remember her with a red glasses you know all that I've been on all these different shows\nYou know everything out there ... except I couldn't get on Oprah and they would call and teach us so finally they call and we get our Oprah parents and it was three different families on Oprah and I was supposed to advise them in their trouble on Oprah\nAnd the very first family\nOf course I knew what I was getting into and the families knew what they were getting into a sort of and um the very first couple I'm sitting up there are getting an argument with Oprah\nWhy would I Do that because Oprah was wrong [laughter]\nIs what happened so here's the deal the wife had run up\nLike Seventy thousand dollars worth of debt and her husband had no idea\nAnd uh I had told the producers I said what's partially his fault because he's not involved in his wife's life enough he's not loving his wife enough to even know what's going on in her life enough that she can run up Seventy eight thousand dollars if unless she's just like a psychopath and her level of deception\nThis guy hadn't got he he doesn't know what's going on under his own roof these free can clueless when his relationship\nAnd so Oprah's reading the script and she's like and if you say that it's partially spoiled and he owes her an apology I don't think I agree with that and I said well you would be wrong he does or an apology because he hasn't been walking with his wife to the point she runs up Seventy eight thousand all over the debt and he don't even know what the clips going on under his own roof\nAnd she's like well he delegated to her I said oh this is not a business you don't delegate stuff to your spouse\nAnd just dump it on them and even if you're delegate in business you would always inspect what you expect you'd never just walk away and hope it happened you wouldn't know what's going on in business and besides that this is a marriage is not a joint venture God did not say and now you are a joint venture\nYou said and now you are one and these two are not one they're not on the same page and so\nYou know the poor lady sitting there crying because she so ashamed and overwhelmed and the guys angry 'cause he's finally got a grand and debt that he didn't know he hadn't oh man it looked like a Jerry ... Springer episode or something and um you know and I'm a I'm ... I'm making him apologized to her for not being a good husband\nBecause of your wife can run up your husband can run up a hundred thousand dollars in debt and you have no idea what's going on you have chosen to not be involved in your own spouse's life or their or psychopathic liar\nOne of the two but most of the time it's you just did you just dump it on\nAnd then and then you cry because they didn't do it right\nAfter you dumped it on them and walked away enclosed your eyes and what we'll do the ... well you know you thought but you didn't even care enough to get involved in what was going on and so\nOprah's all upset with Dave because Oprah was wrong [laughter]\nDidn't work out well the rest of the show what we got through it [laughter] so here's the rule of thumb then\nWe see couples who have a good marriage had been married ten years or Fifteen Years or Twenty years\nSit down and start doing a basic budget together where every dollar has an assignment every dollar has a mission every dollar as a name before the month begins on paper on purpose every month before the month against a unique budget it takes about ten minutes\nOnce you've been doing it a while but it takes about three months of doing it to get really on the same page and get a rhythm going\nWe see couples that agree on their spending before the month begins on paper on purpose increased their level of communication\nTenfold\nIncrease their level of cooperation\nIncrease their empathy for each other for the stress of the other ones have been carrying that they didn't even realize\nTenfold [noise] they begin to agree on their goals and their productivity with their money goes through the roof and you'll feel like you've got a raise when you learn to do this together\nOn paper on permission before the month begins give every dollar a name that's why we named the world's best budgeting software\nFor every dollar the best that for your phone every dollar movie of every dollar to name [noise]\nDid you know there are more than two million real estate\nAgents in this country two million when all you want to do is buy or sell a house you don't have time to sift through ads on line or email twenty different people to find a few agents you want to interview our real estate EL peas have years of experience and are the top agents and their markets in fact\nWe recommend less than one percent of the agents in the country that's why many of our listeners have success\nWith an lp Richard in Mississippi did and this is what he had to say there are so many real estate agents today than it is refreshing to find someone like your E. L. P. bail he's experienced trustworthy and knowledgeable bill contacted me within a few hours of requesting information and we're so professional in his presentation an approach\nAre we going to get home do all these different things start a family but um you know definitely go with our side and and of course you know he was able to open up those doors for us to get on the same page and be able to pay off this in a pretty good time\nYou know how how do you explain to other people because I Know I Know what the answer is but how do you explain to other people the level of intensity\nThat is required 'cause you guys I mean it was not panic but you were focused to the point that you sacrifice so deeply that normal people looking at you all have to think you lost your mind I mean you guys were on your game on\nYeah I don't know where do you get that fire from was it desperation\n[laughter] yeah I think it was a ... mostly that living with a stand in line with unacceptable for us and and we just had made the decision and our heart that um we weren't going to do that and so I had and we had because individuals that kind of had the perspective that I'm living with a student loan was and\nYou know and it was normal you know it was just a mediocrity and like that was just a part of life\nAnd Sally money's going to be a room mate for life\nRight by God though and people you know ours and responses that we got where like you know you don't need to do that or you know that you could fit that into your life that we had made a decision like you know art student loan like just so astronomical that we couldn't live with it\nAnd so and we weren't really we weren't ready and willing to do and tell them to do those erode budget you know there's Iraq and in fact get everything out and every dollar hadn't assignment and every extra dollar went to a student loans that we weren't making payment\nLike in the land yeah making payments to having a month\nRight we have to have a big shovel and so we put everything we had toward the end we had like zero last for like just everyday living like eating out\nGoing shopping and socializing entertainment like that did not meet our budget line item and not for our budget and so and you know the sacrifice was overwhelming and they can and the like it was really a marathon to the degree that it was extremely painful to\nWin two ... two years bike and that lifestyle you know but and I would have to say like during those times like prayer with everything like I really had to really have to pray through and just the ... and have that type of lifestyle and really be uplifted and spirit\nUm pet really be focusing ten maintain that lifestyle and\nThen he had countless hours worked ... hours like twelve fourteen sixteen hour days or weeks then months at a time um but he was just very focused they just stay tired and prayer I really am tired of meet the marathon that we were I'm experiencing\nAnd was in pain that it was it worth it [noise] yeah I don't\nKnow you're completely free [laughter]\nYeah they're good yeah I Know what else should get out of this it's like when you climb a wall that's that tall you kind of come away going we can free can do anything [laughter] [noise] yeah I mean\nThere are crushed to strengthens me but I mean we can do anything that was in the first twenty four months of your marriage of
