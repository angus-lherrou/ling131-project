are you\nI think yeah I'm not sure how can I Know\nI meet them by um my husband is out of her pension pay\nTo the previous they paid job I'm In league with the the ladder and the male offering a cash payout to retirement and witty the letter says it's sixty percent at the present value at your church normal retirement annuity mhm I've heard to\nAdvise people on the path to take the\nPath payout\nNot my concern is that there was a recent news announcement that the state treasurer um had said that the pension plan has weakening financially\nAnd it took out there to cover like Seventy nine percent of the kitchen benefit and now it's up to ... percent mhm\nCan an employer I'm not half of them [laughter] and when it comes time for your retirement\nI mean they can be broke and a lot of pension funds of going broke and the problem is you don't own anything you're just depending on the stream of payments so that's yet another reason to take the lump sum and almost always and you can you can uh get with us\nAbout another reason to take the lump sum and almost always and you can you can uh get with a financial advisor get one more ... more of us are pros and run the actual calculations which are are there there are about five steps too complicated to do here on the air okay\nBut basically you can put in the amount of payments you would receive and put in an average death age of uh Seventy six for a male Seventy eight for a female\nUh-huh that's how they're calculated typically on actuarial tables\nAnd uh then you figure out what the president value of those payments are because that's what you're going to receive and\nThat's what they're saying that they're offering you and it's probably the discount rate is the interest rate and it's probably six percent five and a half percent something like that so you probably make five and a half percent on your money and if you die you lose it when you die if you do when you die you lose you\nKnow and so if you took the lump sum\nYou'd be making ten twelve percent on your money if you invested in good mutual funds and when you die\nYour family get some money\nSo the lump sum Ninety nine percent of the time comes out better especially if you include the fact that when you die you get to keep the money\nYou know they do\nWell I mean fortunately it's not a lot on American\nYou know but I Would ... just saying that it's a mathematical theory on that you run through on whether whether it's a hundred thousand or a million or or ten thousand you know the theory is still the same\nIt's just it's an it's less important if it's a small amount of money right I get that but you know where's the mistake is not going to ruin your life you know that kind of a thing but if you want to run the actual numbers out that's how you would do it and I think you'll find that you'll be better off to take the lump sum and roll it into\nHow old are you I'm Twenty one and you need your grandmother to handle your finances\nOh she ... and it sounded like a new deal\nWhich should offer the title Romano wouldn't let her\nWhy why do you do for somebody else to handle your money\n\nUm I Hope they shouldn't be able to get me on a better financial track\nOkay at twenty five that'd be your job I Know it is okay All right so what happened um\nWell my sister and check your credit to grandma and open for credit cards and her name\nOn and ah\nWe my grandpa are committed suicide\nAnd uh\nWe found out the leading up to ... to ... a grandma I Dream about Fifteen thousand dollars they lost Fifteen thousand dollars out of his bank account\nAnd uh she ... into my bills and she hadn't paid any of my vote for several several months\nAnd I I guess I just don't know what to do right now\nOkay um and so when did your grandpa commit suicide oh about three weeks ago oh my lord I'm Sorry oh what a horrible thing [noise] so how old is your grandmother\nA Seventy okay\nWell what you needed to get off the phone is you need to take back control of all your finances would be for the next hour rings twelve\n\nYou have thirty minutes to get it done okay if you have to shut down the checking account if you have to shut down the credit cards and if you have to freeze your credit that's fine but you need to get control over your finances because your grandmother for whatever reason is misbehaving we wish that Bush that correct\nYes there were never money ... money and with your sisters id and for all we know she was open up credit cards and your name as well correct we don't know\n... I'm not sure yet\nI'm telling you need to check your credit and shave she's done that to you as well but you need to shut down a so did you get rid of your checking account is that what you get rid of take over and how how does she handle their money\nI gave him my checking account my debit card I'm\nJust go down to a halt credit oh you don't just go down to the bank enclosure checking account\nJust close and whatever monies in their ... use it to be moved over to a different accounts and have that bank are told that bank what's going on that this lady is um\n... you know she's she's misbehaving she's mentally ill she says the we don't know what it is but we need to get all control taken away from her or is that all she had was your debit card in checking account\nBut that's all I have when we are that's all she had a rerun money or your stuff so you get paid as a as a direct deposit into your account\n...\nOkay so you need to change that as well right to the new account number two a day for today\nSo you need to change that as well ride to the new account number two a day later\nToday yeah are you going to do it today I Am going to be\nOkay good and then you just call her up and say a ... I got enrolled in a financial class and so I'm going to take over my finances thank you for your help I'll take it from here and then you need to call like sure your bills are being paid call every one of your bills how much debt if you got\nAll my bills photo that ended up again and again it's a rolling around twenty of them\nHow many different creditors are you a\nA ... regular ... ah that's like utility bills and that kind of stuff he or she don't have any you don't have anything to you don't have any debt well OK okay\nThen you just need to call your utilities and make sure where they on auto draft on your account\nAll\nDay then you're gonna have to give them your new account numbers and get all that switched over today show that you take over the handling of your money and you can just like random mother know that you know with grandpa was passing out in which you to have to fool with us on Ishaan won't take it over I and I'm I'm enrolled in a financial class and\nI'm going to get control as a twenty five year old man of my life and I'm ...\nI'm Sorry\nShe actually I'm ... now she's in jail why she in jail\nAll my sister cross charges or a credit card game honing yesterday\nWhile okay well you didn't let her know that you took the bank account or a due to all this weird notion of family then\nThey're interesting wow\nSo people in the family are not real happy with a grandmother I now I take it\nAnd no not at all\nYou know very sad sad to be Seventy years old and that and so and then the next thing you need to do is you need to pull a copy of your credit bureau report and you can do that for free once a year with each of the three credit bureaus and see if there's anything showing up on your credit bureau report regarding identity theft\nRoom mate she if she has opened cards and your name as well\nOK\nAnd let me help you to your sister may or may not have been really mad\nAnd she may or may not meant for your grandmother it'll be picked up but here's the thing the only way if someone opens on account and your name\nThe only way to get that account cleared other than pay it yourself which would be pretty stupid to pay an account that you didn't open when someone stole your identity the only way to keep from doing that is you have to file a police report\nAnd when you're filling out the police report they always ask you if you know who stole your identity and if you don't tell them that would be breaking the law and so your sister followed the law properly when the police report as being filled out and said yes I Know who the identity the if he is\nMy grandmother and I'm I'm surprised that actually that they went and picked her up but they did and um\nYou know show 'em 'cause it is it is a federal law it is a federal offense now to steal an identity\nAnd so um she she is in trouble [noise] she's in real trouble but your sister ... could maybe accidentally activated all of this because she just had to do a police report to get the identity theft removed from her name\nRight now but she may have been just mad and gotten arrested I don't know either way's fine with me but I'm\nJust moments definitely a thief but oh my goodness what a sad thing though are horrible thing you guys are going through not Cody um well much how much do you make what kind of money do you make\nOf forty thousand a year\nOkay All right are you really ready to take this over and learn how to handle money if you are I'll show you how which in our class\nI Am saying\nOkay you don't have to wear your shoulders back now and not look for anybody else to babysit your you're too old for a babysitter so time for you to man up here okay you hold on I'll have Kelly pick up and we'll get your signed up for financial ... you can go through

grandmother does it\nOh my gosh it's just heartbreaking\nAnd then a suicide in the family on top of that with grandpa oh my gosh what a mess this money stuff man it's it's a big deal not because money's a big deal but it's just so revealing it reveals everything else about you as an [noise]\nJesus so do you send your treasures where your heart is and it's just send money problems and you have

for the next five ten years or so until you buy a house\nAs long as you leave it alone as long as you plan to leave it alone at least five years you can survive the gyrations of the stock market and you should be fine\nIn that and that that's exactly what I Would do I do a similar things got in the sometimes I've got some extra money and I'm just saving up for my next real estate purchase as an investment\nAnd um even if I don't know five years in that case I'll ride the market with it and I 'cause I can afford for it to go down if I mess up a little bit but yeah that that's the direction I Would go good question Robby is with us in Pittsburgh hey Robbie welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHey Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOh thank you so much for taking my call yeah I had a quick quick and ah so I Am a nurse or by profession and my wife is a nurse and that that\nI Am wondering if I should go back to school again next year or so my question is if they work for me to go to a call now I'm thirty two years old my wife is\nUh twenty nine we make a combined income right now I'm a two hundred and a two hundred and twenty thousand a year or so if I go to school it's going to cost me three years of not working on that tuition off around Ninety thousand dollars\nMhm uh but uh our gross income after I go to school and be successful uh together that would be close to a three hundred thousand mhm\nSo uh but ... a\nYear now\nUh right now around Seventy thousand\nOkay you're saying this is going to cost you a three hundred grand three years or three years of Seventy thousand missing plus nine out of pocket yeah okay can you cash flow than on the out of pocket and can you live on her income or you're doing this\nI can live on her income for sure that's how we did it when she was in school um but I don't think I can cash anything right now because I and I also don't have a house mhm uh at the moment so I was you know planning on buying a house\nOr or putting Lisa putting a down payment for a house next year before I start school so\nThat then you need to wait until you can pay for school or whatever but you never in Thirty years are going to show recommended somebody borrow money to go to school okay you got the cash flow to do it it's just a matter when you do it and what you put first what you put second you might plenty of money to come up with not agreeing\nYeah\nPlenty of money and you don't have to have the whole money up front you just got to see in your budget how you can cash flow it um I can see it pretty easily ... how long does it take to go through the class again\nOr go to ... it's a three year program so thirty grand a year\nA thirty grand a year yeah\nAnd and she makes what\nShe makes a hundred and fifty thousand\nYou can't cash flow thirty grand out of a hundred and fifty\nA wrong not when I'm not in coal\nNow if you're in school she makes a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in ... thirty thousand over a hundred and fifty to go to school year for three years\nI I'm Sorry fifty thousand it's ... it's a it's going to be around a sixty thousand a year\nI thought you said it was Ninety thousand\nI'm Sorry I got that wrong it's it's a sixty thousand a year\nSeems high\nYeah it it it it it is an expensive program\nYeah go to a less expensive program\nThat but cash flow it whatever you're going to pay for it figure out a way to\nPay for it if I usually go you don't actually have an old style stacked up ahead of time but you got to see where it's going to come from I Would not recommend\nUnless you really have an old style stacked up ahead of time but you got to see where it's going to come from I Would not recommend you go get student loans because here's the thing everyone starts that program doesn't finish it but every one that takes out student loans to start that program has on student loans whether they finish or not\nAnd then you've got what's known as a freaking mash and so I'm not suggesting you're dumber you can't pass the test or something like that but life happens do in the last thing you want the only time debt works as if everything works other than that that doesn't work\nAnd so we tell you to stay away from it thanks for the call open\nPhones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Joshua is in Dallas texas Hi Joshua how are you\nI'm good how are you better than I deserve what's up\nSo basically I Am stuck in between whether I should or bankruptcy or just go ahead and start paying 'em all my ... all of them would go about basically all my debts except my car our aim collection so that's why that's the only reason I'm basically on the lady I'm bankruptcy\nWhy are they only go actions\nUm they're like oh medical bills um one is a is a car that guy I'm ... I Love my job and uh I think I think like a phone bill is America\nMhm okay so how much is the repo bill\n[noise] I'm actually only like a couple of grand I'm ... I guess what I have on there is a Ninety five thousand four hundred and forty five dollars\nAn old apartment\nMhm how long ago was a three and a half years ago okay and how ... how much how much older and wiser medical data began\n\nI Would say about two thousand\nAnd one of the doubt if you're going to\nThe rest of it is it makes it very well like my ... a phone bill and with a payday Lowe says well you know\nSo your your total that's less than twenty thousand dollars\nRight and then I have um my car which is a twelfth out\nMhm okay and what do you make a year\nI'm a little bit old for forty five I make a thousand a week I'm a independent contractor\nMhm and you're single or married you're married or\nI'm twenty eight on Saturday the happy birthday\nDoes she work outside the home\nUm you know she said I'm here Dr\nOkay yeah mhm [noise] well\nLet me tell you what I'm hearing okay and I think I'm hearing maybe I'm wrong I'm a ... cat used to say that that is not the problem which is a symptom\nOf something else that's going on I'm right and it sounds like you guys are never told your money what to do you've never had any savings for emergencies so every time an emergency comes up you get thrown out of an apartment in a suit your car gets ... and you end up with a mash\nYes they're so we've got to get you on a plan where you are telling your money what to do or you're going to be back here if I waved to want to ... go way which is what bankruptcy might do maybe I'm if it did that make you have zeroed out all of a sudden except your car\nIf you don't change their habits that causes this mess in the first was you'll be back right where you are someday do you agree\nYes there you know so we really need to get under that those bankruptcy doesn't solve that uh you got to solve that in the mirror you and your wife learning how to handle money I don't think you're bankrupt I think you're scared disorganized don't know what to do and have done nothing so far\nI think you can probably shuttle that old apartment that for three or four grand if you saved it up and offer them a lump sum settlement uh I\nI've actually called them multiple times where I started listening to you that was like one of the first videos that I was looking up with how to get that collect bears you know under use\nIt don't it doesn't change my answers or whether it's nine thousand or three thousand you're still not bankrupt\nIt's still about you getting control your money\nAnd when you do that then you're going to see your way through this bankruptcy is not a debt problems such behavior from Scott\n... is a total money make over both read that take an extra job shall everything in sight and let's get this mess wind up I'll show you how\nShe was like\nUs today rams you\nOne of the

up call\nOkay I think it's time for her to stay at work long enough to build up enough pay pay in a savings account to be able to survive the time the shoes off while she was only ... okay I mean what are we\nOrder if you weren't they weren't there to bother stronger drink\n\nThey wouldn't be able to drink right if you weren't there I Am about to buy her her drinks she wouldn't be getting

but I wasn't sure so I'm Glad I understand and I'm not trying to be lacking compassion I Want to be compassionate\nBut continuing to assist her in this behavior line that has been destructive to her is not compassionate\nOkay can play like\nMan I tell you what I don't know I mean you got to sit down and figure out how you're going to do this in layers but maybe you maybe you assist her partially in return for her engaging in behaviors that she knows she's supposed to be doing\nOK but so far she has refused all help that has to do with her ... up yeah I was a little kid my dad used to say straighten up and fly right ever heard that\nI don't even know what that means I don't even know what that means I just knew we'd better straighten up I never did flies or I don't know what he meant but I didn't fly right you know but you know what I'm Talking about straighten up have\nYou know ... ... and I and I did I mean because he he would've looked as if we didn't do what he said so you know but I'm sure that show that in this case we can't do that kind of stuff but but I I got to just think that's what needs to happen here for her own good you're I provided whether\n...\nBecause I Love her because you love her and you don't want to see her in pain and she refuses to do the things because the pain to go away\nMhm okay\nAnd you're more concerned about her behavior than she is\nSo I ... I think I just sit down and tell her all that say you know I Love you know there's always tell you when you do all that she's going to get pissed off injury\n... she feels entitled to your money back you know that's weird and required also had a sound re violation and look boundaries Michigan titled or your money so she was supposed to take care of your mama\nCigarettes hanging out your lip and iron lung in the closet I mean come on\nSerious like momma\nThis is the Ramsey show [noise]\nI get asked all the time about what people need to do to improve their families money situation to the most overlooked things are term life insurance and\nDisability insurance both plans make sure that you have income to pay bills and take care of yourself and your family if something were to happen preterm life you need to carry ten to twelve times your income and I recommend\nFifteen or twenty year plans for most families stay away from cash value our return a premium plans there just a rip off disability insurance is just as critical how are you going to pay your bills or if you're unable to work disability is the leading cause of bankruptcies foreclosures\nThat's why I send you to Zander insurance they've been helping my listeners find the right plans at the lowest cost for almost Twenty years called eight hundred three five six Seventeen Ninety or visit sander dot com and compare online\nThat's eight hundred three five six Seventeen eighty or Zander dot com\nWeather from logo radio today if you are updates brought to you by the ravens the science and math for them to be clear eyed about with wins on the west northwest of five\nThursday Saudi sixty three degrees Thursday night a twenty percent chance of rain overnight below forty seven and a twenty percent chance of rain in the afternoon on friday and it says on the road you might be [noise]\nHi this is Dave states like I've been with W.

lobby of Ramsey solutions from Spokane, Washington where the question\nI Heather Hi Dan how are you better than I deserve what's up and I just finished baby step three and now I'm working on baby steps three ... saving for a house got your emergency fund good for ... yeah and I wanted to know how long is too long in baby step three being the flashy lives onto babysat for\nWas not a magic cancer of the concept or the or the critical thinking skills for the answer is simply this\nIf you stay there so long that you don't save for retirement you screwed up your retirement right or if you don't stay there long enough then you don't have a good solid down payment and you'll end up with other problems on the mortgage so it's the it's the pull between those two things\nAnd most people that means you know three years four years something like that um but if you're if you're fifty nine it might not be that long or you're not fifty nine now how old are you\nAnd twenty eight on friday\nOkay cool and so I mean if you stayed out for four years and never started any retirement until thirty two but you had a really juicy down payment on a house and got a ... at you know how to play on the pay it off in a few years because of that\nYou're not you're you're still going to return multi millionaire you know if you do that at it but if you stayed out for Twenty years in called that baby steps freebie site when I'm ... yeah it's kind of how you think through it from a critical thinking skills standpoint so how long were you thinking of\nWell I just started in June and I'm hoping to have it done in two years\nOkay and so Thirty years old you're your game own on retirement taking on a Fifteen year mortgage by forty five the mortgage is paid for if not sooner and uh you will of saved thirty five years at Fifteen Percent of your income which unless you just don't work\nIs going to make you a millionaire multimillionaire usually I'm doing this so you're in a safe zone there but that's how you make the decision more importantly than they Ramsey says never go more than three years it's not how it works it's just you're pulling those two things are pulling at each other or because you're not saving for retirement the longer you go yeah that's all it is I think for stopping by think states\nOpen phones at triple eight eight to five five to to find but Julian is in New York City Hi Julian how are you\nKnow I ... it can you hear me okay\nI can how can I help\nThank you very much for taking my call so I'm In a a bit of a unique position I'm I'm twenty four next year I'm going to medical school and uh I was I'm very very lucky and very appreciative uh I'm not going to have any deaths\nAfter graduating medical school but at the gate the residency included I buy the specialized um and uh what did you get a follow up or what um uh yeah I'm not certain that's what I Want to do yet I Know\nThey're not asking how you did that\nOh oh um yeah so so if they get from my father and my grandparents um wow I Am very very bad who showed up yeah\nGood now yeah you should be that's amazing wonderful so\nUm yeah so when when I was Twenty one uh I was given a essentially control is funny because it's under my name I'm but I'm Sorry I Apologize I'm so I'm\nA yeah I was I was given control this money and uh I've been given a very good financial advice from my father who's helping me manage it but um because it's under my name and he he's actually in the rain stopped me or I Would like that a second opinion as to what to do with this money I can give it a little bit of\nMoney for a living expenses um and I said that about five thousand dollars from some small side jobs in those but I Want to know how to capitalize on this and how that myself up as best as they can for after medical school\nWell the thing I Would be most concerned about is that the money is available and enough to get through through medical school\nUm it it definitely is um about one third of it is invested very securely and two thirds of it I have in savings I'm In the two thirds we were discussing putting into the bill on a three month renewal basis until I needed to take them out to pay my tuition and then I Would just reinvent the rest\nUm well I probably would not do that and the only reason is is that the bills basically or bonds and a bond interest rates are yields a go the bond values rather go down as interest rates go up and we are in an increasing in the interest rate environment\nSo if you put a hundred thousand dollars in the bills that could turn into Ninety pretty quick\nAs interest rates increase so that's not a very safe investment in the environment that we're in right now um but if you wanted to have some portion of the money invested I probably would go to something like growth\nIn income type funds but I'm okay if there's enough there to do simple division and it doesn't have to really earn anything if you want to keep\nBut I'm okay if there's enough there to do simple division and that doesn't have to really earn anything if you want to keep it all very very safe that would be okay with me because the most important thing is for you to be able to graduate with zero debt\nAnd if you screw around with his money in some way and it loses value and you're not able to do that then the whole you know it was like a ... we were concentrating on the wrong thing\nAnd Julian is the right thing to concentrate on Julia much debt free graduation is the most important part of this math equation not what this money is paying\nA it'd be nice to be a little bit sophisticated about it but if you get caught up in some kind of a sophisticated process and you end up losing money trying to trying to just get a little bit more on this lump sum uh you you defeated ... Detroit yourself in the foot so to speak so um\nThat's the process you're looking at I'm going to keep it pretty safe or if you want to go toward something that's fun but I wouldn't use bonds for anything right now a possible play Kimberly is in Pensacola Hi Kimberley how are you\nSaying I'm doing great thank you so much for taking my call sure\nI I just wanted to thank you for all you do this thing temporary Wal Mart has it's been seven years and it's not and I have paid off that I'm following their plans to go over that\nUm I'm calling from today is um my sister in our what all concerned about our parents are hoping you could give it some advice on how they got them um my parents for the north Carolina and they live in a flooded area hard prone area\nAnd um every time the hurricanes come ... I'm thinking they experience some partying it on their on their property in their home as well as my dad is now\nAnd we were just wander in what you can find things that what um they have like that they do have um savings and my mom has a ticket for one\nToo often does this property blood\nWell in Ninety nine and it flooded and it was it got like forty inches and house and I think about ten feet in his shop\nAnd then two years ago um it got in my dad shop I think about three years and it almost like about six inches from getting in the house again\nAnd I'm ... and there's only been two major flood but um but they're in their sixties and it it's very emotional for them in any town a farm and it's just\nIt's throughout this past down we actually pack that or I didn't care whether they bought it helped a lot with added things that they had all their belongings and let them took him away you know because they were afraid that it\nActually I was living there has become more painful than not living there\nBut those are the fear of rising water even yeah even the fear is not founded we once one Twenty years is not that bad but bottom line is is that has developed a phobia for them and they're not on living there sort of a fun living there why wouldn't move\nRight there I mean the actual threat a flood statistically with what you've given me I wouldn't do that concerned about but if they're absolutely panicking Everytime the weather person comes also draining\nAnd just trying to lose 'cause it's not fun to live there\nSo you know it's more of an emotional decision but that's an okay decision wrong with that is my mom lives are more moving\n\nYou've heard me talk about our deep for years and how it's only a matter of time before you become a victim but I run across some numbers that even surprised me and shows the real nightmare that people go through when they become a victim of the sixteen million victims of identity theft last year yes sixteen million\nTwenty
