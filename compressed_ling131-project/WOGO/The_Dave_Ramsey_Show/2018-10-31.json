Senate at all of a ... stupid bank\nYou save money for emergencies first you need to grandma's rainy day fund because it is going to rain Graham all knew that\nThey need to save and invest for your kid's college in your retirement and you need to just plain old build wells you need to be outrageously generous\nFor those of us that are evangelical Christians the baseline starting point of that is your tie that your local church\nBeyond that though you catch somebody parking car and you give them a nice to\nUh pulled up the other day in front of a nice restaurant this guy in a free good hundred thousand dollar range rover gives guy five dollars to park\nI Know freaking hundred thousand dollar range rover gives guy five dollars to park his car you ...

car show I Am twenty dollars you know what the weird thing is the car sitting right there when I come out [laughter] it's the most amazing thing ah yeah\nAnd you know but those guys are out there in the heat and the cold and rainy those gals I mean they're running up and down on the run up and down that's why I got them there\nAs somebody waiting your time I was when since you carried a hundred

you wonder why you're broke country typed\nI'll be outrageously generous it's a sign of people who were winning with money generous people are highly attractive people every body wants to be around not because they want their money but just because there are people that smile ever noticed that selfish people never smile they looked like they were ... on a pickle\nOutrageous generosity and gratitude contentment staying out of debt living on less than you make saving money for emergencies and to change your family tree\nA hundred thousand is student loans and the balance would be a credit card debt\nWe recently met with a financial adviser and they suggested that we filed for bankruptcy because they would take us a long time to pay off the bat they suggested that saying that it would be better for us to start fresh and I just wanted a second opinion\nWhat is your household income sure\nA combined it for about eighty five okay you have any car debt harder mhm I'm no we don't our cars are paid off okay what are your car's worth\nUm\nI Would say about twenty thousand combine okay All right\nWell here's the facts that the quote unquote financial advisor did know\nUm apparently or he wouldn't have given you such stupid but advise student loans are not bankrupt double\n\nHere we did talk about that during the conversation they never go away but he was drinking entirely and the amount of credit card that we have\nBob are really really have allied um at wait a minute this moron suggested your bankrupt with thirty four thousand dollars with a credit card debt with a household income of eighty five thousand that's absurd dude that's what I was thinking\nThat's absurd does the ... the the hundred thousand dollars in student loan doesn't change anything because it's going to be there regardless it's not like reputable so we're dealing with you're going to file bankruptcy and thirty four thousand dollars make an eighty five no you should pay it off in one year\nAnd a year yeah one year live on fifty paid off in one year take six extra jobs shelves so much stuff you can't breeze no eating out no vacations and you're a hundred percent that free in one year what are your car's worth\nYour car the work we're appointing okra each\nUm her a newer models are older so\nProud of ours or who are hers is worth what about Thirteen thousand mind of about forever\nMhm okay\nWell um you can do what you want to do I if I woke up in your shoes I have to tell you I've worked with families that were in dire straits over the years that were forced into bankruptcy you're not one of those\nIf you choose to file bankruptcy just cause you to that young lazy to address the situation let's even say you did it over two years it's only Seventeen five a year\nAnd your debt free other than your student loan which I'm not talking about the student loans will be gone in one year I'm Talking about the credit card debt to big on on your show\nHow fast do normal people that call the day Ramsey show that work our plan pay off a hundred and thirty four thousand dollars making eighty five about four years probably\nOh quarter yeah\nThat's the normal routine for people around here that would be student loans and everything and uh you know I I Would not move down in car initially out of your wife's car into a into a six thousand dollar or five thousand dollar car initially\nOut of your wife's car into a into a six thousand dollar or five thousand dollar car initially I might end up doing that as we go along we'll see how it goes what do you do for a living sir\nI'm operations manager\nI'm okay and what does she do for a living\nThrough the pastor\nOkay All right cool um does she ever do any outside speaking for money\nI'm no windows ... that's about it got a\nDoes she do speaking Miami does she speak on Sunday mornings\nYes he does just under okay All right\nI mean I Wonder if if you know she might feel do some ... occasionally for somebody that was ill or on sabbatical or something in that congregation pay or a little bit or maybe she works and evangelists to outrage and they pay or a little bit for speaking skills\nOr maybe dot dot dot you do something I don't know I mean if you add ten Fifteen thousand dollars a year to this equation\nOf income and you guys tightened down your budget and nothing I mean nothing where you have no life because we're going to clean this mess up you know you can clean up the whole thing in four years maybe three but four for sure\nUh any clear up those student loans really really really fast as a part of that equation I'm Sorry the credit card debt as a part of that equation really really fast but you've got to cut them up you've got to quit using them and you gotta stop living the way you been living goes is not working agreed\nOn despair does that make sense you have to like that\nYou know the Bible says that no discipline seems pleasant at the time but it yields harvest of righteousness you guys make good money so I Know you're not stupid people you're not dumb or\nYou're not dumb you just been doing some dumb things which makes you just like most of it was added a lot of dumb things in my lab do a lot of money in particular has high end up teaching is 'cause I got a P. H. D. and D. U. N. B.\nBut um you know I don't I don't know who it was it gave you this advice but you need to stay away from them\nBecause they gave you really really bad advice that's my opinion I think you could not only can work through this I think you should work through this I think it'll be a testimony to God's power and you're all his life that you turn this around and that you attack at an attack at an attack in and that you could start having a sense of self control the sense of discipline\nAnd it'll change your marriage on communication\nLevels it will lower the stress when you're working the plan together and you can do anything how old are you guys\nUh twenty eight I'm I just turned thirty two\nExcellent show when you're thirty six and she's thirty two year debt free as I feel\nSorry for the you know life no vacation with\nNo eating out for a short period of time\nFor a short period of time or you live like no one else\nSo that later you can live and give like no one else think about what how much how much money you would have and how well the you could become and how generous you could be if you didn't have any payments right now\nOh my gosh\nI think about the piece that will be in your house the stress that would be gone so it's worth it to pay a price to win but there's a price to be paid the price of the pet you got to your own home\nAnd you don't get out of a whole by jumping out usually you climb out\nScratching and clawing pool and dirt under your fingernails you know what I'm saying you can do this map I'll help you I'll help you don't want you to go through our

with time share ... team\nThey have offices all around the country where you can sit down face to face and review your contract\nTo find a solution they've accepted thousands\nOf timeshare owners this year alone they're the best in the business because they simply have more options for exit than anyone else it could be a long process\nBut there with you every step of the way and timeshare exit team

fight again we're back behind the wall you know we we can you know we're not taking fire were not you know we got we're back undercover again okay would retreat enough to get undercover in the battle but we're not gonna ... we're not going to surrender\nTo the to that we want to take that ground back again someday\nBut for today are are for the next two years or whatever it takes to turn it around absolutely I make this move\nDefinitely make that move it all sounds very logical to me good question I ride Derek with us in Phoenix, Arizona Hi Derek welcome to the day Ramsey\nShow ... donors honor to talk to you then you too sir how can I help\nYou while you're talking to money make over ... ah just changed our lives I got it as a wedding gift and it was the best wedding gift we implement

somebody cheaper and fifty two thousand dollars a year to work in the back off a ship and stuff\nWould that be the best route to go as well at least ten okay you walk away from fifty in order to do a job you could have hired somebody for twenty to do that ... short\nWell she she grows says she's gross two hundred ten thousand so far this year\nI don't care what your groceries okay unless you're\nGoing to add more to her business in savings okay or in revenue than what you are making now then it's not making sense okay 'cause grossing two hundred and ten is fine as long as your expenses aren't three hundred and ten\nNo yeah\nShe's got costs of goods sold out of that that's not profit we're talking about there\nYeah ... is a is around a hundred thousand out of that\nShe's going to have taxable income of a hundred K. and she needs somebody to do are shipping\nShe needs a lot of help she's we're working to fulltime jobs that were working from eight AM to ten eleven

chance to sit down and chat with McChrystal in one of the things I asked him with some of the different challenges that leaders may face now than they did ten or Fifteen Years ago\nI think it's extraordinarily more complex than it's ever been and and so what happens is leaders often confuse celebrity\nWith leadership or\nYou know having a a mouthpiece for real leadership and show what they can do is they can reach a lot of followers they can get people to respond to a certain way and anger or joy or or that sort of thing and that is a form of leadership and I\nI wouldn't deny it that is getting a connection with people and and causing a reaction almost a chemical reaction\nBut real leadership or let me put it this way leadership that I think is truly effective is sustainable over time it builds other leaders it develops in a population or groups a set of values to set of\nSustainable consistent a commitment to something and I think that that is sometimes missing in today's

are here open phones that triple eight eight to five five two to five\nThat's AAA eight to five five two to five Peter starts off this hour in Gainesville, Florida Hi Peter how are you\nI'm doing welfare how are you better than I deserve what's up\nGood thank you have meant that I got a follow up on all the millionaire if that worked at all and then um\nBut I just want to let you know I Am an avid listener and I can't believe I'm finding myself in that situation a little background a while back I was entering my apartment complex and found the gate shutting down my vehicle and cracked my relationship\nI I tried to collect from the complex for the damages caused to my vehicle and from there were contacted by Democrats and seven hundred and Seventy five dollars to pay for the gate that close by my vehicle\nUm come back and forth conversation I automatically refusing to pay them just because there's no indication of what it was close et cetera et cetera I thought everything was clear after I stopped sharing from them and this week I got a call from a collection agency I'm just wondering if with by\nHer attorney what's that hire an attorney for seven hundred and Seventy five dollars worth of damage it yep okay what about do you think that small claims court could be an option yep\nBut I I'm ... and I think if you hire an attorney for a couple of hundred dollars and they write them a letter or you might shut this whole thing down I don't know that you don't have to go to small claims court\nOkay and so I mean I mean conversation with the a collection agency cracked it has nothing in the army I'm like\nOh yes it does they still on that and they're the ones that hard to collections agency I Would sue I I Wish I knew they weren't my complex\nOkay for I Am empowered as well just come back on the part that goes on you think my my next Monday to talk to the train and be in contact with the um with the apartment complex and no way could I could write a check for this a collection agency\nOr if you think that the gate closed improperly and you weren't doing anything wrong and the stupid thing broke your car they need to fix your car and not charge you for the gate right right that's what you're telling me and if that's the case um you know\nA letter from an attorney may solved the whole thing uh but they're not scared of you obviously\nOr shall we need to get someone that gets their attention because basically you're getting run down by a corporate ladder here uh\nThe tension because basically you're getting run down I ... a corporate ladder here uh this is probably a corporate owned or ... owned apartment complexes being quote unquote professionally managed\nAnd so you're not dealing with a mom and pop you just got stuck in the vortex here and the only way to jog that out is shock somebody and so yeah I mean that you're going to write a check 'em you might as well decide which one you want to write you want to write a check for a gate that broke that wasn't your fault or do you want to write a check for justice\nMe I like a good fight 'em a hillbilly so I'd rather just fight\nI really would I mean I'll spend I spend a million dollars completely destroying something rather than spend ten dollars to keep from doing the wrong thing it just drives me bananas I Can't stand it Josh is with us in Chicago hey Josh how are you\nTo the question is from Brenda in Colorado a she comes to Dave Ramsey dot com and says is dental insurance for my kid I was a gimmick or something I should keep paying don't or insurance is one of the most easy insurance was to figure out that they're charging you more than you are getting\nUm we've had dental insurance proposed to us as a a a employee benefits several times and it's really simple when you add up what you pay for it in a year you would never spend that much on dentistry\nIt just doesn't work out it's one of those things you should self insure through now we do have an advertiser that is with us that is\nA a dental discount company and that is worth it\nBecause that helps you get discounts on me or dental repairs or dental work and so forth and um you know you can check them out as well you can find them on our website one dental is what it's called one dental\nAnd er James just helped me 'cause I was looking at him my brain wasn't were firing and I couldn't remember are great people to have gotten to know the\nOne dental when it's a discount program for dental services now that it was worth it and we do that but we've had done to insurance attempt advertiser many times and we just simply don't let them Christine is with us from Hartford, Connecticut Hi Christine how are you\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOh my goodness longtime listener and just so excited never called before [noise] so um my husband and I are get free\nIncluding our house way to go\nWell thank you for your teaching we followed them off and we are actually we're everyday millionaires island teacher here nitrogen\nAnd um so we we've been in that thing away that you recommend and you don't get out of curiosity we finally decided to meet with Neil ... we went online and found on what your your site recommend\nThey may know more about power over investing\nYeah okay yeah yeah or if I'm smart Dr ... thank you okay um and we met with him and very I had a lot of information for us\nAnd then you know the the structure is like a ... percent mhm I guess and so when my husband and I didn't know is simply then and that's the way that you teach since we then you know we both are blessed to have pensions\nWe have you know we're only an arcade theaters and we ... we could retire and five years you don't have to but we we couldn't be comfortable um what what is still makes sense to hire\nUm a financial person for a year at you know whatever I think it's like five thousand dollars a year because they go on a five point five percent of what you're\nActually they're lucky they're proposing a ... a managed to count for you correct OK yeah a lot of the industry has gone to the managed to counter approach and uh so the question is what do you get for your money that's what you come ...\nAnd I'm anytime you're investing in when I'm investing by the way my personal money's invested with one of our smart rushed her approach okay\nUm and so the there's two ways to do investing in mutual funds upfront fees\nOr that as you do the investment they charge a fee and then there's very low almost no\nAnnual after that or they managed to count worry it's a percentage of the ballots every year\nAnd what are you getting for that while they're helping you select the funds and putting you in funds that are out performing the market overall um you know ... over a long period of time over average you know funds that outperform the U.S and the and of course you've got someone to meet with uncover anytime there's a question about anything\nI'm a if there's a change in the market and you're worried about it or up or down um anything along those lines and there's tons of studies that say that\nYou will come out ahead doing those two things one is getting good advice and picking the proper funds and to a you know just not jumping off the ledge every time somebody comes on the news and freaks out you're probably not already not doing that one\nWhere we live in I mean I like to do every day you know you've got that Dali and you're not going to jump off the roller coaster and get hurt you know so who are out that that part\nOf the roller coaster and get hurt you know so who are out that that part of stuff so you know the thing is just asked them to show you okay why are you worse what is your charging\nAnd you know because you're charging me of the worst that uh and in most cases you'll find it is\nThat right there you're going to make more than the cost of the fee\nIn extra returns and certainly in services in terms of um you know education is available to you and\nUm you know there's eight thousand mutual funds to go through I don't keep up with eight thousand mutual funds I have a day job you know and so a a a life you know I don't want to do that but those guys that's all they do all day long comb through those funds\nIt's the whole world they eat live and breathe that stuff and it's I also don't work on my own car\nOr I could probably fix my car cheaper than the mechanic fix it\nBut it would take me longer or there'd be several trials and errors along the way I might break something in the process\nAnd so it's worth it to me to get somebody to hook the computer up to the car that actually has the computer that hooks up to the guards instead of me being a redneck laying on the hood trying to figure this out\nAnd it's kind of like you know investments I don't the why those either um I don't even do my own taxes are and I'm pretty good at this stuff it's what I Do I'm a money guy and got a natural for math and all that kind of stuff but\nI don't why when it gets into the ... the but you know the dirty details so to speak so that's why I think you're going to find the investment is worth that they managed account is worth it but I it's fair to ask them to show you\nGot it the typical guy does this or you've been doing this over here but if you had been with us during that same period of time here's what we would have had you and here's what the ... and it you know what am I knew one and a half percent more would cost or half a percent street an editor for one that kind of a thing um it's a fair question to say hey prove your worth\nAnd uh I don't think any smart Mr pro that we have would um\nTell you that that they can't do that um that they all obviously all believe that they can and then just asking show you the question Alex is with us from Charlotte North Carolina Hi Alex welcome to the day Ramsey shout\nAt night or during the day\nBetter than I deserve Sarah what's up\nUh I got a question or maybe a better course or Gary Coleman but about my career uh I'm currently and by that\nAnd I'm a welder I work out of town and I'm Mike around a hundred and forty thousand a year mhm and um I've got opportunity to go work at home but the pay is about a\nThird of water on my working out of town and I'm curious if he thought it was crazy to take a job that I'm I'm not married yet I'm getting married and I am on\nYou're making a hundred and forty and you'd make like fifty\nYeah OK at home um my aunt where are you where are you working out of town\nA member going on now I sit down and we're we're on I'm On my own hand they own market right now I'm On\n... anything other than a flower mhm mhm\nOkay well I think the answer for me would always be see none of the above I I liked the idea of coming off the road I don't like the idea of a two thirds pay cut so I got to figure out now and I don't either how can I come off the road and make more money\nWhat am I gotta do to make more money off the road or can I Do some kind of a mix and say I'm going to be gone two weekends a month and a and go to ... there's some OT out on the road that way and pick up some serious change as until but is there is there a pass a career paths\nAt home or whether it's owning your own shop or a you know I don't know run running a different kind of a ... a different way of doing this rather than just saying a\nJ. O. B. at home versus a road jobs is there another way to do this and that's that's what I'm going to be the rocks I'm going to be turning over and looking\nFor is to how to do that and um you know where do I want to be one I'm forty and will be on the road [noise] you don't want to be on the road already you told me that getting married I don't blame you I think it's a good idea will be home with a
