O. dot com [noise]\nUSA radio news on friday Senator Jeff flake told reporters he has a yes vote on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's nomination flake did tell reporters that was a difficult decision for everybody\nThe White House has been in contact with senators who are still undecided mainly Susan Collins and Senator Joe Manchin who both voted yes earlier today White House press secretary Sarah Sanders and what the White House is doing\nWe're going to continue our we've been in constant contact with a number of senators and since this process began and we're going to continue to Africa right up until the last minute because it's just such an important moment\nA multiple murder suspect in Tennessee has been taken in the city following a seven day manhunt investigators early on friday said they were closing in on Kirby Wallace using helicopters and dogs after he was spotted for third time\nWallace ended up being arrested a short time later near a wooded area you're listening to USA radio news\nThis time to find a venture on every dry with ... you get complete protection for ... performance and between October first in November thirtieth you'll get travel wars to help you on your journey with the purchase of any specialty motor oil change you can earn up to one hundred dollars to travel more credit save on hotel rental car activity\nAnd the dot com bust travel ought to find participating location\nMake the switch travel a lot of ...\nIt'd be like everything and it's been a lot I hear ya\nYeah so basically none of these bills the foreclosure are all the bills that he opened up and your name had been paid for years\nCorrect you haven't paid anything on them for years so there's really nothing on fire today that says you got to fall by friday right\n[noise] no the only a reader I'm considering it now because I I'm applying for other jobs that pay applying you know I lost my other one [noise]\nAnd um I have the possibility of getting hired at another company and I cannot guarantee saying they're starting reference checks and everything and everything else along like fair and\nThousand dollar loan from the bank\nAnd he doesn't have um attention he gets about teen hundred and some security and I'm I'm just wondering what what what can I Do\nAt this stage for him um I did provide hands I took over our bills and I did provide him with about five hundred dollars a week on like a debit card that for him to buy food\nAnd what are you doing with the rest of that I'm Sorry what are you doing with the rest of the money\nOh I'm paying all and I'm paying on his cell he still has about a K left on the equity loan ... two thousand on a credit card mhm eight thousand on a car and eight thousand on the house\nAnd how much are you able to put on the edge\n[noise] I'm putting everything\nWas a turning out to do everything on on that much money does that amount to what is it\nA month [noise] mhm\nI think it amounts to about a thousand a month\nAnd that's pretty good okay so he's got Fifteen and eight and two did I get that right\nIt it will have on the car eight on the house and she won a credit card\nOkay All right and it ... you know if you divide that about four thousand a month I think you're done and the year\nOkay and your first goal would be to get him debt free you're done with a better year right your ankles get him to free 'cause he's Seventy five years old and they still work in a steel plant that I understand that right yes that was going to come a moment and it'll come suddenly that he just can't do that\nAnd I'm afraid of yeah my prayer is at least that he gets through this year mhm and that way your debt free and if he's a hundred percent that free house and everything you can probably make it on a Social Security if you had to write okay not yeah\nNot ideal not what we want but we can probably get there\nAnd uh then the next step is if we get past that that'd be wonderful let's get debt free then let's build an emergency fund a three to six months of expenses but we get past that then let's start building some nest egg for retirement but the fastest way to build a nest egg for retirement is to clear that debt and to have that emergency fund and Bush\nAnd he is still the baby steps in other words\n[noise] okay that sounds good I'm asking is why a bank loan um [noise] um someone at his\nAge and the K and all you know four and a and\nTo be paid off and twenty forty three knowing that\nHe went and lived that long\nFor two reasons one is they're stupid and the second reason is is counting on the house I've got a lien against the house right well that's true\nAnd so the house will be sold upon his death and they would get their money or they can foreclose on that upon his death and they'll get their money they've got the collateral as part of it on and so that's part of the equation the other part of the question is you know asking a banker if you should borrow money is like asking a dog if it's hungry\nI mean they'll they'll loan anybody this breed that are not breathing money you know what I'm saying\n... has gotten completely out of control and stupid so there's nothing you know just because someone offers you alone does not mean that you are capable of paying the loan it just means you might be breathing\nOkay\nSo the industry is you're stupid is what it amounts to but uh so we have to protect ourselves from them offering us things because sometimes we will go oh they wouldn't have offered me this credit card if I couldn't afford it and it was like no they would've offered a dog that credit card\nSo I mean and dead people get credit card offers so it you know it doesn't mean anything doesn't even mean it doesn't mean you're not a dog and it doesn't mean you're alive\nIf you've got a credit card offer you could be a dead dog and get a credit card off or it can happen so I mean you could be that low on the deal so that that's what you got to think through and just you've got to take care of him and you are you're doing a really good job congratulations Tim is with us in Dayton, Ohio\nOr you're doing a really good job congratulations Tim is with us in Dayton, Ohio I tell him how are you\nOn the umpires have I got a record retirement okay\nUm did you hear about a year ... you know and I'm a ... ventures I don't have a four one K. all pretty good mhm I click here at fifty two would be better to file for Social Security and weight while before it touches on four one K. was\nTerminally ill or\nYou can run the mouse out [noise] but usually your rate of return on your four one K. on the mutual fund that money is growing at a faster rate than your Social Security check will grow if you delay it\nAnd that's the way you're comparing it say numbers of white from sixty three sixty five to start receiving it\nWill you know and what is the rate of return on that you know how much more do you get as a result and usually you get more in a mutual fund generally speaking um and then the other question comes up you know even if I don't need it should I take it\nUm and um I I you know if you're willing to live on less than you make in in a sense invest some or all of it um by not taking out your four one K. or by some other things than than usually comes out better to take it earlier uh but but you know there's a lot of different\nParts to that equation and you know if you know when you're going to die sure makes it easier to do the equation oh\nThat would definitely has [laughter] yeah so you got you got to kind of gas and you've got to say you know average death age of a male and the U.S is Seventy six averaged ... deaf I drove a female in the U.S is Seventy eight\nBut once you've lived to be sixty it's higher than that because that and those numbers include infant mortality include teenage death that kind of a thing and so you know if you're healthy sixty year old you got a real shot at Ninety\nAccording to the ... tables right now and so um that that's what you've got to walk through and think through in the process so good question man like you were joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five toddlers in New Hampshire I taught how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nWell um I I when I spoke to the lady she said I can ask your question and I just

shaving she wants to say more than that but she I'm she's always running the show and I've been kind of just kind of go along with her at this point um\nWe paid off to credit cards and we paid off on

gonna we're in agreement that we're going to work this plan together okay and once you do that then you're first gold you squeeze out of your budget as you say with thousand dollars if you've already got money saved\nThen we would save only a thousand dollars of it stop\nAll investing temporarily temporarily temporarily and then you move on to baby step two which is your debt snowball and that's

because I'm getting more and more in the style chick\nI was thinking this morning about the neighborhood I grew up in and\nYou know as you get older you don't remember the bad stuff all your does remember the good stuff and so it's very ideal like in your mind I it was an idea like neighborhood it was incredible is full of kids\nAnd we were always doing something you ever get a ... a piece of plywood out and put a couple of bricks up under it and go across it on your bike like evil can evil you were jumping and it didn't do well when you go over the handlebars I mean have you ever done stuff like that and we'd anymore how much\nI mean we played baseball we play football we spent a lot of time arguing about the call 'cause we we'd we'd always argue about whether somebody is out of bounds we played and played and played and played and played run in and out of each other's houses and one mom always have some lemonade one mom would always have some\nBaloney sandwiches I mean it was a great neighborhood\nAnd I remember being a little kid and some of the kids I played with started going to school I thought man\nI Want to go to school you know be cool to go to school when I can go to school I'll be happy than you ever thought that and and then I got to go to kindergarten and I thought man next year I'll be in a grade with a number on it\nI'll be happy then they teach you to read and the first grade I'll be happy then and when back\nWhen I went to school and I don't know where you go to school but I mean we had one through six was elementary school and and so you know you're about a second grader and all the sixth graders there the king of the hill right they own the school right\nAnd so you're like man I could just get in the sixth grade I'd be like the big dog on campus I'd be in charge I'd be though I'd be ruined the school man I'll be happy then then you finally get\nTo sixth grade and you know what you look over there and we had what we called junior high school and middle school which was\nSeven eight nine the school I went to and some man if I could just get out sixth grade and go over there in middle school you know they've got they've got P. E. they've got football they got cheerleaders\nCheerleaders they got lockers man if I could get over to middle school I'd be happy then you remember that\nAnd that was in middle school I got to be about the ninth grade and I was fourteen Fifteen Years old and one of my buddies got his driver's license\nAnd oh man if I could just get my driver's license that'd be free\nI could drive myself to McDonald's and we go through McDonald's I'll tell you how long ago it was we would go through the McDonald's drive through and we could get a Big Mac and a small coke for a buck sixteen\nAnd we were scratching together the ... the sixteen always you can scratch the bug with the sixteenth\nChilly here that are hitting me cats path right that can lead that money and continue contributing to their prepaid plan marches in there\n[noise] um about insects Hyundai\nEighty six hundred dollars on how much do you own your car\nWe attended advantage and what do you own your credit cards all five thousand\nOkay and um are you guys on a budget in reducing debt already\nWe started at ... and that's and I realized we did that and he's got that an orderly having that Peter Pan ... pan and then I don't know a ticket I\nGotcha okay I'm In your household income as well\n[noise] um has been explained high and I have a small business that brings in about twelve thousand a year\nOkay so about sixty thousand give or take All right um no I Would not cash would stop adding to it\nUm and um\nYou do need to get on a budget and follow through with what you're learning in financial ... University in just work your baby steps if you stop adding to its you'll be fine\nThe other thing I probably wouldn't do a norm urgency a no rush but sometime in the next year or two I Would probably take that money out of there and roll it into a five twenty nine plan in good mutual funds and here's why\nYou're much better off to save for college in a five twenty nine or an ESL and mutual funds than you are with prepaid college plants here is the reason anytime you ... pay something your rate of return is what it increases in price\n\nAnd so if I prepay a an item I pay a thousand dollars and increases in price\nTo twelve hundred dollars my rate of return if it did that in one year would be twenty percent so that'd be a nice rate of return right so how much of the increase in price because that's the only return when you ... pay anything they're not giving you an interest rate they're not giving your growth rate you simply or saving the increases in tuition\nBy paying it ahead of time that's all you're doing now\nTuition for the last Seventy odd years as average about seven point two percent\nInflation right\nSo that means you're making about seven point two percent on your money when you do prepaid college in a good growth stocks mutual fund you ought to be ten to fourteen percent\nAverage annual return over that same period of time minder and so on you make more\nBy putting it in and you actually get some headway towards college the other problem with prepaid college is\nA ... and it's a blanket statement but and it would vary from state to state many many many of the state's\nBusiness government are very poorly run and they screw up some of the prepaid college plans and the process I mean they're just horrible administrators now some states\nAre well run my state happens to be well run so in the state of Tennessee I wouldn't be\nConcerned today under the current administration with a with the stability of the ... still wouldn't do prepaid college even in Tennessee because of the other reason I was talking about I Want a better rate of return on my money than simply the inflation rate of tuition\nSo all of that to say a row you already six hundred bucks into a five twenty nine and a good mutual fund\nAt some point right now I just stop adding get yourself on a budget cranky lifestyle down stop going out to eat canceled the trip that you had planned to call to vacation because you're broken you've been spending more than you make and you have to stop that and that's how you got a car loan and credit card debt\nSo you're right on track you're doing the right kind of things and that's what I Would do if I were in your shoes Matthew's with us in Fort Worth Texas have map you how are ya\nI'm excellent uh want to thank you for ... for a a help stealing the recipe you for the last seven years we paid off over a hundred thousand dollars good for him would have been in bankruptcy had a had we not gone through a few while so ... to my
