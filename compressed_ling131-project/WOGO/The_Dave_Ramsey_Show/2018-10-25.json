mean it's not a deal breaker it's seven hundred and fifty dollars for the thing that Sharon and I did when we were looking at things like that was we would if we found one thing like that that we were going to not cut to hit our debt free go we had to find something else we were going to cut deeper\nOkay so like that means that if you are going to cheat and go out to eat once a month now you're not got ya or the if you thought you were going to do X now you're not and it's out jak instead we're doing select soccer\nUm and how many kids do you have three okay and is he the oldest or the youngest or he sold the oldest okay\nAll right and um well I mean you get yourself out of debt and the other kids as they come up and do you can do whatever you want to do right with them in terms of uh you know activities and sports and stuff you can afford to do all of that the thing that we decided was that all of this is for fun\nBecause um I mean Daniel my son played ice hockey all the way up through high school we knew at six years old he was not going to play on the trail\nRight we we're pretty sure at that point you know and a show we made decisions to invest in ice hockey to have fun right\nNot because we were trying to create a future career for him\nAnd that's why we went with the way that there are a couple of different options on the one we put Atlanta's less than half the cost of the other\nAnd we went with the way that there are a couple of different options and when we put him in as less than half the cost of the others yeah\nYou know and you know so parents go bananas on this stuff is my point and uh some of them you know there's been ten thousand bucks on whatever and you know in a sport that the kid is never going to go pro probably not even going to get a scholarship\nAnd all your does burn up the kid and a half your budget but seven hundred and fifty bucks is not the case that you're fine you know you just got to be but you do need to get what it does is it makes you stop and pause enough you called me that's pretty cool\nYeah he paused and he went crap I can think about this and so you know just try to find you a trade off to innocence pay for it\nI've done the everyday dollar budget and we're like forty seven dollars I'm not over budget as things stand now\nUm we had back in January we had an identity theft going on in our account and that that it is almost I think twelve to Fifteen hundred dollars in the ...\nThat the bank to bar overdraft this to so that really does\nI mean why why did the bank charge you anything if there was a ...\n... well it was um and that was charged to our account\nI Know but if it's identity theft or bank shouldn't be charging you anything\nWell they did and they said there was nothing they can do about it\nA lot can change banks\nYeah we did okay wait we actually closed banking and we just have a debit card that um it's like one of those little Walmart origin so we don't even go straight to buy anymore mhm it's just a debit card but um they charge us\nLike six nearby six hundred dollars and overdraft mhm and they wouldn't take them back mhm but I'm\nHere in that time because that was going on a weekend hand\nOn our house payment and I'm ... thanks for the smaller next that we had well without the smaller nights but we're still have a hand on our house opt out to the housing loan people and they're working with is\nThat we're having to pay extra a month on our mortgage payment\nSure how old are you guys\nFifty nine so I'm fifty nine and a thick the mom Seventy nine or something\nOr you guys on some kind of a fixed income for some reason\nThe disability out three other\nAnd none of you were able to work\nYou know I Do a little side business with crafts and things like that\nWhat is the nature of your disability\nUm man is a hip displacement what's wrong with him\nUm he had um a as a and broke his back uh-huh and he has a um\nA piece of the bone sticking close to his nerves that mhm and he also had a triple bypass surgery a few years ago when he has a defeat the later and mhm he's got like twenty five percent of his heart beating so\nMhm okay um\nWell what what you guys have more than anything else is an income crisis right due to the fixed income and that's why I was exploring the question that does sound like you've got some pretty serious limitations\nUm but what I'm going to do if I'm In your shoes is what you're kind of started doing there with the crowd\nAnd even in his shoes are obviously none of you all are going to be involved in physical labor of any kind right on crime but if there was something that you could do like I talked to a lady the other day who was just going to garage sales and she was buying clothing for a quarter and a nickel\nAnd selling it on ... for a dollar and two dollars ... she had done that like ten thousand times and made like ten thousand dollars mhm okay and that doesn't involve\nAny heavy lifting obviously and involve the keystrokes on the computer to set up an ... account and sell some stuff on ... but I'm not saying that's what you do I'm just saying that something like that that is\nThat that that is in the line with the limitations that you guys have because if we can add a thousand dollars a month only your world it would change your life\nMhm wouldn't it it really I guess or will\nBe dramatic and how old is mom\nMom is Seventy nine\nAnd how much of this thirty four forty two comes from her\nEleven forty seven yeah\nShe passes away your got a real problem\nCorrect\nSo we've got to solve some of the income issue one way or another here um and how much is your house payment\nUm they were four Seventy eight they've increased it faster\nThan it was that's one of those on your nails that's just due to taxes and insurance going up\nYou know and what's the home worse oh it's\n... yeah ... and what's the home worse [noise]\nOh it's a hundred and an honor why oh why don't we\nDon't want to go in the ... yeah well I sure would be good when you know so\nI think more than anything the the the magic wand here is some kind of an idea for you to create some income and I don't know what that is but I Want the three of you to sit around and talk about what you could do a ... you're obviously not going to do anything this physical\nI get that you got some serious limitations I understand that and I'm not picking on you know I'm just trying to help you uh but man a thousand dollars a month would change your whole life\nThousand dollars a month for a year and you pay the house off\nAnd that'd be rid of that payment and then when mom passes you're not in a problem and right now you being a serious problem two thousand dollars a month income change\nYou'd feel like you were rich like you were a multi millionaires or something it would change your life that much\nAnd so in is that possible yes that is possible\nIt's very possible but you need some income ideas some things you can do jump and it's probably something you jump on the computer and sell something or\nWhatever it and again it doesn't I don't want to put a bunch of strain on you physically but um you know I'm having an intelligent conversation with you over the phone so you could have an intelligent conversation with somebody on the phone sell them something\nRight and that that's a possible thing you can do um the you know and it doesn't cause you to\nWork forty hours a week necessarily but if you can do anything that creates a thousand two thousand dollars a month that would change your world and that's that's really what I Would work on rather than try to solve the forty seven dollar problem\nThat you've got what that is a symptomatic of the fact that you're struggling with income and legitimately ... your struggle it's my pleasure lazy or something like that but it just hand\nIf you could come up with any kind of a small business idea that your husband than you could do together um and just get them to get the needle to move a little bit here man it would change everything for you I thank you for the call\nOpen phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Benjamin is in Oklahoma City Hi Benjamin how are you\nToday how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so my wife and I graduated college about a little over a year ago and we got a good job\nGood and bought a house good and I'm Wondering in your eyes or their dad what are we paid it off about ... ...\nOr more in your eyes or your parents when from a financial perspective is a good time to start thinking about having kids 'cause she thought life kind of pushy and you know that it I'm sure mhm ah so I just wanted to get your thoughts on it\nNow I was really the one on a kids' fresh with insurance ... she won but I'm\nA I I don't think that there's a financial manager other than just being completely crazy like if you don't have sixteen kids if you're broke that stupid okay that was crazy but you guys are in great shape your sharp young couple whenever you're ... whenever you're emotionally in relation to ready to have kids and God says it's okay to have kids\nGo have kids I I don't I don't tell people that need to be out of debt and have their emergency when there's not a baby step for kids\nUm you know you don't have to be a certain place you're going to be fine a child is not going to destroy your life financially or as a matter of fact you probably won't even hardly notice\nEverybody talks about oh ... five hundred and sixty two thousand dollars to raise you out really not really they eat the same broccoli you eat after a certain point\nThere in early in the same warm house you're already in after a certain point and so the actual cost of a kid is just not that it's not devastating\nBut again you don't want to just load up a whole house full of them if you're broke and that that will cause a problem but to decide to have your first couple of children\nI mean it's that's not something that's between you and God and your wife and you guys are in good shape financially smart you're already moving in the right direction

dollars in taxes mhm now I Want to take half my emergency fund\nAnd put it into that account because I might not reached a thirty six thousand just gosh blowing it out my salary\nMhm lord of the penalties for\nWithdrawing or should I Do that one of the penalties for withdrawing I don't read for what you're\nYeah it's about fifty for a ... percent on taxes are but I I really don't need\nAnd fire emergency fund I currently have thirty thousand I'm I'm thinking thinking fifty thousand and put it to that I can rebuild my retirement my emergency founded about three months\nIf you don't need it why would you rebuild it\n\nI mean I don't have to have all the thirty thousand I just built it because I feel very comfortable with having a cushion right and what is your income a year\n\nAbout a hundred and sixty\nOkay so what is three to six months of expenses\n\nIt is about to join the three thousand\nOkay that would be a three ... that'd be three months or six months\nThat will be fifth month\nOkay right so you can be within the range of three to six months of expenses at Fifteen thousand and um if you want to use some of that money that's fine and if you want to build it back up to six months later that's fine but it doesn't sound like you need more than twenty five thousand ever in your emergency fund\nYes but I'm not a citizen here I'm also not a U.S citizen I'm\nI work here on my now ex patriot and I just feel more comfortable because if I Need to leave the country I have about sixty days to get all my first and order a healthy\nMhm\nOkay so you're just going to keep a little extra well so what happened and that's why I feel more happens if that ... that event occurs while you're down on cash because you funded this thing\n\nSo it's very unlikely um I just received a new role and at least for the next two years I'm probably very safe at my work life\nMhm yeah\nWell the thing is is here here's what's bothering me is the proper amount to have in your emergency fund there's thirty thousand dollars than the answer is no don't drain it down because this is not an emergency you use emergency funds for emergencies period if the proper\nAmount of having your emergency fund which means you should end up there is Fifteen thousand twenty thousand then don't have more than that later\nSo you decided what the proper amount in an emergency fund is when all the smoke clears but don't tell me you're using your emergency fund to fund this and then you're going to put it back which tells me you don't agree you know you've got your mind the proper miles thirty grand I think is what you're saying and so the answer is no don't put the money in retirement\nDon't use your emergency money to do that but if you're willing to reassess your emergency phone and say I've got this thing over funded I'm going to back down in the twenty range than I might go ahead and do this deal\nA because we're not there but but if you think you need to keep thirty thousand dollars around for emergencies didn't keep thirty thousand dollars around for emergencies\nAnd don't monkey with it as a merchant ships on this is is foundational before you move on to investing of any comment so you got to decide your definition that's what I was poking around on I'm trying to figure out what you really need slash one and it sounds like emotionally given the unusual situation that you're in you want to keep thirty grand around\nAnd so you should keep thirty grand around\nSets it don't mess with that but if not if you're going to permanently lower it then use some of that money to do this then hey I'm just fine with that a cage is with us in Salt Lake City Hi cage how are you\nHey Dave how's it going\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nAnd thanks for taking my call today I'm I'm a college student I'm two semesters away from graduating with my bachelor's degree in finance um but the more that I go through school and the more than I listen to you it makes me want to I'm really make a living being a financial ... many years ago and still here today [noise]\nUm so I was just wondering I wanted to get your advice on whether you think it still possible or somebody like me to to run the type of business that may be your advice dawn ... model to maximize success on the early going up starting\nOkay well the um you know see based financial coaching where you pay someone pays you will see just to sit down and do one on one coaching which we do some here and we ... we we have a program where we certify people to do that that comes to our training to do that\nIs it's difficult to make a living exclusively doing that uh because\nIs it's difficult to make a living exclusively doing that\nUh because it's it's very much uh the inventory is your hours in the day and you have to sell enough of your hours and the day for enough money to equal a good living\nAnd it can be done but are coming straight out of school difficult to do\nI'm not saying that can't be done but I'm just saying it's not it's not a slam dunk okay it's not maybe a thousand or your job your first two years out\nIt's going to take you a while to build up the thing you could do is you could go into the financial services world like on the brokerage side and work with someone like one of our smart Mr prose as an example and those guys are in the business gals run the business of selling investments\nAnd there's nothing there's there's nothing that preempts you as a matter of fact that it's almost paramount that you do coach people while you're selling them an investment so that they don't get into the wrong investment you're teaching them you're helping them make decisions\nBut in the process of doing that then you know you're making a commission and there's nothing wrong with that it's like when you're showing some on a home you're coaching them into this house was gonna you know it's going to be pretty you know based on your income is those are really out of your ranger coaching someone if you're a realtor and telling them that you're in a sense your financial coaching them\nAnd so but you get paid a commission when they buy a house\nAnd so uh you know this idea that some people have that everybody gets credit commission has a conflict of interest and keeps them from doing the right thing by their clients is absolutely absurd there's plenty of people on strike commission with high levels of integrity that do the right thing so you might explore that angle\nBecause truthfully you can make more doing that\nThen you can just\nDoing a book billing by the hour and I'm not saying making more as the whole answer but you know as a as a young guy coming straight out of school as a financial coach you probably don't have to get a little bit of miles on your before people are going to trust you\nYou know I could be I mean there's some people trust you and if you're really good you know you're no you're stuff than you'll you'll get business but ah I'm just saying it's it's a tough road\nTo just do what we did back in the day and it's one of the reasons is not is one reason we quit doing that as our exclusively but we did\nYou know we started doing events we start having a class where we started\nDoing other stuff to go with it um because it's difficult to make a scale up when there's only so many hours in the day you can fill out an hourly rate open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five Amy is on Facebook dot coms life day Ramsey\nThey do you put all of your rental properties into an L.
