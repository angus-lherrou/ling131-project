definitely given us except on a mortgage on your home is a taxable income and they likely will send you a ten Ninety nine for the amount that day for gays oh okay so what's your household

in a twenty percent tax bracket and you had a thousand dollars in forgiveness that didn't cost you a thousand dollars and only costs you two hundred dollars\nRight\nAnd so it's still a good deal but your yeah your I have about two hundred dollars per thousand so that is forgiven that'll hit your taxes if they ten Ninety nine you\nIf they don't you have no obligation to list it and I would just wait until you know they do that if they follow through on that but at the end the larger the forgiveness is the more likely they will follow through with a ten Ninety nine\nAnd send you that but as you get that then you will do the taxes so\nYeah I'd I'd get ready for some taxes at tax time that I'm by April ... you know that you may have\nAnd in addition to that now if you had a larger return

arrived in the wrong way and and so it wouldn't help your next time so I'm you know I started asking myself okay you know ten years from now when these kids are our early teens\nKnow where you could get pre approved and have a lien against\nYour house for a certain amount of money and that's a line of credit home equity line of credit means you're pledged your house for that line of credit\nUm and this is a method of getting a second mortgage on your home basically a show or is it worth having or should I avoid it will die and we tell folks to avoid that\nWe tried to take it the other way we went through to get rid of your he lock your home equity line of credit if you have one woman should get reverse mortgage if you have one we want you to get out of debt because when you don't have any payments you know what you have money\nThe bar or a slave to the lender so now we don't recommend home equity lines of credit and bar Paul is on Facebook is there a mileage limit your use as a rule of thumb when buying a used car\nUm\nKnow what I'm trying to determine is is the core worn out to the point it's going to give me trouble so the more inexpensive and cheaply made the car is the more the miles would affect it\nIn other words a hundred thousand miles dodge neon would be different than a hundred thousand miles Mercedes\nLike one is used up and the other one is just getting started\nAt that point you know what I'm saying the ... is really tired under the hood of that neon at that point I don't even know they still make a dodge neon but you get my point the cheap little dinky but car I mean you got a hundred thousand miles smart car that's called dom okay\nIt's not called smart anymore so I'll just give you that example so no chance I Want that thing\nBut if you got a car that's built let's say a higher in nicer vehicle or they're typically well built I mean ... again a Honda Lexus a Mercedes a beamer a Cadillac um\nThe larger body Ford products for just building a great product a truck\nA Chevy Truck for truck with a hundred thousand miles on that one thing about that it's got easily another hundred and it may be another three hundred and it depends on how you took care of it and what you were driving and that kind of thing\nUm but I I wouldn't think anything about that at all uh again that we can depends on your budget and how nice car you want obviously the least miles or the last used car I bought was a raptor at Nineteen thousand miles on when I bought it I drove until I got about sixty or know got got about fifty something on it and um\nSo I was a very low my car when I got rid of it the other day\nAnd um\nSo you know you just you're looking at your situation to what is the um what is your situation and what can you do but generally speaking the\nThe I'm more of an economy car it is quote unquote the ah the more than ... miles would have a negative effect on it\nUm because I'm just I'm just really don't know how to do them all and looking for is dependability and how much life has left in it it's a cool question very interesting Dustin is with us in St Louis Hi Dustin\nHow are you for taking my call Sherman what's up\nI'm standing on a high school senior I'm got about three thousand dollars and I mean the count out donating should I and that and I knew what China and\nYou're going to college\nHere a community college within a program in St Louis and the olive tree\nOkay so you're only going to do two years\nAnd then ending on how the program ... maybe ... service maturity and I keep them at the community college of either and you know our first\nYeah you know I Will be true if you get some search someone certifications and stuff and not the four year degree might not even be a wise investment I agree with that\nCrime so that's what you want to do you won't be programmer or you want to be an hour or whatever [laughter] okay uh and the community college is paid for as long as you keep an eye plus\nUm you can invest it or here's the thing I always tell folks at your age I'm I'm much more concerned that you complete all of your educational goals with no debt than I Am whether you have an investment mutual fund\nLike on a scale of one to ten and a nine point nine\nFinish college and all your education was the road that so if there was a bump in the road in your little plan you might need some money to finish your schooling and that's much much you dust and is a better investment than a mutual fund is assuming you're studying something like you're talking about studying which is a very usable\nField of study that you can you know really make some good money and and the you know getting that level of education is really gonna cause your income to go be a lot a lot higher than if you didn't have that education so um you know you're the best investment we can make\nMuch better than a mutual fund I like mutual funds and I you know may I talk about um all the time so if you want to invest some of it into a mutual fund that's fine I Would not put it in a retirement account to stage\nA with this amount of money in your situation because again\nStage uh with this amount of money in your situation because again my main\nGoal for you is your friend is for you to get your degree and your field of study whether it's a two year whether it's certifications and the ... tech field or or whether it's a four year degree my main goal for you is to give you the tools in your belt the educational tools in your belt for you to be able to deliver your dream\nWithout any of that and that three thousand dollar spent on that is more important than than the mutual fund the show if you put it in a mutual fund and you run into a bump don't be afraid to take it out\nAnd use it for college if you're going to go that route [noise] if you need to thanks for calling open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Mike is in Chicago Hi Mike how are you\nI'm Gray Davis an honor to speak with you you too sir what's up in your world\nDon't my wife and I are currently on baby step forward type of cooking for retirement and we're using the access our budget to pay off our mortgage early cool and we're both teachers and the state run pension pay nine percent of our gross take home pay\nOur dilemma is when we say an extra Fifteen Percent on top of that nine percent that we already contribute we don't have much left over from all agree to fill ration so when we say the earth that\nWe're able to save a lot for a mortgage celebration or is it okay to do that oil recommend saving their twenty four\nPercent now they they mandatory amount that you're putting in our ... are you vested in that is that uh uh you're choosing an investment for that or is that a pension\nGet the ... and there's no options yeah it's it's mandatory its pension and you don't have control of it right and when you leave you can't take it with you correct that the weight on sixty seven or okay uh and it's nine percent nine percent\nYeah okay so the the equation is do we put Fifteen on top of that or do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct correct I probably would split the difference\nBecause I don't like the pension we're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be you don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run through its horribly wrong state\nAnd now we're better than all those guys [laughter] huh yea no thank you so uh but what I count some of it yeah some of it I'm not going to count it as a whole new line what if we counted it as a four or five\nIf we can do this before then that means we need to put it in ten percent\nRight you got a million that you don't have a choice but I'm saying if we because we don't have a lot of faith in it I don't like it but it's there and we'll probably get some odd but I mean likelihood is I'm not predicting the failure of the teachers pension in Illinois it's just horribly run and if it was ever going to fail anywhere to be there\nYou know so um that that that's the truth and you know that show a given that let's just let's give it a fifty percent hit\nOr so and just round numbers let's put in ten percent instead of putting in Fifteen Percent on top or something like that not only are celebrate your mortgage a little bit I'm not going to be perfect but it was a little bit more to get that way and you can go that direction so I'm\nYou know to do it\nThat that's that's what I Would I back off a little
