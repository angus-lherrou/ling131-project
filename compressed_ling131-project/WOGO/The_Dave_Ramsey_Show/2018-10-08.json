who is very abusive and um I mean the kids well um [noise] he had any fires from my full time job\nUm that house got foreclosed on Iran's up a ton of debt on my credit card and mining um so I have\nJudgment on my credit now a collection call out the law do um I like I say he enemy fire from my full time job all I can get right now is a part time job that barely Howard says the basic living and says\nOh I have no way that you know start paying off the debt ... yeah\nAnd it was like okay I'm Sorry the I'm Sorry you've been through this sounds like you've been through ...\nAbout the second okay All right I'm Sorry the I'm Sorry you've been through this sounds like you've been through hell I'm so when did you leave your fulltime job\nThan a couple of years now and ... yeah I haven't been able to find anything else comparable to what I did [noise] um and I\nWill you let me tell you you're emotionally not pass that because you're the way you're describing it it sounded like it happened yesterday\nYeah I mean it\nUsed to live and you're living in the abuse aren't you\nIn your head\nYeah I mean my kids and I we we weren't homeless for a while we we just know that there are a lot and I read he tried to cut the other day I might have had to go to court trying to deal with everything and it's been a lot\nI hear ya yeah so basically none of these bills the foreclosure are all the bills that he opened up and your name have been paid for years\nCorrect you haven't paid anything on them for years or so there's really nothing on fire today that says you got to fall by friday right\n[noise] no the only I'm only considering it now because I'm I'm applying for other jobs that pay applying you know I lost my other one [noise] and um I have a possibility of getting hired at another\nCompany and I get on there every day there's got to reference ... everything and everything else along with my parents\nAnd he doesn't have them attention he gets about Fifteen hundred\nAnd some security and I'm I'm just wondering what what what can I Do at this stage for him um I Do provide hands I took over all the bills\nAnd I did provide him with about five hundred dollars a week on like a debit card that for him to buy food\nAnd what are you doing with the rest of that I'm Sorry what are you doing with the rest of the money\nOh I'm paying all and I'm paying all his self he still has about a ... in K left on the equity alone ... two thousand on a credit card mhm eight thousand on a car and eight thousand on the house\nAnd how much are you able to put on the edge [noise] I'm putting everything was a turning out to do everything on on that much money does that amount to what is it\nA month [noise] mhm\nI think it amounts to about a thousand a month\nAnd that's pretty good okay so he's got Fifteen and eight and two did I get that right\nIt all on the car eight on the house and she won a credit card\nOkay All right and I do you know if you divide that about four thousand a month I think you're done and the year okay and your first goal would be to get him debt free you're done with a dead an ear right rankles\nGet him to free 'cause he's Seventy five years old and they're still working at a steel plant that I understand that right\nYeah so there's going to come a moment and it'll come suddenly that he just can't do that\nAnd I'm afraid of you know my prayer is at least that he gets through this year mhm and that way your debt free and if he's a hundred percent debt free house and everything you can probably make it on his Social Security if you had to write okay not yeah\nNot ideal not what we want but we can probably get there\nAnd uh then the next step is if we get past that that'd be wonderful let's get debt free then let's build an emergency fund a three to six months of expenses but we get past that then let's start building some nest egg for retirement but the fastest way to build a nest egg for retirement is to clear that debt and to have that emerges from unemployed\nAnd is still the baby steps in other words\n[noise] okay that sounds good well I'm asking is why a bank loan um someone at his age K. and all you know four and a and that to be paid off and twenty forty three and knowing that\nHe wouldn't want to\nLive that long\nWell two reasons one is they're stupid\nAnd the second reason is is they're counting on the house I've got a lien against the house right well that's true\nAnd so the house will be sold upon his death and they would get their money or they can foreclose on that upon his death and they'll get their money they've got the collateral as part of it on and so that's part of the equation the other part of the question is you know asking a bank or if you should borrow money is like asking a dog if it's hungry\nI mean they'll they'll loan anybody to breathe or not breathing money you know what I'm saying\nThe lending has gotten completely out of control and stupid so there's not\nAnd you know what I'm saying the lending has gotten completely out of control and stupid so there's nothing you know just because someone offers you alone does not mean that you are capable of paying the loan it just means you might be breathing\nAnd ... and so the industry is you're stupid is what it amounts to but uh so we have to protect ourselves from them offering us things because sometimes people go oh they wouldn't have offered me this credit card if I couldn't afford it and it's like no they would've offered a dog that credit card\nSo I mean in dead people get credit card offers show is you know it doesn't mean anything doesn't even mean it doesn't mean you're not a dog and it doesn't mean you're alive\nIf you've got a credit card offer you could be a dead dog and get a credit card off or it can happen so I mean you could be that low on the deal so that that's what you got to think through and just you've got to take care of him and you are you're doing a really good job congratulations Tim is with us in Dayton, Ohio I tell him how are you\nOn the umpires have I got ... retirement okay um did you hear about a year ... and um I have a French and then I'll have a four weekends off of a pretty good mhm\nI click of a ... to be better to file for Social Security and weight while before it goes on before we have for the whole entire movie or\nYou can run the mouse out [noise] but usually your rate of return on your four O. one K. on the mutual fund that money is growing at a faster rate than your Social Security check will grow if you delay it\nAnd that's the way you're comparing it to say no words if you're white from sixty three sixty five to start receiving it\nWill you know what is the rate of return on that you know how much more do you get as a result and usually you get more in a mutual fund generally speaking um and then the other question comes of you know even if I don't need it should I take it\nUm and uh I I you know if you're willing to live on less than you make in in a sense invest some or all of it um by not taking after four one K. or by some other things than than usually comes out better to take it earlier uh but but you know there's a lot of different\nParts to that equation and you know if you know when you're going to die sure makes it easier to do the equation oh\nThat would definitely [laughter] yeah so you got you got to kind of gas and you got to say you know average death age of a male and the U.S is Seventy six averaged ... deaf age of a female in the U.S is Seventy eight\nBut once you've lived to be sixty it's higher than that because that those numbers include infant mortality include teenage death that kind of a thing and so you know if you're healthy sixty year old you got a real shot at Ninety\nAccording to the stat tables right now and so um that that's what you've got to walk through and think through in the process so good question ma'am thank you for joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five taught as in New Hampshire I taught how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you\nBetter than I deserve how can I help\nUm I Wish I when I spoke to the lady she said I could ask you a

twenty you said okay so what are you thinking about ten Fifteen around there and how long you plan on living there\nIs ...\nWe want to take her two young children to Disney World you're should\nWe're currently saving to build her on a new home on property we bought in cash already we can cash flow the trip by not saving for the house for one month about three thousand dollars I feel guilty for both not taking a family vacation and for not saving money where's the balance you you're guilty lot aren't you\nI mean you're stuck because you're just going to be guilty you're guilty if you go to Disney and you're going to be guilty if you don't\nYou know what I Do I'd be happy if I did either one of them are guilty either way it's your money it's your choice you're smart either way you're out of debt you have your emergency fund and you're saving up for expenditures\nOne of the expenditures as you want to build a house for cash that some awesome go second one is you want to spend one month of that money and go to Disney about three thousand bucks a either one is wonderful you should not feel guilty\nEither way but I'll tell you what I Would do I go to Disney yeah little kids you part is perfect age for that\nUm if it's something you obviously do want to do something they want to do I'm just not something I Want to do but you it's fine I mean Rachel cruise loves Disney she just took her little baby down there they had a wonderful time not sure how great a term her husband had but they had a great time and I'm\nNo ... but but I mean if it's what you want to do you've saved up the money you're not going into that you're not getting out of debt and going on vacation you're out of that\nYou have your emergency fund this was the point in the baby steps where you enjoy some of the money and I don't suggest consuming all of it and hitting no long term goals but I think if you don't consume some of it and only hit long term goals then you're not enjoying your life\nYou live like no one else so that later you can live and give like no one else during the first three baby steps you're extremely intense you don't do anything except beans and rice rice and beans till you're ... out of debt and have your emergency plan in place and then you let your foot off the accelerator some to where you can do baby steps for five and six\nAnd purchases are in there\nAll at the same time maybe step for Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement meanwhile you start putting some pretty good college and five and six is when you find extra money to pay off the house early in that sense what you're working towards\nThe middle of all of that we don't go ten years and never go on vacation\nThat's when you go on vacation and we don't go ten years and never upgrade the couch the springs sticking out of it that's when you upgrade the couch you just pay cash but the stuff and you realize that every time we consume something it slows down our long term wealth building but the purpose of long term wealth building has to be able to consume\nAnd to be able to give\nMoney piled up just for pollen ... having pollen money's sake is not worth anything it's only or something when it does something for your family or you're able to do something for others that's all it's good for Jay is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Jay welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\n[noise] hey Dave ... thank you for taking my call first time caller sure\nI'm about two years ago I began a commercial helicopter training\nAnd I finally received like commercial helicopter certificate um however I ... I mean uh the by eighty hours or more training I got discovered uh their family history highly regulated by insurance\nAnd an orderly comments sure why NATO out two hundred hours and I'm trying to figure out how to pay for eighty hours and be ready to work the upcoming season I'm as a commercial up about\n... is there any way you can do it as a co pilot and get the hours\n[laughter] no I unfortunately a a a a job are there any out as a single pilot\nNow that that moment you just said the wrong thing you should do the job opportunity there's only one person in Florida and you know a doctor about what's wrong\nWell I I didn't tell you not a thing or two days I I work at a firefighter so that's my primary um income choice there's this kind of like a secondary thing that that kind of went off in bed and that's uh\nThat's kinda why I'm I'm kinda limited as far as a ... ... jobs that I I can take\nHelicopter pilots not make more than ...\nThat I I can take\nThe helicopter pollens not make more than ...\nI Know believe it or not firefighter yeah it definitely makes more\nOkay so you're not planning on quitting the firefighting degree or a career you're going to continue that and part time helicopter pilot\nYes yes that's that's what I Want to do [noise] okay um\nAnd show it forces you to stay in that particular area and it forces you to work in a regular schedule that you can control and so it does limit the number of jobs available which means that having your helicopter pilots life things has a very limited value\nYeah Charles ... is not that valuable to you because of the way you're going to utilize it so I mean you have to just cash flow this it's like it's like a hobby you're getting paid for your own make some money but if you're not going to make enough money to even justify the expense you've gone too\nYeah so I I just I feel I'm too far into it to just\nI'm not suggesting you quit but there's just no way in the scenario you've laid out here that it makes sense to do anything except to slow down and go I'm just gonna take me a little time does I got a cash flow this and I got to find the time to do the hours\nRight they say don't rush to get the job generally up\nAnd they'll charge not worth that much\nYeah it doesn't pay that much either\nThat's what I mean they're not worth that much compared to what you're paying you're not even gonna make back you're eighty hours worth of training and the first year\nNo no you're right now\nSo not mention all the money you've already put on it so um what I Want to do is look for\nA place I mean you've got connections in the fire department other lifelike guys or something that you can get some hours in the coal policy can get some takeoffs and landings and get some of that council virtually\nUnfortunately and those are more complex aircraft and I'm I'm currently on a lot of them that we're at ... ... aircraft gotcha not even a turbine yet but um\nI mean I I've even reached out to people that are on their on aircraft and and you know offered to pay for fuel and things like that to kinda do get those ... or Jerry ... and unfortunately a lot a lot of those guys are very busy so I can get our air and our there but nothing really counts as\nTo who you're going to end up paying for these hours or does uh eighty hours cost\n[noise] well considering some of the hour and a place of a you know on the cheap you can get 'em at two fifty or three hundred five hundred it all depends on the aircraft and what kind of a deal you can you know so\nThat she won a thirty thousand bucks\nYeah pretty much already my chair\nAnd you don't have that laying around obviously\nNegative negative on\nJust take your time and cash flow it because you you now have ... as we continue the conversation you've even narrowed your opportunities down further because you're in an entry level\nUm ... the simpler versions of helicopters not all of them which is limits the number of jobs you can take even more and so this is slightly above a hobby\nYeah yeah it definitely has a passion or why not I there's nothing wrong with that as long as you pay cash for it yeah yeah I mean I\nI've got a ... I collect handguns and shoot them a lot and\nAh and you know shop burn through some MOH a but it's a ... I don't make any money doing I'm trying to make money doing it but it was just a hobby and so that costs money hobbies costs are on and this was not going to cost you money is actually gonna make you a little once you get past this\nBut up until the point you actually get a check it's going to cost you money and you know you're just going to put another twenty thousand bucks into this thirty thousand bucks some of this before you get paid\nAnd um that may take you two years the cash flow that instead of one you're not going to make this year unless you can find some way that the guys that are hiring for the season want to pay for it in return you promise to work there are three years or something like that you know and they want to pay for your hours or something maybe there's somebody

didn't know her her dad passed in a car wreck what four years ago it was it now\nYeah typically dollar Fifteen that's right yeah I don't say that\nI'm thinking I remembered that you know about there and um we had to have him on several times over the years as we discuss this whole subject to millionaires and\nAll of the some of the mythology litters around millionaire's show up you used some of the research from your dad's in Europe are professional researcher to like he was and uh and they put this together tell me about the background on that part of it what about this or did you do and more of it which combined with what he had done\nYet I think that that trade had we had worked together really on the in this uh survey for the buck on you know really started back and kick out into thinking about the twentieth anniversary is a millionaire next door like you said it came out in the nineties\nAnd and work together on kind of what books should include and\nGot to the point when we were just about to send out a survey on our sample of a fun and ... and and he was killed by by a drunk driver I'm and show really he wasn't able to either data that came back and compare it to love

that research and\nTechnology company that studies wealth accumulation and builds tools to help and you guys have to check this out its um data points dot com has all the stuff on her research as well but you can get the new book the next millionaire next door\nIn during strategies for building wealth at any major bookstore show the new data that you guys got\nAs you put this back together on the anniversary and then you've added to it since with your continued research\nWhat were the ... or was there anything that just shocked you in the findings were you ship wow I didn't see that one coming\n[noise] that you know we worked a lot at um some of them escaped though in that kind of behaviors that millionaire make related thing and I think what what I was\nJust like any of that that are trying to do the right thing I'm a millionaire and make mistakes along the way to sell a lot of that sort of behavior and then the the the ... that they make related to that with the rising and then I think I think he was that a lot of things in terms of the kinds of\nOr that or the amount that they're spending on things like a furniture and clothing and things like that that some of the things are rising that were sort of similar time\nYeah I was speaking in a church a couple of days ago and I told them one of the\nA key points that I've seen over twenty five years of doing this one of the five things you have to do if you want to build wealth is you have to be careful who you hang around with because you become who you hang around with and I see on the back of your book understanding how those around you influence your financial by ... what did you find on that\nYeah absolutely I think that again you see it very clear from the work that we've done but the thing and that every every day like I like\nThat they are um that that that they're showing defense that caring about what other than driving and buying and wearing it they're really key factor in building well you know it's related in that way for a guy the old you are how much you make\n'em and I think you know now it ... it really hard to ignore what other people arguing the actual media and so forth that it can take the parents are not caring about what other people that he'll as wide awake though\nYou know I think in my case I was I was a unique because one of the benefits would going broke like I Do it in my twenties where his violently was ... at that point I just reached all I wanted to do with survive\nAnd thrive and reach a point I just don't care what people think I still don't care what people think and I think that was a big contributor to me\nA personal you'll be able to to build wealth again after going bankrupt but I see it with other people as when you don't care what other people think about what you drive where you live what closure where when you've been on vacation you're not trying to keep up with other people's Facebook version of themselves then you've got the ability to win\nAbsolutely and I think like I said I think that that and say that there's a lot of that is a lot that I write them fairly young and I live here but I think it's keep in mind but we don't see that research\nShe'll gaining knowledge\nI think it's keep in mind that we don't see that and the research\nShe'll gaining knowledge and composer to invest and grow well that is a great work come closer to grow wealth what do you mean by that\n[noise] but you know it will tell you that related to make them confined math but it really you know you can apply any kind of major financial decision that you're making a few\nHave kind of comment before making it so I have a example we get some kind of theirs\nAnd it rained a lot of great time to go out and look for in a car because you're not if you're an emotional and where you are terrified about any income level that you have all the time you're making as well as he can stay on and come as\nA matter of what can I answer the wire and then you get out of there and making the right one\nAnd I I often hear or we'd go to a more burns personality does a career show on you know choosing a career and there's all this I'm a stuff about following your passion out there but you guys have you found yet again in this new set of data\nThe idea that a lifestyle related freedom does not equate to less income or less wealthy it actually which to greater and greater will the new\n[noise] yeah you know I think that's right I think that you know understanding that against your passion or or your entrance let's say for your career happily grounded in reality and and and I think that that's something that\nYou know a lot of people don't want to hear but ... and ... um if he had an accent or the art and that's really where
