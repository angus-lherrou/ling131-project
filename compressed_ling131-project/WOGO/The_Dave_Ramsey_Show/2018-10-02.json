you just went wow that's the best deal ever ride yeah this is\nFrom like to even get kicked out 'cause someone gated or should I leave or should I should I go back rent and or\nWell where do I want to be long term whether you want to own um\nMy wife she we kind of didn't want to own 'cause we got a daughter she's four and my wife she that school and now so we just trying to kind of settled down right now\nMhm have you got every angle\nArea if I'm like I say my wife great grandma's house has she been here her whole life so she likes it it's like about two and a half three acres\nMhm and um it's kind of in a country will part of Atlanta\nGotcha okay and how old are your\nUh my wife she turned twenty yesterday and and I'll be Twenty one and a couple of days so we both twenty now\nMhm and you've got a one child yourself and how much debt that you have\nA we don't have any do\nOkay and what's your household income\nI make a very clear but I'm trying to get in school\nBut I had to kind of work with the answer to that was that much I don't know what else um I pay about six hundred and Seventeen dollars a month and your wife doesn't work [noise]\nOkay that's pretty shy and that's where we ride on your budget is is very tight on your budget\nYeah and we get found out about you not too long ago one of my friends from turkey recommended me start listening to you so now we actually kind of made a budget and stuff on out to eat and we're already kinda you know trying to start it off a little better and\nGood good for you okay well here's the thing if you wanted to buy the house the only way you can buy it is the ah the relatives that are involved that would be the air's a this would be great grandmothers children or grandchildren\nThat would be the air since there was no will someone would have to petition the court you'd have to get a lawyer and go to probe a court in probate court would have to rule that the house could be sold and would assign someone to sign the deed as the cellar\nTo be able to give it to you you're going to have to have a court action to do that that's going to cost three two or three thousand bucks to get all that done\nOkay I don't think you need that expense right now yeah though\nWith all the mood the numbers you gave me in the situation you're in um now is anybody going to throw you out as long as that mortgages paid I doubt you're gonna get thrown out\nYeah 'cause that's what I was thinking should I feel kind of want to actually start even going into real estate 'cause I Do construction that's what I Do know I kind of this house it's kinda it's not ... it's kind of beat up and fight the last few years she yeah here's like other relatives staying there kind of beaten it up so I mean I don't know if it's like\nMaybe weren't more maybe you know what\nI'm saying they Lincoln flipping and get another house\nOr Lipitor unless you become the owner of it\nYeah and and that's what I'm saying like I Do I Need to use that I see in a statement learning anything they just hurry up and now like my instinct game or should I tell you what I Would\nDo if I were you I Would be willing to walk away from this house some day when you get I I Would treat it like you're renting it\nYou're probably not gonna ever bother to own it and if you do you're going to go through a lot of hassle to become the owner going through this court action that I'm Talking about okay so uh what I Would do is pay that rent or pay that payment of rent I Would not spend any money on this and I would\nThat rent or pay that payment as rent I Would not spend any money on this and I wouldn't frets about becoming the owner today\nIt's inexpensive rent in the Atlanta area it's a place you like living any money you spend on it just say to fix it up is money you're probably gonna lose you're probably not ever going to become the owner of this thing\nYeah it's going to be and I just got to be a really strenuous process with the courts to become the owner of this because we don't even know who the errors are\nYeah well I don't I Know a couple of the day is this is not that many um\nOr that they actually even know about it like I said we we been here for a year so I don't know like should I I I'm not like should I be worried\nThat they are paying the oil and I just keep paying it in because that's not that you shouldn't be worried because it's not bad rent\nYet but I'm just worried like get nobody comic me out 'cause it's not in my name\nYeah they can take you out the people that own it can there are the heirs but they'd have to all get their crap together and they're far from doing that\nYeah and they're they're they're far away they're like in another state and\nYou know but they're not they're not worried about this is what I'm saying yeah they're not worried about this at all it's not bothering them one way or the other they're not gonna get any money out of it when it sells 'cause it's not worth much more than ... vote on it\nIf it was valuable now there'll be some sharks and the water circling right but it's not got any ... because it's not worth any more so you're not going to get kicked out but some day you're going to want to move on so don't spend a bunch of money on it 'cause some day you're just gonna walk off and leave it\nYeah 'cause 'cause I've already done painted and scrape the before they need a little some something you know and then they will have because\nThat's like whatever money whatever money you spend and make her happy is money is gone\nWhen you leave because there's going to come a day two years from now that you guys are going to stand up and walk away or you're going to go to the trouble to get the heirs to take the thing the probate court and get to be transferred to your name\nAnd you can probably do that but again it's going to cost you a couple of thousand dollars and you'd want to make very sure that the property was worth more than the mortgage before you did that and um\nAnd you don't want to spend a bunch of money renovating his house because you're going to very likely move on in about two years but in the meantime I just looked at it as cheap rent\nTo a place you kinda like living\nAnd uh you know six hundred bucks rent in line is not a bad gig on two and a half acres so I'm sitting there in front of you for now\nUh now hurting anything no one's you're not stealing anything you're not doing any more harm the mortgage companies getting paid they're happy the relatives that aren't going to get any money anyways still aren't getting any money everybody's happy but just look at it like you're a renter and some day you're just going to move on\n... worried about being the owner and then if you really want to be the owner then get ready to spend three or four thousand dollars and six months of pain in the bud court actions and you probably can work this through if you can gather up all the people you need to sign on it\nAnd that's what you're facing so it's an interesting situation but um my guess is it's not worth any more than his vote on it\nMy guess is elope probably fairly close on this\nIf we thought it was worth two hundred thousand bucks is a relative thought is worth two hundred thousand bucks and Ninety thousand was old and they were going to get a hundred thousand their pocket when is old\nNo sharks would already been circling they'd have been trying to figure out some way to get that thing sold and get the courts do it when you die without a wheel and you don't have to go in and the judge has to you know authorized the sale of the asset and it has to go into a pool to be dispersed too the heirs\nAre just like it would in a will but it's just a lot bigger mess\nAnd do you can't get clean title to this thing unless you do all that and you do not want to become the owner of it any other ways of doing it properly and getting clean titled 'cause you won't be able to sell it if you don't get clean title so that's how you do it if you decided to do it later but for today I Would treated as cheap rent\nIt's a rental house how much money would you spend on a rental house that you're going to move off and you don't home not [noise] not any that's what you would do hope that helps my em thanks for calling him this is Dave Ramsey show\n[noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing
