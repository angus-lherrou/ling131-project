first of all in terms of a water problem is is a problem that happened after heavy rainfall yeah All right so if you've got water that comes in after heavy rainfall I Want to make sure we try to slow

you guys were clean the kings were soil slips away from the house we've got an extensive articles actually several of them on a Monday ... dot com to search how to stop a leaking basement is the same advice\nAnd we talk about the proper drainage improvements so do that first and then in terms of the country itself\nYou can use a patch in compound quick Crete has a patch in compound product you definitely want to use the patching compound because it's designed to stick to the old concrete if you tried to put new concrete over it it's not going to stick\nSo they're ready to use patching compounds are trial apply their latex formulas so it's easy to clean up but that will seal the old concrete and then once that dries then you can painted\nAnd what I Would look for us in the ... floor paint the Toxie pain so I like because there there are chemical cure when you buy the floor paint you get the paint and a gallon can that's about three quarters spilled and then a court of partner you mix them together stir them up\nAnd then you apply the paint sometimes there is um an additive that goes in after the fact that gives you some texture to the floor helps kind of hide the dirt but patching it first than having an epoxy paint will have that looking like new in no time\nOkay that ... hair color fat\nQuick creature you I K. R. E. T. H. quick creek concrete patching compound good stuff Mary thanks so much for calling us at a date money pet\nI got that Richard in Illinois and the line is getting some water through the foundation tells what's going on\nWhat it is it over time I've got a ranch house where they walk out basement in on the walk out when you come out there is a retaining wall but is about eight foot tall where it meets the house\nIt hasn't really separated from the house but\nThere is water they get in between that we can end up on day one and then they read it bottom on a heavy rain and then teach back into the basement so I'm trying to figure out the previous owner that had this house is put something in there like a call ... sometimes got hard time and\nIt's not falling down too much\nSo this is a gravity situation so let's give you a gravity solution let's have the drainage work with you and not against you and by the way\nYou can see all this so the cows come home and it's still going to find that on its way in which you have to do is stop the water from accumulating so on the opposite side of this retaining wall I'm guessing that there's some run off that goes towards the wall yes there is\nSo what you're going to want to do is is intercept that run off so we don't get as much water that collects in that area we're going to try to do is limit the amount of water that gets in an area that just direct rainfall with no runoff that means\nNo gutter discharge no a runoff from higher elevations so the way we do that is is first of all examine the situation and make sure there's no water dropping\nAt the high side of this work and work its way down if there is you've got to run a pipe underground to get it to a place where it's not going to interfere with a with leakage into the basement secondly in terms of intercepting the run off what you could do is installed something called the curtain drained Richard it's really it's a rather simple drain you might construct yourself\nYou take a trench that's about twelve inches deep and twelve inches wide you put some stone in a trench then you put a ... type on top of the stone surrounded with more stone\nLay a piece of filter cloth across the top and cover with soil so it's all done it's invisible in the end of that dream that you just installed should exit the daylight somewhere to figure out the best way to do that based on the configuration of your yard will that will do is they'll intercept the water that's coming down from higher elevations\nFor the phone and the trench come up to the pipe and then run around the house as opposed to collecting in that particular corner\nIf we can keep the water from collecting in that area you will probably be just fine because it's rare that just direct rainfall accumulates enough water to actually leak in the house it's almost always the runoff from gutters and from drainage\nRight well and needless to say I probably have to do some get rid of landscape in this gets a little green Bush along along that well as well so\nYeah and that's a good point 'cause sometimes you can make the problem worse by having landscaping that traps water so just think in terms of water control here not in terms of trying to steal that water out and I think you'll be in good shape\nI think so much for calling them money pack now when a breakdown in your home you know

really did have a very very special relationship that way on that went beyond most mother in law daughter in law relationships am I correct absolutely\nWell first of all she had an amazing mother in law and mom mhm hates me when I first got much mother in law\nAnd she told me when I first got married how much he loved her mother in law and how good her mother in law was to her and she said I Want to be the same kind of mother in law for you and she said and here's my rule\nNoble and uh we're speaking about the amazing tragedy to you and your family went through leaving Vienna the Nazi invasions ah your ship almost go bomb coming in New York you finally get your what did you do and how did you eventually meet Leonard\nWell my parents and I lived on the west side and I went to the New York public schools my father was in the diamond business and um he found\nA beautiful yellow diamond actually on my mother had this yellow diamond that I'm wearing on the street in Nineteen forty seven when I was a little girl and that in those days nobody a value\nColored stones but at any rate he did well and then they went into retailing and my mother was a very very fine sales person she taught me how to sell\nLike all my life because every once in a while there would always be someone who was ill and I had to come in and give them the hand after school and um I went to the finest public schools in New York\nA Hunter College high school and then on to college when I was a freshman in college I'm One of my high school friends was dating a real nice fellow by the name of Bob Bob best friend was a boy by the name of Leonard laughter\nAnd so Stephanie invited me to a party that her parents what giving and her parents told her that she could have Bob and Bob could bring lettered if she can get an\nA date for Leonard so that the four of us could hang around while they were having a party for the grown ups with the you know they were thirty people\nThey're rich or so um\nMy um my first date with letter was blind date that within range by my friend Stephanie and I'm Larry came and picked me up and my dad met him and they talked for a couple of minutes and then we went over to Stephanie's house\nThan when I got home my father was sitting in the living room which he never did he was usually waiting ups and they and bad and ah so I thought something bad has happened to my mother and then he was going to give me some bad news boy\nAnd so I said what are you doing in the living room what's happened to mom\nAnd she said nothing nothing's happening to mom I just want you to know that the nice boy\nWow what am I Am surprised that must have been for you know it was terrible why why are we getting involved with only Eighteen oh why didn't need\nThat pressure you just to be done usually you're done with being a darling I was so I was such a bad thing\nOr a ... I was expected to tell you what are the boy you're too young\nNo no just the reverse and when his mother met me she said the same thing for him and he said oh my God and neither one of us were ready for a relationship because he was very young and just about to go into the navy and I was just starting college\nSo it wasn't until I graduated and that he got out of the navy that we started to date\nAnd then I'm I'm\nAbout a year later we were married so we knew each other really he was my best\nFriend is an hour I'm Still surprised that I married him and he still surprised that he married Evie house not really why is that because we were such good friends and we really liked each other we\nEnjoy talking about a variety of topics we never kept our mouth shut and we were always talking about something and he let me a book I never returned I said and you know eventually said well I have to marry you if you\nDon't get me back the book I said okay\nThe consummate salesman let her lover let me ask you what was it like when you first met actually well I\nMet her right in the beginning of when I met Leonard and she really was very very\nNice to me and she was um she asked me to to help her ... of the hostess I'm with a surprise birthday party she was going to do for him\nAnd uh she had it at her home and she said she afterwards you know she loved the way I dressed for the party\nThat um and and she liked the way I really did help her\nA as a host and I introduce people to each other I met people for the first time and um you know we\nGot along very very well she was really always good to me\nWhen she ... how successful was the state Law Order companies with this point and how what was it intimidating the meter was or would they not that far along in the success you\nYou know very sensitive about that John in fact nobody had ever heard of as the laughter when I met them it was a very small\nNobody had ever heard of that the laughter when I met them it was a very small company I Believe they had only started and and then a few years earlier had chest the launch of this\nPhenomenal fragrance which came subsequently called you do which has been a a serious seller for well over Fifteen Years which is longer than most fragrances live and um\nYou know she\nOf what I find the counter after I was married um and get people would come up to the counter I the first thing I Would say was have you ever heard of that the laughter and they said well I bet she related to their Harry Potter\nNow I had never heard of this or Harry Lauder me neither\nYeah because with two young your hair Harry Lauder was the\nI'm a dance hall artist Scottish who is very very famous in the thirties and in the forties apparently in England and Scotland and many many people knew him here and he was very popular here\nThings kind of changed your own little do the [laughter] now they're they're asking Harry's or certain areas or relatives are you related to the U.S they fail takes\nAthlete now when I go in a if I if I you know you charge card when people see my name they say are you related to se Lauder so I always say oh I Wish I were I don't want that and now the

success story and and this is what else they loan or had to say\nShe said nothing happens fast many stories have surrounded the growth of big business certainly my big my big business and most of them

to detail last hours of sleep worries ... friends and family didn't let a day go by without discouraging us\nDo you remember her telling you any of these stories are experiencing the\nYes and the beginning I'm One of the great\nStories that Leonard likes to tell us how the lawyer and the account and the friends and family discourage them from going forward and do what he says lawyers make good lawyers accountants make good accountant but if you want to be in business\nWhat you're doing stick with it\nAnd you persevere and it will happen\nYes and you know that's really great advice for folks

months after we were married I discovered that I was pregnant and\nAt that time they wouldn't know vaccines for me and the doctor said there's no way that you're going to go back to school so I'm I
