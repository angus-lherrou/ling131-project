they have to deliver on time they have to deliver quality they're learning how to put prices on something or they're learning that it's a good thing to make a profit to capitalism is not evil ... that these are the lessons are what is important\nTo understand that he actually that if she makes some money that's just a bonus\nRight but what ... what are you what you've identified as you've identified the way this kid is wired and a lot of us that are entrepreneurial are are a lot or at least a little bit ADD [laughter] right right I mean how much you'll pass anything the shiny I run towards it you know so I'm sure\nYou know but ... ... if you start maybe but starting like a hundred dollars a year or something you might want to do and they're all asleep but if you if you're making under a hundred grand where the profit\nI have a national you know unless you just hit some bizarre thing or something like home depot wants to buy or out or something I don't know but you know what you're trying to do is teach her the lessons of how to set up operator business deliver on time\nFollow through responsibility the character of work ethic those kinds of things that you have to have to run a business initiative\nAnd it's a wonderful thing the teacher team or pre teen like that it's absolutely fabulous so much so that Anthony O'Neill here on our team put together the teen entrepreneurial entrepreneur tool box it's a box of teaching age for parents to work with their kids on how to start and run a business\nAnd as you know we have a student loan crisis with a half a trillion dollars\nIn student loan debt we have an entire department within our company called Ramsey education that puts a curriculum in the high schools and in the colleges across America we are now and forty percent of the high schools teaching high schoolers this common some stuff\nFor staying out of debt and being on a budget and learning to save money and all of that kind of thing\nAnd what happens from time to time is the schools can't afford the basic resources and so someone will come along side in the community a business or an entity of some kind and we'll pay for that high school to have\nFoundations in personal finance curriculum from the Ramsey organization is that we've had about four million students go through one of the coolest things that's happened lately is the University of Wyoming\nHas decided that every high school in the entire state of Wyoming needs to have this curriculum and they're sponsoring it in paying for it\nDang dang touchdown baby\nThat's how that happens the college university says we're going to take care of these high schoolers\nIn our state and make sure they learn about money and of course the University of Wyoming is the best cost alternative in the Wyoming area to go to college so this all works out really really good now Tyler Moore is with me on the line and\nTile is from the University of Wyoming usually associate vice provost of enrollment\nKyle White uh go man thank you for doing that\nWell it's a it's a pleasure to visit with you David ... thanks for that we are certainly Saturday here in the state of Wyoming to be able to partner with a Ramsey education and provide some practical applicable\nBeing for students to be able to apply that college search and and and be real savvy consumer higher education\nYeah 'cause you guys do have low tuition I mean you're you're you're you're the best deal round I wasn't getting right\nYes there we are we have the lower resident tuition any public institution that grant doctoral degrees anywhere in the United states\nOf all fifty states of all the rooms are like so like your cheaper than my University of Tennessee or your cheaper than the University of dot dot dot that's correct wow very cool very cool and I got to tell you when I heard what your whole promotion was\nBehind this I immediately wanted to steal it and bring it and use it somewhere\nIn like in the University of Tennessee and I'll tell you were doing a few minutes but I Will get them to do it yeah you guys are creative I Love this tell everybody about this uh about this campaign and the the motto for the campaign is hands down the best thing I've heard\nSo that our our our campaign is called the world needs more cowboys\nWe're we're not talking about ... and cowboy hats that ride off into the sunset but we're talking about a date with long heritage and a university mascot and cowboy that can be\nAnyone from any gender any background but we're talking about that enters here we're talking about curiosity and independence boldness\nBut we're talking about that enter spirit we're talking about a curiosity independence boldness at pursuit that adventure and we're talking about someone who changes landscapes and and books for opportunities to make differences in the world we are talking about trailblazers and people exemplify the spirit of the underdog you know\nIt's not a cowboy isn't what you are but it's who you are yeah\nWell and you guys are the cowboys I mean so it's a play on words obviously I mean if you're a mascot right best looked at your football team your basketball team whatever's the cowboys I mean like\nMy University of Tennessee Volunteers I think they ought to steal it inside of the world needs more volunteers that makes it just as much sense right and so that's good I play on words but you you guys got though that you got to the table first with is why are you to go man I Love it\nIt's a great motto or does it says so much in just a so few words very very cool well we're really grateful to all of our sponsors around the country that are helping us and\nYou got sponsoring the high school every high school in Wyoming is going to have\nAs a coming up soon the the high school curriculum because the cowboys paid for it [laughter]\nThat's pretty cool guile\nThank you ma'am\nWe're happy to be happy to be a partner we uh we are we are state that is very practical where state that very much um applicable in terms of being smart with our money and we wanted to make sure that we were not leaving out our opportunity to educate the future generations\nAnd know that there are opportunities in higher education to be smart with your money to be smart about that investment and your future and the University of Wyoming is a way to do that and we're we're helping helping our students in our future generation in the state of Wyoming through the Ramsey education product\nWell it's one of those when when when things as far as I'm concerned because you're\nYou know you're you're helping them by sponsoring this ... going in there we're blessed because you're doing it with us and we appreciate that I'm In the winter is is that you get to put the University of Wyoming cowboys right in front of every high school student and remind them that's where they ought to go to college\nBecause sometimes people do silly things like wander across the state line\nTalked to a lot of Provo is around the country I'm my own chancellor and vice transferred University of Tennessee and it's a constant thing the ... the state is trying to woo their own residence to their own university and it's become a thing you gotta you gotta go after it don't you\nYes sir absolutely and we have a lot of great students here in the state of Wyoming and there are a lot of great students across the country who need to know that there are opportunities even\nOut of state but you have to be\nSmart and you have to do your due diligence in that process of searching for higher education\nIn addition to being the lowest cost per resident tuition of doctor are renting institution we are near the very lowest spurt non residents to come to Wyoming so we have a lot to offer not just here in the great state of Wyoming but from coast to coast north and south we\nCan be a solution that provide students an incredible opportunity for education\nAnd we're going to be very very good at making sure that we are\nHelping a student be successful not just students access and part of that is not racking up a lot of debt at the end of their degree completion I meant so how many students on your campus we have\nA little over or twelve thousand so twelve thousand a little over twelve thousand four hundred students here and that call themselves cowboys\nYou know that's a good size school it's not too big and small and so that's and that's just right those are Goldilocks deal dress right\nVery cool very cool ... it's an honor to talk to you again rather thank you for coming on with us\nThank you very much\nA best wishes to you and your team there in uh in Tennessee and we appreciate the opportunity to say the world needs more cowboys\nAnd I love it I Love the motto and I think the world does need more cowboys in so many ways [laughter] good stuff I got a picture John Wayne going in my head I can't help but it's just the way it is but a bottom line is lesser mascot and so\nNow it's ah that's very cool stuff I Love it and what a neat thing that the College of the University of the state is buying it for every single high school now if you're a business or university and you'd like to do something like that maybe you don't have to maybe don't have the money to buy the whole state or something every high school in the states\nSome states have more high schools and others can you imagine you know but uh um\nYou know maybe you just want to do it to the hospital used to go to um I went over spoke to them in the building where I used to go to high school the other day and it's now a middle school\nSo I Know the forty really bright and shiny little eighth graders looking at me that's the hardest speaking you'll ever have I'll just tell you\nUm but uh as Anthony O'Neill's got tough job you're all but a pretty cool it's pretty cool to go back over there and you know if it wasn't and by the way that school has our curriculum I furnish it to them on the sponsor of that [noise] but\nSee that's how you doing just that easy one [laughter] ah the world needs more cowboys I like it and this is the day

Ramsey and you'll see the best possible deal out there that's the magic word Ramsey at blinds dot com\nWendy is in Alabama I'm forty six years old and married but we do not have any children should we get long term care at fifty since we don't have any kids to help us or wait until sixty wait until sixty\nThe probability of staying in a nursing home prior to age sixty is less than one percent so much less than one percent it approaches zero\nBut once you're sixty it goes up every single minute\nVery weird show I highly recommend long term care insurance for nursing home insurance for in home care insurance once you're sixty because Seventy five percent of your ladies will outlive your husband's show the typical scenario is\nThat papa goes in the nursing home\nFifty thousand bucks a year corrections scrambles a three hundred thousand dollar nest egg dies leaves mama broke\nThat's a normal scenario at a decent retirement going a little bit of a nest egg there but it's all gone and nursing homes are not evil they're just have to be paid to operate the people that work there their kids so they need money called payroll\nSo they're not evil and they're not ripping people off and\n... to go to nursing home\nSlugs and I go to a restaurant even though I eat there\nWell that's dumb donate their then okay but if you're going to need in home care or care in a nursing home you need to pay for it and I don't care insurance is absolutely a vital part of financial planning but not until you're sixty whether you have kids or not\nJ. D. is just in Sacramento, California Hi J. D. how are you\nI have I'm good how are you better than I deserve what's up in your world\nThanks for taking my call I'm calling with a question about mortgages my um my wife and I are debt free and we got eighty three a done\nWorking on three B. and we just went through a coordinated it thank you and yeah and my ... when the ten percent but I hear you on your show the twenty percent ... percent but if we can't get there than them one of those too so I'm just wondering what what makes the difference between ten and twenty or said\nOkay a good really question well like you said obviously a hundred percent down is our favorite mortgage okay not one All right uh the in when somebody's buying I said\nI pretty much slap my fist on the table and said don't buy a house unless you're gonna put down twenty percent on your second because you've got the equity coming out of the first one\nAnd normal scenario on a first home it's okay to whatever you can put down and get into the house okay here's the reason twenty percent is ...\n... if you put twenty percent down you have what's called an eighty percent loan that are eighty percent loan to value ratio that allows you with a standard family make\nTheir own or for that matter with an F. ha loan to have no P. M. I. P. M. I. plans for private mortgage insurance which basic Ernst that pays the mortgage company money if they foreclose on un lose money on the foreclosure\nThose rules for so it has zero but not under any circumstance it's only because they are taking more risk because they don't have good asset protection on the ratio you see what I'm saying\n... pm my insurance is about Seventy five dollars plus or minus a month per one hundred thousand borrowed\nSo you write a took a couple of hundred thousand dollar mortgage you got a hundred and fifty to two hundred bucks a month NPR mile alone if you don't put down twenty percent so that's why we put\nWords twenty percent but if you're on your first time home twenty percent can be a big difference versus ten percent and so if you buy a Fifteen year fixed rate we're more than a fourth of your take home pay with ten percent down and you get your mind on your first time that's not the end of the world and you can get rid of the PM I when you pay the lone down ...\nPercent of value by buying an appraisal that the more get from an appraisal\nThey were sent a value by buying an appraisal that the mortgage from an appraiser that the mortgage company approves of and then they will drop the PM mind after you get it pay down\nThe fact that we're in fact in California where home prices are no fairly high compared this country making it if it\nDidn't make any difference is still the same situation you don't get a pass on mathematics just 'cause you're in California they don't like okay I don't want your map doesn't count you know we don't do that so you use common sense but uh but you know again you're anytime you're the higher the whole process market you're in the more difficult this discussion because when you get ...\nPercent I'm not requiring twenty percent but you get you get J. D. how it's much to your advantage to not have the state of mind\nBecause you are talking about three or four hundred thousand dollar loan I mean we're talking about some money per month to going out the window for insurance that's worth absolutely zero to you [noise]\nSo that's what I'm trying to avoid here but it's not but so if you buy and you don't put down twenty percent didn't keep choking on that mortgage keep working your baby steps four or five ... Seine as you get that mortgage pay down and get that loan reset with an appraiser plant that's approved and then get that PM I dropped so you're not doing the um African one year\nDoes it just sucks it's just a horrible you know it's just but it's part of the race and it's a it's a logical reason that they require it but it's just super expensive\nAnd it just as bad so you want to get out of it as soon as you can because then you get to the business are really paying on your mortgage and not just wasted money but yeah you know we don't beat up on a first time homebuyer you don't baby step three B. for not putting down twenty percent\nUh the goal always is to become a hundred three as fast as we can and not waste any money we don't want to waste that's what we that's the goal we all have well those of us that are in tune with being smart [noise] Nick is with us in Chattanooga Hi Nick welcome that I've Ramsey show\nHey Dave it's good to talk to you you too man what's up [noise] okay so I'm twenty five I uh I I've done pretty well for myself\nUh I have a dilemma though my killing healers cars car it's a a a two thousand nine Chrysler three hundred bucks to ask thirty eight model what the big game in it and it's a hot yes said\nWell below Kelley Blue book value and I have about five to six thousand dollars worth of equity in the car mhm\nUnless you go through your baby steps if you want to be tough for me but I think I Need to sell the car I Know you're going to tell me to sell the car and money to finish my murders based on what is your and what is your car worth\nA private market is twenty three too I think\nYou're twenty five and you're doing pretty well for yourself tell me what that means\nThat means I have a good job of got Twenty one thousand dollars best ... uh I have no credit card debt mhm no I don't know what are you single\nI'm Single and what's your income by a ... a forty five fifty thousand dollars a year give or take a little bit with overtime is this your only dead on the car that's my only debt and how much do you do on it\nBut I was sixteen thousand two hundred and fifty two dollars and Twenty one steps\nAs a single guy can't you pay that in a year or maybe you have no life keep the car no life you don't see the inside of a freaking restaurant unless you're working there\nI've been doing that day by the ... not at All right I mean I've been doing everything and that but\nCan't I mean can you can probably pay sixteen thousand a year making fifty grand if you're single ...
