of the homes on your street so far on average\nI had a very\n... right and so you're right at the barely at the top edge of the market right I'd write it down here you know yours is yours is not like double the average house on the street but it's one of the nicest ones\nAt what\nIt's worth two Seventy the average house on your street is two fifty five is the information you gave me is that right yeah that that puts you at a little bit nicer than the average house is that right yeah okay that's all I'm Talking about ... if you're going to spend some more money on how much more money or you're going to spend on the house\nI like it when we got twenty but you're going to spend the ... you weren't gonna spend the whole twenty said okay so what are you thinking about ten Fifteen and around there and how long you plan on living there\nOkay\nWe want to take her two young children to Disney World should\nWe're currently saving to build her on a new home on property we bought in cash already we can cash flow the trip by not saving for the house for one month about three thousand dollars I feel guilty for both not taking a family vacation and for not saving money where's the balance you you're guilty lot aren't you\nI mean you're stuck because you're just going to be guilty you're guilty if you go to Disney and you're going to be guilty if you don't\nYou know what I Do I'll be happy about it either one going to be guilty either way it's your money it's your choice you're smart either way you're out of debt you have your emergency fund and you're saving up for expenditures\nOne of the expenditures as you want to build a house for cash that some awesome go second one is you want to spend one month of that money and go to Disney about three thousand bucks a either one is wonderful you should not feel guilty\nEither way but I'll tell you what I Would do I go to Disney yeah little kids you part is perfect age for that\nUm if it's something you obviously do want to do something they want to do I'm just not something I Want to do but you know it's fine I mean retro cruise loves Disney she just took her little baby down there they had a wonderful time not sure how great a term her husband had but they had a great time and I'm\nNow ... but but I mean if it's what you want to do you've saved up the money you're not going into that you're not getting out of debt and going on vacation you're out of that\nYou have your emergency fund this was the point in the baby steps where you enjoy some of the money and I don't suggest consuming all of it and hitting no long term goals but I think if you don't consume some of it and only hit long term goals then you're not enjoying your life\nYou live like no one else so that later you can live and give like no one else during the first three baby steps your extremely intense you don't do anything except beans and rice rice and beans till you're ... out of debt and have your emergency fund in place then you let your foot off the accelerator some to where you can do baby steps for five and six\nAnd purchases are in there all at the same time maybe step for Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement meanwhile you start putting some pretty good college and five and six years when you find extra money pay off the house early in that sense that's what you're working towards the middle of all of that we don't go ten years and never go on vacation\nThat's when you go on vacation and we don't go ten years and never upgrade the couch that as springs sticking out of it that's when you upgrade the couch you just pay cash for this stuff and you realize that every time we consume something it slows down our long term wealth building but the purpose of long term wealth building has to be able to consume\nAnd to be able to give\nMoney piled up just for pollen ... having power money sake is not worth anything is only worth something when it does something for your family or you're able to do something for others that's all it's good for Jay is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Jay welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nI have a pet thank you for taking my call first time caller sure\nI'm about two years ago I began a commercial helicopter training\nAnd I finally received like commercial helicopter certificate um however I unfortunately I mean uh the eighty hours or more training to cover a this history highly regulated by insurance\nAnd in order to recover and sure why NATO or two hundred hours and I'm trying to figure out how to pay for eighty hours\nAnd trying to figure out how to pay for those eighty hours and be ready to work the upcoming season I'm at a commercial up about\n... is there any way you can do it as a co pilot ... hours\n[noise] no I unfortunately uh they are the jobs are there any out as a single pilot\nSo that that moment you just said the wrong thing you should do the job opportunity there's only one person in Florida and you know ... what's wrong\nWell I I didn't tell you another thing or two days I I work at a firefighter so that's my primary um income choice there's this kind of like a secondary thing that that kind of went off in bed and that's uh\nThat's kinda why I'm I'm kinda limited as far as the jobs that I I can take\nThe helicopter pilots not make more than ...\nI Know or believe it or not firefighter a definitely make more\nOkay so you're not planning on quitting the firefighting degree or a career you're going to continue that and part time helicopter pilot\nYes yes that's that's what I Want to do [noise] okay um\nAnd you show U.S forces you to stay in that particular area and it forces you to work in a regular schedule that you can control and so it does limit the number of jobs available which means that having your helicopter pilots life things has a very limited\nValue yeah shot that ...\nIt's not that valuable to you because of the way you're going to utilize it so I mean you have to just cash flow this is like I'm like a hobby you're getting paid for your own make some money but if you're not going to make enough money to even justify the expense you've gone too\nYeah so I just I feel I'm I'm too far into to just\nI'm not suggesting you quit but there's just no way in the scenario you've laid out here that it makes sense to do anything except to slow down and go I'm just\nGonna take me a little time 'cause I got a cash flow this and I got to find the time to do the hours\nRight they say don't rush to get the job\nDone me up and they'll charge not worth that much\nYeah it doesn't pay that much either\nThat's what I mean they're not worth that last compared to what you're paying you're not even gonna make back you're eighty hours worth of training in the first year\nNo mayor right now\nSo not mention all the money you've already put on it so I'm what I'm going to do is look for a place\nI mean you've got connections in the fire department of their life like guys or something that you can get some hours and the co pilot seat and get some cops and landings and get some of that council virtually\nForks and those are more complex aircraft and I'm I'm currently find a Robin ...\nAircraft gotcha not even a turbine yet but um\nI mean I I've even reached out to people that are on their on aircraft and and you know offered to pay for fuel and things like that to kind of do get those ... or ... and unfortunately a lot a lot of those guys are very busy so I can get and our air and our there but nothing really counts as\nTo who you're going to end up paying for these hours what does a eighty hours cost\n[noise] well considering some of the hour and a place of a you know on the cheap you can get some at two fifty a three hundred five hundred at all and on the aircraft and what kind of a deal you can get you know so\nI just won a thirty thousand bucks yeah pretty much already my chair and you don't have that laying around obviously negative negative on just take your time and cash flow it because you you now have\nAs we continue the conversation you've even narrowed your opportunities down further because you're in an entry level\nUm ... the simpler versions of helicopters not all of them which is limits the number of jobs you can take even more and so this is slightly above a hobby\nYeah yeah it definitely has a passion or why not ... I there's nothing wrong with that as long as you pay cash for it yeah yeah and I I've got a ... I collect handguns and shoot them a lot and uh and\nAnd also I burn through some MOH but it's a ... I don't make any money doing um I'm trying to make money doing it but it was just a hobby and so that costs money hobbies costs are on in this one was not going to cost you money is actually gonna make you a little once you get past this\nBut up until the point you actually get a check it's going to cost you money and you know you're just going to put another twenty thousand bucks into this thirty thousand bucks into this before you get paid\nAnd um that may take you two years to cash flow that instead of one you're not going to make this year unless you can find some way that the guys that are hiring for the season want to pay for it in return you promise to work there are three years or something like that you know and they want to pay for your hours or something maybe there's somebody looking\nFor a pilot that you know that much intensity uh sometimes are unemployed here or will pick up some education costs in order to get somebody on borders are having trouble finding the help in that area\nAlso helps destruction [noise] interesting [noise]\nThis today Ramsey show [noise]\nIt's time to take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and making sure

together we both get hit by a bus with millions of dollars in a trust to beat good used only for their good are we did not leave the money to the guardian we left it into a trust which is the proper thing to do the trust is formed only at your death we put in that trust exactly how the money was to be invested the four types of mutual funds for instance that I\nRecommend we put in that trust that

pay a month\n[noise] um we make um my wife and I are both dependent on overtime we make about forty grand a year or forty forty grand a year\nWhich are typically what's your take home a month [noise] um [noise] read at four four thousand forty two hundred okay and you said the house payment is how much again fourteen hundred okay All right\nUm but I asked me how it should handle that and he told me how to go slow and take my time and be patient with it and it was very helpful but now I'm having another problem whereas\nI'm so basically since then I bought a house remodel the air being be making a lot of money about fifty thousand dollars a month on gross [laughter] um but about yeah about Fifteen thousand dollars a month and I'm just blowing through the crazy sex addiction\nOn spending just in the same amounts of money the ten thousand dollars a month on prostitutes and strip clubs and I'm from therapy all the above and I don't know what to do have tried everything I go to sex addicts anonymous\nAnd but I I I I Want to know what you would do in the situation I I've done well I spent about how that money on buying a house in air being being it now and I'm doing well with that and that since then\nIt's been a long project I finished but I don't know what to do about this how it should handle it ... ... anything else I even tried I [laughter]\nHow old are you I'm twenty two ... and um\nThe inheritance came from who passed away\nSo my dad passed away about two years ago and I'm a he was missing plane and I might be coming into a lot more money 'cause I felt the shelter wrongful death situation is um ... it it's a long story\nAbout your mom\nMy mom she's out of the picture that divorce decker we talked to her um right she yeah she that are the picture\nI ... as you know job and I'm not a therapist I'm not a trained ... um I have worked with addicts for Thirty years but goes one hundred percent of the addiction to broke\nIf if they don't feel their addiction and so you are going to destroy\nYour legacy your dad's legacy with the money that was left to you and you're going to destroy all your future dreams that this money represents if we don't if you don't get the help and heat to help and\nFight to win against the addiction um sex addictions and pornography addictions are the fastest growing addictions in America that we see that in our offices with financial trouble um people in your situation more than any other addiction\nWe see we still she cocaine we still see 'em and we don't treat for that but we ended up helping them with their finances we still see alcohol and uh but gambling and sex are both just the the\n... is a is a is gone crazy because of the Internet\nAccess and um uh it's affecting every part of our lives and the good wage and bad ways but the access in this case was causing\nExcess and gets people in real trouble with gambling and porn sex addictions um\nSo you're you you know you named off a couple of the right things and that's getting an essay getting in a I'm a non almost group I'm getting in a with a therapist is the second thing I Would do um the third thing I Would do\nIs um ... it it sounds to me like just a guy talking to a young guy an old guy talking to a young guy that all of your family structure has gone it's just you didn't have it with your mom and then your dad died and so you're you're just left without any authority\nStructure as a twenty year old young guy there's nobody in your life kind of standing over your shoulder the stump you when you grew up your life\nBut I I Do have a family on my dad's side that I'm actually a good way but they know what's going on you know so I don't know I had some problems going on like over a year ago a like size and that's just a and I I never\nUnlike over a year ago like effect and that just a and I I never and whenever I tried it goes down they kind of they were like a huge meal you're just going to pick on this day and I never had a track again okay with them so I just kind of put off the illusion that\nYou know K. everyone's okay but that's fine so that there are no help is what you're saying yeah OK\nOr no help but they they ... they're they're good but I just I don't know how\nWell I Know that all behaviors obviously have psychology involved um as a person of faith as a Christian I also believe behaviors or spiritual\nAnd show to treat or something like this only as a psychological thing is usually a half treatment to treated only like it's a spiritual thing might very well be half treatment but um there there is something that you're obviously searching for\nAnd there's something that you're missing 'em that's causing you too I'm literally go crazy in this part of your life right\n[noise] yeah I I I think like I'm just beyond lonely I don't know that um but um [noise] I I don't know honestly\nI think that's probably right that doesn't sound wrong how can I can resonate with that I can imagine you being there in that situation\nAnd it's amazing you're going to be on one of the largest cities in the world and be lonely you know but you can be it's very very real um the saw the last component I Would add to it um and you're asking me so you always get my opinion when you're asking me and that I'm an expert on my opinion [laughter] so ah\nWhat I Would tell you do is find a great church and will help you do that\nAnd and sit down and get past store all counseling to go with your other counseling\nGet with some young guys in that church\nAnd become friends with some people who have some character have some integrity and that are walking a straight line not perfect there isn't any perfect people over there are at that church ... churches got people and I'm sure you can find that out pretty quick but you will find a\nBook or synagogue I Know you're Jewish okay cool that's more effect then let's get whether I buy dude let's get the spiritual element of those going because there's a there's an aspect of that goes with this\nAnd if that's your heritage and that your your your faith and wonderful on by cause of the town that has a lot to say about the issues that you're dealing with\nUm a lot and um so yeah I that's the only thing I Know how to tell you though because I Can't just yell at you stop it or you would have already stopped it I mean you're smart guy you've already realizes just ruining your life\nAnd um you know that I Know that um but the nature of an addiction is ... and you're finding this from the twelve steps is that one of the thing is you realize you're powerless and you know God has to step in\nAnd I've got to push for structures in my life and I've got a you know figure out a ... there's some careful psych self analysis and say well loneliness is the issue so how do I fix loneliness well obviously I'm fixing it inappropriately and so how do I fix it was more wisdom\nAnd that will be hanging out with good people are that are lifting you up I'm\nObviously not hanging out with paid friends which doesn't work for anybody whatever version of paid to friends you have and yours is one of the more gross so um but that's you know that's the only thing I don't know how to tell you I I I Would make sure I'd really lean into\nGetting a group of people around me that I can trust and if there's a group of people that um are are working on a social project that is worthy and you've got to get with a bunch of young men doing that and you had some good guys around you um\nThen that's very important I've got a group of guys I get with once a month I was with him last night as a matter of fact I'm fifty eight um that group of guys got all our son's together that are in their twenties or the other day and we all encouraged them and they all agreed\nThat they need a group of guys you ain't got a what my friends the the man's bill calls a band of brothers in your life\nA talk with you in these situations so I'm a man I'm just a guy I don't know how to help you um I'll pray\nFor him to tell you that and hold on all have our pick up we're going to send you a copy of Mansfield book he's got a lot to say about this kind of stuff in the
