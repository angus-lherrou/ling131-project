two kinds fabulous and socks\nAnd there is a bunch of them that are fabulous\nAnd so I don't know why I decided to take up the cause of bragging millennials I think it's because there's a group of people my age and in the media\nAnd in some of these stupid books magazines and stuff that say all kinds of negative things about them is if the entire generation is living in their mother's basement collecting participation trophy it's just not true\nThere's a group of them that are but there's a group of them that are freaking rock stars too and so you know I I guess that's why and so I'm just

in debt and that's really where where you needed a financial expert to figure that out did you okay I'm Glad you found one to quote their vague we have no idea what the ... millennials had been

staying in a nursing home prior to age sixty is less than one percent show much less than one percent it approaches zero\nBut once you're sixty it goes up every single minute [laughter] it's very

I wanted to go to a\nRestaurant even though I eat there well that's dumb don't eat there then okay but if you're going to need in home care or care in a nursing home you need to pay for it and long

D. is with us in Sacramento, California Hi Judy how are you\nA Dave I'm good how are you better than I deserve what's up in your world\nThanks for taking my call and I'm calling with a question about mortgages my um my wife and I are debt free and we've got baby step three eight I'm working on three B. and we just went through a few uh we coordinated it\nThank you and yeah and my ...\nWhen the ten percent but I hear you on your show the twenty percent we would prefer a hundred percent but if we can't get there than the one of those too so I'm just wondering what what makes the difference between ten and twenty percent\nOkay a good really really good question well like you said obviously a hundred percent down as our favorite mortgage\nOkay not one right uh the when somebody's buying a second home\nI pretty much slap my fist on the table and so I don't buy a house unless you can put down ... percent on your second because you've got the equity coming out of the first one right in a normal scenario on a first home it's okay to whatever you can put down and get into the house okay here's the reason twenty percent is advantageous\nIf you put twenty percent down and you have what's called an eighty percent loan that are eighty percent loan to value ratio that allows you with a standard Fannie Mae conventional loan or for that matter with an effort to try loan to have no P. M. I. P. M. I. bands for private mortgage insurance\nWhich basically is insurance that pays the mortgage company money if they foreclose on un lose money on the foreclosure\nThose rules for so it hasn't zero benefit to you under any circumstance it's only because they are taking more risk because they don't have good asset protection on the wrist\nOnly because they are taking more risk because they don't have good asset protection on the ratio you see what I'm saying\nOkay at ... pm my insurance is about Seventy five dollars plus or minus a month per one hundred thousand borrowed\nSo you were in a couple of hundred thousand dollar mortgage you got a hundred and fifty to two hundred bucks a month NPR mile alone\nIf you don't put down twenty percent so that's why we push people towards twenty percent but if you're on your first time home twenty percent can be a big difference versus ten percent\nAnd so if you buy a Fifteen year fixed rate where the payments no more than a fourth of your take home pay with ten percent down you get your mind on your first time that's not the end of the world and you can get rid of the P. M. I. when you pay the loans down to eighty percent of value\nBy buying an appraisal that the more get from an appraiser that the mortgage company approves of\nAnd then they will drop the PM I later after you get it pay down\nThe fact that we're in fact in California where home prices are no fairly high compared to this country making it up and\nNow it doesn't make any difference is still the same situation you don't get a pass on mathematics just because you're in California they don't like okay you're on your lap doesn't count\nYou know we don't do that so you still got to use common sense but uh but you know again you're anytime you're at the higher the whole process market you're in the more difficult this discussion because when you get all the way down to ... percent I'm not requiring twenty percent but you get you get J. D. how it's much to your advantage\nTo not have this thing to me I Am I\nYeah I mean because you are talking about three or four hundred thousand dollar loan\nI mean we're talking about some money per month to going out the window for insurance that's worth absolutely zero to you right so that's what I'm trying to avoid here but it's not but it's so if you buy and you don't put down twenty percent\nThen keep jumping on that mortgage keep working your baby steps four five six simultaneous get that mortgage pay down and get that loan reset\nWith an appraiser plant that's approved and then get that PM I drop so you're not doing enough for Twenty years\n'cause it just sucks it's just a horrible you know it's just but it's part of the race and it's a it's a logical reason that they require it but it's just super expensive\nAnd it just as bad so you want to get out of it as soon as you can because then you get to the business are really paying on your mortgage and not just wasted money but yeah I I you know we don't beat up on a first time homebuyer you don't baby step three B. for not putting down twenty percent\nUh the goal always is to become a hundred percent that free as fast as we can and not waste any money we don't have to waste that's what we that's the goal we all have well\nThose of us that are in tune with being smart\nAnyway Nick is with us in Chattanooga Hi Nick welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHey Dave it's good to talk to you you too man what's up [noise] okay so I'm twenty five I ah I I'm I'm pretty well for myself\nUm I have a dilemma though my killings healers cars have a car it's a a a two thousand nine Chrysler three hundred bucks to ask thirty eight model what the big game in it and it's a beat up yes I paid well below Kelley Blue book value and I have\nAbout five to six thousand dollars worth of equity in the car mhm and I've been listening you go into your baby steps\nIf you want to be tough for me but I think I Need to sell the car I Know you're going to tell me to sell the car and use the money to finish my merged based on\nWhat is your and what is your car worth\nA private market is twenty three too I think\nAnd and you said you're twenty five and you're doing pretty well for yourself tell me what that means\nThat means I have a good job of got Twenty one thousand dollars invested a retirement a I have no credit card debt\nMhm what are you single I'm Single and what's your income\nBy income is about forty five fifty thousand dollars a year give or take a little bit with overtime\nIs this your only dead on the car that's not only that and how much do you do on it\n[noise] ah oh sixteen thousand two hundred and fifty two dollars and Twenty one steps\nAs a single guy can't you pay that in a year\nOr maybe you have no life but you get to keep the car no life you don't see the inside of a freaking restaurant unless you're working there\nI've been doing that day by the ... yeah I can I mean I've been doing everything and that but\nCan't I mean can you can probably pay sixteen thousand a year making fifty grand if you're single ...

Equifax\nHas been given a score it said we suck weight or at least all of our data to the entire world [laughter] that's the perfect score 'em\nAnd Experian doesn't have a short now I'm ... I don't think either one of these have a separate scoring rather than fight though I don't I'm I'm not aware experience ... doesn't show anything except psycho score on it\nWell maybe they have a\nProgram and I'm just not aware of it where there started their own score um or maybe Equifax ... facts as I don't care and oh by goes what are ...\nMillion more but um\nExcept their former president who made like a hundred and eighty billion dollars for a wedding uh but uh no uh I wouldn't worry about it I wouldn't worry about any of these scores by the way because they're all based on you borrowing money\nAnd so again it's a set of false logic it's bad critical thinking 'cause the only way you get a high cycle scores to borrow money and why do you get a high score so you can borrow

that would tell you know and all of\nIt yeah I think of it to my mom and so I started teaching financial ...\nI said yes I decided I needed something to keep keep me going and keep me keep the um momentum going so\nLuckily I'm also interested in the other part the part where it didn't work like when you first started you took it and you were like twenty three twenty four years old and it didn't take you didn't go crazy you didn't do this you waited a lot like six years before you\nGet mad as it did I got you got to ... what made the difference the causes which ... coming up\nThan it was close to ten years that I was getting closer to when I've been doing this chick ... a little bit against al at first I was a tortoise for a long time I heard of just going\nAs it as a teacher didn't make a whole lot of money and I started teaching at and you know two thousand nine and she does that mean if you were twenty six when you were fun\nYeah and I was doing some stuff and then I was using that credit card that I kept for emergency oh emergency is and I have a lot of the classes were candidates I took it again and now I teach it okay if I Need that\nYou know no you know do I do it shorter monsters you got the information you didn't apply it all before but then just like the fact that it's just not getting anywhere no traction in the decades coming up and that that got you fired up again is that right is that the right answer\nIs and I had to just to budget and had to kind of figure out the cash and telling telling my money where to\nGo and what like that doesn't take a decade took it took me a little while [laughter] no I just want to add to your wants to change this war to watch it and I think\nThat he wanted to do it and all of a sudden and when you want to do

Dick Powell and\nA Robert Montgomery and they were passionate Republicans and they went to work on him and so you can see the whole shift in the book it happens graduated but it it it happens decided

Wichita, Kansas Hi Benjamin how are you\nI'm doing well thank you for taking my call they sure what's up\nWell I have a question for you I'm I'm now considered uninsured rubble\nAnd my term life insurance will expire next year I'm In our ... there are some of us that are considered uninsured people so are one of my questions is what should we do\nInstead of term life insurance and in my case I already have accidental death insurance in place should I go ahead and can't hurt or keep it since I'm now can't get insurance\nHow old are you [noise] forty three why are you not in trouble\n[noise] history of diabetes I'm no longer diabetic but I I just got that diagnosis removed but I've had that in the past five years of my history\nOkay have you checked with Zander insurance and see what they can Roger\n[noise] we're in the process of having them do that kind of a double check\nOkay on dry up or something you know because you know every day that goes by you're going to be more and more in trouble in your situation so that's great news just ... hopefully as a short lived issue\nOkay because in other words I think I think you're gonna be able to get insurance I just don't know exactly when or what it's going to cost that's the other thing you gotta look at you or it could be unreasonable but I'm diabetes is a real tough\nDiagnosis for life insurance really tough so um anyway\nThe answer to your question overall as if someone's uninsured people yes you would keep accidental death at forty something years old you know the probability is accidental there would be your cause a except that you've had the diabetes issue\nUm but otherwise I mean you statistically that'd be the cause we don't recommend accidental death as you know but it's better than having no insurance\nRight so yeah I Would keep it and it's not that expensive because it's kinda gimmick insurance is what it is a definitely would keep any term or any whole life or anything that's in place as long as you can keep it don't okay you know to the very last moment and if you're a term is expiring see if they have you checked to see if they have a renewal and non medical renewal\nNo I have not I didn't know about those sometimes they do ah sometimes it's very very expensive uh but\nAgain you might be worth it or if you've got a non medical renewal it might just jump way up like triple or something what you're paying now kind of thing um so would you have like ten or twenty year term\nIt's run out right twenty or turn when we first got married yeah okay All right you know that that's um\nYeah you would see you would see it go up you just to buy a twenty year term at forty rather than at twenty obviously but in your case if we did a non medical renewal most of them have that so I Would check that that's the other thing then lastly or not lastly the next thing I Would do is just start looking around for a gimmick type none\nThey are not lastly the next thing I Would do is just start looking around for a gimmick type non medical policies policies that don't check medical and that's like ten thousand dollars issued through your bank or with your checking account\nI had a question for you in regards to um\nOur the papers the salary ... my husband has traditionally been tricked position I'm aware or it can be getting into the race but with that the rave there I'm saying that he also has that they're going to be transitioning him into salary pay she usually work\nFive and twenty hours of overtime each week so I wanted to make sure that when he they haven't given him an art form I forget that when they do want it to make sure that\nYou recommend to calculate whether the salary rate is comparable with sampled the record she was working before he would get what overtime\nWhich sounds like it would be simple you've been working Fifteen to twenty hours a week last year extra and you've been paid for that in overtime correct\nCorrect\nAnd so what was his income last year including the overtime\nWith about forty thousand and how will that compared to the salary but that's the kind that we don't know yet\nConservatives salary if the salary is fifty that's raised if the salary is forty five and the same number of hours which gets effect of Lee a pay cut\nRight\nYes does that make sense it's like yeah like as we were I was kind of weird because it's just more since we're in the ... member cheer mhm um I Know that he has the potential to work more hours so because of that I was kind of\nVery yeah about it but the question the question and it's not just more hours the question is is this a good deal for him apples to apples not a ... and ... and has he got the chance to move up in the company because he moved to salary\nYes he's going to be moving to management condition\nNo but I mean for for up later oh okay but let's say let's say they offer him fifty five as a salary or sixty is a salary\nWill we be dancing wouldn't we\nYeah okay 'cause that's like that's like getting paid a lot more and I'm working the same number of hours you know like ... it's almost like he picked up more hours but then after work I'm usually what I'm saying but it but again if they want to give him a salary and act like they did in my favor and it's a and and he gets paid forty\nBut he's worked in the same number of hours where he's working when he's making forty eight then that's not a blessing\nYeah they're just making sense to you\nYeah that makes sense\nIf it's even if it's forty eight to forty eight we still like the salary because of the upward potential\nOkay that's a long term good career movies moving into leadership in the management and that's where he wants to head toward its long term\nBut um you know\nYes but but again you just compare it to last year's income so the whole thing comes down to how does it compare to forty eight thousand\nWhat's the salary do 'cause that's what he was making working the hours that he's going to continue to be working apparently Chris is with us from Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Chris how are you\nI'm doing good day thanks taking my call sure what's up\n[noise] uh well right now I'm a I'm like income about thirty one thousand dollars a year [noise] I've got a fourteen hundred dollars in credit card debt\nA battle eleven thousand a student loan debt that uh that that about six months ago was right about Nineteen thousand ... I've been working working hard you know what I'm saving my money and paying it off as much as I can good or not across right now\nI came up with the idea for an invention ... and I don't know whether to keep you know steam rolling my debt plan and doing all that are just you know kind of jump ship and say hey this is something that could you know be my future and potentially mhm\n[noise] so [noise] I mean it kind of want a you know maybe your financial advice from you know what to do with the remaining that I have ... and you know my aspiration because I'm In the process I've been saving to ah get to be a home loan shift about their ... any advice you can give me I'd be greatly appreciated\nRight well I'm going to avoid buying a home until I got the debt cleared the only question is then how can we start working on the invention idea and make some money now 'cause we don't need to make a a bunch of money five years from now we need some money today\nOne around twenty thousand dollars today show the invention you came up with a physical product\nYes sir it's a a odor the odor either slash a mold a little small machine that um people getting on their own\nOkay and you've made one\nI just made a very um rudimentary prototype mhm the next the next phase I've got is like either dip into my rainy day fund started coming in my regular cash flow and like buying a computer and get my three D. modeling and give me a couple of silicon prototype so I can go you know take it to a yeah thanks\nAnd give me a couple of silicon prototype so I can go you know take it to a you know take the next level or what I Want to do so again like jump off my my debt plan more do I get mine Vinton [laughter]\nOkay um well what you're talking about you could spend anywhere from twenty five dollars to a two hundred and fifty thousand dollars on it there's really no in between I mean you could just go anywhere you want to go with this there's a lot of money to be spent on something like this\nAnd if you were a billionaire and you you know what you would do is you would build a couple of 'em and you get them out there and test them and make sure that they work and that you there was a market for it before you went into production\n... because you don't go into production on prototypes that are on tested or from an R and D standpoint or you don't go into production on something that I've got no market for it not been able to sell it\nBecause you can let you make a hundred thousand of them and having them in your basement if you had unlimited sums ever be able to show\nYou know ... I'd like trying to ah continue to do with the way you're doing it and that's just piece it together and let's build one and let's find somebody to put one in there in the property and a commercial applications\nAnd let's say let me give me just let's just make up a pretend example okay here would be like your ideal thing you build one or two in your garage and you'd convince these guys look this looks rough we're not looking at the ... the form of it we're looking at the function of it I just want to show you that the idea works\nAnd if the deal works then I'm what I'm going to want you to his place in order for ten of 'em or thirty of them or a hundred of them for for all of your locations okay and you find somebody like that that's got an upside to test it and then if a place that order that just plays for the pause it with you large enough to build the order\nMhm and it finds itself\nThat's called organically cash flowing something in other words you you prove it to somebody who's going to be a big customer and they place an order with enough of a deposit to fill the manufacturer your first order out\n[noise] they they got you dial down my rather than just spend all my extra capital towards paying out my credit card debt and my student loans that\nI don't think ... and much capital on this you've already we're already built one in the garage yeah build another one okay maybe a couple of hundred bucks right [noise]\nWell I ... in that but I I just see I'm a protecting us I Want it to be you know a good good looking kind of\nThat's another it's probably there are no protections [laughter] very they're very purpose of a prototype despite all the crap that's broken [laughter]\nI don't want to get it perfect you're going to put it out there in the end the marketplace is going to kick it around and you're going to learn foreman function changes informants function changes in the switch has to be on that side of this which has to be made out of this was to that and you're only going to learn that if you beat up about a hundred of them but let's get two of 'em in somebody's restaurant\nIn there to restaurants and they got a hundred they can put them in later or two of them in somebody's industrial application and they've got um you know they've got forty more they will order if it works because it's the best thing since sliced bread I got to have the ... I'm ...\nAnd then they give you enough money\nIn their deposits for the initial order for you to do your manufacturing and basically you got almost nothing out of pocket except your brain power and you're sweating and your smile out there selling it and that's how a lot of these things get off the ground\nOr the way a lot of people lose a lot of money on them is they go into mass production or something is proven into the marketplace for the actual prototypes\nAnd you're talking to a guy's lost some money that way so stupid stuff so [noise] do easy man go easy this was the day Ramsey show\nFor years and one of the most asked questions I get is day one are you going to do a live event in our city\nWith a radio show and book tours and are growing company and family time I wish I could be more places but it's just physically not possible that is until now on Thursday November the fifteenth Chris Hogan and I will be live streaming our smart money event directly to you\nThat's right from the comfort of your own home you can watch the event that walk chew through the plan that's helped millions get out of debt and retire with dignity a plan that focuses your money on what matters most\nSo whether you've seen this event before and you want to get re energized or you've always wished we would come to your town where we want you to be part of this it's time to live more and worry less\nAnd those nine weeks you know we've had stories folks come up to us and and and and one of the older gentleman or a class with tears in his eyes just saying you know I've never ...\nTo my life and and I'm doing this and it's working I'm seeing I'm going to follow just for a while just it blesses you and your name man it's more than the facts the figures in the math it it's really changing lives I I Wish we could put our Congress\nThe figures in the math that it's really changing lives I I Wish we could put our Congress drift ...

pay bills and take care of yourself and your family if something were to happen preterm life you need to carry ten to twelve times your income and I recommend Fifteen or twenty year plans for most
