you\nI'm doing well do you think of it taking my call sure man what's up in your work\nWell uh my wife and I sat down and realize that we're on a bad road for future and decided to really take over or an aunt that lives in ... the thing you\nWould like to you we recently heard them online and had a friend who did that we watch videos and ... on line there from there and so you know you step into right now we're currently saving for big step one\nAnd we have a total that her loan and consumer credit card debt of Seventeen thousand nine hundred dollars [noise]\nMy question is I'm including in the Seventeen I went ahead and rolled in our second mortgage that we purchased on the home we just moved into a total of two thousand one hundred and thirty five dollars go\nIn my mind um from what I've learned in working that's on calling it was should I role in that second mortgage my reason why I think that is because that's been lower um our bills won't pay that off too\n[noise] um\nOur bills once I pay that off to your your second mortgage it'll two thousand dollars\nA year or so my wife and I just recently got into her second how\nYoung guy so crude one if you have a two thousand dollar second mortgage yes it's part of your debt snowball and baby step to\nOkay good I was just curious I wasn't sure if that would be the best way to continue to attack\nIs to have you here for a week or two daughters yeah if it's\nIf it's under half your annual income on a second mortgage we always suggest you put it in your debt snowball and a man that's an unbelievably small ones so thank you congratulations well done and I mean just knock it out and I'm I'm Glad you're attacking this it's going to work for you\nDebbie is with us in Anchorage, Alaska Hi Debbie welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nUm I had a question about whether it would be wise and maybe that's not a good way to finance our house to pay a credit card [noise] mhm [noise] I'm not a void of\nBankruptcy how much credit card that have you got thirty four hobby okay and what's your household income [noise]\nA hundred and forty\nYeah no I Would not cause see when you refinance your house and you put a credit card debt on with the house\nThere's two or three problems with that one is the debt didn't go away you just moved I just moved to allow gay okay the second thing is is the credit card debt is not the problem is the symptom of you living without a budget and overspending would you agree with that\nFor taking my call uh my wife and I were moving out to a San Diego station out there or we have to pay for house here in Pensacola and um I Know you normally\nSay not to buy a house if you're in the military\nUm but as make good money last two times I've done it and I am uncomfortable having my whole network in [noise] in the stock market basically because we'd be looking at the house about three hundred fifty K. um you know we have three hundred and Fifteen cayenne retirement already in [noise]\nBut I Would have to take a two hundred twenty five K. and non retirement investments in order to be able to afford a house up there and also you know I don't want everything in the stock market so don't want everything in one house especially if I'm only going to live their short time and I wanted to know your life [noise] [noise]\n[noise] um I don't have a problem with you not wanting everything in the stock market I Would not long distance landlord in order to accomplish\nMy goals though so you're talking about keeping the homeless by foreign Pensacola when you moved to San Diego is that what you're telling me\nYou know sure we have it on the market I I I only to cash out of this now is on really they're going to help while they sell for three fifty\nOkay and uh you're not going to be able to buy anything in San Diego for three fifty\nMalone not unless I catch something on retirement investments should ah you know at two twenty five ... you know I can afford something out there\nHow much do you have in on retirement is that all you've got a to point hiking on retirement talking about a half million dollar house then yes or what's your household income\nOr about one eighty okay\nThe reason we tell folks to not buy in the military in most cases is because you're not in the home long enough for it to appreciate enough\nTo sell it and make a profit and also sometimes some military markets have an oversupply of homes on the market they're hard to resell\nSo you get stuck in it and you lose money on it in some markets in Pensacola would not be one of those markets usually and certainly San Diego would not be one of those market you're going to see incredible appreciation and incredible market activity\nIn both of those markets you should so so you should be able to get out of this and make a profit on the one you bought there and that's what it sounds like you're doing\nAnd you should be able to do the same in San Diego and I do agree real estate prices are up substantially um\nI'm not sure that you have to use all of that I Would probably if I were in your shoes what what I Do if I woke up in your shoes or I Would either a rent or be I Would pay cash for whatever I bought in San Diego\nAnd that would mean one of two things that neither one of which are going to be comfortable one is I'm not gonna I'm not going to spend as much as you're talking about spending instead of been spending five hundred maybe four hundred and leave a hundred and non retirement\nUm or I'm I'm just going to get comfortable in order to have a house like that with having no non retirement investing until I re sell this house now\nIf you re sell this house let's say you bought it for five Seventy five or five fifty use up all your cash a non returned my character and money from this other home\nAnd it goes up to seven hundred when you sell it you're probably next move moving to a cheaper market\nThere's not any more expensive markets for you to move to in the military\nThan San Diego\nI mean Hawaii Hawaii maybe okay\nThan San Diego\nThat's about the ... I mean Hawaii ... Hawaii maybe okay but uh there there's a couple of other main there's one or two but most of the markets would be well most markets in general not just naval markets but markets in general would be cheaper than San Diego I think we can all agree to that so if you make some money and you're there are three years\nAnd you sell out you're going to put money back in non retirement investing in by a less expensive home may be a larger home but less expensive home the next by and the next station does that make sense yes or the\nSo it's not really a permanent decision even if you use all your non returned my cash although I'm with you I don't think I'd want to use it all I'd probably try to buy something\nIn the foreign hundreds instead of in the five hundreds leaving me with some cash\nAnd non non retirement investing a but the point at your point you're making is from my portfolio standpoint I don't like it all in one house and I don't like it all and I don't like so much of it being um I don't like using up all my non retirement investing from a portfolio standpoint my answer to that is is not for that long\nYou're not going to be there ten years\nAnd if you are that that makes us going to change during that ten years\nUh but if you're not then you're going to reset your mix when you buy a different type of real is different expense of real estate in the next next location that your station I thank you for serving your country sounds like you're doing a good analysis on it I'm just kind of joining you in the discussion Jason is with us from Tucson, Arizona Hi Jason how are you\nHow you doing better than I deserve what's up\nI I own my own business and I'm not trying to figure out how not to be climbing on their horses when I'm ... years old but ... retirement should I go or oh\nOkay well you need to start or retirement and I guess\nI Do you ... well the first thing we teach folks to do is to get out of debt and have an emergency fund before you start retirement and the reason is because if you don't have any payment you are more money\nFreed up to put into retirement and then we want you to put Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement Jason what do you make a year\nAh it down around a lot I average probably right about a thousand a week\n[noise] okay so somewhere around fifty grand a year okay the affair and how old are you\nI'm thirty four and okay good do you have any debt no good for you or you're single okay okay does your wife work outside the home\nYet nurse machine make a right about that made it okay All right so you got about a hundred and twenty thousand dollar household income and no data\nAnd you're thirty four years old well done well we want to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses that grandma's rainy day fund and then we would tell you to put Fifteen Percent of your household income\nInto retirement and that's going to be about Eighteen thousand dollars a year in your case going into retirement and now you're asking how to fund that if if she as a nurse has a thorough three B or four one K. available at our hospital or a doctor's office you would put some money there especially if there's a match\nAnd then you both need to do a Roth IRA you can do five thousand five hundred each that's eleven thousand dollars of the Eighteen that we need to be putting in right there\nAnd put that in good growth stock mutual funds and Jason to help you set that up and teach you how it works just 'cause you need to learn how it works you don't do it because I said do it or someone else said do you do it because you understand it and you don't buy something you don't understand when it comes to investing\nThat I recommend good growth stock mutual funds for your long term investing in your ... in your

mutual fund every month and if you do that for Thirty years you're going to be a multi millionaire\nMulti millionaire if you fully fund to ... from age thirty four to eight sixty five you will be a

hard at the beginning to go from letting our money kind of flow out wherever and to really nail down a budget and during the envelope system and that was hard for me to\nThink for me it's just the the sacrifice um you know in the world we live in just the spirit of comparison and just seeing everyone around do spend money and buying mood nice things and I'm just constantly telling ourselves that will be later and you know when we went through the class and I know it's kind of what you always say but it really\nIt's been embedded in me is just you know live like no one else so that you can live like no one else in a really close to that because there were times where we wanted to give up or they would have been easy to just you know do what we wanted but [noise]\nUm to be here now to be

most amazing thing ah yeah and and you know but those guys are out there in the heat and the cold and rainy those gals I mean they're running up and down on the run up and down that's why I've been there\n\nAs somebody waiting your table how it's been since you carried a hundred pounds or the dirty dishes on a tray over your head\nI'll give you a back ache about doing it all day you just don't leave somebody to help that's giving by wind 'cause you know I learned it oh shut up you Tightwad you wonder why you're\nI I was there and said oh shut up you Tightwad you wonder why you're broke country type\nB outrageously ... it's a sign of people who are winning with money generous people are highly attractive people every body wants to be around not because they want their money but just because there are people that smile ever noticed that selfish people never smile they looked like they were wind on a pickle\n\nOutrageous generosity and gratitude contentment staying out of debt living on less than you make saving money for emergencies and to change your family tree\nA hundred thousand is student loans and the balance will be a credit card debt\nWe recently met with a financial adviser and they suggested that we filed for bankruptcy because they would take us a long time to pay off the bat they suggested that saying that it will be better for us to just start fresh and I just wanted a second opinion\nWhat is your household income sure\nOh combined it's about eighty five\nOkay you have any car debt\n... mhm I'm no we don't our cars are paid off okay what are your car's worth um\nI Would say about\nTwenty thousand combined\nOkay All right well here's the facts that the quote unquote financial advisor didn't know um apparently or he wouldn't have given you such stupid but advise student loans are not bankrupt double\n\nHere we've been talking about that during the conversation they never go away but he was just thinking entirely because of the amount of credit card that we have\nFound like our ability and really have a light a match wait a minute this moron suggested your bankrupt with thirty four thousand dollar for the credit card debt with a household income of eighty five thousand that's absurd dude that's what I was thinking\nThat's absurd because the ... the the hundred thousand dollars for a student loan doesn't change anything because it's going to be there regardless if it's an automatic reputable so we're dealing with you're going to file bankrupt jumped thirty four thousand dollars making eighty five no you should pay it off in one year\nAnd a year\nYeah one year live on fifty pay it off in one year take six extra jobs shell so much stuff you can't breeze no eating out no vacations and you're a hundred percent debt free in one year what are your car's worth\nThe work world corner OK each\nUm her to a newer model over oh they're so\nProud of ours are working are hers hers is worth what about Thirteen thousand mine of about seven mhm\nOkay\nWell um you can do what you want to do I if I woke up in your shoes I have to tell you I've worked with families that were in dire straits over the years that were forced into bankruptcy you're not one of those\nIf you choose to file bankruptcy is just cause you to get young lazy to address the situation let's say even say you did it over two years it's only Seventeen five a year\nAnd your debt free other than your student loan which I'm not talking about the student loans will be gone in one year I'm Talking about the credit card data big on on your\nShow how fast do normal people that call the Dave Ramsey show that work our plan pay off a hundred and thirty four thousand dollars making eighty five about four years probably\n... yeah\nThat's the normal routine for people around here that would be student loans and everything and um you know I I Would not move down in the car initially\nOut of your wife's car into a into a six thousand dollar or five thousand dollar car initially I might end up doing that as we go along we'll see how it goes what do you do for a living sir\nI'm operations manager\nI'm okay and what does she do for a living through the pastor\nOkay All right cool um does she ever do any outside speaking for money\n\nI'm no she knows the wedding but that's about it\nGun or does she do speaking I mean I mean he says she speak on Sunday Morning\nYeah see that's just under okay All right\nI mean I Wonder if if you know she might feel do some ... occasionally for somebody that was ill or on sabbatical or something in that congregation pay or a little bit or maybe she works and evangelists to outrage and they pay you are a little bit first baking skills or maybe dot dot dot you do something I don't know\nI mean if you add ten Fifteen thousand dollars a year to this equation\nSomething I don't know I mean if you add ten Fifteen thousand dollars a year to this equation\nOf income and you guys tightened down your budget than nothing I mean nothing where you have no life because we're gonna clean this mess up you know you can clean up the whole thing in four years maybe three but four for sure\nUh any clear up those student loans really really really fast as a part of that equation I'm Sorry the credit card debt as a part of that equation really really fast but you got to cut them up you've got to quit using them and you got to stop living the way you been living goes is not working agreed\nOn despair is that makes sense for like you know\nThe Bible says that no discipline seems\nPleasant at the time but it yields harvest of righteousness you guys make good money so I Know you're not stupid people you're\nNot dumb or you're not dumb you just been doing some dumb things which makes you just like most of it was added a lot of dumb things in my lab dude I'm with money in particular as high end up teaching is 'cause I got a PHD in to you and be\nBut um you know I don't I don't know who it was they gave you this advice but you need to stay away from them\nAs they gave you really really bad advice that's my opinion I think you could not only can work through this I think you should work through this I think it'll be a testimony to God's power and you're all his life that you turn this around and that you attack at an attack at an attack in and that you can start having\nA sense of self control the sense of discipline and it'll change your marriage on communication levels it will lower the stress when you're working the plan together\nAnd you can do anything how old are you guys\nA cure twenty eight I'm I just turned thirty two\nExcellent show when you're thirty six and she's thirty two year debt free as I feel\nSorry for the you know life no vacation no eating out for a short period of time for a short period of time or\nYou live like no one else\nShow that later you can live and give like no one else think about what how ... how much money you would have and how well the you could become and how generous you could be if you didn't have any payments right now\nOh my gosh\nLike about the piece that wouldn't be in your house the stress that would be gone so it's worth it to pay a price to win but there's a price to pay the price of ... you got to your own home and you don't get out of\nA whole by jumping out usually you climb out\nScratching and clawing pool and dirt under your fingernails you know what I'm saying you can do this map I'll help you I'll help you don't want you to go through our non white class on how to handle money and I'm going to pay for it\nIt's called financial peace university you hold on and all have Kelly pick up and we'll get you and your your wife signed up I'll show you how to file bankruptcy you are not bankrupt not even close thanks for the call open\nPhones a AAA eight to five five two to five you joined us America we're glad you are here Robin follows me on Twitter at Dave Ramsey which is wise or David lump sum pension\nAnd a roll over or\nMonthly annuity checks\nWell the lump sum and rolling it directly to an IRA where there is no taxes in good growth stock mutual funds\nThat will cause you to make more money monthly than the monthly annuity check would have been because it is based on a lower rate of return to the mutual fund tripper format and when\nYou die with a pinch and the money's gone when it goes to pinch in heaven not the your heirs\nGoing euro or take the lump sum narrow it over and an Iranian I\nStill there when he died [noise] goes to your heirs [noise] so you make a higher rate of return while you're alive and they one hundred percent higher rate of return [noise] when you die [noise] there's a piece of money in our age they'll they're so you're saying [noise]\nAlways some rollovers mutual funds direct transfer into [noise] good IRA so that with mutual fund so they don't have any taxes\n[noise]\n\n\n\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care if the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just getting rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely\nLegally and forever is with time share exit team they have offices all around the country where you can sit down face to face and review your contract to\nFind a solution they've accepted thousands of timeshare owners this year alone\nThey're the best in the business because they simply a more options for exit than anyone else it could be a long process\nBut there with you every step of the way and timeshare exit teams so confident in their exit service that if they don't get you out you get a full\nThat yeah and ... and again it doesn't have to be permanent and it's not like oh it's a great house so we're just going to relax I that's the thing I don't want to do here I don't want to just accept defeat\nI don't mind moving down you know pulling back to get back behind the wall and but now we're going to fight again we're back behind the wall you know we we can you know we're not taking fire were not you know we got we're back undercover again okay would retreat enough to get undercover in the battle but we're not gonna ... we're not going to surrender\nTo the to that we want to take that ground back again someday\nBut for today are are for the next two years or whatever it takes to turn it around absolutely I make this move\nDefinitely make that move it all sounds very logical to me good question all ride Derek with us in Phoenix, Arizona Hi Derek welcome to the day Ramsey\nShow failing on his honor to talk to you then have you too sir how can I help\nYeah you're while you're taught a moneymaker her book or just changed our lives I got it as a wedding gift and it was the best wedding gift we implemented it\nAnd pay off twenty thirty thousand dollars a day and months and then that ... ... so it's been awesome good um [noise] my question to you need your help with this because sometimes I feel like I'm controlled by fear and over stinking when do you quit your day job which is good\nTo go fulltime entrepreneurial or\nDo you have the full time job or do you have the entrepreneur gig running [noise]\nYeah that's what my wife does she sells the clothing for that um [noise] and she's doing very good at it and so I work for a local government here in town a mechanic just trying to figure out when that time is to leave that retirement and benefits of security\nYou wouldn't believe it was her the mechanics thing to sell women's clothing [noise] the [noise] school because she are you already involved in the business\nYes she's been selling it for a year and a half um she's she's kill it she she makes in one week would I make a gross in a month as a mechanic mhm um so I Would be going fulltime helping her with English ing and shipping in the back office stuff while she tells all the dresses and scourge\n... and ... and and what do you make a make fifty two thousand a year\nYou can't hire somebody cheaper and fifty two thousand dollars a year to work in the back off a ship and stuff\nWould that be the best route to go as\nWell at least ten okay you walk away from fifty in order to do a job you could have hired somebody for twenty to do\nThat ... short\nWell she she grows says she's crossed two hundred ten thousand so far this year\nI don't care what your groceries okay unless you're going to add more to her business in savings okay or in revenue than what you are making now then it's not making sense\nOkay 'cause grossing two hundred and ten is fine as long as your expenses aren't three hundred and ten\nNo yeah she's got costs of goods sold out of that that's not profit we're talking about there yeah ... is is around a hundred thousand out of that she's going to have taxable income of a hundred K. and she needs somebody to do are shipping\nShe needs a lot of helps you were working two full time jobs that were working from eight AM to an eleven twelve sometimes mhm\nOkay\nSo the question then becomes what are you gonna add not can you quit okay so it's just a business perspective because the other thing is scaring me here is if if this thing a ... out on\nYou then you're both out of work if you quit yes\nIf it flamed out on you if the fad passes on this particular clothing line five years from today is this thing still operating this multi level deal right\nUh well we're I guess you'd call multi level\nMarketing and I would call him ... it's on network marketing thing your recruiting people\nKnow that's that's the misnomer a that's a misconception of ... I buy wholesale\nFinancial retail just like a discount ... Cooper Tires I don't like All right I well you don't recruit people\nBuy you can but yeah you can\nAlso okay so seriously moment [noise] um no I I Would hire somebody to do the shipping twenty thousand first and then when it gets so big and you're making so much money [noise]\nThat that you can't see you buy you win the money and he won with then that's fine but right now I think you're caught up in the Hi\nThis is a rancher show\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family is the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't\nBig difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed\nPaying for the mortgage utilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement\nThat's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting term life insurance just go to Sandra insurance dot com or called eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two and see how inexpensive it really is the the family that takes those deliberate steps to be different and responsible\nIt really does make you the hero of your story and it puts you on course for better things ahead\nAs well go weather today\nOr updates\n... by Margot cloudy skies today and then tonight partly cloudy alone thirty four\nWednesday mostly Saudi him since he wins out of the west in five ...

of choice I'm Dave Ramsey your host you jump in and we'll talk about your life your money it is a free\nCall AAA eight to five five two to five Brandon starts this hour in Phoenix, Arizona Hi Brandon how are you\nOn better than I deserve but a little confused oh how can I have [laughter] well my wife and I would get ... for our house mhm and we've got a one and a half year old little boy yeah hey and we want to\n[laughter] we want to plan approved college but before he goes to college\nYou're most likely for our faith going to sort of a two year mission right and I know that probably doesn't apply to the ah the college savings plans ...\nWe've got a chunk of money right now about seven thousand dollars that we're going to put somewhere but we're trying to decide whether we should put it down on a mortgage which one way or the other will be paid off before he goes yeah by a couple of good ah or should we give them something um\nWho could build up that the future mission in college fund\nGotcha okay and your debt free except your home correct in addition\nTo the seven thousand dollars do you have an emergency fund a rainy day fund up three to six months of expenses\nWe'd do you how much is in that about\nGood okay well you're out what we call baby step for five and six baby step ones with thousands saved too is that free but tiles\nThree is a fully funded emergency fund baby step for is putting Fifteen Percent of your household income into retirement which you should just start doing that as a part of your savings you're investing plan right now maybe step five is kids college and beyond that\nSix is pay extra on the house as you can as fast as you can show what I Would do with this money is I Would hear a market for school and mission trip\nBecause you guys are obviously LDS right we are you OK\nCool so what what I'm going to do is say out of the seven thousand I'm probably going to drop five thousand of it into a five twenty nine for my one and a half year old into a good growth stock mutual fund that's all for college has to be used for college take the other two thousand and just sat\nIn a mutual fund in your name no big deal just regular mutual fund in your name and you just on the file when you drop the paperwork into a file right mission trip on the file\nBut it's just earmarked for that it's in your name your controlling the money and if everything goes as planned and he's going to do is to your mission dripping ... then that two thousand will grow into enough to help him do that the other five thousand you'll add to it periodically throughout his life\nSo that there's enough in there for him to go to college when it comes back from mission trip\nOff of that but when I had not thought about what it out like that\nBut um we got an offer to get the care taking condition and the guys have died a four hundred dollars a month to take care of him they Asian home I'm In the same town me when\nI'm doing a lot at home\nOr do we keep it and continue making payment on it\nIt's not completed\nWell we're at a point I paint and flooring\nAnd you're living in it\nNo no um well we were living in a mobile home um but then I got that offered to live in this house basically for free and he paid ... here and take care of\nI got that are okay so that's why that's so you've never lived in this other house\nNow okay it's gonna be a little tough to sell it and the condition that sand yeah like they can't get financing on it right so you're going to take a weapon or what will it take money wise to finish it\nUm\nWhat never had a professional answer on that but probably at at eight thousand ten thousand dollar yeah and what is your household income um well my husband he worked forty hours a week what her household income [noise]\nProbably thirty seven thousand a year\nOkay so your husband's the only one working well we have a ... um that doesn't make it out and running but it doesn't make money\nGiven comments about twenty five thousand and other than that makes about Fifteen thousand nearly\nOkay\nAnd then getting the care taking condition or they'll be making about forty eight hundred cash but we get housing for free\nYeah I got that part until you get until he decides he doesn't want you to care take anymore and then you don't have housing for free anymore ... so I mean he could walk into more and fire you\nPretty much\nI changed my mind and then you you have a housing issue again right right so um you have any idea what the house you have shorter built would bring as it is\nUm [noise] well we had an appraisal and if it were completed it would be about a hundred and sixty thousand\nIt's mark completed so probably a hundred and fifty hundred and twenty five\nNo no not if it's not completed it won't know um because you you it's a further discounts and the cost it takes to complete it it's a lot further discount because basically the typical consumer cannot bothers house\nOkay because they don't have any money and they're trying to get a mortgage and they can't get a mortgage on this house\nAnd so that limits your in but they didn't limit your selling tool to investors and they're going to discount that a lot deeper than that if you get a hundred out of there should be flying I'm thinking so um [noise] how much will be borrowed against it so far\n[noise] the house itself we owe thirty thousand but they're from property attached to it all together in a hundred thousand\nYou owe a hundred thousand against the house and the property yeah which would bring a hundred and sixty if it were fixed if you sold the property as well\nYeah okay All right\nYeah I I Would look at trying to pick up the other ten thousand dollars and an additional loan and get this house finished and let's get it so as soon as possible\nAnd then just continue signing money and power we yeah\nWe all have you know I should have some equity in your pocket at that point I mean I'm not a ton but you're going to get a little money out of it so you know it it just hasn't worked out for you you realize that right yeah you've got way too many hours in this house\nAnd and really didn't get much out of it went all the smoke clears here right you'll get a little bit but it's not it's not it's not worked out very good so you know you're going to have to reset that and then the second thing I'm going to tell you is you guys need look at your income\nBecause your household income as you I'm very very low income\nAnd ah so I I Want to think about careers what can we do to get our income up long term and I want to think about some part time jobs in the meantime but um yeah I Would get the house finished up I'm saving scratching and clawing painting and [noise]\nYou know if you borrow three thousand bucks or something that's fine but let's let's try and get it sold as fast as possible now if the land is such that you can sell off a piece of the land without selling the house in order to have the money to finish the house that's what I Would do first ... showing acre also corner use that money to face\nThat's what I Would do first ... showing acre\nOff the corner use that money to finish the house then get the household and that way there's no more debt involved\nOlivia is with us in Lexington high Olivia how are you going to hire you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] and I had a question and I had never can amount of debt and and I'm running at our family [noise] um about an hour so in recovery for and it actually and and part of that is going to pay so [noise]\nAnd I hear your regular income ... ... budget and\nPet therapy at the end it's likely not going to get aid and how kind of scared to quit that I'm not really sure way to put it in the budget [noise]\nOr how big of a priority like how long you been clean and have any good for you ... what is it [noise] and sex addiction and wonder okay all\nRight well no I'm not going to put therapy on hold right now there's just something you need you need some accounts for a walk with you as you finish this life transformation and that that is essential to you having a life\nWould you agree with that statement [laughter] now\nWhat I Would do is is number one it's not a permanent situation um the therapies not permanent is not going to be there the rest of your life\nFifty years from now you're not going to still be going to the therapist okay I Hope [noise] um and then uh otherwise therapist is not very good [laughter] but ah at some point you'll you'll pull back from that and the second thing will happen is is that as you continue to address your income\nInjure outgo you're going to find ways to make more income and as you are more emotional healing\nYou're going to feel more energized to make more income\nAnd so if this month you don't pay any extra on the debt Richard Pryor therapy good\nIf next month the same thing happens okay\nBut by this time next year we ought to be making more money right let's do something let's kick her life in gear and let's start to clean up the mess to ... for today Seventy five whole days you been clean\n[noise] that's a great start right but it's not like you told me you've been clean for two years\nMhm by the time you're going for two years we ought to be have different having a different conversation about the money would that make sense to you [noise] so let's get Hugh healed and then let's see oh your money\nAnd her as you and it's not going to be suddenly like a switch flips and you go OK I'm OK Now getting the money no it's not all or nothing it's going to be gradual it'll be incremental\nYou'll feel better you you know when you're Ninety Days or your four months you ought to feel different than you feel right now and you ought to be able to do more and make more and save more and more and\nYou know you you all have more focus on the money 'cause you'll be more he you'll have to spend less severe emotional energy just coming through this right now your game on just getting through this is that right mhm yeah [laughter] okay well I Want you to finish turning the corner you turn the corner you're finished turned the corner and let's let's gone out and then as\nYou make incremental progress move more and more than money from your new in Germany or increased income to\nThe debt size but for the day we want to take care of Libya\nYou need to be taken care of\nYou're doing a good job yourself\nThis or whatever I'm sure [noise]\nHow often do you look at your bank account and wonder where all your money went how often or you're stressed about bill's afraid your paycheck will last a whole month you shouldn't have to live like that you shouldn't feel powerless over your money and you don't have to you can take control of your money\nWith the financial ... your membership you learn to manage your daily finances pay off debts spin and save wisely and invest for your future if you follow the scores\nAnd do the stuff we teach it works every single time in fact the average person pays off fifty three hundred dollars in debt and saves twenty seven hundred dollars and the first Ninety Days\nBut this is so much more than a month course it's about changing the course of your life\nKnow I'm a we've been discussing a special needs trust or oil that has to play in planning for a baby's future yeah your animal ...\nSure uh originally a kind of had that chopped up in my mind is that that special needs stress kind of function the same way that the other boys have a college fund and baby step five\nUm the uh and that we would you know we'd be saving for all three of them but the one would have some some special condition special rules because of course\nAll three of them but the one would have some some special condition special rules because of course ah you know his his features are boring sport too early to know what is your fully what it means we've been blessed but he's\nHe's healthy developing well you know there's this guy to limit for him just like anyone mhm um and we don't have to uh [noise] uh you know which are truly didn't know if he ever have any on occasions but uh but now it's one of them get into it and we haven't found anything quite yet\nBut it would come down to the wire one thing but I'm not comfortable with is that you know if I start investing any money on the Charles I I lose control of that to the trustee that we've named and while while I trust the truck the inability to go with I Wish that makes me uncomfortable\nNo you don't you don't need a special needs trust and lost both of you die right the special needs trust does not need to be funded prior to your dad okay so that\nThat was on its rounded from your wealth or your life insurance until you've got wealth\nOkay\nAnd it's not ... I wouldn't even have it formed except upon both deaths both of you dying okay as long as I Want to have you with a live as long as one of us alive to manage your ass that's one of the things you're going to do is care for this child\nWho out of those ashes now that the when the trust is needed is if both of you die it gives the trustee me the the the the direction on how to handle the assets and disperse them to take care of this child's needs\nAnd um and what that needs to be is a a big hairy term life insurance policy that ... that is the beneficiary of it is that special needs trust or a
