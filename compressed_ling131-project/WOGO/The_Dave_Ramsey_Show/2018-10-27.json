about your project\nStrict wallpaper in our kitchen entrance down the sheet rock and we'd like to uh put texture in it but I'd like to do it as soon as possible so after a short and bank\nAnd I like more information about that or what you recommend\nIt is possible right Leslie to use an additive in pay but frankly usually get the opposite question most people calls wanting to take the texture away so [laughter] so I Would say Cindy or you're really sure you want to do this because once it gets on there it's hard to make it to make it go away\nWhy yes I mean our other walls have some texture I mean and that's not a heavy texture it's just a little bit and I can just not the flat sheet rock\nAnd it's a texture and the painter is an actual texture within the drywall itself almost like a ...\nWhile I'd rather not go that route as the the the step one nurse back when\nUm I'd like to add texture to the pain just to give the wall something other than the drywall well\nThere's a couple of different techniques that you can use 'em first there's something called the linen technique that's done with almost like a wallpaper brash sort of a very short\nStiff bristle that's you know maybe twelve inches to Eighteen Inches wide and you put the paint on and then you shouldn't drag that brush through and that gives you a linear texture to it and that can kind of look like wallpaper and you can do it with one color or do a base color and then let that dry and then\nPut a thinner coat on top and then dragged outlined through um you can do something that's almost call it I guess it is actually called the Venetian plaster but that involves you know sort of marveling the texture on and and furnishing it and rubbing and it really is a heavier coat of paint and plaster but that gives a really interesting sort of\nCloudy textural look that sometimes has a high shine to it\nUm there's this waited texture I think Ralph Lauren is one of the pain that makes that\nAnd that has um it really does look like sway that has that sort of like rub softer not looking texture to it there's a standard finished with there's actual sand in the pain sometimes I can feel a little rough almost like a sand paper\nBut I'm back of the nice texture to they all in different application techniques so if I were looking at a paint that has a specific texture and homo center and make sure that I really read the directions and looked at what that manufacture was recommending for the application process and get those correct tools and do the proper prep work for it because some of those textures or\nYou know kind of labor intensive for the wire and you want to make sure you get it right\nAbsolutely [laughter] okay well I Will look into the uh\nThings you suggested here and make a decision that I Hope that helps you out it does say something much\nWell now we are entering the heating seat and then maybe a lot of your actually already using the heat in full swing this time of year you really want to try and get the most out of your energy dollar and to do that you've got to keep that draft but those drafts aren't always just found it really obvious places\nYeah now my favorite place that sneaky drips happen\nOr switch plates and outlets annexed your your walls you know air gets into those walls and those dress from the outside will just zipped right in the ... they're not proper we deal with the ... is very simple\nYou can pick up some pre cut ... ... homes and there's and hardware stores are literally page to page and then slip them under the cover place to do a great job of keeping those dress out\nI mean truly it's like one of the least expensive improvement they can make that will make a very noticeable difference in your expenses which is just amazing to me the other thing if you find that you have larger gap some of the exterior walls\nYou can try and fill up with an expandable thumb and that is going to stop the Airflow but in a lot of cases it's not going to happen he wrote an surpass from coming in so if you want to do that as well you can make them a little ill will just to sort of strengthen it up and keep the little rodent ads from chewing their ...\nYeah good point so lots of ways to try to cut back on those drafts but I'll tell you what did you add up so given the now before I could see terribly cold it'd be more comfortable all winter long\nMentioned you've got the money and how can we help you today\nA real issue with the leaking feeling\nToday I got to issue with they only leaking feeling\nI'm not sure if it's coming from from my roof for from our conditioners or doesn't do it all the time sometimes when it rains it comes down to the top ...\n[laughter] ...\nOr or or got kinda that allows we've got a metal roof structure house right now I'm thinking maybe the ... they don't want more goes into a gathering you know but like I said I've not had any luck 'cause I have it fixed and then it it'll come arraigned and then again\nIt comes in again right so what you're doing the fiction that he was stealing the seems in the in the metal roof\nYeah we got up and put a some talk of the stuff on ... you know where to stuff was nine minutes are supposed to be a twenty year roof and we had an older house probably\nAbout ... who's the metal roof is supposed to be a hundred year roof mean metal roof last a long time here's what I Would do I would try to make it so I Would go up there if you can you get up there that area with a hose yeah so I Would try to make it so I Would try\nYou know the normal light duty rainfall when it falls down from the top and she doesn't anything and then I Would try some directional pressure\nAgainst those seeds and see if I can figure out what type of driving rain storms coming in your ... I suspect that is do the rain\nOr driving in those in it might be trapped in there and that's why he comes up days later after ... I I don't know\nBut I I think what you're gonna have to do is to try to figure out what part of that is breaking down and then once you do if you already going to ... I Would suggest taken apart that section of the roof and then putting it back together with proper ceilings to make sure you get it done once and for all\nRight okay All right no way to ...\n... ... we've got to repair the Salem to or not or a proud to say on\nYeah I Know you don't want that you got his gun and by the way when you do repair that ceiling make sure you primer on it because if you don't prime over leaks means that they're going to come right through now since ... okay\nYeah I actually I like what we're going to do is put up a a little lip sobbing or a like a ... not paying lame but at the applied that will go up and get rid of the popcorn but it's up there right\nNow oh yeah well let's say you know that for most expensive words and home improvement while you're at it

live near a loan or a Humvee or anything like that and things like an hour and a half drive the way I'm not a hardware store about ... miles and you know ... where\nWhat three or do you need some kind of hair back then I don't know what the different are\nOK so first of all the type of repair mature uses different type of material you would use if you were said pouring a new concrete slab and you mentioned quick read that's a great friend and they have a wide variety of repair products um you have the option to repair the cracks you could also re surface that concrete is a product for that\nAnd in all cases they the difference between that type of product a repair product in the original sort of concrete Prague is it the repair parts are designed to adhere to the original concrete base\nYou know if it's if anything is loose course shift a pop it out and restore it but I'm sure that there are plenty of concrete repair products that are out there and you know you're going to obviously have to get yourself to hardware store or lumber urine to find it\nYou can do some research on line that their website but you want to make sure you choose a repair product because it is

data group back with us again for our part to interview\nNow if you're lucky enough to catch his first visit here on legend self six that's you know why we've invited him back we just couldn't cover enough or what he's accomplished and his team of associates of accomplished so\nUh we're here to get more time on me it was a great guess standard I'm surely be better today pat we're glad you're back with us from very well\nTo be back with you John\nUnderstand he just had a little ... and you came back from\nA job to Asia for about a month so it's good to be back here in the U.S and are headquartered in Boston\nAnd I'm sure since we are busy with you probably created a another billion dollars of value somewhere didn't ya\nWell has been a great area of growth for us and the trip focused\nIn on um India where we think will become one of the\nThree largest economies in the world over the next Thirty years though on several new publications there on this trip and\nExpanded our research and set up a hundred and fifty million dollar venture capital fund to get a committee of a very accomplished in Indian born but people move to the Silicon Valley became very successful entrepreneur is now they're going back in there\nA whole we want to give them some financial support and ideas and advice to help them build great companies over there as well\nI think it's great he's always on the leading edge she was on the leading edge back in the sixties when he goes into the world of computers are so far ahead of the curve and and pat I'm sure many many people know the name international data group but\nFor our first time listeners are those who are not quite familiar with everything you do um give us a snapshot again of of ID gee\nI'm a ... as it exists today and and then we'll go back and check it out\nYeah we're we're a company whose mission is banned that focus on providing people the most time well useful and and the actionable information about computers communications and chronic\nOr do we do that for about three hundred or newspapers and magazines around the world with titles like computer world peace in the world Mac world at that trend or we have out for him to the Web sites that are made in support those magazine brands and uh about twelve hundred different expeditions and conferences\nAround the world and then we've also build a family of venture capital companies to help young entrepreneurs get started in the developing countries to be able to bring a lot of new products and services and about their choices to their local markets\nAnd and the number of employees you have is a myth sounds\nA we had Thirteen thousand uh current employees John\nThirteen thousand curtain employees and revenues I Believe approaching three billion with a beat three billion dollars\nThat were about to point eight billion you know after a month\nAnd with a beef three billion dollars\nA letter I we're about to point eight billion you know ask for a month\nBut that's incredible now last time I think we spoke around two and a half so I wasn't for all sorts of trading or the other\nThat's correct yes and and that really gave me a chance to uh\nUh get around during the summers and meet the heads of the computer companies and meet their top engineers and their product fighters so I learned a tremendous amount about the companies and then when I came to start my own business um you know that was a big help or because they knew my name and at the my writings and\nAnalysis and therefore they were willing to pay attention to\nA proposal that I made up um to set up a a sense of where the computers were and what the customers who are using them wanted for a future products and services\nAbsolutely ... and that was a job you got while you're at MIT but he stayed with it when you graduated correct\nUh that's right yeah when as an editor I was out talking to\nThe heads of the computer companies and helping them or you know told me that they had a need for this or\nUm and when I asked her public the price he said that was too low I should charge more so that would be taken seriously I Love that business idea and uh so I put put out the proposal and wound up having a nine companies send me check for twenty five thousand dollars each perhaps payment so that\nIs actually all the capital that are used to get started so\nTo a anyone asked me about how to start a business I'd say just talk to people who can be customers find out through unfulfilled needs and proposed to fill those needs and in many cases they'll you know to sponsor you they'll buy a subscription to your proposed service and otherwise advance money to help you get it going so you don't need to raise a lot of money\nIf you are in close touch with your customers they'll they'll be happy to support you\nWell absolutely ... you know there's there's a real important antidote lesson here while you're working for that magazine and folks again it was it was called computers none of the nation back you know many years a number of years ago or sixties\nYeah with a ... there and that's about\nA six three three sixty three\n... and ... was his job is to go all over the country as you said and gather information a world of computers were number this was back in the sixties he'd build up a tremendous knowledge\nAnd a resource of words that were all located now into the lesson I wanted to go back to that that they would love to hear from you pat you brought this idea back for a bland new publication and you brought it back to the publisher what did they tell you\nWell they said that the market research project that's not something we're interested in and you know you can do it on your own uh so I said fine I'll Try it and then that was what started the business and\nNow that we've had a number of cases like that um after doing the talking to 'em a lot of the managers of computer centers they said they needed them out of the weekly newspaper to help them get real information about what other people like them were experiencing with computers what were their problems and difficulties and we launched the weekly newspaper and everyone\nTold us it couldn't be done we are only putting fifty thousand dollars into the project all the money we had available and they told us how it's going to cost you a million dollars to a friend a weekly newspaper\nAnd you'll be out of business in two months and you know we'll either you did well will pick up the pieces and carried on ourselves or if you went slowly one that was a bad market and what your favorite some money by showing us that you had a dead end project\nAnd fortunately we got through advertising because we were new but we've got about Seventy thousand people who gave us a check for twelve dollars to subscribe to our publication so that was in fact a million dollars came out of the subscription\nAdvances we're getting from readers enthusiastic about our content\nThat's that's pretty amazing when you go back to the original original um when when that publisher told you originally pat now you go do that we're not interested or tell us folks um how much money was raised in how you raise it to launch that new magazine and that new venture\nAdventure well uh I'm I've I've I put in I felt my card and put in a five thousand dollars that was all my proceeds available and then I went to my sister and I went to the\nFirst person either employed ... general manager and said would you be willing to invest in support me in this project and they said well you know we know you and like you and everything but um we know these things they risky they don't always succeed so\nWe're going to give you ten dollars while tape it to your ... your ... adventure your capital availability\nSo so your seed capital was five thousand and twenty dollars by selling your car and getting a ten dollar bills from your wife and and the manager you're my sister and a manager\nYears I'm Sorry your yeah your sister manager right so so that was in Nineteen sixty three basic sixty four okay and and those to investors I got to recapture says to investors it gave me the ten dollars what what's the ten dollars worth today\nAbout three and a half million dollars say the today [laughter]\n... Lee unbelievable absolutely amazing ... and they told you couldn't be done\nA writer which always encouraged me because uh uh you know if it was easily able to be done a lot of people would have already done it so when\nThey say can be done that means I'm going to have very much reduced competition and uh\nThey say it can't be that and that means I'm going to have very much reduced competition and that\nJust by energetically keeping in touch with um the customers and prospects you often find ways that they would like to see the service provider that no one else is the gifted and then you can charge in and you know put butter or give them something they really want and you know who's the ethical you support it\nIs that is ... I was going to ask is eager to success but when ... when you grow your business no matter what stage it is pat isn't that one of the uh the one of the critical elements that you use and success is always staying customer focused and listening to them and listening to what they nice sounds simple but so many people don't do it\nYou're right that when people ask me what does it take to be an entrepreneur I say when you have to find something you want to do you're passionate about do you have to give a lot of physical energy because if you have to but Seventeen Eighteen hour days and in the early days you know you have to keep your optimism high so you feel you're good positive spirit\nBut don't spend too much time sitting now making a paper plans because uh uh but you said that they would work here playing what you should do is working to market going out and finding out what people one of their changing needs and keeping you know right up to date with their changing needs and you'll be winning all the time if you try to\nYou know go ahead and roll out a plan that you made up at some time you're almost sure to be way off the market within a year or two\nThat that's incredible I'm Glad you said that and it's very very intriguing because I find that a lot of the greatest entrepreneurs in America the wealthiest most successful never really had a formal written business plan and if they did they usually throw it out\nI found that to be very helpful because you listen better if you don't have a lot of preconceived ideas in your mind\n... I Love it I Love it now now when you're growing from ... from a regional business you know started up you mentioned some of the critical elements what about growing from regional to national what are those next critical step to grow a business even further\nWell of course you had to make sure that your communication network has spread throughout the country it's other people in all parts of the country are aware of your projects and then of course the next step is\nTo begin to move into other countries and are there the the key step is to go over and you know and actually make discussions with the proposed customers to make sure they see the same needs and then go out and find someone in that country who\nUh shares your passion for the fulfillment of those needs and you know has the enthusiasm that charisma to be able to hire\nAnd motivate good people and then you know give them or resources they want or give them an encouragement and support get out of their way\nLet them know adjust to their local market and to provide them help and assistance but don't try to tell them how to do it because you're never going to fully understand foreign market where the local person who lives in the culture every day is\nGoing to be much more able to move quickly adjusted changes within that market\nYou know another point you came up with an you shared with me in the past is that um decentralization was important to you and and you you you'd um hone in on the numbers are around a hundred and fifty was very key to the grocery your business and your business units can you share with the number one safety is so important okay\nYeah that's our average business ties you know I ... I found early on that ah I was I was like a typical entrepreneur I wandered into everything make sure everything was happening in a way I expected and um then I realized that my attempt to control was actually slowing the growth of the business and that's why I really have the epiphany to say\nYou know I'm a what is really necessary is not a my control but finding fertile markets then good at getting an enthusiastic leader\nAnd then I found that morale I visited uh companies and even observing our own companies that are the morale was ... about a hundred and fifty people are the people at that stage they knew knew each other they knew each other families they had a clear vision of\nWhy they're role with though important in the company and they were all you know\nWork together as a unified team a ... and it's interesting because that's sort of\nA you know we have people grow up in a a families and usually like twelve family has made a tribe who migrated from place to place\nA so typically like twelve people on the family and so you had a hundred and forty four hundred and fifty people in this group of human beings who would move around a and conduct all their activities and\nI think the mind is really sort of set up to deal with groups that size very comfortably and organizations get larger than that then you know people feel alienated its them over there rather than us you want everyone is has a who are winning a sort of doing things together\n... that's why I have a hundred businesses and each one headed up by its own team and then they advertise about a hundred and fifty people each\nFolks hope you're taking shorthand this was a lot of wisdom from old man who's done it from scratch I'm John Resnick losing was McGovern will be back on legends of success right after the\nCauses a ... a part of the brain to a accelerated development that often you know has\nA quantitative factual types of skills but um diminishes the social sensitivity and social interaction capability so that you wind up having you know people who can be um\nInteracting capability so that you wind up having you know people who can be um a brilliant mathematician and you know can multiply to twenty digit numbers together or can\nHear a piano concerto ones who repeated exactly and do amazing things\nIn the specialized part of the brain that are related to math and music yet um you know they have very little sensitivity to other people they can't read another person's mood or style and you know their day to walk away from people there really isolated that socially\nSo uh what we hope our research will do is to identify what biochemical\nOr other action in the developing brain and often this is much more frequent and and males than females that causes the development of this autistic or situation so it can be prevented or hopefully even reversed in cases where it's you know the child is now five or six to seven years old\n[laughter] it's amazing and I understand that the the statistics these days are one in one hundred and sixty six children one out of one sixty six has autism\nAh that that's really tragic because it's such a hardship\nFor the parents involved and and also requires lifetime often very lifetime special attention so many other people need to get involved to help your child is an adequate life\nWell I commend you and your wife are doing a a a tremendous job understand there's five hundred researchers at that location I Wish you the best of success with that and we get back from this break all you're quite welcome and we get back from this next break we're going to find out I'm going to ask you a pat\nWhat are some of the unexpected challenges entrepreneur as and business owners all don't know there are obviously they don't expect they don't know what I was the unexpected challenges they run into maybe can help 'em out without a little\nOkay ladies gentleman path McGovern founder chairman of international data group will be back right after this legends of success\nIf you're a baby boomer with one hundred thousand or more of an vegetable assets this may be the most important sixty seconds for your retirement we're sound income strategies and we transform typical portfolios\nThat depend on speculative gross into portfolios that generates sustained retirement income for life in right now we're offering the latest book from our founder David ...
