to find a AAA eight to five five to five Jim is with us here in Philadelphia Hi Jim how are you\nGood they buy from Iran sure what's up\n[noise] um my wife and I work currently in baby steps to uh we started this time last year with about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars in debt or we'd been intense and pay off our thousand dollars while the small yes or\nSold my brand new pickup truck sold a race car a wild everything though we um we have an interesting situation a we have one child and we're looking to expand our family however we're going to need to um related they do I've yeah I'm always go out and other\nSixty six thousand dollars to pay off\nAnd what what is your household income uh were making about a hundred and forty thousand dollars a year right now so you did a hundred and a year but a lot of that was from selling stuff I'm pretty much a large water watch out what's the maps telling you that it's got how long has your going to take you do the show the sixty\nUm [noise] if we if we continue on this course where we were really sold everything so the rest of it's just going to be working really are I think it's going to be probably about another year maybe a little bit more\nWhat I was thinking about what I Would ask him on a cell that okay\nProbably about another year maybe a little bit more\nThat's what I was thinking that's what I Would ask him on a cell that OK cool and so what is the pricing model of uh VS that you guys are looking at\nUm well we actually met with a doctor a few months ago and got a ballpark up about twenty thousand\nMhm I'm\nUh just you know we haven't found anything or start any any process as yeah we're just still kind of shopping around but ... what we're looking at a we spoke with other couples and all the click of who's got around there\nUm let me give you a little inside okay this comes like a lot because babies are important\nI mean having kids is a big deal it's an emotional thing and it causes people to uh\nYou know to to change their financial directions and the to violate things and everything else so let me tell you I I absolutely know nothing about medical things I Am medical idiots okay [laughter] but uh I have actually been involved in about this decision probably a hundred times over the years\nAnd what I Am hearing\nEven as late as last week a with couples that we are coaching on this is that when they press in they find several different pricing models\nAnd prices you don't just accept\nThe first opinion you get on how you go about this okay rise in other words I heard the other day are thirty five thousand for one pricing model but that was like a guarantee as many times as you need to do it till you get a baby right\nOkay ah well that's not one we're going to do [laughter] and then I heard the other end of the spectrum I'm hearing a you know\nCorrect okay\nAnd the next thing you need to do is you need to talk to a real estate agent and find out what this house was actually worse because right now you don't\nYeah I don't I don't know I don't know exactly who it is my wife my wife is a great grandma so I Know where I live on their lowest said there was a it's a hundred and three down on though if they even ... they're not\nOr nothing like it was not always that accurate but it's probably not that far off we could use that for discussion purposes okay if you if you found a house that was worth a hundred thousand and you could buy it for Ninety five thousand that really wouldn't be that great a by\nI just being okay by it's not like you're getting there were a great deal there where you just went wow that's the best deal ever ride because as I watch\n'em like they even get kicked out 'cause someone gated or should I leave or should or should I go back ran over\nWell where do I want to be long term whether you want to\nKnow why she we kinda do want to own 'cause we got a daughter she's four and my wife she that school and now so we just trying to kind of settled down right now mhm have you got every angle\nArea it's like I say my wife great grandma's house and she'd been here her whole life so she likes it it's like about two and a half three acres\nMhm and um it's kind of in a country will part of Atlanta\nGotcha okay and how old are your\nOr my wife she turned twenty yesterday and and I'll be Twenty one and a couple of days but we both twenty now\nMhm and you got a a one child you said and how much debt do you have\nA we don't have any do okay and what's your household income uh make uh every player but I'm trying to get in school but I had to kind of work with the center that was that I don't watch I don't know what else\nUm I pay about six hundred and Seventeen dollars a month and your wife doesn't work [noise]\nOkay that's pretty ... on your budget is is very tight on your budget\nYeah and we just found out about you not long ago one of my friends from church he recommended me start with Nancy so now we actually kind of made a budget and stuff on how to eat and we're already kinda\nYou know trying to start it off a little better and\nGood good for you okay well here's the thing if you wanted to buy the house the only way you can buy it is the ah the relatives that are involved that would be the air's a this would be great grandmothers children or grandchildren\nThat would be the air since there was no will someone would have to petition the court will get a lawyer and go to probate court and probate court would after rule that the house could be sold and would assign someone to sign the deed as the cellar\nTo be able to give it to you you're going to have to have a court action to do that that's going to cost three two or three thousand bucks to get all that done\nOkay I don't think you need that expense right now yeah though\nWith all the more the numbers you gave me in the situation you're in um now is anybody going to throw you out as long as that mortgages paid I doubt you're gonna get thrown out\n'cause that's what I was thinking should I Do kind of want to actually start even going into real estate 'cause I Do construction that's what I Do know I kind of this house is kinda\nThis house is kind of it's not ... it's kind of beat up and fight the last few years she yeah All right here's like other relatives staying there kind of eating it up so I mean I don't know if it's like\nMaybe weren't more and maybe you know what I'm saying they slip in and get another house\nOr an ... unless you become the owner of it\nYeah and and that's what I'm saying like I knew I Need to\nYou'd had I see in a statement learning anything they did hurry up and now my in the game or should\nI wait till you what I Would do if I were you I Would be willing to walk away from the south someday when you get I I Would treat it like you're renting it\nYou're probably not gonna ever bother to own it and if you do you're going to go through a lot of hassle to become the owner going through this court action that I'm Talking about okay\nSo ah what I Would do is pay that rent or pay that payment of rent I Would not spend any money on this and I wouldn't fret about becoming the owner today\nIt's inexpensive rent and the Atlanta area it's a place you like living any money you spend on it just say to fix it up is money you're probably gonna lose you're probably not ever going to become the owner of this thing\nYeah it's going to be and I just got to be a really strenuous process with the courts to become the owner of this because we don't even know who the heirs are\nYeah well I don't I Know a couple of the day this is not that many um or\nThat they actually even know about it like I said we we been here for a year so I don't know like should I I I'm not like should I be worried\nThat if they are paying the oil and I just keep paying it in because that's not that you shouldn't be worried because it's not bad rent\nYet but I'm I'm just worried like can't nobody comment me out 'cause it's not in my name\nYeah they can get you out the people that own it can there are the heirs but they'd have to all get their crap together and they're far from doing that\nYeah and they're yeah they're far away they're like in another state and\nYeah but they're not they're not worried about this is what I'm saying yeah they're not worried about this at all it's not bothering them one way or the other they're not going to get any money out of it when it sells 'cause it's not worth much more than a vote on it\nIf it was valuable now there'd be some sharks and the water circling right but it's not got any ... because it's not worth any more so you're not going to get kicked out but some day you're going to want to move on so don't spend a bunch of money on it 'cause some day you're just gonna walk off and leave it\nYeah 'cause 'cause I've already done paying eight and ... before they did a little some something you know and I met my wife will head because\nThat's like whatever money whatever money you spend and make her happy money is gone\nWhen you leave because there's going to come a day two years from now that you guys are going to stand up and walk away or you're going to go to the trouble to get the heirs to take the thing the probate court\nAnd get the deed transferred to your name and you can probably do that but again it's going to cost you a couple of thousand dollars and you'd want to make very sure that the property was worth more than the mortgage before you did that and um\nAnd you don't want to spend a bunch of money renovating his house because you're going to very likely move on in about two years but in the meantime I just looked at it as cheap rent\nTo a place you kind of like living\nAnd you know six hundred bucks written in line is not a bad gig on two and a half acres\nSo I'm sitting there in front of you for now\nIt's not hurting anything no one's you're not stealing anything you're not doing any more harm the mortgage companies getting paid they're happy the relatives that aren't going to get any money anyways still aren't getting any money everybody's happy but just look at it like you're a renter and some day you're just going to move on\nQuite worried about being the owner and then if you really want to be the owner then get ready to spend three or four thousand dollars and six months of pain in the ... court actions and you probably can work this through if you can gather up all the people you need to sign on it\nAnd that's what you're facing so it's an interesting situation but um my guess is it's not worth any more than his vote on it\nMy guess is ... probably fairly close on this\nIf we thought his worth two hundred thousand bucks is a relative thought is worth two hundred thousand bucks and Ninety thousand was owed and they were going to get a hundred thousand their pocket when assault\nNo sharks would already been circling they'd have been trying to figure out some way to get that thing sold and get the courts do it when you die without a will and you don't have to go in and the judge has to you know authorized the sale of the asset and it has to go into a pool to be dispersed too the heirs\nAre just like it would in a wheel but it's just a lot bigger mess\nAnd do you can't get cleaned title to this thing unless you do all that and you do not want to become the owner of it any other way than doing it properly and getting clean titled 'cause you won't be able to sell it if you don't get ...\nSo that's how you do it if you decide to do it later but for today I Would treat it as cheap rent it's a rental house how much money would you spend on a rental house\nThat you're going to move off and you don't own a nod any as what you would do hope that helps my own thanks for calling him this is the Dave Ramsey show [noise]\n[noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care if the reason you want

I'm the only seen one of the whole dead set it was crazy but there was one of the lady that um that they would bring on this lady that was a psychiatrist or psychologist or whatever\nAnd so she was there to like help crazy people with a crazy and I was there to help people with their money thing and that was a it was those shows those kind of show and um she and I ended up talking in the green room after that and she was the one she gave me some study and I read through the whole study I was amazed there was a huge correlation\nBetween extreme levels of financial control\nAnd domestic violence so if you have a friend who is not allowed to go to the grocery store by herself without her husband\nOr her boyfriend if you have a friend that is not allowed to touch money in any way because her husband her boyfriend is incomplete extreme control of every decision around the finances I'll give you a Ninety percent probability he's hitting\nHer\nThat's how that's how strong this study correlation was I mean there's just because there's so many it's a it's all about control\nAnd it's all about bullying at a different level\nAnd a ... and so there's just a sickness it's involved there and it shows up in the money believe it or not and and you can see it and and after doing that reading this study all those years ago now I'm always listening\nWhen he started he won't

I'm\nNot I don't I don't I never expand baby step on emergency fund what I Would do is if your income is truly vulnerable and I think yours is not as volatiles your acting like it is you might get a hundred grand and your whining about running out of money I mean really\nYou really need to stop and think about what you just said but anyway if you're going to go to zero in December because nobody's buying a house in Colorado Springs in December you don't want to have zero money I'll go along with that part but I don't think that's what's really happening you're making eight thousand dollars a month average\nSo I'm a five hundred to ten thousand a month whatever so anyway set some aside but we're not going to call in an emergency fund and we're not going to add to the thousand dollar account we call it an Illinois valley account\nThe Helmand valley is the volatility of your income the hill is when they come as good the valley is when it's bad and so if you want to set a couple of ground over there in that in addition to the thousand two separate accounts wanted for emergencies and one is for you if you run out of money because you don't make any money in a month\nBut dude I don't think you're really doing that I think you need to go back and actually look at your cash flow a analyze your revenue streams for however long you been in the business and go how many times have are really run out of money\nI mean you can make money and so um I don't I don't think it's happening if you told me he might forty thousand dollars in real estate business I can imagine you having some zero much but you're not you know it's not what you're telling me you're making money\nA year just afraid of the volatility and you know that's reasonable so go back and track your revenues in charge revenues and if they truly are dipping down below what it takes to exist in your house\nAnd given in certain months over in a long period of time you can go back go you know every January and February I'm always screwed this is where we are then okay set some money aside to cover that so that you do that but I don't think it's as bad as your emotions are telling you it is\nAnd uh but no we're not changing the emergency plan we might have a hill and valley account if you truly have a volatile into march with us in Seattle Highmark welcome to the day Ramsey show\nYeah thank Dave hey it's a great honor to talk with you know you had a great impact on changed my life five years ago I'm getting I think you\nAre currently I I I got a career question I'm In baby steps eggs are the only thing right now I'm paying off my arm do you get a net worth of a half million dollars uh [noise]\nWhat happened was five years ago I I left a small company with a great a company culture when I hear you talk about your company that the company I was working for a very similar culture I was making an average salary or for what I did I went to a competitor I was much more of your making\nUm I was making a eighty thousand dollars a year\nWhat do you make now I make a hundred and forty thousand dollars a year on your question is what\nI make my question is I really miss that small company culture and um I have an opportunity to go back to a smaller company of about a hundred people start up [noise] um I think it would be a really\nReally interesting to get back into that culture um I just kind of lost my passion for my work\nAnd um you know I should have to work every day I get great reviews um\nI'd probably go back but I Want some equity or I Want some indication that I can earn my way back up to what you're actually worse than the marketplace\nThis idea that in order to have a good work environment you have to make less [noise]\nIs not necessary is not necessarily an assumption I'm going with\nSo maybe that particular company can't pay you but if you want you'd probably find somebody with an Asian culture and how you what's your worst that's one of the mouse to\nThis is the day Ramsey shows\nThat you know statistically when it comes to life insurance and protecting your family that women are more likely to be uninsured or under insured than men this doesn't make any sense women make up half the workforce contributes mightily to family incomes\nAnd in many cases are the breadwinners and take care of their families twenty four hours a day this is one of the most overlooked areas when it comes to financial planning maybe it's a relic of the past but a loss of income or the need to replace family care\nIs equally important for women as it is for men single moms working moms and stay at home moms all need term life insurance\nRates are actually lower for women which is why I say ... or insurance they shop the top term life companies to find the lowest rates available you can compare rates online at ... dot com\nThey treat you like crap and they over charging for most of the services and this day in time there online offerings their Web banking systems are not any more sophisticated or not that good\nThey're not good at anything so I I just don't get it so that that's why we endorse credit unions you hear me in some of your city is endorsing a local credit union or a local small town community type bank\nAnd I'm just a a huge fan of using that for your ah your banking service needs and it's what I did\nEverything I endorse on the show is stuff that that I personally do or what do you know in your situation that kind of a thing I don't have anything is inconsistent like I'm too big or too good to do that I I'm not I don't have a need for some of the things that we tell you to get but\nYou know ... you know in most cases I'm a customer personally Ted is with us Ted's in York, Pennsylvania Hi Jen how are you\nI'm doing better than I deserve how're you doing\nJust the same how can I help\nAll right well thank you and your staff right you're doing it's a blessing you um how it'll be needing a lifetime saving operation about ten to Fifteen Years I don't get hit by a bus\nAnd I want to know if I ah I should continue funding NHL have with my employer contributing a couple of hundred bucks here or should I just put a that extra money into a Roth IRA her four one K.\nWas it just a couple of hundred bucks a year\nThe company I don't know whether she\nWill you can put you can oh they're matching a couple of hundred bucks a year yeah ... and more okay show the the nature of ... what kind of life saving operation if you've got to have an ... what is it\nI think the liver ooh I got hungry I see so yeah ... fortunately you can't live without\nYeah heard that you know our Shaw how can I say it's a it's a slow a slow progression then yeah\nIt is they they estimate that you know Seventeen years out so okay I got to figure to right around the time I'm going to retire so I'm trying to retire early you know and I'll see if I can\nYou know I think the thing is the uh what you're going to want is a ... you you you got to have the cash in your age are saying or somewhere else and an investment to cover what's going to come out of your pocket I assume you're talking health insurance is going to cover a large portion of this correct\nYeah that if I don't retire um and I'll be on um either ... or some other type of insurance policy\nYeah I think I'd be on cobra or or I wouldn't retire because this is I guess this is a multi hundred thousand dollar event isn't it\nProbably half\nNow and so I'm thinking we're going to term retirement around this a little bit um or and or cobra one of the two if you want to retire early you're just going to have to pony up for the cobra but the cover only last what two years or something\nUm I don't know if you can keep that indefinitely so I I think that's number one I Want to make sure you got health insurance to cover the vast majority of this I don't want\nTime that poorly a but then how much you have you got coming out of pocket a over ten years you can put five thousand dollars a year end of that age essay or whatever your big the duck double is what's your ducked double\n[noise] um [noise] ...\nYeah you or whatever the ... on the ... say a year\nOh now\nA trustee of the health insurance uh amount of fun\nI don't know the edge essays are health savings account that is attached to a health and a chess a health insurance policy that has a high deductible policy\nIt it depends uh depends on the policy I pick it's either six to nine nine thousand\nDollars is what I'm Talking about you can put up to that amount per year into that savings account\nAnd that would be six thousand happy hour show really fun that yes and I don't touch it until I you know rehire yes\nHere's why out when you're when you need the money out of pocket to cover the whatever comes out of pocket on on the liver surgery a and you\nKeep your health insurance in place then you've got this big juicy health savings account sitting there in an odd use mutual funds in it and I let it grow over the next ten years be as big as it can there's no downside of that whatever you don't need for the liver transplant or liver trans whatever the processors they're\nWhatever you don't need you can pull out and just pay taxes on the no penalties\nAnd sixty five and so um you're going to want to build that up and you just not going to become sort of what

today sure what's up on the health\nInsurance question for you and I'm hoping you could give me some insight on it we adopted our two children about three years ago\nAnd they came from the foster care system so we don't get a lot of services that one thing we do get is health insurance until they're Eighteen and it's provided through our state Medicaid system\nAnd every year my husband and I kind of go back and forth on whether or not to keep it or to put them on his plan through his employer and we're getting close to that um [noise] time of year to make that decision\nOkay um what would his employer's plan cover that Medicaid is not covering\nWell they're both and healthy thankfully I guess are um you know the thing we always come back to as unknowns of any kind of health issues that they may have er\nUm any services because even though the Medicaid coverage is crummy you know in a lot of ways that a lot of doctors don't take it and it's a basically welfare insurance [noise] um it has covered their needs up to this point because those kids are healthy and they've had minimal minimal ...\nAfraid if they had some kind of a major event that he'll Medicaid would not do a good job of covering and that his insurance might\nActually it's more the opposite I'm not worried about the major step because like we've had to go to the ER for you know my you know got scrape and about and they pick up the tab for everything it's more the ongoing care there is um you know it's very hard to find providers who take it there's a bit of a stake then we feel\nA little strange having that kind of coverage given our own financial position you know that our kids are on a ... there's a bit of a stigma that oh I don't feel having it so it's just it's just kind of a dilemma we face every year and\nI knew you were you know in November we can make a play or I heard you uh uh you know free food stamps because you are adopted a foster child you know that would feel the same way as what you're saying um it would\nYeah I mean I I well I don't look at you may already be marketed stripe\nAnd takes care of their you know their their financial needs and and so I don't know this is not an easy\nNow is a question and does it\nCost to add them to your husband's policy\nAnd I think it would be nothing given the policy Ron has a high deductible each has a plan that we have and there is no ...\nAnd why is it a question if it doesn't cost anything and it's better coverage\nThat's a good answer there probably isn't a question I guess the only question would be just changing jobs in the future if he were to leave it you know you know and go somewhere else\nYou know what I mean you you just have to cover your kids from then on\nIf we have it you know you know and go somewhere else\nYou know what I mean you you just have to cover your kids from then on you're done you're done goes you opted out you know I don't know you might be able to go back in and if something got crazy but um but for now you could opt out okay for that matter I guess yes for that matter I don't know that you have to opt out do you\n... when you go sign alone and they don't pay you get to pay it

he\nDoesn't want to have a job that will conflict with his job because he's been trying to get into this job forever because\nWhy would a conflict with his job he's only working twenty hours a week\nRight to call 'em for this job\nTwenty hours a week or the whole week\nTwenty hours a week ... ... ... is the TV station ... he just go and they have a football game and does it go for it at the game\nNow what would you be on call for football there is no emergency football\n[laughter] so he's been trying to get into the TV station here\nI got that part where he's working twenty hours a week and his mother is calling me 'cause she came by his dad gum twenty thousand dollar bill I'd like for him to work another forty hours a week on top of the twenties playing with football so she can pay is freaking bills so you're not calling me how would that sound that would sound awesome\nI I Try to tell him that when I I did\nGet down to how they cannot get half of it and I do\nThink that he declared in basically thirty days late every time you don't work much\nYeah\nYeah there's a great place to go when you're broke to work so uh what I Would tell him to do is get into financial piece university and get his young budding gear and start paying that ... I I mean if I'm you I'm going to be all up on this kid because he's twenty eight years old and he's a slacker\nAnd his momma is calling me you're single after his mom's a single lady out here when you're fifty what got a fifty\nFifty years old and you're having to pay this kid's bills yeah I'm mad at him right now I don't want you to be two and a good loving mama's kind of way I'm not trying to disown him I just want to knock him out on his little head okay\nYou know and then you you better plan on paying ... doesn't get moving okay right so you know ball and knock it out and then you must chalk it up to that and but dude I'm telling you ah we're going to have some discussions is he married\nHe lived through the girlfriend okay I'll bet she works forty hours yeah yeah\nThere you go [noise] alright open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Katherine is with us from Portland Maine Hi Katherine how are you\nA thank you I don't hear about my budget activity every dollar touch it among baby step to great I protect my expenses for the month [laughter]\nProject what I'm going to be paying for gas and then sometimes something happens like last month when my car broke down and I had to have a tone and repaired and it costs to almost five hundred dollars [laughter]\nIt was on how often that we know that one of them are often do you have your your baby step one with a thousand dollars right I Do now that would be an emergency that you would use that for\nOkay but that's what I was confused about because the way I handled it what I simply added a new line item and my budget for that item and then reduce the amount that I pay toward get for that month so I get it wrong\nThat would be okay you cash flow did you just ... but if you can cash flow in\nThat month that's fine I didn't have to come out of the emergency funds so you are paying more than five hundred dollars extra on debt each month yes good answer you reduced it by five hundred for one month 'cause you got kicked in the kneecap what this thing but usually you're not going to have that month in a month out\nNow there's some things if a if there's a recurring unexpected event it no longer is unexpected\nFor ... you know you don't have anything budgeted for car repairs well that would not work because most cars are going to need some repairing over a period of six months you know they're going to\nHave anything budgeted for car repairs\nYeah I probably would put something in there for that because the ... your budget needs to reflect the real world and the real world is you're going to win something on the car in a given six month period of time it might be tires that might be\nThe real world is you're going to spend something on their car and given the six month period and um it might be tires that might be maintenance you might be oil change it might be a five hundred dollar toe you know\nBut you're going to spend something on a car in unless you're driving really nice brand new cars you're going to spin something on the car during that time so your budget should reflect reality in that regard\nSo probably gonna have a little bit of a do not to be a lot fifty or a hundred bucks or something and let that build up as a sinking fun they call it than the every dollar software or in a ... I don't care where you build it up but somewhere you build it up and you uh have the money in cash then\nFor your car repair as it comes up and that's an example of something that is recovering so it's no longer unexpected emergencies should be unexpected things\nThings that are are often enough that we can expect them aren't emergencies anymore but you did good yeah you did find just to cash flow through that emergency slow down your debt snowball for that month and then you pick back up next month hopefully won't have another one of those and you can really\nBuild it up and go from there so good question and you're doing good keep after Tom is with us in San Francisco Hi Tom welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nThey appreciate we're doing a great thing I've been an avid fan for three days now\nCan you [laughter] I'm On earth where you are too many other a long time you and I [laughter]\nThe question for you so my wife and I\nWe have about three hundred okay and and didn't did another hundred and Fifteen and automobile line of credit that type of thing so it's about four Fifteen\nAnd we make a pretty good income shootout or about one twenty annually I remember one eighty syrup three hundred come on the question for you I was a move back to school you can get my master's programs only twenty five okay so that would be a very real are why our niche\nBut over the last three days are starting to think maybe maybe I shouldn't just want to get your take on the ...\nMasters in one oh it would be an ... ... ...\nAnd that would increase your income by more than twenty five K\n[laughter] it would probably be hard to say I'm there wouldn't be wanting cave and we raised because of the category of jump into mhm\nOkay are you majoring in your bag and I would make it back in touch over a year then from that point so that's really nice return I think you can put that in the budget and the reason you can put it in the budget as you make so stinking much money\nNow you living in a very expensive area granted it's crazy and yeah I I mean honestly want to live in a really rough ... you know but you guys are really you're really spending money\n...\nAnd so I mean how quick can we pay off four hundred well we can pay off four hundred and two years if we do it in two hundred a year that you'd be living on a hundred I'm not sure you can do that after taxes in your area so you probably got a three year and get out of debt plan\nBut you know vacations you don't need to see the inside of a restaurant and don't you dare talk me by buying anything else\nYou bought enough crap for a while you need that you need to live like people that make a hundred people that make three hundred and get this debt calling\nAnd in the process of doing that can you will you twenty grand or probably find friends in the budget measure\nMeasure delays you buy one once or something to do\nYour lifestyle we it's time to address\nThis was a\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have to be intentional with every decision you make\nAs an example if you're a business owner and needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full of resumes that aren't right for the position you're hiring the smart thing to do is to go to zip recruiter dot com slash Dave to hire the right person\nZip recruiter doesn't depend on candidates finding new it finds them for you\nIt's powerful matching technologies scans thousands of resumes\nIdentifies people with the right skills education and experience for your job\nAnd actively invites them do apply\nCollege cost is the number one cause of student loan debt\nAnd what I mean is that you can buy a Bentley or you can buy a huge pickup truck both our transportation but one is several hundred thousand dollars and one is just a few hundred dollars\nBut one is several hundred thousand dollars and one is just a few hundred dollars\nBut both of you know the mall\nAnd answer if you if you don't have any money and you're saving up you can't afford a Bentley you can't afford to go to a super expensive college and there's nothing wrong with that by the way I didn't go to a super expensive college so you go to an in state school\n\nThere in Florida you go to the University of Florida Gainesville or you go to University of central Florida right there in Orlando a wonderful ... wanna but wonderful both of them in state tuition not that expensive and uh that's thing one your college selection\nAs at the least expensive college that will help you get the degree that you need to get is what you need to have you met\nWith rare exceptions and you're not going out of state and you're not going super expensive private the second thing is then you start looking for scholarships and you make scholarship hunting your full time job\nOr after school job that kind of a thing and you start applying for and filling out the scholarship forms and riding the essays and he probably ask for a thousand scholarships and you'll probably get turned down for nine hundred and fifty of them but if you get fifty one thousand dollar scholarship she just went to school for ...\nThat'd be pretty cool not about part time job the third thing is planning on working a lot while you are in school don't borrow money so that you don't have to work work\nAnd get good jobs jobs that pay a lot dog walking cutting grass jobs people don't want to do what they pay a lot to do what I'm Talking about minimum wage crap and if you're going to live on campus go ahead and be an All right be a residential advisor or written that's one where they call what isn't All right\nHow it is it is a resident about okay so there you know the the babysitter in the dorm okay and uh you get free dorm for doing that and sometimes free tuition for doing that and sometimes free tuition free dorm and pay for doing that she'll be in our a if you're going to live on campus\nOr work in the cafeteria get free food if you live on campus if you can get a job working for the University of the tuition might be completely free\nAnd that might be different to something to look at it so that's the kind of stuff you look at but figure out where you're going what steps are to get their figure out the cheapest way to get their figure out scholarships for somebody pays you to get there and then plan on working your butt off\nAnd those things will get you through school completely debt free in this day and time and it can be done Alex is with us in Baltimore hey Alex welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nAnd Mr Ramsey how are you a thank you for everything that you do thank you a check on that can be a call at one I Am debt free I'm On baby step three or five months say about two months ago are my six month here's my question and I work full time in a retail establishment\nAnd I have a small\nA job that
