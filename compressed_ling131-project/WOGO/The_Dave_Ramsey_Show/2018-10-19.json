department within our company called Ramsey education that puts a curriculum in the high schools and in the colleges across America we are now and forty percent of the high schools teaching high schoolers this common sense stuff of staying out of\nDebt and being on a budget and learning to save money and all of that kind of thing\nThen what happens from time to time as the schools can't afford the basic resources and so someone will come a long shot in the community a business or an entity of some kind\nAnd we'll pay for that high school to have\nFoundations in personal finance curriculum from the Ramsey organization is that we've had about four million students go through it one of the coolest things that's happened lately is the University of Wyoming\nHas decided that every high school in the entire state of Wyoming needs to have this curriculum and they're sponsoring it and paying for it\nDang dang touchdown baby that's how that happens the college\nUniversity says we're going to take care of these high schoolers in our state and make sure they learn about money and of course the University of Wyoming is the best cost alternative in the Wyoming area\nTo go to college so this all works out really really good now Tyler Moore is with me on the line and tile is from the University of Wyoming usually associate vice provost of enrollment Kyle White uh go man thank you for doing that is\nWell it's a it's a pleasure to visit with you David thanks for that we are certainly Saturday here in the state of Wyoming to be able to partner with a Ramsey education and provide some practical applicable\nBeing for students to be able to apply that college search and a and B real savvy consumer higher education\nYeah because you guys do have low tuition I mean you're you're you're you're the best deal round I wasn't getting right\nYes there we are we have the lower resident tuition any public institution that grant doctoral degrees anywhere in the United states\nOf all fifty states of all the rooms are like so like your cheaper than my University of Tennessee you're you're cheaper than the University of dot dot dot that's correct\nWow very cool very cool and I got to tell you when I heard what your whole promotion was behind this I immediately wanted to steal it and bring it\nAnd use it somewhere in like in the University of Tennessee and I'll tell you where am I doing a few minutes but I Will get them to do it yeah you guys are creative I Love this tell everybody about this uh about this campaign and the the motto for the campaign is hands down the best thing I've heard\nSo that our our campaign is called the world need more cowboys\nWe're we're not talking about guys and cowboy hat that ride off into the sunset but we're talking about a date with long heritage and a university mascot and cowboy that can be\nAnyone from any gender any background but we're talking about that enters here we're talking about curiosity and independence boldness\nAt pursuit adventure and we're talking about someone who changes landscapes and and books for opportunities to make differences in the world we are talking about trailblazers and people examples the spirit of the underdog you know it's not a cowboy isn't\nWhat you are but it's who you are\nYeah well and you guys are the cowboys I mean so it's a play on words obviously I mean if you're a mascot right\nLet's look at your football team your basketball team whatever's the cowboys I mean like my University of Tennessee Volunteers I think they ought to steal it inside of the world needs more volunteers that makes it just as much sense right and so as as good I play on words but you you guys got though that you got to the table first with this way to go man I Love it\nIt's a great motto or does it says so much in just a so few words\nIt's a great motto or does it says so much in just a so few words very very cool well we're really grateful to all of our sponsors around the country that are helping us and you got sponsoring the high school every high school in Wyoming is going to have\n... as a coming up soon the the high school curriculum because the cowboys paid for it [laughter]\nThat's pretty cool guile thank you ma'am\nWe're happy to be happy to be a partner we uh we are we are state that is very practical where state that very much um applicable in terms of being smart with their money and we wanted to make sure that we were not leaving out our opportunities to educate the future generations\nAnd know that there are opportunities in higher education to be smart with your money to be smart about that investment in your future and the University of Wyoming is a way to do that and we're we're helping helping our students in our future generation in the state of Wyoming through the Ramsey education product\nWell it's one of those when when when things as far as I'm concerned because you're\nYou know you're you're helping them by sponsoring this ... going in there we're we're blessed because you're doing it with us and we appreciate that I'm In the winter is is that you get to put the University of Wyoming cowboys right in front of every high school student and remind them that's where they ought to go to college\nBecause sometimes people do silly things like wander across the state line\nI've talked to a lot of ... around the country I'm my own chancellor and vice chancellor numerous just Tennessee and it's a constant thing the ... the state is trying to woo their own residence to their own university and it's become a thing you gotta you gotta go after it don't you\nYes sir absolutely and we have a lot of great students here in the state of Wyoming and there are a lot of great students across the country who need to know that there are opportunities even out of state but you have to be\nSmart and you have to do your due diligence in that process at searching for higher education in addition to being the lowest cost per resident tuition if a doctor or renting institution we're near the very lowest for non residents to come to Wyoming so we had a lot to offer not just here in the great state of Wyoming from coast to coast north and south\nWe can be a solution that provide students an incredible opportunity for education\nAnd we're going to be very very good at making sure that we are helping\nA student be successful not just students access and part of that is not racking up a lot of debt at the end of their degree completion\nI meant so how many students on your campus\nWe have we have a little over or twelve thousand so twelve thousand a little over four hundred students here that call themselves cowboys\nYou know that's a good size school that's not too big and not too small and so that's that's just right those are Goldilocks deal just right very cool very cool ... it's an honor to talk to you again rather thank you for coming on whether ...\nThank you very much a best wishes to you

what a neat thing that the college the University of the state is buying it for every single high school now if you're a business or university and you'd like to do something like that maybe you don't have to maybe don't have the money to buy the whole state or something every high school in the state\nSome states have more high schools and others can you imagine you know but uh um\nYou know maybe you just want to do it would be to the hospital used to go to um I went over spoke to them in the building where I used to go to high school the other day it's now a middle school so I had all the

reason I'm asking that as we're about thirty four thousand dollars behind on making our mortgage uh caught up to Fifteen your pace I'm\nSorry no you're not you paid off Ninety four of one twenty\nOf obvious a step to stuff like student loans car launch haven't started towards the mortgage at\nAll that's not your mortgage no okay wow how what's the balance on your mortgage a one party seven okay and what's your household income or right on the hundred\nGood for you you're doing great man killed in a way to go um so what's your interest right on your mortgage\nThree and a half a minute when I re fi yeah there you\nWouldn't know riff on this um you'll just start paying extra moment when you get your baby step six and you'll probably pay it off and about seven years maybe you would\nSay you would lead it back there even though we started off as a thirty year I was I'm sure we should put that in a two and finished that get caught up before we were all the three\nNo no no because here's the thing when you pay a thirty like a Fifteen in other words if you calculate your uh Fifteen your payment and a third of your payment and the difference if you just pay that extra on your thirty every month it'll pay off in Fifteen\nNow that you don't have to refinance to convert a thirty dollar Fifteen particularly with a three and a half percent interest rate and a five percent interest rate environment you definitely don't want to let her all that great right we got\nYeah there was no chance of race I I was just I'm Wondering if we should just put that as a thirty four down their heart cherry\nI'm a holiday would drive all but I see what you're saying no no because you know all we're doing is just by bishops Sixers pay extra around the house and you're just going to show that you're going to turn to the house it's going to happen at about the same pace as if you put it into baby step to\nWell I can tell you that my wife is going to be very happy to hear that she is just about tired of drawn out weekly menus and a grocery shopping with any pension with a baby and you\nKnow you need to get you need to get through with baby step to that's why we have a baby step six

good work and I think you're going to uh how old are you\nI Am thirty three you know\nI I really think that you're probably going to have a million ... million dollar network before you're forty five\n[noise] well um I really I Love hearing that\nIs this is where our story begins\nI'm I took a really good job as a project construction project manager for the pipeline construction company and that was the the big increase in income ... and then I was able to pay off all the debt and then save up six months merges you fund and then I was laid off oh and so boom there and happened on all the

I'm about seven weeks into the class I was offered a job and then I took the job and moved to Pennsylvania mhm and then uh in may\nWe got engaged and then in June of this year we got married but oh so then that's where I start the story starts together\nOkay I see and on so you were working to get out of the plan a separately but together and then getting only been married how long since June why or congratulations thank you what a way to start off Ninety thousand dollars I mean that's like the perfect job and knocked it out\nIt was it was a it was all got thing I mean I Know you're clear you

was able to coordinate a few ... moved to Indiana, Pennsylvania oh wow so I'm kind of able to stay engaged with some couples and help them out and their journey and those those a lot of fun as a big source motivation for me\nIt is you're when other people are doing it it keeps you wrote one for sure so coordinating a class while you're getting out of debt is not a bad idea at all men hold it old you're out there on the road for sure and so a faith or what do you got what are you guys tell people the key to getting out of that is\nReally I think fair asked we because we started that ... we were our biggest cheerleader then ... and it's so normal to have that and\nWe didn't want to be normal I guess and and so I guess just really ... and getting started and that's just what it takes to get your feet off the ground and go\nAnd we figured on normal shocks now yeah but I mean you being a mess right now if you still had all this power around you\nWere able to face this job layoffs I mean when I was grinning ear to ear because I was able to move back to Texas I mean when when he put me in his office and uh we've got to let you go if we have been shut down so I was a man this is this is actually kind of cool and [laughter] I'm not big on the job anyway so says this is a great um you start something fun\nIt does change that conversation\nAbout you know done\nYeah I've got a big pile of money I have no debt is is there ... I got to lay off as a different ... and then I have a big pile of debt and no money and I got laid off it's a different different rule while well why do you guys were proud of you congratulations very very well on\nGot a copy of Chris ... book for you retire inspired that's the next chapter in your story for you go to be millionaires and you are on your way without a doubt\nYou know how to do it now that you know how to make this stuff called money behave\nAnd you've learned it at a very young age and very young in your marriage learned a lot of people go twenty Thirty years and they're still fighting about money all the time I mean you've got the advantage of being a head of the curve on them where to go guys or rock stars thank\nYou Don Cody and face Waco, Texas Ninety thousand dollars but all in Seventeen months making thirty than one dirty than dirty you heard the story I Love and counted down let's hear a debt free scream three to one where\n\nWell done well done [noise] our question that goes from ... dot com found out for yourself why ... is the number\nOne online retailer of custom window covering you get free samples free shipping\nMan with a new promos that they run every month you'll save even more universal promo code Ramsey to get the best deals rules and restrictions apply\nToday's question comes from Christian in Florida they took out a lease on a vehicle about four months ago before enrolling in financial ... I feel like I made one of the worst mistakes in my lap [laughter] I was wondering if you give me some advice on how it would affect me if I were to return Elise car\nTo the dealership or at this point or just keep the vehicle or none of the above\nWe take her car back that you owe money on or signed a lease on that's effectively are falling\nThat you owe money on or signed a lease on that's effectively\nA voluntary repossession and that that would be dumb because they're going to sell the car after they've repossessed it and are there are an already possession lot\nAnd then they're going to sue you for the difference if you don't pay them the difference immediately\nAnd you don't have the different she goes you're broke so I don't know that would be a dumb idea we're not going to do that um what we are going to do is find out two pieces of information one is called the car free ... company that you are paying the ... to ...\nAnd find out what the early buyout on the car is\nNow the early buyout is different than the total of your lease payments pleasure residual value at the end it should be less because you're these leases are very new and there should be it's kind of like an early pay off I'm Alone when it doesn't include all the intro stripped from\nThe time that you know from keeping alone the whole time\nShow the early buyout as your hourly pay off now now that what is what struck by the car off they can get the title in your hand then you compare that to KB dot com Kelley Blue book dot com private sale what the car is actually worse\nAnd I'll just make up some numbers let's pretend that the early buyout is twenty thousand and then you look it up in the car is actually worse sixteen thousand that would leave you four thousand dollars in the whole probably not far off of what you're going to find\n... four thousand dollars in the home and you sell the car for sixteen you've got to put four thousand dollars cash with the sixteen in order to get the title for the buyer\nAnd so um\nYou have to have that other four thousand dollars you have to be able to cover the whole the journey and the amount that you are upside down\nIn the way you would do that is obviously alone and so you start working with your local credit union with your local bank and you get a loan lined up for the amount that you're upside down and you put the car up for sale and you sell the car\nFor as much as you can possibly get for which is more than they will show at four in the report lot so the bottom line is you're going to be responsible for this difference either way but the differences greater and you do more damage to your life and lose more control of your life by doing a repossession and so\nYou cover the difference cover the amount that you're upside down with another loan and I'd rather be four thousand dollars in debt than twenty four thousand dollars in debt or whatever the numbers are so um they ribs utility to borrow money no day rooms you don't need to move some of the debt and get rid of the majority of the debt by doing that\nAnd so you borrow and cover the amount that you're upside down [noise]\nYou know guys we been talking a lot about
