watching this\nI watched it on Fox Fox had a little box in the lower right hand corner of a of people who appear to be in the hallways of maybe Congress holding up signs anti Kavanaugh science we

see the screen and the bottom right the there were two women that were in the forefront and you could just tell they weren't happy the way the same with going and they put their hand over their head

she said\n\nWith with what you said unreasonable none of it made any sense to you don't you care about how she ... got to her position\nShe said she spent more time on this went over hundreds of cases a was a brief did she said I think once a week by some a group of legal experts so she can understand what this was all about\nAnd she very carefully went over Christine forced testimony and very sensitive Lee fit as I said before that uh that she believes her she believes something happened before we can assign what happened to her to Kevin Oh there's got to be fairness\nAnd while this is not a criminal trial and therefore you don't apply their standard of beyond a reasonable doubt into a moral certainty certainly has got to be at least more like even the knot and she went over the evidence in such a name for people\nWho she claims were were there and the four people have no recollection evidence that they weren't there now now what do you do with that\nAnd ... also said that the person who who took her to the party or or brought her back a has never shown up she got home somehow she didn't fly she didn't say that about didn't fly I added that but um she got home somehow

really know where does know how she got that isn't how she got back didn't tell anybody she said that just doesn't fast past the fundamental fairness tests and everything she said it was reasonable she's a moderate\nBut the women in the bottom right hand corner apparently weren't listening or had turned it off or felt that\nUh somehow didn't make any sense I mean did you hear what you had to say\nDoes not matter that you want people to think it through I thought you wanted to be an FBI investigations have to have more confidence that Dr Ford allegation had been thoroughly bet if you
