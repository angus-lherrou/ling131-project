remiss if I didn't start out talking about the recent\nSpate of bombs or at least a would be bombs I guess and the arrest of a suspect\nI don't even want to say his name because often these people like the fame or infamy for that matter that they acquire by these dastardly acts\nThe suspect but we did have previous arrests and was known to the authorities but we can't prevent every crime or a threat in this country I'm Amazed that we prevent as many as we do and and you know figure out who's up to what\nWhat one has to be impressed with a quick action of the ...\nWho was up to what but one has to be impressed with a quick action of the authorities to find the suspect\nIt never ceases to amaze me how professional an excellent our law enforcement people are they are truly amazing and and in fact ah one of the things I set for all the years that you know the top press is not that effective bought\nThe day in and day out people who do the job are terrific\nAnd it was good to see by the way the FBI Director make a statement about the effectiveness of his team and others who helped out\nActually I don't really you but I felt the FBI Director disappeared and he was on the FBI's ten most wanted list you know never hear from him into his like he doesn't exist\nI've not been happy with his lack of enthusiasm and taking actions against those in his department who abuse their authority and they clearly did\nAnd speaking of unhappy with leadership I see where attorney general sessions if you're watching today he made a statement showing some leadership and one of his last\nMy opinion likely high profile lax\nBefore his dismissed I I think the only reason he's not being dismissed by the president is goes all the issues and people you know with the Mueller investigation and everything else that's going on and his next attorney general wouldn't be approved\nRight now with you know what do you want another uh Kavanaugh hearing to take place this is not the time but he's never lived up to the expectations I have for him\nAnd I think many others did too I remember he was the first one that came out for President Trump's certainly a mentor for senator who did so and he took some of what a risk so you think he's got courage he's a risk taker nah\nOut of the cold and satisfy your sweet tooth at\nMom from a mean trick or treating to benefit the red

in now and join the conversation eight eight eight nine seven one eight eight eight nine seven one seven to for three setting fire to the airwaves it's do Larry Elder show\nMore guys were filling in for Larry Elder of the pain free or at least factor dot com studios and as I said with your calls at eight eighty nine seven one page what you call in about\nYour reaction to everybody in the media seems that way to me are certainly on the left trying to blame President Trump for what this crazy guy did as if this guy did it because of what President Trump says because of course everything that goes wrong is President Trump's full and everything goes right like our economy\nIs because of President Obama and if you didn't know that just that ... he he mentions it all the time I was calling me that's because of what I start okay which by the way explains why they were so against now justice Canada it wouldn't have mattered if the president had nominated a left is like the pope\nWhatever the president is for their against remember they were against whoever the nominee was they didn't even know the name it didn't matter they had their son's ready\nThat is their basic platform this November and it doesn't matter if the president has done a great job none of it matters the hazing and they hate him with a passion you know I thought that we reached the ... the top with George W. Bush in their hatred no\nThis one is being surpass this bumbling fools could never had beaten their candidate and they will never acknowledged the great things that he has done\nSo these acts will not long be about this evil did you notice just like it wasn't long about they usually for that didn't last that wasn't about her it was about the Democrats regaining power so she she's like an asterisk now that's what she's going to probably be an industry\nSo it'll just be always about punishing President Trump and all Republicans because we're evil and they are not you get it which is even more reason why you have to vote tell me what you think as I said it eight eight eight one eight eight eight nine seven ones\nThe vote tell me what you think is they set an eight eight eight one eight eight eight nine seven one six age\nIt has also been amazing to see the Democrats in the media in action\nYou know the Democrats than going to use these acts to their parties and the vantage point for the media to be so blatant in their advocacy is all new in the age of Trump they haven't been on partial their views for many years now a lot of us know that that's not a secret but\nThey used to pretend here's the difference that they were non biased no more now does out in the open with their advocacy and you can even see it in their questions what's his name Jim Acosta from CNN hardly hiding his disdain for the president I'm telling you you could see that in his questions\nThey're out to get the president and make no mistake about it and the media has enormous power to influence the debate in our elections and the president is right to call them out on this\nShow the president has rightly call that the press for who they are and the press cannot deal with it in their righteous indignation\nAnd just today I was watching getting ready for the show they always Shepard Smith on Fox saying that Trump's phrase lock her up and the chance to encourage in that vein and CNN sucks are the kinds of things that ... that people like the suspect on so Mary was Trump is responsible for it\nBut those of us on the right blame people with ... bad values were bad acts not those who share their political views\nBut of course that we're on the right blamed Bernie Sanders for his support or remember who shot and seriously injured Congressman Steve ... and the other cars and he would have wiped them out if he could\nBut President Trump is responsible no matter what he says even when he tries to unify seasonal ...\nCNN is hopeless by the way I I Try to watch what's the other one MSNBC it's it's not easy watching each house I I live in another planet and there's a real argument to be made for not letting Hillary Clinton be above the law yeah CNN is hopeless that's my point and President Trump is right\nAnd a lot of supporters are people who argue with me when I've done all the shows\nThey said how could you say you know here's my position if Hillary and bill will agree never bother us again and leave the scene which is I Know it was impossible it's not going to happen then I might agree not to indict her if I had any power to say that oh you could imagine the calls I got mark how could she be above the law and they had a great point\nThat it's not inciting people to write or to physically harm someone that is legitimate political 'cause see\nWhat it's asking us to see on the right and for the Democrats and the left and now the media that is unacceptable\nSo they're almost all on the left and we are fortunate to have someone like President Trump call them out we've had so many weeks presidents in the past and it's absolutely refreshing\nTo see someone taking back to that\nEven if the media the left the Democrats can't take President Trump is not responsible for the craziness in our country\nTell me what you think as I said eight eight eight nine seven one sage and let's try to get a caller to in Houston, Texas let's go to Mark Mark you're on with mark Hi Mark\nHi Mark a the Mark I'm what you were bringing up about a media is absolutely true they\nDon't want to record the fact that the a cycle and he is a psycho prior to the threatened to blow up Florida light power and I I don't know some other bomb threats to sow what Trump responsible for though no\nHe happens to be just you know the the ... the available ... now and another distinction is the fact that\nYou know Trump literally did not say let's go blow them operated the worst you said a few times during his his uh uh\nUh uh not his candidacy while he was trying for a couple of times he said oh yeah go ahead on the ... or something like that that was that but he hasn't done anything like that where the the left whether it's the actual a political people or the new\nUh they've all actually said\nA going out and confront them and and and and and run 'em out of the stores all this other stuff so um again that's that's part of the contrast and different\nYeah like Maxine Waters right get in their face wherever you see them you know don't let them leave especially if you know they're in the cabinet ... this is what they do when they do it's OK mark don't you get that\nOh of course it's the the the ultimate double standard that everyone recognizes that accept them well do they recognize it but they're not going to say than even most of the hard core I Would say\nYou know a intelligent Democrats because that's the other thing to what they're doing and the people that are acting out these acts of violence most of these are actually borderline psychotic that are reacting to something there that way if the Trump to arrangements then now they could argue that that's the cause of it now too and that makes them psychotic\nYeah it ... you know

retired if nothing else to do\nHave signed onto a letter condemning President Trump's attacks on the media and accusing him of inciting violence against the press is condoning of political violence as part of the stain pattern of attack on a free press which includes labeling any reportage he doesn't like it is fake news in Bahrain reporters and news organizations when he wishes to punish from press briefings\nAnd events the open letter reads\nMany of these journalists were from ABC News and they took a particular exception to in praising the president praising\nRepresentative Gregg June forte as my guy well discussing his body slam of guardian reporter Ben\nJacobs last year it goes on I don't even want to read it\nI agree with the president does so does that mean that I'm condoning political violence you you guys are still biased you just so\nObviously there Jim Acosta asking questions outrageous kind of questions they might as well be when did you murder your wife for all I care or they they're so ... it's obvious to all of us and finally we have a president United States was not letting them get away with that my God and just fantastic and\nThey can't do it because you

did\nYou know I've been changed to where he targeted a African American woman shot her and said I don't care white people you know now I I think what happened was terrible\nBut I don't understand why it by the media is going leaving out the fact that thanks to the army and then people would say and I don't understand why they had to make it even more harrowing than it was it seems like oh that does it make\nYou don't I don't know if it if it makes things work and I I just don't understand why the truth isn't enough because the truth is that\nLet's see let's hear this have any form of

the guys up the pipe bombs we understand that but we all don't get guilty of that\nBecause of it we we don't take responsibility for\nPersonal Trump hasn't done anything I reached look he's not a perfect package you doesn't always say what I wanted to say what he's standing up to the other side which hasn't happened before and that's why you have the reporters are suing out that the document
