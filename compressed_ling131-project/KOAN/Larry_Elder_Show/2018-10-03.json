you ever reaction\n[noise] oh yeah I have a reaction to a jerky so to speak\nOr not only was he sanctioned by judge Royce Lamberth lying under oath because I had to testify\nA judge Royce Lamberth lying under oath because I had him testify during the Clinton years in a deposition in fact twice because Lamberth made him come back\nStephanopoulos was one of the heads of the war room alone with Hillary Clinton James Carville and himself base near the number of women they did that\nAt the direction of Hillary and Bill Clinton and they did it to protect the president so for him to be talking about you know how cabinets defending themselves and how the president is backing him up by saying that\nUh you know he never takes the side of the accused I mean that's terribly hypocritical and of course one would expect from George Stephanopoulos\nTell me the women you represented and tell me what specifically are stepping up all is due to malign them\n\nBut with regard to Gennifer Flowers and eat they were all working together Stephanopoulos Carville and the rest of them they\nBroke into her house and a\nThreatened her terrorized here they had her lauded by the IRS when it was a mess with

and their relationship with Twenty one years so you know it was a scorched earth policy to try to keep these women quiet\nAnd you know for stepping up all the way it at all here it's just unbelievable and I might add Laurie at the time that Lamberth will judge Lamberth Stephanopoulos have lied under oath\nHe came into that deposition unshaven disheveled insulted the judge this was about ... the illegal attaining the FBI Files and nine hundred Republicans and others are Stephanopoulos or\nWas caught by the judge or not telling the truth and at that time Sam Donaldson who with his co host\nOn

now you know he's a multi millionaire and he's riding high ABC\nAnd now he feels a duty bound to take a shot at the president simply because he defended judge Kavanaugh\nLarry claiming a you said you had a step monopoly under deposition twice did he ever admit under oath to doing some of the things that you claim it's done\nWell I had a very good memory [laughter] you know the the favorite phrase of the Clinton people was\nI had no specific regular recollection you remember something I Can't remember now on the front of the of the bar justice so now he wouldn't have the right thing and like I said he he was found to light and all those\nWell given the fact that he won't admit the anything how do you know that he himself has done these things how do you put his fingerprints on these things\nThat's been widely reported him in Reno because actually ... you wrote a book called the war room which became a documentary where in that book he admitted to working with Hillary Clinton to address\nAllegations by your accusers\nBy Bill Clinton's accuses the women that I represented in ironically Laurie in today's world with some of the left has judges erotic patrol simply denying an allegation is enough to say that you think someone in fact the president's got two lawsuits right now because he denied that he sexually harassed or any women\nHe's very lessons jak allowed to go for
