members of the family engage in something illegal\n[noise] well you know what I'm I Can't tell a you know I haven't looked at the water hundred thousand pages of documents that they seem to provide 'em\nYou know there's there are a few things in here which is proven to be true that was probably beyond the pale of law\nUm what what what bothered me about the uh the article is the the authors obviously showed their bias in several places I'm One of which where they say that uh the rich never really pay their full freight\nUm and ah there's a couple of places where they're under explanation allows them to make some rather crucial accusations which\nIf I knew all the facts I might be able to disapprove mhm so I'll give you an example if you if I may sure um suppose that I buy a house for half a million dollars I put twenty percent down and I borrow with a mortgage the remaining four hundred thousand dollars or the purchase price now\nWhat is that worth to me what is that included in my network has like if I gave it away at that point what would the value of the gift be or the value of the gift will be a hundred thousand dollars because it would be subject to that market and\nSo now let's say there's a downturn like there was in the Nineteen nineties or two thousand three or two thousand eight when everybody lost value in real estate and now my real estate is worth only four hundred and twenty thousand dollars\nAnd like a lot of clients of mine decided when the downturn came that was a good time to give away real estate to their children mhm so now it's worth four hundred and twenty thousand dollars I give it to my children watch the gift that I report on my gift tax return\nWatch four hundred and twenty thousand dollars minus a four hundred thousand dollar mortgage that's twenty thousand dollars left that would be the value of the gift\nNow a decade later\nThere's been improvements all around the neighborhood knew Tony retailers developments of of of various sizes and I sell my children's sell that house for seven hundred thousand dollars or have to pay off the mortgage so they keep three hundred thousand dollars\nI'm not even going to talk about taxes at that point but they kept three hundred thousand dollars and then one could say that they got Fifteen times the valuation of the gift\nBut you see how it was perfectly legal they didn't but the article doesn't explain leverage of real estate and so as a result I mean you you can easily said my gosh how could that ever happened how could you ever invest in something and then sell it ten years later for Fifteen times what the value was one it was given\nReal charge recharge my guess he's an attack in the state planning lawyer a review said there were a couple of things that that jumped out at you and if they could be proven to be true it would be problematic what what's the most serious one\nThought well and the one that I really found to be a very serious is there's there's a there's a statement that when Donald Trump's a casino was in very bad shape or you know just ... drowning in debt\nThat apparently his father or sent an emissary to buy three million dollars worth of chip\nRead them and put you on hold for for for for this was going to take that on the other side I remember when that happened some some guy went in there and bought three point five million dollars worth of chips\nGiving simply the casino that amount of money in cash and didn't cash the chips that basically gave a Donald Trump a three point five million dollar loan from his dad as far as I can recall uh
