stand for the flag I Neal for the cross I'm not making this up\nSalvadoran this the hard way south wasn't simply a loyal Democrat he was the head of the Allegheny county Pennsylvania Democratic Party also a military veteran you think should be allowed to stick up for America once in a while but now he made the mistake of writing this in a Facebook post quote I stand for the flag I looked across\nAnd I'm not so long ago most Democrats would have nodded in agreement that today if hate speech and he lost his job but tonight their losses are gaining marks office joins us now\nMark thanks for coming on the show um mistake that I mean did you have to leave your job running the county's Republican rather Democratic Party because of those words on Facebook\nAnd again also a military that I stand for the flag I knew what the cross loses his job\nWhile I was the executive director of the county party um and yes basically that's exactly what happened because of that post which reminds me it was over a year ago that I write hosted that uh I was asked to resign yes\nSo you're a veteran you say you stand for the flag and you were denounced as a racist for that\nCorrect the people who brought this to light tried to tie it to the NFL players taking a knee\nSo I I look I'm confused I'm I'm not a democratic voter never have been but you know I've been here a long time not a lot of decent patriotic Democrats doesn't seem like that long ago\nIt wouldn't have been weird for the head of a Pennsylvania democratic county party to say I stand for the flag and you know before the cross would it have been five even\nJust remember this is the the party DNC that blew the inclusion of God in their platform number that\nYears ago a crazy thing to say\nAbsolutely not and and I can tell you that even just last year when the Pittsburgh Steelers decided to stay in the locker room instead of come out for the national anthem\nA one player villain a waiver who's an Army Ranger came out and stood by himself with his hand over his heart and he was not considered a racist so this even as much as a year ago or it would not have been unheard of to hear somebody a leader in the party defend the flag\nSo what I mean you're the executive worthy executive director of the party you obviously know a lot of Democrats in your county traditionally democratic county what if what if your ... your former coworker said two years since this happened\nI haven't heard from any of them I understand the party line is that it was a personal matter and I can respect that or however those that are elected officials or party members who are not tied with my direct sort of chain of command if you will I have not heard from many of them\nThat's a shocking what is the saving you about how the parties change\nWell it makes me wonder if there is room for moderate Democrats in the Democratic party nowadays um there were some elected officials who said that they acknowledge that they've known me and I'm not a racist however it wasn't sensitive and unfortunately\nIf my patriotism and standing up for family friends has become insensitive or that I think we as Democrats need to stop and reevaluate exactly what we stand for\nStanding up for the flag is considered racist then what happens to the country do you think going forward\n[noise] that's that's a good question I'm a little worried about that\nWhen you're going to do\nWell um I'd like to continue to bring this to light and continue to voice concern for this very issue um and then in the short term um ironically my son is going in the Airforce and sixty days so I Want to spend some time with him and in the un I Will continue to fight this cause as long as I can and continue to clear my name\nGod Bless and let let me
