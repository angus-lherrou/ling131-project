appreciate [noise]\nIt's my pleasure Dan Dan what can we look for in health care in the event that these guys by these guys are talking about Democrats take control of the house in November\nOh my God well let's try to put in Medicare for all and that's scary because they have a hundred and sixty three progressive Democrats that said that's what they want to do and I would be a disaster it may sound good but it'd be a total disaster\nI understand I think it was a Bloomberg estimated the cost of this or something like thirty two trillion dollars over the course of the decade\nAnd so you can make it clear that was trillions now right but thirty trillion national debt in into oblivion a national that would be so big it'll bankrupt\nOblivion or national that would be so big it'll bankrupt I say the horrible horrible thing\nBut Dan Obamacare solve all our problems remember when Joe Biden said yeah it's a big deal I I thought it solve all our problems\nWell I'll tell you what Obama said you can keep your doctor if you want to and that was a lie this one here\nYou can't keep Medicare Bernice plan replaces Medicare itself with Medicare for all the different kind of policy\nNot only that is twenty two million American people who have Medicare Advantage plans which are run by private companies and he would eliminate all of them that would be an increase for seniors this would hurt seniors especially and that's why a Mac is against Medicare for all\nWhen when you want to get they left wing persons drawn to tighten Dan Weber asked him or her who's going to pay for it who's going to pay for who's going to pay for thirty two trillion dollars over ten years yep\nThat's great and in addition to that you're going to have rationing\nPeople say oh well Canada and Great Britain have great plants\nEverywhere I should keep this number in line twenty two weeks that's how long it takes for a major surgery and Canada\nAfter they've examined you may take months but you have been examined and now after they say yes you need this major surgery twenty two weeks average wait a lot of those people cross over the border and they get their operations in America\nThen wherever is my guest founder and CEO of a Mac ... association of mature American citizen\nNow Dana probably mangled this guy's name but I Know the father of the Canadian health care system in Canada is named Claude Gaston way or something like that and he didn't win that founded it or in Quebec\nAnd all the other provinces ultimately adopted it he still lives are as far as I Know in his nineties and he's come out and recently said that I was wrong we should have had more competition I should not have outlawed private care and he pronounced the healthcare system uh Internet intended it pretty much a failure\nYeah yeah and well we just got to look at all socialize looking at a cute but they don't even have\nA aspirin available and the local drugstores look at Venezuela they are socialized the medical care thinking doctors running too much and now the poor people literally are dying and it's a shame socialism doesn't work because the socialism the individual man's nothing\nAnd I'm often asked people this question whenever I have a discussion about this\nCanada Great Britain they have a socialized medicine Canada has the what I think Obama wants to have which a single payer are in Great Britain has something very similar but when you take polls the majority of citizens in both Canada and Great Britain seem to like their system why is that\nBecause if they get a sniffle they can go into a local clinic than they wait in line a long time but that go to the local clinic and I'd get taken care of and it won't be any money out of their pocket\nUntil they have a serious problem not only that the recovery race after cancer operations after the hot operations because of the way they rushed the medical care is much less survival\nAnd Canada and Great Britain compared to the U.S was something depending on what type of cancer were somewhere between twenty and thirty percent higher survival rates because it's not a machine like they have over there\n[noise] oh yeah my family and

I think that's one\nOf her and me why he should have got to downhill from there he should he should have hung up after that\nExactly um\nDiminish um\nUm diminish um\nThe the other thing I think is you can turn on MSNBC or CNN or ABC or or or or CBS and watched Trump get ripped for free why go to a theater pay money popcorn and parking and see the same and you can see every night for nothing\n... exactly right there's no the left has been fumbling for the critique of Trump that actually going to work and they've tried so many different tax on the kind of out of ammunition and of course Trump is the guy to the ... back I mean he's emotionally incapable of not getting back\nOr even on things like Stormy Daniels and get back on every crime\nBut I think it it's widely Trump boxing aggression that has surprised the phone\nI'm Talking to the national ... birth of the nation or his latest documentary is now available and digital age teach your documentary of course ... death of a nation talks a lot about\nAh the Democrats use of the race card ... manipulate ... of race or their racist history do you think that Kanye West Kansas on people like that are beginning to get black people to rethink their assumptions\nOr yes absolutely I think that uh what's happening really is um no I was assigned as well as a black conservative intellectual open because it's very important in the eighties and nineties or people like Walter William Tom solo people like that I think this is the thing is that the idea that now working out\nA trumpet been a fantastic evangelist and helping with the help and um I think the black people look at ... not a racist bone and this guy's body\nIs outspoken a and he actually lean while he wants the whole country to prosper and he's he's black Americans no less white Americans Latino Asian American as part of this great American means so when you look at Trump's approval ratings I mean I'm actually a little done because\nRepublicans in general have been had trouble breaking ten percent in recent years and prompted them to thirty mhm\nUm what is your prediction didn't ask about the mid term ... tell me about the house\nWell I'm not a not so much of a product you know I wouldn't bet the ranch on this one my thought is that the the people who have been one to Peter out or that the Republicans will now my prediction is public and we'll narrowly hold the house will make gains in the Senate in ...\nYou know great hope that the Democrats would topple the Republicans and the year we talked with a lot of opportunity I think that blown it\nI think didn't ask if that happens or twenty sixteen uh I I don't think anything could could could match the devastation and uh as far as less is concerned about the election of Donald Trump's but this will be close if the Democrats don't get the house it's going to be close to election night back in twenty sixteen\nYup it is and it only will raise the stakes support for twenty twenty but it may very well made that jump will safely get at least one more Supreme Court appointment I mean that the Supreme Court in the back you gotta remember Larry we have not had the Supreme Court in our lifetime it's been seriously balance\nNot seem to have a narrow five four majority a completely different story to have six or eight\nMhm or the house the Senate and the Senate I think a number of races that looked\nTo be very close for hanging in the balance ... about it to the rights and people who seemed at one point to be winning Democrats are now in big trouble of all I think that this is actually looking pretty good for Republicans there's no reason to be overconfident of course the main thing it was it for a while to get to realize the importance steak\nI think if the public in turn out it's going to be a very good November\nMy guess is the ... the death of a nation available right now on digital HD diminish this may sound like a bizarre question a Donald Trump has called people all sorts of names he's called a Robert De Niro low IQ Maxine Waters low IQ\nLion Ted Pocahontas and on and on and on why hasn't the left come up with a name for him\nI think well they have and I think part of the problem with calling him name is that they think they're falling off of them I mean I think when the left came up with Stormy Daniels they thought they had him they thought they had him because they thought here's Trump he's a Republican\nThe Republican base is never going to put up with anything like that the Republicans thought costs and they're drawing out the law knives and sort of life in their own and they were very confident that what happens it's up with them the more they threw out strong Stormy Daniels drop like what else is that\nA man that's in the march forward in the face of the kind of attacks\nMore in the lead then Republican guarding recover it puts them in a category of his own\nBut ... I would've thought the Democrats would have gotten a bunch of consultants together and figured out a label words a name a moniker they could put on Trump and because he does it for everybody else I'm just shocked they haven't done it\nA little bit fried I mean they tried with the orange heritage writer in your family impacted makes fun of his kids they drive the factors label the price of racist label I mean they wired with the biggest guns ideological as that they've got\nA lot of it has actually worked so I think there are actually now when they first killed from there now very scared of\nDiminished as soon as they have been my guess death of a nation is now available and digital HD if you think the twenty six team was important twenty Eighteen as the Nash\nIs protected if he is right and the next I Hope you are I've always said it's just a coin toss I Hope you're right if it's gonna be twenty sixteen all over again and it's like coming on\nDrew runs and has now been been freed now he lived in Turkey for almost Twenty years and was one of thousands arrested in a wide government crackdown that followed that failed to against the Turkish government back in July of twenty sixteen\nHe was accused of committing crimes on behalf of terrorists or he was accused of trying to convert courage to uh uh Christianity\nAnd was accused of being part of a network of people that was involved in orchestrating the coup attempt\nThis country's always maintained that uh he has been unjustly detained he says he was never even told why she was detained now here is what pastor Brunson said\nWhen he was freed he prayed for Trump in the oval office listen to this\nWe're like prefer you referred for you often or as family my wife and I\nThink it will I needed probably more than anybody on this [laughter] so I Would that would be very nice thank\nYou thank you very much so you can [noise]\nBarakat\nI ask you [noise] borrow your Holy Spirit on President Trump you get from supernatural wisdom to accomplish all the plans are have for this country and for [noise]\n... you get from waste them enough to leave the country and to righteousness [noise]\nAfter you get from perseverance and NPR's thing for fans for truth I ask you protect them from slander from kind of means from those who would undermine bias or you make them a great blessing to this country\nWith your wisdom and strength persevere and way bless him [noise]\nMake you less our country [noise] Jesus name we blasted [noise]\nFree and fair\nTo the largest towns Denver [noise] fair to wish him and understanding it's fair to counsel\nHere it is now in the afterlife and then [noise] thank you very much\nSo I guess not everybody thinks presidents and Nazi Jay Sekulow if his lawyer says this is a big win\nAnd nothing was promised not to the church in exchange for the release of pastor Andrew Brunson\nHello this is a big when I was wondering what you did the productive representing everybody I thought what a great day it is or the Bronx and family and professor ... themselves and the president and the administration did just a phenomenal job it moving\nIt was when\nGeorge somebody's ... away in Ninety five ... ... am angry at all live in January ...

McCaskill\nShut off responded to our hidden camera investigation at a local uh Missouri newscast or in the last hour and what did she say she attacked\nA video of course she made a false statement in this state that she put out a she said that the Republican candidate for Senator John Paul II had brought you know lay in bed at somebody in her campaign that is not correct\nI had nothing to do with Josh all that never spoken to him he I I was the main investigator involved in this investigation\nAnd your listeners know our investigation put on the Capitol campaign showed\nMultiple staffers saying that uh that her and the cat's gonna bottles policies\nAre the same but quote people just can't know that uh other staffers talked about banning semi automatic rifles and the capital herself was caught on camera in the office talking to someone she thought worked for her\nSaying that there would be a gun stand up some type so the capitals now just respond on local news in Missouri are claiming that the Republican candidate had something to do with this which he did not\nAnd um but she's definitely on defense if you look at the uh a response that you just put out\nJames O'Keefe I looked at the video not only the the staff or talk about banning semi automatic rifles he talks about banning semi automatic firearms\nThat's right they talk about handguns Clara herself talks about

I don't think any swing state so what is an investigation exposures is that in order to get elected in order to get elected you have to lie to the people and that's what all the things got nixed a rose says\nI'm you know we can't let people know that Obama and McCaskill and saying here's another staffer says pretty shocking\nI say I prefer the name of Glen when free for the McCaskill campaign when asked if\nModerates will be upset once they do a bait and switch and they impeached Trump what the staffer says his quote get over it on club he's saying the moderates we'll just have to get over being lied to very devastating very powerful\nI mean maybe the most powerful undercover investigation we have ever done because it involves a sitting US Senator has\nNow responded to all of her staffers calling or wire\nHere is Claire McCaskill response teams will do\nWell in in some startling that Josh how I Would be part of fraudulently and betting somebody in my campaign\nUm is the attorney general say Missouri is supposed to be going after fraud not participating in it and\nSo um there was nothing there I've been very upfront about all my positions in fact now I remember that very individual talking to me\nTrying to get me to say\nTrying to get me to tell him to say something different\nAnd then what might physicians are and I said no you just got to tell the people on the

see what's really telling about this is how far they're willing to go to fortunately in bed somebody in my campaign\nUm that startling I've never seen that in a U.S Senate campaign before in the state of Missouri dreams\nWere first\nOf all it does it mean shoot the ball to fly it's categorically unequivocally falls\nGet Josh Hawley had anything to do with our investigative journalism I've never met him at for her to come out and said\nThat he is part of Rosalind betting somebody that ball and treated live on local TV in Missouri second of all you saw her waffling and bumbling and stumbling around through about guns her staff said that she supports a semi automatic rifle but\nShe told her that she supports a ban on a ours those are her words so she found ... you know and and it's a really amazing thing to the\nHeart beyond defense and lie about me and I'm I'm ... I'm certain wary of what's gonna happen next to this this other Senate candidate John always going to say that he had nothing to do with the chicken up to respond to that so I think were were cheating or goal of holding people accountable\nAnd I think that she's in a lose lose situation because it's not just wants to average ... paid campaign staff saying that she's a lawyer\nJohn Hollings her Republican opponent or what are the whole thing right now and you know whether or not your video and got in the ... early\n... I'm not a pollster but I Believe it's tied I think it's forty five forty five and I think the ultimate measure of success is local media coverage that that is what if you are purchasing ads all this money that gets poured into politics dog goes to buying ads and\nAnd I'm I'm only a matter of voters in Missouri for example and I can tell you right now at the local TV stations are opening with the videos so\nI think it will have an impact I think that the fact that she's on the fence and she's lying and she's not addressing the issue um I I we learned we have another video coming out and I'm thirty minutes and the next video and I'm going to quote some parts of the video here\nUh shows campaign workers saying they close have to essentially lie to try\nTo get to moderate voters they're talking about the pro life money I'm Sorry to Planned Parenthood money that they take these or drink Claire McCaskill staffers talking about taking money from Planned Parenthood indirectly masking the source of contributions\nAre going to we're going to hear your videos up on Larry Elder dot com and we'll check out your next one James O'Keefe president project here it's a dream was always that you very much for coming on regular\nNow every morning when I get up on the first things I Do if I drink super beach it's\nHarness the power of nutrient rich between created a super food that helps the body create more nitric oxide seat nitric oxide is a miracle Monaco that our bodies make the fuel cardiovascular health keeps our blood pressure down but as we age our bodies need help and generating more natural nitric oxide\nThe core philosophy of human that develops this product you have to develop heart healthy products for the body one piece\nOr ...
