Sanders the other day\nIt seems that the president has already reached a judgment about their stories and there does seem to be a pattern here when Roy Moore is accused from Bill O'Reilly is accused when Roger ales is accused when Rob Porter is accused and that one Brett Kavanaugh has accused the president consistently every single time takes the side of the math\nNow my next guest has represented virtually all of the primary accusers of Bill Clinton his name is Larry claiming he's the founder judicial watch you know runs freedom was walking to the program Mr Larry claiming Larry how are you doing [noise] thank you Ira good to hear from Mary when you hear a Mr Clinton up all this and in fact I'm only as\nA method of going after the president and then a Sarah Sanders a four

George ... so to speak or not only was he sanctioned by judge Royce Lamberth line on the road because I had him testify during the Clinton years in a deposition in fact twice ... made him come back\nStephanopoulos was one of the heads of the war room alone with Hillary Clinton James Carville and himself\nBase near the number of women they did that\nAt the direction of Hillary and Bill Clinton and they did it to protect the president so for him to be talking about you know how cabinets defending themselves\nHow the president is backing him up by saying that uh you know he never takes beside the accused I mean that's terribly hypocritical and of course one would expect from George Stephanopoulos\nTell me the women you represented and tell me what specifically are stepping up on the state to malign them\nBoth regard to Jennifer flowers and eat they were working together Stephanopoulos Carville and the rest of them they broke into her house and a\nThreatened her terrorize

she published a semi fictional book about Bill Clinton and their relationship Twenty one years so you know it was a scorched earth policy to try to keep these women quiet\nAnd you know for stepping up all the way in it all your system believable and I might add Laurie at the time that Lamberth will says lamprey Stephanopoulos have lied under oath\nCame into that deposition on shape and the shovel insulted the judge this was about ... illegal painting the FBI Files and nine hundred Republicans and others are Stephanopoulos or\nWas caught by the judge or not telling the truth and at that time Sam Donaldson who was his co host\nOn NBC's last week called me up and he asked me about the monopoly is whether he had been found to have lived and I said Sam how could you leave this guy on the air when he's now a certified liar and of course now you know he's a multi millionaire he's riding high ABC\nAnd now he feels a duty bound to take a shot at the president simply because he defended judge Kavanaugh\nLarry claiming a you said you had a stepping up ... under deposition twice did he ever admit under oath to doing some of the things that you claim you've done\nWell he had a very good memory the memory you know the the favorite phrase of the Clinton people was\nI have no specific regular recollection means I remember something I just can't remember now on the front of the of the bart justice so now he wouldn't admit anything and like I said he he was found to light on those\nWere given the fact that he won't admit to anything how do you know that he himself has done these things how do you put his fingerprints on these things\nThat's been widely reported him in Reno because actually ... you wrote a book called the war room which became a documentary where in that book he admitted to working with Hillary Clinton to address\nFalse allegations by your accusers\nBy Bill Clinton's accuses the women that are representing ironically Laurie in today's world with some of these left his judges who are out of control denying an allegation is enough to say that you the same from one in fact the credit has got to lawsuits right now because he denied that he sexually
