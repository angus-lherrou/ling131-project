personal fund\nFrom being transferred to the United states to Mexico on doors and ...\nBeing transferred to the United states to Mexico Honduras Guatemala and I'm Wondering if that doesn't make sense of the logical or at least a part of a logical answer to the immigration problem we're happy\nTo stop the remittances from here to Mexico\nMexico Honduras Guatemala\nI I Would imagine we do have the technology to do it the question is whether or not or would be effective are these people are already here are and the question is what do we do to prevent more illegal alien from coming here and that's what the president's trying to do\nOr if he were to somehow try to stop remittances a and a remittances that his money coming from people in this country to Mexico\nIf I Believe they're a second uh largest source of income after oil\nUm I don't know it seems to me that doing that would also exacerbate the problem in in Mexico I hear people say that\nIf President Trump for example withdraws the aid from Honduras in Guatemala it'll simply make conditions there even worse or and or would create even more so called migrants it seems to me the argument against Mexico is that Mexico's economy under developed\nAnd needs to be developed and you stop the remittances even if you could do it legally\nI'm not sure how that would create conditions that would make it better for Mexicans to stay in Mexico as opposed to coming up here illegally but thanks for the idea of you know look into it Thai is in San Antonio Texas tiger in the area of the show\nLove your show man thank you so much thank you um\nSo yeah that that gun on a fantastic and that as a conservative or for now a long long time one of the\nThings I've understood is that the Democratic party at an absolute going well hold on the black community now and the mind that uh for about six years and they had no intention of ... what is going to take the but more than a month for them to get out of their belts\nAnd so\nBut but to my point you you had a caller asked you how many legal\nImmigrants are accepted into this country um\nAnd I happen to know living in San Antonio I'm married to a Hispanic woman her family is from Mexico we as a country per year except about one million legal immigrants of which about six hundred thousand\nOr residency changes I don't know maybe they have dual citizenship and they're moving to America I'm not sure what the situation it so that leaves you with about four hundred thousand so that boils down to almost eleven hundred per day okay legal citizens that we are accepting into this country and at this point in our\nHistory we have the most legal immigrants that we have ever had and that's thirty seven thirty seven now\nIf you if you estimate our population a\nMillion and do that math that comes up almost ... percent of our population legal mhm\nSo you know to make the argument and this is through not only democratic uh you know president but Republican and then is raisins and and this has been going on for a long long time\nUm but you know I wanted to ask you you mentioned earlier on your show that Mexico has spell any policy for ... body who enters the country illegally that's right my my bigger question here my bigger question is if Mexico is\nAnd from what I hear they have a blockbuster and be willing to help you you say that they're they're pretty much just escorting them and kind of you know I'm just protecting them or whatever they're doing and how would that these people are not rounded up by the federal rally immediately or Italy\nAt medium that they can't for the the the integrity of Mexico's ... themselves\nMhm ...\nIf they're if they're entering legal you know that the phone so why should they why should you know if they're if they're agreeing to help us and we just went on to a new trade deal with them and it just seems like the third mainly fostering these people to our border and then they're going to see how we handle\nThat's exactly what's going on why do you think Trump is so upset when you think papa so angry because the Mexican government allows the so called caravan from
