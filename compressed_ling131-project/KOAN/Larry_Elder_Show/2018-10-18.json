other cases you know we hear so much today about tolerance and inclusive easy a it was the exact reason that the city of Atlanta gave for firing the chief and it's quite ironic just say that we're

making Kelly said blood coming out of her eyes like coming out of her wherever that was on this show\nYeah and then I thought I thought we had him in and he survived that it is\nAnd I said okay well

what he means to the country what do you mean through his party yeah ah and\nBut you just said nine out of ten Republican support him so what do you mean when he meets with party he should just know\nThat he has to be better than this because if he isn't he has to be better than this who else is going to be you know and if he doesn't see that he if he isn't better who else is going to be better\nSo if Trump isn't better nobody can be a ... ... ... ... and\nSure whether it's because of his own sense you know it felt well you're talking about but just what he means to the country what it means to his party yeah uh and he should just know that he has to be better than this because if he isn't\nWho else is going to be you know and if he doesn't see that it's so if he isn't better who else was going to be is a rotating things that people are using that as an excuse to be that way also then he's not as smart as I thought he was when he got down do you think he's smart\nI thought you
