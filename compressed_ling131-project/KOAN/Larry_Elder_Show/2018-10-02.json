Eighteen forty three you've come across Larry what am I poll dot com and again make sure you've come across leery about the new excessively\nCompleted negotiations on a brand new deal to terminate and replace NAFTA Andy NAFTA trade agreements with an incredible new U.S Mexico Canada agreement called us\nEmbassy a sort of just what [noise] and [noise] we have\nNegotiated this new agreement based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity\nTo me it's the most important word and drag because we've been treated so unfairly by so many nations all over the world that we're changing that by the way without tariffs we wouldn't be talking about a deal just for those babies out there that keep talking about terrorists that includes Congress oh please don't charge tariffs\nWithout terrorists you wouldn't be we wouldn't be standing here I can tell you Bob and all of these votes would not be standing here right now\nAnd we're totally prepared to do that if they don't negotiate once approved by Congress this new deal will be the most modern up to date and balance trade agreement and the history of our country\nWith the most advanced protections for workers ever develop\nNow the caller asked me if I'm prepared to apologize of course not\nLet me tell you something initially President Trump talked about terrorists in order for uh for national security remember that\nNever mind that we produce most of our studio here and the two other major suppliers Canada and Mexico are friendly countries so the national security stuff with BS and you know she stopped saying that\nNow if the goal is to reduce tariffs with our trading partners I'm all for in the short run doing something to make them stand down the question is is this going to benefit the American consumer and extra early to tell that\nNew York times called it a victory for the president and it is the hill did as well and it is because the campaign to reevaluate their to renegotiate NAFTA the question is is it going to be positive for the American consumers for example [noise]\nNew York times points out that for the first time the new agreement mandates that an increasing percentage of parts for any Tara free vehicle must come from so called high wage factory\nThe agreement says they'll sacrifice pay a minimum sixteen dollars an hour in every salaries for production workers that's about triple the average wage in Mexico right now and the assumption is that division will force automakers to strip supply\nNow and the assumption is that division will force automakers to strip suppliers from Mexico or Canada to this country\nBut there is to that automotive Alice had warned that the provision could have a damaging effect for Americans quote by raising costs for American car buyers and incentivizing only makers to move production to low cost countries outside of the country like China\nSo we don't we don't know yet and I want to find out more about it before I determine whether or not the president has done the right thing with NAFTA and know what's popular among the base especially and now they have to Bernie Sanders has become a anti free trade and um the Republican Party also anti free trade\nAre both parties now have pretty much the same position on trade\nOne more time this is about consumers and tariffs if they're designed to protect industries that are there are failing all they do is prevent the business people from doing the kinds of things that need to do in order to make those businesses competitive\nAnd if the idea is to retaliate against or the other countries for so called dumping products on us dumping simply means of other companies are being subsidized by their government\nThey're not making money but they are being subsidized by government and and if that's stupid why should we would retaliate by doing something equally stupid I still feel exactly the same if however the gambit is to cause our trading partners to reduce their tears in her goods\nOpening up their markets for our manufacturers and suppliers that's good but if ... if result in higher prices to the American consumer explained to me how that's a good idea\nSo it's too early to a a do a victory lap as far as I'm concerned I Want to find out more about it anyway thank you very much for uh for the call appreciate it triple eight nine seven one S.
