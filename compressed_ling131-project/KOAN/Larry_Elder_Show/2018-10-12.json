to\nKenya west made an appearance today at the oval office along with Jim Brown\nAnd the reporters were all there because Kanye West is a star and jump around a star otherwise wouldn't have given a rip\nAnd Kanye West ended up speaking almost ten minutes kind of a stream of consciousness sometimes it'd make a whole lot of sense but most of it had to do with his belief that black people need to rethink their assumptions and that the police have a job to do a and he did not like the idea of this knee jerk\nPulling out the race card\nAnd he's being hammered been called a sellout being called an Uncle Tom so real meat is President Trump is the biggest heath racist because that's why people are he invites Jim Brown and Kanye West into the White House he's ... he's racist he's a bacon doesn't like black people so it doesn't matter\n\nI look at this a reaction to what kind of you with that and I'm going to talk to you about what they said on CNN about him with Don limited calling him a token negro when the commentators called him a token negro another one said this is what happened when negroes don't read now\nCalling a black person in negro in the year twenty Eighteen is a slur and I guess he's black commentators believe they can get away with it because a lot of white people don't realize calling a black person the negro and twenty Eighteen is uh is is offensive\nIt's something that you say when you want to put somebody down because that's what they're doing the getting away with a snake a tree left wing bigotry\nAnd Kanye West says he grew up without a father and told a President Trump today in the oval office how much that bothered him\nAnd it is far and away the number one problem in this country the number one problem in the black community the large number of kids growing up without fathers far and away\nNothing else it even close all the other stuff people talk about all of a sort of nonsense far and away and you have somebody calling us you can call them uneducated you can call him a not terribly literate calling what you want at least he gets the big picture\nHe also understands\nThat there's a connection between the welfare state and the demise of the family my friend Walter Williams and Thomas all have written about the black family after slavery\nA black kid was more likely during slavery to be raised under a roof with biological mother and biological father than today and after slavery because for years it was illegal for slaves to marry\nThere was a huge uptick in Mary\nAnd if you look at census reports Eighteen Ninety Nineteen hundred Nineteen ten a black child was slightly more likely\nTo be brought into the world where they biological mother and a biological dad under the same roof than a white kid more likely and then along comes the welfare state and dependency\nAnd the LA Times ... poor people to non poor people questions about welfare and about dependency they ask the question to Nineteen eighty five they asked him again or in twenty six team\nDo you believe welfare creates dependency or do you believe it is a stepping stone to get you on your own two feet\nAnd they asked for people in non poor people those questions forty one percent of people living below the level of poverty responded welfare creates dependency and forty one percent felt that he gave you a stepping stone or to get on your own two feet so as many poor people felt that welfare which harmful\nAs felt that it was helpful\nSo don't you think maybe just maybe that's worth looking at that's a topic worthy of discussion as many poor people think that welfare is bad or ethnic it's good and about eight percent or so have no idea that don't have an opinion one way or the other\nThat is a boatload of people on welfare who believe that it's created dependency and that's what Kanye West was talking about you don't think it's worth having the conversation of course you don't know if you're on the left\nBecause you look into the mirror and say oh my goodness what have I done to be stabilized families it changed values to change incentives my dad used to tell me people are motivated by two things promise of gain and fear of loss you
