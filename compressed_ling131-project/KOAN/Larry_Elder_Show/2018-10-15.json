complete bogus thing\nYou didn't have his hands up didn't say don't shoot but a President Obama opted to talk about America flaws and suggested they Fergus him with a microcosm of it\nObama's attorney general Eric Holder said when it comes to matters of race America has been a nation of cowards close quote\nAnd he said that there were a America right now or is involved in pernicious racism gay three examples since the push for voting rights with the aid for for for photo voter id was an example a pernicious racism never mind the majority of blacks weren't\nPhoto voter id\nPutin said a as another example of pernicious racism the fact that black boys or expelled or suspended from school and a greater percentage than the other kids in that particular school\nHe a Jesse Jackson even sued an all white school board in Decatur, Illinois for kicking out a bunch of black kids that were fighting after football games he argued that the all white um school board\nWas racist er and that the policy that was applied to these black boys was racist\nDecatur defended himself by pointing out all around the country where the school board is all white or school board are considering a poor people of color close call back black boy just kicked out disproportionately compared to other boys at that given given school why because they're misbehaving\nThe third example that a Eric Holder gate as an example of pernicious racism or is the fact that a black\nCriminal defendant committed same crime is white criminal defendant gets a longer sentence and that is true what Eric Holder didn't tell you is that the u._s. than the commission or that came up with that with that that also said the reason is for is the fact that judges\nOr when it comes to sentencing will take into consideration the defendants arrest record and it turns out the typical black to send it has a longer arrest record than typical white defend it as a result that black defend it gets a longer sentence nothing to do with racism or the U.S sentencing commission says that\nThe judges are taking into consideration legitimate\nFactors that's all you got Eric Holder is all you got\nAnd if I had a son he'd look like
