for your religious rights eight six six four three five two to\nFive to a few things before I go to the phones were talking about\nActing white and how Obama was criticized for being a new leaders because he'd gone to Harvard and taught at University of Chicago spoke standard English got hammered Bobby Rush who still in the house who beat him badly in the house race\nMade a caricature out of it\nAll but said he's acting white years ago I wrote about a young lady living in Oakland black teenager who wanted to be a doctor into all of her peers you wanted to be a doctor because they thought of her as your leaders in snooty she was getting death threats\n\nI find it interesting that I'm watching MSNBC or CNN they're talking about how racist President Trump is because he had so few black people in positions of responsibility in his administration\nAnd then he meets with black people and what are they called mediocre negroes by Marc Lamont hill mediocre negroes or sellouts or in the case of ... of Kanye West he must have some sort of mental disorder\nSo you're a sellout yourself loading your coon you're a Sambo and why aren't there are more sellouts and coon skin samples in his administration\nIn this business about race and racism when\nObama was considering running for president according to either time or Newsweek I forget which one big long article about the big meeting had with all of his top people top advisors to consider running for president after all he just got elected to the Senate\nAnd the article said race never came up nobody even mentioned it\n\nBefore he became president Senator Obama spoke at a historically\nBlack college he talked about races and he said the Moses generation referring to the generation of Martin Luther king got us Ninety percent of the way they're my generation he referred to his generation after the Joshua generation my\nGeneration has to get into the additional ten percent\nI think about that Senator Obama\nSaid we're Ninety percent of the way they're fast forward President Obama racism is in our DNA President Obama hires in AG who said that America suffers from quote pernicious racism President Obama has one of the biggest race Hassan wasn't America Al Sharpton visiting the White House over Seventy times\nBecause President Obama realized that in order to stay in office and keep that Ninety five percent model of the black vote blacks need to be angry\nSo a guy that went from telling Steve Croft when he was running for office in two thousand eight Steve ... said to him the prophet sixty minutes at him Senator Obama if you don't get the nomination will it be because of racism\nAnd Senator Obama said no\nIf I don't get the nomination it will be because I have failed to articulate a message that the American people can embrace nice it hallelujah I'm not going to vote for attacks been regulate left wing Democrat but at least this one is not a big red\nFast forward it comes to office the Cambridge police acted stupidly if I had a son he'd look like Trayvon invite people from the black lives matter movement in he invoked Ferguson which was a lie at the United nations address which isn't moans and winds about racism\nHas an attorney general who talks about the move for voter id is an example of quote pernicious racism quote unquote nevermind blacks one voter id too I mean it's just amazing\n\nAnd if anybody anybody should understand the importance of getting a good education you ought to be Obama\nObama's mother sent him from Indonesia where he was living to live with his\nMaternal grandparents because she wanted him to get a good education\nSo Obama goes to the finest prep school in the state of all why then goes to a very selective private school called occidental here in LA finishes up at Columbia Ivy League school then go to Harvard for law school his girls\nThey went to school private school at a school that was operated by the University of Chicago and Obama had access to it because he taught there and then when he moved to DC [noise]\nThe girls and rolled into said well friends and same very expensive prep school they feel that the Chelsea Clinton went to [noise]\nNeither Obama
