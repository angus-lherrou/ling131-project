response to it the other quote in Nineteen eighty five ms magazine published a study by psychologist Mary cos that gave rise to the steps that one in four college females would be sexually assaulted during college\nThe study also found that forty two percent of putative rate than to uplift of went on to have intercourse again with their alleged assailants behavior inconceivable in the case of actual rate in fact\nIt was a researcher herself to classify the subjects as victims Seventy three percent of the women whom the researcher designated as rape survivors rape survivors said they hadn't been raped when asked directly into quote wow wow Heather\nWell that that that's the methodological sleight of hand that has stayed with every single\nA campus rape survey since the Nineteen eighty five\nMen survey or the believing in this alleged epidemic of campus rape Maine's ignoring females own characterization of their experience is something that allegedly to feminist tell us when she never ever do\nQuote in twenty Fifteen the association of American University a you conducted a sexual assault survey at twenty seventh selective colleges the vast majority of survey respondents who ate a you researchers classified as sexual assault victims never reported their alleged assault to their colleges rape hotlines\nSexual assault resort centers or title nine officers much less to the capital city police and the overwhelming reason that the alleged victim did not report is if they did not think what happened to them was that serious in the world\nWell you know we've been hearing to a Montrose from the radical feminists\nDuring this absolute hysteria melt down of identity politics insanity of the Brett Kavanaugh hearings one is always believe survivors meaning always convict males you should not subject a so called self described survivors\nAh claims to any kind of empirical testing number two\nThe reason that so called survivors do not report is because the patriarchy makes it so painful for them to do so they're they confront such horrible a skepticism from these title nine officers and what not\nKnow that is complete the as Larry the reason they don't report when you ask the people\nWho the rape researchers classify as rape victims why didn't she report the overwhelming reason as\nThey said because what happened to me wasn't serious enough to report now I maintain that in the case of actual rape which is the most terrifying experience any female can have short of\nA being murdered a you would never voluntarily have sex again with your rapists and be you would never claimed that that experience was not serious enough to report\nTo the McDonalds my guess is a fellow at the Manhattan Institute and contributing editor to the journal her new book is

for the stunt of carrying around a dorm mattress for a year or two like Jesus with his cross\nTo protest the fact that the guy that she belatedly identified as her rapist was not expelled by Columbia and the reason the Columbia did not expel her\nAlleged rapist was because ever talk with in the aftermath of of what she eight months later\nWould decide to report as rape sent this guy a series of
