minute hold on hold on to last me for saying okay All right so they've\nThey've lost\nOkay I Know this chick right here for all practical purposes is ruined the getting get half of what we should have

Alaskan is thirty three hundred dollars that anyone I'm elected I'm going to put in a bill and it's got to be a special dividend there is payable\nI call it the promise to give it to end because I Want to make up that thirty three hundred dollars I Want to put that in Alaskans pocket you know the impact of that will be ending the recession because the private specter the private sector will Ben have funds\nBuy things with they should have had that money before that's their earnings it's not the state government\nIt you're absolutely right you are you hearing near the argument outta me well I'll tell you what\nMy non levy and I came up with that position on the restitution all of the stolen money or to gather around ... dining room table\nIs Mike Dunn as Mike Dunn levy come out and as he said anything about this yet or not but luckily that he ... be restitution\nYeah oh yeah very much\nHe ... be restitution yeah\nYeah oh yeah very much so he he is the only guy that has come out as gubernatorial candidate and demanded an overdue payment or thirty three hundred dollars\nWell I had a I had bill walked around here yesterday I don't know if you're caught or not but what I mean I had bill Walker on yesterday and and I I was asking you to make the case you know tell me why\nYou know say hey here's this guy he's a he's a loader operator he's got a couple of kids why things\nGo up there and sit with the ... and explain to him why you took sperm infant division there you go and he told me he sat there and he told me to his story you know you say hey everything's in the toilet\n... everything's ... down and everything's down suppose ... whatever you know and the economy and jobs and blah blah blah\nAnd so he felt like he needed the money um in order to make things work and you know they they cut\nYou know till they couldn't cut it anymore and I I just don't think he made his case I I don't think he made he made made a case that somebody can follow if they know every rule in the book I don't know but they didn't the average person in the way\nTo look at that thing man they spend the money on priorities no they didn't spend the money at all they kept it me earning reserve or the or the Alaska permanent but they did not spend the money that means he didn't need the money\nYeah there you go it's it's I mean it's ... and that's what has a he's either going to I told him I said you've got to make your case yeah somebody's got to make your case you are because right now man it's uphill\nBattle when somebody when people swing a curtain behind them and and walk up to that little machine yup that's permanent fun things going to be on her mind and then hey this is the guy took my ... and I mean the Republicans are just as guilty ... forthright as murders and all this too but they're not getting tagged with\nThe legislature you know if your callers will call their legislators and ask them if they voted for the budget\nIf they say yes why did they then used that budget vote\nLimit and and take down your permanent fund given right\nRight and when there was an opportunity for the joint houses to come together and override what Governor Walker did there was no the Republicans weren't there\nThey didn't do they didn't do it they took a powder on the fight they did that tells you a who's who is the permanent fund offenders and who are not\nThey they absolutely did and and they're just as guilty of it and I know you know the unfortunate thing we haven't been able to do is blame our own\nWhen we need to and and and we have to be able to do that I I I'm Glad to hear that from your gym 'cause\n... you know when when Republicans screw up and when they don't act and when they're co conspirators to bad things\nWe need to point him out on because in in and hold them accountable because drug or you know same thing back in Washington DC when Trump came in here he's trying to do everything and who who the heck is blocking who's trying to stopping heck it was the Democrats who it was Republicans yes the biggest problem with uh you got to figure\nOut where the knocks on your head or coming from and and correct that you know\nThe legislature had the opportunity to stop Governor Walker dead in his tracks on stealing the perimeter and fun and they took a powder on that fight that's wrong they did I I think the people who get elected this year have to have very clear instruction\nFrom those who are their employers that people are there state\nYou know we established a trust fund called the Alaska permanent fun it's the people's money and you earnings of the pond or the people's earnings it is not for I mean you know the legislature passed a budget five hundred million dollars more this year than last\nYear we've forward funded the education may have a good day problems now are\nThey ... they can raise the but I Know we're just going over same stuff but they were they raise the budget in ten years they doubled the budget in ten years but but then they but do the last three years they haven't really cut anything that's right I mean\nThere's this fallacy of the ... you know\nA governor or no\nUh uh made an additional contribution to the uh to the pension funds to take down in the early obligation by a couple of hundred million dollars right and and so that ruined the budget for that particular year\nI think it was a billion four billion fire or something like that and they stay saying well no they brought the budget down for a billion for no they didn't\nYou just didn't do you have to make up on ... again\nYou know\nIt's all such a just a [laughter] a shell man it ain't no different than that dude it's no more different than that do sitting on the street corner would that box\nInnings and he's getting three car drowned man it is I Know that simple as elementary it's [laughter] it's whatever or it's an educated but\nI'm Serious it's no different there there's moving them cards around and hopefully it will release them\nYou can't believe the the budget stuff that they they sham that they go on is the you know they pass a budget that Ninety percent of the money that they actually want and then they come back to the following year and they do a supplemental budget and the supplemental then spends more than than you did and you didn't get tagged for politically\nRight cause they do it when they come when they first come back and people are watching them then you you're right I forgot about that I learned that when I was a staffer down there now they come back at the beginning a session slide it through flat it all in there and that's right\nYeah well you got to read the actual state but you know I read the financial state and all three hundred and forty three pages of the uh uh a comprehensive annual financially Jaffer of the state of Alaska capper that's right that's the one that tells you yeah the reality\nOf it and if you read that in the summer I I I I think it's on page to page three or ... the summary says that we added three point nine billion dollar increase in our network\nFrom actual fungi C I F R I\nSaid I only got a minute left but but I my first year down there I was at the right at the beginning of of the legislative session in January they were like they were going to be doing this budget is called you know ...\nAnd I was what it and I asked somebody what are they doing ... ... is it that way he says this is what we do egos visitors at the at the beginning we put everything back in the budget that we said we cut last year or something you know we're doing exactly [laughter] asking October for\nFive to seven six thousand she street I've got to meet and greet and if anybody wants to write a check at that level of an\nTo Nelson Nelson claims bean has not fulfilled is obligations bean is running for ... ... no doubts in is married\nTo a lottery Nelson\nWho is running for these [laughter] see I just had to bring that to you I guess\n... that's like gravy I'll do it is and people are just a [laughter] uh well it's a small town it's top so what do you expect things like this are going to happen\nAnd uh\nWe'll we'll see a a ... that's a story to I Want to know the somehow I don't want to spend the time to figure out the ending but it would be it would be interesting to know how that would be interesting to know\nA small town fights\nUh let's see a star the rangers in in the news today\nAlso uh\nLet's see uh you know this beetle damage has been a problem and they won't do anything about it I'm waiting for the day I'm waiting for the day the hillsides going to take up it's going to catch on fire and that baby's gonna\nBurn burn burn\nBecause they're they're doing little to no I'm extraction of oldfield meaning would beetle damage or carrying out that old would clear cutting of creating space between\nThese um houses and and and the woods and this stuff is dry and it's just it's got to be the wrong day is going to be the wrong month the wrong day something's gonna catch fire up there and and that hill that hillside\nIs gonna is gonna burn baby burned\nBecause no because the environmentalist half as have delayed installed our ability to go in there and in deep clutter de fuel they referred to old lumber spruce beat him all that it's old lumber they call it feel\n... and in in in that hillside as it gets larger and larger and more homes more homes there was a lot of woods in there and that stuff needs to be clear cut it needs to be it it it needs to be cleaned\nOut and the environmentalist have have have blocked that block that and I'm not saying is that some things haven't been done but there hasn't been enough done and and you know everything's okay until something happens\nEverything's going to be just fine everything's gonna be peachy until that until that plays takes up a fire one day and then it's going to be hard to put out because it's just an awkward place to get to it's awkward to get in there it's awkward to to to fight a fire depending on where it's at\nAnd and and you\nKnow and and when and when it's all over and and and half the dang hillsides burn down um or or or millions of dollars in property or lost somebody's going to say well we've been trying for Thirty years trying to get this uh thing cleaned up and nobody will allow us to\nYou couldn't get the courts to agreed Everytime we tried we've uh the city has tried to do some things that ... there's always some somebody trying to block them to do it\nAnd and it it's just so much\nValue in property and homes and and that that are up there that um it's a shame that there there are not precautions being taken in order to to ensure that these houses and these properties are safe\nIt makes no sense it just it's just dead wood it's dead wood\nIn a forest that needs to be extracted and it's just ... and nobody is willing to do anything enters into trees that are standing up that are dead they're just they're just did the ...\nThe property taxes the things people pay up there in the hills got to cover something right [noise]\nWell it ain't it it is not covering cleaning up that that that that\nOld would because that stuff is just up there and it's going to and you know the drier and dryer and gets we've\nBeen noticed we have less snow fall lately we've been having less snow fall you know and and uh I mean just look at right now here it is what middle of October ... was the beginning of October yeah and and there's no snow\nUm when this this past year though we we really didn't have\nHuge fires like having no no we lucked out of the fire season 'cause and we're we've been lucky for a while the last year you know they had a few big ones you know that one really close to the town yeah it was up there uh yeah\nBut I mean that was really close to ... that could have got that all that it could have\nOne one shift one and wind shift things like that I remember that\nYeah I mean and it'll play smell like smoke all last year of the I mean it was right there McHugh creek it was burning so\nCute great when you start if it starts hadn't what do you call that South I guess no ghetto the lord north yeah or if if they had a fire started heading north you know there's nothing stopping it\nAnd and those homes with the with the five\nStopping it and and those\nHomes with the with the five ... up their numbers that nobody wants to lock Britain yeah nobody wants to deal with it\nThey've been hired just shove it under the ... the the the the furniture hide that under the couch we'll talk about that later what we'll do something about that some time\nBut um\nUnfortunately it's going to happen\nAnd it's always easy to sit here and say well you know this was going to happen there's going to happen but the question is why we don't do anything about it\nIt's been really dry this is October second we're still pretty it's been pretty pretty dry yes you know we met a lot of rain so far and barely any term termination dust and if it that's all it takes a fire could happen right now that\nIt's all it takes is is really it's just the right conditions\nThe bad day bad timing whatever and and off we go and now we've got I I'm Glad you remind me about that hillside\nUh ...\nThat was a that McHugh creek 'cause that did that got close up that got close enough where you're thinking hey if you think he's traveling north\nYou know we're we're in a potter's marsh we're in all the the I mean those are million dollar homes up above the
