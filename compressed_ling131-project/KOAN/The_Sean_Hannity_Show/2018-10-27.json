choose from the second question that we're asking you what attracts you most to resorts and married a our youngest son told me actually yesterday but he thinks pools should be on the list which is not\nUm oh I Would agree with him juice for their spot that's there but I don't know so those are a big part of it will help us write in votes or something yeah so I don't either anyway go vote folks are immoral\nRegistering global hospitality is a company that certainly carved a niche in service departments and extended stay offerings across there seven brass we asked their CEOs Sean worker what a service department can offer travelers today and what makes it more attractive in a hotel room or even an air being the rental and here's what he shares\nIn a big impact in the experiential market today is being locally authentic\nGoing home with stories selfies and telling your friend they found something unique that maybe they'd like to experience that others don't\nSo living versus staying as two very different experiences living and staring out at\nSt Paul's cathedral or you know the the ... the arc de Triomphe from your own home and then going downstairs and meeting somebody and you're having a cafe or history or a beer you meet people instantaneously because it's all about experiences you don't necessarily find\nThat if you're staying and you know as a business traveler leisure travelers you're saying that in the typical hotels so it's all about the experience and go home with stories\nAnd give us an idea and we don't you know we have is the price and compare how does that different\nIt's comparable to think of it this way and we'll just pick a mark a luxury hotel room a couple of hundred dollars a night it's probably going to be comfortable with a couple of hundred dollars a night but you're getting twice the space and you're going to be at home\nAnd as you said you're going to get that experience from ... to get\nThat little clip that area and you're going to feel fairly comfortable I mean you are both over travelers right right and you want to unpack you don't want to have your door housekeeping staff banging on your door at ... am on a Saturday\nMorning a show about right you\nKnow this is about you're at home so we'll we'll when people are out and about to make sure that your service department are your whole 'cause we're sharing economy product as well to clean when ... when it's practical we want you to enjoy it feel relaxed and not worry that somebody's going to bang on the door and\nPossibly opening well let's go don't you have less so I was certainly a large part of the market and we just talked about you know there are business travelers out there give us an idea of some of the amenities that you think are most pressing for the business traveler today and then you know are you providing them\nBusiness travelers are stressed that the way we think of a hotel and how we think about our platform is unpacking hotel experience\nOn our platform we partner with the way we partner with growth hub we partner with when you work we partner with a variety of services including you know the big bus tours and city unscripted show in advance of you even getting there you can order yourself the food you want when you wanted to be a\nGarden fresh or the best tie from around the corner that hey You're welcome to your experience first are stuck your fridge\nSeparately that's great for consultants that's great for somebody on assignment but equally great for a week stay a major city globally so that's fundamentally different equally fascinating space you can get it from we work if you got after a long week and you found five hours or four hours and you want to go around and essentially\nLearned the city on the big red both or whatever you can book that in advance and if you want to great walking tour around the historic area in any city you can think of\nThe Jack the ripper tour in London comes to mind\nTo work with\nCity unscripted and you can get that from a traditional hospitality website because they're not catering to you know generally they're catering to the you know the kinds of the massive that is perfect they go to needed\nShowing share with us the service departments an extended stay locations registry global hospitality offers\nThey do enabled travelers individualized combinations to replicate your home but Steve wise the CEOs Mary on vacations worldwide and leading global vacation ownership company that offers a diverse portfolio across more than sixty five resorts well he had a different perspective on what travelers are seeking when they travel with their families for more than a week\nAnd we started off asking him initially his thoughts on the importance of vacation here's ...\nWell I think touched on it I mean part of it is you know in the twenty four seven or other frenetic life that we live today\nI think people kind of lose sight of some of the important things like maintaining those close personal contact with their friends and family and everything else and\nVacationing actually lets people or why now having said that I'm as guilty as many where you know even when I'm On vacation I still got my cell phone and all and I stay connected but I think it's\nBy forcing people to actually get away from their job get out of their day to day home environment I think it's really healthy for kind of rejuvenating people and letting him get back to work with a whole different sense of purpose in a sense of\nKind of feeling about themselves\nWe and we couldn't agree more although it is a challenge but maryann vacations worldwide traces its roots back to Nineteen eighty four Steven today you have over sixty five locations around the globe I'd love to know the average length of stay but I'd also like you to talk about how the vacation at one of your properties\nWould compare to vacation someone may try and coordinate on their own or threat travel agents\nAre average like say I can't give it to a precise number but it's going to be over six days um we originally started selling a week's based products that you bought seven consecutive days back in two thousand and ten we shifted to it points based product with a lot of people to take a more frequent but a shorter days but it's still going to be\nArticle there are a lot of people to take a more frequent but a shorter days\nBut it's still going to be close to six days in terms of the average day one of the basic differences between staying at a time share resort like ours versus staying at our traditional hotel room is you've got a lot more square footage typically see one of our unit is a couple of bedrooms are living room dining room and kitchen\nIn a highly another guy's resort versus a standard hotel room the size of the footprint of the product thing and is over twice that of a hotel room\nAnd by virtue of having a kitchen and everything else for people that want to cook a meal or to along the way during their vacation they certainly have the ability to do so and one of the things that we hear consistently from our customers is\nThe added space coupled with the uh the variety of the matter is is available at the resources are really enhances the quality of their vacation experience\nWell I Know we know Robert we certainly like that and Steve did make some good\nPoints about what time share or resort ownership properties offer traveling to do that dairy goat feeding the the amount of wind up the world's largest hotel business in terms of number of properties is more focused on ensuring travelers understand the specifics of what their various brands provide when you need a room at night somewhere or are more interested in hotels\nRather than a type of combinations that shot or Steve offer\nWe asked Barry what he and his team are doing to differentiate their brands and provide identifiable experiences\nYeah it's a great question and and there is lots of friends out there for gas and consumers to choose from but as we think about our brands they all do fit and somewhat of a nice\nValue or economy as we see it it scale extended stay and each one of those has an identity in terms of what represent a guest and draws them to one of the brand\nFor example super eight which we've just done renovations to over Ninety five percent of our brand system what we see them as as an American road rage you know\nSomeone who's really attracted to a product that's on the road where they view that product into that they resonate to\nHow it fits to them as as a road warrior versus days and which is really something about happy and being sunshine and track someone in a way that feels very different which also then you know when we look at\nThe upper scale of our segment there's a very different products for someone who may be going on a destination or resort visit so each one has somewhat of a identity that really is resonating with the gas and as they get that experience they feel very different when they say they're\nVery I had a question on the ground with a for wind up in the portfolio of France where do you see the area for the largest let's see if you could kinda forecasts that over the next couple of years\nSo today we have about forty percent in economy and there's always opportunity to continue to grow in that state but with the acquisition of teens are we really are very targeted in the mid scale the upper mid scale market and we see that as a real opportunity for us to get even further footprint and move more up stream from where we are in a county\nHave the other brands like out there and lifestyle a trip by a little bit I mean there are some others so when they're really does have so many brands area has all the hotel operator so we already have a producers Melissa Valerie working on segments for twenty Nineteen and we're going to look to cover this would help you try to understand what all these hotel rooms provide out there\nWe are and but as far as what we just heard from Sean Steven Barry there's certainly a lot of options for travelers to stay and I think it's you know it's pretty clear we can expect even more options and the last ... years ahead\nRaising my family talks right now I'm going to fall spring break Rudy up next after the bottom of the responses

right but you have a great job I'm guessing you either have a ton of friends who get the candy with you or maybe no friends as they're all envious\nNice to connect with your Chris welcome to our and world traveling her personal connection episode today\nHappy to be here thank you\nWell thank you very much and I'm going to start off by saying to marry and I we created this program almost Fifteen Years ago back in two thousand four and from our original host to Rudy joining us in two thousand nine to marry me I'm pretty confident when I say that you're a first for us as I Can't recall any past guest ever receiving such an honor from the dome Lama\nNot to mention the two sports you've meddled in during your various Paralympic as Mary mentioned during your intro so helpless set the scene for everyone listening around the country today you are promising ski athlete at Middlebury College at one time but share what happened in that sense you on the course that you're on today\nSo I was actually it was my first day of the nation I was home and getting ready for the ski season we're big races coming up in two weeks I went to the mountain I skated a mountain called perjury in Charlotte Massachusetts growing up and\nMy brother and I went to the mountain met up with a few of the buddies guys that we had grown up skiing with and we were going to train their 'cause that's what you do you go home to your own mountain and train over the Christmas break and so we went to do that and just a freak accident in the middle of warming up popped up in the middle of a turn I fell in the middle of trail\nDidn't get anything above the ground and broke two vertebrae and and obviously in some ways I Am recreating this story based on the knowledge that I have is nobody thought this is this is one of his assuming happen and I broke two vertebrae and paralyzed myself from the waist down as a result of that\nProbably relatively innocuous kind of which is sometimes when the worst one up and I go\nTo Chris from what I understand you are you returned pretty quickly to school I think it was two months and he's starting to train and it took ... about a year later\nI did go to school for me was returning to lie to live the life that I saw in the hospital with a life in a lot of ways scares me it was a life that was really it was really easy for me to envision the limitation whereas the social part of school\nMy wife didn't change that much because my my relationship with my friends didn't change so I went back to school I bought I fought as hard as I could get out at the hospital as quickly as I could to go to to return for the spring semester so that was two months after the accident and you know to say that I was prepared for that\nIs it's a complete overstatement that was I was down fifty pounds I was super super weak I could barely do anything but\nI learned in very short period of time what would have taken me a lot longer had I had I not have as much as we\nBetter or where to where you are today since our time is short and I think for so many people achieving your level of success after an accident might be enough but it didn't seem to be for you since you got back in the game so quickly as you mentioned um you travel a lot\nDidn't seem to be for you since you got back in the game so quickly as you mentioned um you travel a lot since you're a noted guest speaker on the topic of inspiration you're currently the chief information officer for the well known researcher at St Regis ... valley in Utah\nWhich is in the Park City area I Want to know about your experience there how do you interact with people traveler specifically what does it mean to you\nYou know one of the biggest things is thick skin for me as much as my greatest dog and pony show I have people say oh well he was given this will be great and then we take our first time they go oh you're actually really good and and the yes I've done it I've done it a lot\nAnd and skiing is an amazing sport in it's\nWhat we end up sharing together where I watch you if you're going up you watch me is I'm a ... or as I'm going to lift I watch you if you're going up with the watch me and we're trying to achieve the same thing but it it's the nature of\nLife and so many in so many ways I think it's such a great life lesson in that we and\nWe end up trying to perfect something in part of perfecting it is in doing it over and over again and sometimes\nPeople can have a great creative solution to whatever they're trying to do and a lot of the answer to getting better is\nMiley well let's talk about over and over again I I Want to expand within your cars and they listen to your right now you know I'm sure most people you encountered there quickly inspired by your story but I\nAm curious to know if you ever worked with a Traveller where travelers or people on the slopes at your job is who\nYou know there are skeptical or they're down on themselves and after a while you sort of help them turn around their motivation because as you know probably better than most of us out there a lot of it has to do with getting out of your head sometimes so are you able to reach them and connect with them help them\nI really am and I think that part of it is it it ... to learn something new if we get a new door opened it's super exciting for us and then went looking for what the next thing but it but as you said it's so easy to be stuck in the rock that\nWe're in and the beauty for me is that I've done this for a long time I ski race for Thirty years and there's a whole lot of video and break them down into into it and then you show\nAnd you see things in a different way than most people do and and what's fun to work with clients is that it through working with skiing you can open somebody's eyes to through an entirely new possibility that it can be one very very simple thing only makes it all makes sense which\nThat's that's where I think it is such a great idea for so many ways for what we're doing\nAs people in general and how our our lives work\nThat well we're an hour from a different perspective we want to turn this conversation a little bit right now because you are a very humble person we can hear that but you know Mary I think you would agree we have to turn this morning when I mean\nYou can really hear your passion for skiing in your first love obviously and also for what you're doing with people but I don't think this interview with the complete if we didn't have you give everyone a quick summary of what we think we might have been your biggest achievements ... traveling to an conquering mount Kilimanjaro in Africa\nYes and I I think conquering might well be a a a bit of a bit of an overstatement than it is still there right hand and will continue to be there much longer\nTo see the video of you do I mean I have to tell you right now I I I couldn't do it myself and I like to think I'm a pretty good shape I mean what you did was amazing it really was\nIt was it was a you know and I think that part of that the motivation for climbing Kilimanjaro and a lot of ways but but it was a it would be objective was much bigger than being myself as\nAs somebody with a disability I broke my back almost Thirty years ago now and ended up in a wheelchair you become an advocate for a group that you never joined\nBut there are hundreds of millions of people in the world with physical disabilities and a lot of ways it's an invisible part of the population because from the time were little were taught not to stare at someone who looks different\nAnd I wanted to give people an opportunity is there so I felt like and climbing the mountain I really wrote a power of hundreds of millions of people whose lives I was hoping to to effect and uh and it was it was amazing it was difficult\nBut also I think they getting there were probably more difficult than than actually climbing the mountain\nWell you're talking about some of your travels because I've seen some video of you even how you get on and how you're born an airplane having to ... because your legs and such you know Christmas for pretty much from the stand your legs do not move\nAnd you're having to hold on to arm rest and sleep your way through the plane but even when you got to Kilimanjaro and climbing that really impressive and again Chris I the story is very inspirational with us we're going to run in a time and a little bit and I apologize for that but\nI just really want to let people know you've also created a foundation that they can go to and check
