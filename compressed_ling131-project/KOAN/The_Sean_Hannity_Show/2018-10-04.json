Kevin I really just continues to hinge on those three critical\nRepublican senators senators Jeff Flake Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins and yesterday Senator Flake said that if this FBI investigation does indeed find that somehow some way judge Kavanaugh lied he says that that would be\nDisqualified Sandra All right Chris in some way could this all come back to Capitol Hill\nOr hearing that there's FBI investigation could returned to Capitol Hill as early as today it would be a very fast timeline but we're hearing that it could happen you know these FBI agents have been working around the clock to try to meet this deadline but Democrats on Capitol Hill keep continuing to try to expand the scope of the investigation\nYeah yeah yeah let's break into regular there know that that's what the Democrats dry and they they just want to delay it and and stretches out we were saying earlier they want to interview more people women interview people yet we need to interview miss for an interview a Brett Kavanaugh\n\nWhy would they need to interview the ladies written a letter she testified before the United states it was in public and private\nCabinet has been in private in ... he says but I mean well more are you going to want okay so then what happens is you give them the investigation so they got the investigation it's a big nothing burger right nothing nothing changed like again like we we all expect right we all knew it\nSo now they want they interview enough people oh so what do you think\nOkay let's go out and you know let's play games for a while let's go out in the interview Kevin all again and we'll interview ms forward again and come back and we still got enough and bird and then what\nWill it be when will not be enough you see the never will be\nIf you don't want men on the Supreme Court you don't want the man on the Supreme Court you're going to do everything\nPossible you can keep him off the Supreme Court doesn't matter all these Democrats said we're going to vote for him before he was even nominated\n\nIt's just it's just what what they do their obstruction is you know dropping obstructing obstructing\nThat's what it's called\n... they have no idea is no plans\nNothing to bank on just no getting away resist obstruct resist given way obstruct it's all about\nAnd try to come up with some stories that maybe some people will go well I didn't think about that yeah maybe we should look into that you know it's nothing burger he will be the Kevin Kavanaugh will be the next United States Supreme Court justice [noise]\n\nMurkowski has been dragging this along because she has those two constituency base who were opposed the cabin off so she keeps giving the impression as if she is potentially opposed\nAnd then\nFlake comes in and says hey I Want investigation the left says the Democrats we want further investigation so they go along with it right Lisa holds out flake cold\nThe ... so they go along with it right Lisa holds out flake holds out columns holds out so they got to have the investigation\nSo McConnell goes through goes forward that Grassley goes forward with the investigation\nNow what's happening is is that through time\nThrough the media reports through the observations of many people they find out hey this whole thing is is pretty weak\nAnd they please everybody by having all invest the the further investigation\nSo she done everything she can do\nHold out wait act like she's not you know play the whole game jerky along make you think this make you think\nThat in the end she votes for Kavanaugh any in she holds party line in the end they can threaten her with committee assignments\nShe wants to be the chairs of the a natural resources committee or she wants to be she wants to be important she wants to be part of leadership she wants to be able to say that bring it back home she ... she wants to be able to say in four years that you know this is what she can do for Alaska and\nAn offset what she did on the Supreme Court vote so there you go that's my Kevin ... ah that's my Lisa Murkowski Cabot I'll deal a written a\n\n[noise] it's a ...

to cut the budget because if we do it will have such a harmful effect\nSo to me as a lay person\nIs a guy gotta G D that there are logical doesn't make any sense to me if you spend spend spend spend\nWhen when the barrel of oil is that a hundred and thirty five hundred and forty five dollars a barrel of oil and you just do everything you want to do\n\nIt in how is it that when we run out of ... when when the barrel of oil goes to fifty bucks we we were unable to cut but a better question was is why didn't\nWe get ourselves there to begin with you know like like ... why does sixty people allow themselves to be put in a position where they know oil prices fluctuate go up and down I don't think anybody flop that oil prices are going to stay in a hundred and\nForty five dollars a barrel I mean we were wishing we're hoping\nLynn says yup\nFinance is a lot of work Linwood no\nUm she says oh there are ways\nIf you take the program from a constituency they won't vote for you that that that's a big problem\nNo lens right\nSee because every dollar they spent in the state of Alaska and I'll gladly lend remind me of this because every dollar that spent in the state of last year I\nGuess what it's attached to somebody somebody out there some place [noise] receives a benefit somehow from the state of Alaska or you could say\nWhatever program youth are thinking about reducing\nThere is a constituency tied to that there is you\nYou may not even think about like what the heck's part of that program will try cutting it and you'll find people start all of a sudden your phone started ringing in my right leg\nAnd and they'll start complaining because guess what the word gets out hey they're gonna cut baseball field maintenance whatever money\nAnd and the phone starts ringing and legislators started getting nervous and then they got constituents call them and in general if you get ten or more people that call on one subject that's considered a quite a bit\nSo so that starts to bother them so it's very difficult to cut the budget because even though people in general want the budget reduce they don't want their budget reduce UC let's say okay I'm a vet right so there was a vet program\nSo I don't want the vet program cut because I think it's pretty darn important but then somebody else comes along and says well we got the vet program but don't cut mind and\nWe and this is the cyclical\nProblem that we go through because no one I shouldn't say no one but most people most Alaskans most human beings are unwilling\nTo mow the grass but they're willing to get tell somebody to go over there and mow the other person's grass in other words and we're not willing to take a cut because we think our program is is important\nAnd justifiable\nBut there was a campaign in the nineties that Dale increase chamber of Congress putting on and it was all about hey listen we all have to understand if we're going to reduce this budget if we're going to try to keep spinning in constrained then we all have to accept the fact that that we can't just spend for everyone\n\nAnd and and and we all have to kind of give give and take on that or or it just doesn't work or are in other words we get\nWhat we asked for\nSee that's really it we're getting what we asked for\nBecause\nPoliticians in Juneau they they get up in the morning in the first thing they do they look outside and they find out which way is the political wind soft blown today that's what they do because their job is to stay elected\nStay in office spending\nMoney is what helps him stay in office cutting budgets does not help them stay in office because guess what it's cutting budgets help them stay in office\nMay they they they'd be all over that [laughter]\nThey would be all over that\nBut they're not going to\n... yeah lens got it yeah you cut the vet program and guess what now you have vets you you you you you cut an older person program and now you hate old people you know you cut a handicapped person program and now you have the hand cats\nYou cut the young for ... girls program or something like ... girls and and he goes on and on lens absolute right she's been there\nBut we can't run we we as we as citizens can't act like this we have to give them the power to say hey listen I Know I might need to take care of that but it's worth it will be right back\nTo keep this\n... and it's not even trying to reduce the sum is just bringing it to a worry you can sustain it a sustainable budget\nThat doesn't mean cutting off money to crippled children to go to school if it doesn't mean about hurting\nOld people like like Lynch got us or I was a law if I talked about it on there and I but you know she was going to cut I think it was back when we were going to reduce a public radio public TV you know the state funds that it gives it a grant and all this\nAnd so people were saying Well Lynn gas is gonna kill big bird Lynn ... going to kill big bird she\nLinn yes have big bird like come on\nPeople but that was what they did you know that's what went on\nSo it becomes this so reducing the budget becomes now this big this big joke in a way this big you know thinking about killing big bird\nAnd so what nothing gets done\nAnd and it and it just did it it just the ... the problem continues and continues and and just and and then we complain\nBecause we don't have it didn't really get it did in well you could argue that the budget wasn't\nWe should have got to David in anyways I Would make that argument I think there's there's truth to that argument any or David Boyle come up here at one o'clock\nHearing about Fifteen minutes will will help us verify that he's a very knowledgeable with the budget and all and ... maybe ... but but we'll talk to him about it but\nThat's the kind of consensus we've got a country that I mean we're just going to keep playing this game up and down up\nAnd down and and and again nothing really works\nThere is a lot of ways Kimberly says there's a lot of waste and there is but but the problem is is that like Lincoln Center for every dollar that you think is waste someone else thinks it's valuable now there are things like travel\nOr a a you know being in that some of the travel dollars that are done you can cut money there but to really get into big money you know that that means something that that it really a\nTalking like you know twenty million dollars ten million dollars losers\nThough those are a little harder decisions but there are a low lying fruit or and one of the things is\nIf we just started now not to increase the budget you don't even have to cut it all you gotta do is not increase\nIt if he didn't if you did that\n... that\nWay no one can say well they cut the budget of course they would probably see something like by not increasing you cut it I remember them tricks to\nBut if you just ... ... if you just held the line if we get if we can double the budget over ten years can we hold the line for ten years is that reasonable five six Nineteen eighty five six nine one zero eight zero\n\nBecause there's got to be an answer somewhere [noise] unless because if if you and I and I and\nI've been following this permanent fundamental thing for a long time if you and I are not going to be responsible enough to say listen we have to have a sustainable budget we're all willing to take the hit\nWe want to legislate tours to act reasonably brutally let's get our priorities in line Let's let's let's course everybody's got different priorities to see that's the problem\n\nBut we have got to make a decision because if we're not adult ... there's ... there's got to be an adult in the room\nBecause we do\nOur great grandkids are grandkids are going to grow up and say to us I thought there was a permanent funded and thing that we used to have I thought the ... the state had like sixty Seventy billion dollars in this fun what what happened and all that great grandpa\nOh well you know we just all wanted everything and so we just spinning that's what happened to it that's about all of a thing you can be all ...\nRight ah we're going to take break we'll be back with more David Boyle from Alaska policy foreign coming up at one o'clock or Elizabeth Williams who is going to recall\nThis a judge Corey she'll be up later in the afternoon we'll be

take the Devon in\nPicking a few different times take half of it this time take all at one time take part you know what's the future is that really the answer and so I'm about to\nBring on my buddy David boils the Alaska policy forum I there are a great data company they may a nonprofit the they do humans work in a trying to look at data throughout the school district in the state of Alaskan budget and analyzing different things and bringing this to\nWere where we can kinda understand it and put it in perspective welcome to the show a David\nHey good afternoon how are you are learning I'm Sorry that morning\nYeah well now they're doing it still after it's afternoon it's one of one o'clock in the afternoon so you're right you're okay uh we're doing well ah today's PF de da and were Thirteen hundred dollar short\nAnd so um I I guess at one of the kicking around a little bit to see what you thought about whether or not\nGovernors came on my program last week a few days ago and said that I said why why did you take dip it in because I had to\nSend the budget was this ... you know blah blah blah and gave the story that he made his case that it was so bad that's the only way to resolve it and of course I disagree with that but but anyways I Want to hear from you\nWell well yeah uh that you know I listen to the governor in a private meeting back in a I Believe was October of twenty for the money was candidate a bill Walker right in\nOne of the things he testified to was the I don't know if you were there or not but one of the things he testified to was that he would never take the ... the EU would maintain that oh if the for\nEverybody he set it on my show here when I interviewed him because he come on a lot and I invite him on a lot and I was impressed with him and I voted for him because of what he said and he gave you know he gave me no indication that he was going to uh if anything he's either going to cut the budget going to reduce spending gonna you know ... yeah\nThat's exactly what I heard from him but you know um it's unfortunate politicians are like that and we kind of vote on vote on hopefully ... believing in what actually tell us yeah and they\nWere kind of global and we want we want to believe people and that's our human nature sure but you know when people don't um tell us the truth let's say um then they're probably going to own the results of that faucet but\nVia the telephone is David Boyle he's a representative of the Alaska policy forearm and uh they they do a lot of different things are keeping track of uh the data in school district ... keep track of the state budget where it's gone [noise] um\nSo welcome back a\nDavid you there yeah I'm here okay\nI just heard some background noise or something anyway I was confused okay so are\nWe didn't have your opinion is is we didn't have to cut the budget one of your pieces of evidence is that they\nTook the permanent fun money and put it in um I forget what that would that count was called\nEarnings reserves that's right they're earnings reserve account\nAnd and and and your theory our theory I agree with\nYou use that they were going to use this money for the pipeline and they needed to cash shores and that was the that was a cash shortage that they use and so that's what they did\nUm why what do you think's going to happen in the future will I mean ... ... where are we going here well I Know\nI you know you don't have your you know your prediction hat on but\nWe want and I'm not very good at predicting but you know especially when it comes to budget I thought it was better than than a lot of people in general but anyway uh by the way the Army Reserve el Balad as a last month is just about Eighteen billion ... billion dollars so\nIt's grown tremendously and the return on that um there was a that passion there is actually very high so that's why they like the ... reserve account a load of lots of your permanent phone dividend money\nUm I don't know we're going we need that we need to let me just give you a bigger share of for example we've got an article on our Web page um title Alaska is ... that was that we really cut enough\nUm that was back in January of this year and it was put out a an article in to some data and research that was done by the policy data organization which is a nonprofit organization\nWe just have a lot a lot of state employee you know a lot of lot of overhead people sitting around pushing paper in ... in for example according to the policy data\nAlaska has fifty six percent more state and government workers per capita than the average in the U.S\nAnd while fifty six percent more per capita than any other state in the nation\nYep than the u._s. right in the U.S average okay\nThere was only one other state it was higher than us and don't ask me what it was it might have been Wyoming it's a matter of fact but\nUm and the ... the other thing about that is they found out that government worker's compensation which isn't twenty chain\nIs thirty two percent higher than the average private sector Alaskan\nWorker thirty two percent higher\nSo we have we have two things going on here well a lot of state employees and their pay is much higher than the equivalent in the private sector\nRight does not look at their salaries look at their benefits as well well the benefit package is huge benefits\nAre usually about a benefit for about forty percent so if you have a salary ... let's say your salary was fifty thousand dollars a year ... your benefits you're going to be a more to say about the um twenty thousand dollars\nYes so and you have to look at oh look at the end of it and a lot of employees actually don't know what their benefits are worth and they usually we've tried to do that I was born with our payroll data\nAnd many of them are really surprised because they said well I'm not seeing that my pay check well no but you're getting great health insurance and if you didn't have a benefit you'd be pulling out of your pocket\nSo what does an app when someone when somebody hears Governor Walker come on a show like mine and says you know was doom and gloom and that was the only thing you could do what would have been your response to the governor when he said that\nI I Would have shown in the data right\nThat was certainly the dead as a matter of fact you know you know the budget Roger Stone a leftist I'm for your folks out there the unrestricted general fund which is let's just let's call it your day to day checking account for an individual sure\n[noise] you know the governor keeps saying he's happy that he got well there's this\nFiscal year right now that we're in there\nWas an increase over the previous fiscal year ... to point three percent\nOf the numbers I keep hearing is that the numbers that the budget actually grown a few percent\nRight and if and if you take another thing like the debt service and retirement and I think you should take those in a than it actually goes up to five percent increase over the previous year\nNow these are also raised in discretionary spending or are we talking about the same thing\nAt the same thing is ... ... ... is in in ah the unrestricted\nThe unrestricted correct okay gotcha\nSo overall ... percent increase and this is right off of legislative finance division his estates a website and it's I mean these numbers up there right there for about a four four point five five billion dollars right now is what we're spending ...\nWhere the governor to say we've got thanks for the phone [laughter] [laughter] [noise] I'll be honest with you I don't think he knows what he's\nTalking about you know what they did not just the governor\nYou you got just about every single legislator out their heck I Can't find four of them that that that you know maybe there there might be for maybe ... Bolden I'm Shelley use\nAnd ah I don't know for a couple of other ones they they might say yeah heck we can cut this budget but but the other the other fifty six of them are are like\nOh no no gee whiz we're we're we're going to die if we do\nWell you've got an anti ... she's a ... dog yup yup Tammy there you go there's another one but hey you can you can you can count on one hand almost you know well that's because\nYou can count on one hand almost you know\nWell that's because they're part and put them\nOther words they benefit from it but many of them and and they're um you know there are some of them are actually a more attention to the special interest in\nAnd you have a government like the NEA right right\nWe have these organizations or access to go down there in the lobby for more taxes oh yeah there's sociologically associate over we pay for them to go down there and ask them all the money\nOr what I was a staffer who then\nWhen I was a staffer Juno that's all you saw the hallways every day just people line in what money labor unions representatives ah you know a business managers union's oil common era where everybody there are only people who are in the hallways are waiting outside your office was ... and wanting to spend money\nWell I'll tell you if I were an elected legislator down there and it and brand new and\nI Would hang a sign up and I would make a well no no no love ya\nYeah right and sending an email right right right right right right I see every I'd rather see everyday Alaskan\nAnd Alaskans are somewhat a limb gas was on that just you know she was on a Facebook page a little bit and she was seeing how difficult it is just because\nFor every dollar we all know there's a constituent tied to it and so to every time you try to cut a program you know when I served before all of a sudden you got five or six seven ten people calling you know oh no no don't go that don't get that\nAnd so the public kind of to blame too aren't they aren't we\nYeah yeah the public is to blame a somewhat of it but you know a ... threat but I wouldn't use that term there's actually tried to every dollar spent\nHow would you put it turned special interests yeah yeah and she didn't cheat\nCorrect on that but that's why we elect the people we elect him to have a backbone it go down there and stand up for every day Alaskan not or special interest and you know there's some there's some huge special interest in\nIn the in the Alaskan very powerful oh yeah and you you and I would never have the voice they oh no the government unions um\nThe Alaska state hospital those nursing or whatever on association ... oh Providence we can't ... will never get anything change and health and social services for decades middle years there was only the only\nHealth and social services everybody talks about how big budget it in a unrestricted general a statement normally state money on a one on one or billion dollars this year um yes what education is even more\nWell we've got about a minute left in ... and I think the what you've done forces you've really summed it up and that we have the money but their money's there we didn't need to cut the budget just said to David in\nUm the ... need to be taken in order to save government or a ... it's just a window public maybe\nWhen the public has had enough of it or they'll bill or the legislature will change its course but at the public has to rise up\nI Would rather a single parent living in the bank or anywhere else in the last ... Thirteen hundred dollars to spend as they wish and for the state of Alaska to take that money cut twenty percent out of it and spend the rest to her as a as the title of it\nAnd I think some day now I really and you know of course you're going to get a hold all the free media you can and and get your word out and and uh worked at area so\nUh what what do you know I may I ask you a question I Want to know what the judge acts as if that was the only\nKind of the only thing he could do his his opportunities we're limited and I don't know law and I'm no lawyer but I think he had more opportunities\nTo to impose\nA much more a Latino\nRestrictive sit ins or a harsher sentence whatever what worries opportunities do you know\nHe could have one hundred percent rejected the plea deal you know I'm judges hold water because our full job despite so for him to say that he just that they're powerless within sight is ludicrous and there's\nSupport that he put up there was a case um a couple of years ago you remember the Alaska Bush people that committed for\nYou All right there were there was a plea deal brought forth I included no jail time and a judge but he rejected the email because he said\nI don't want justified I Want them to serve thirty days in prison rom so judge court could absolutely reject the deal and that they could have either renegotiate it the plea deal so that there was some prison time or if they couldn't reach the plea deal than they could have gone to trial and I feel\nBritain high or if they couldn't reach the plea deal than they could have gone to trial and I feel confident that it that are cheering would've agreed with us that um that he needed more I'm just walking away from all over before a grand jury indicted\nI'm sure you know that now he was charged\nWith a misdemeanor he was convicted or was held accountable with Mr mean or is that correct because at the final deal\nLevel assault ... I'm Sorry say that again it was felony level of salt\nIt was a felony level of salt so even a misdemeanor ... the the maximum sentence this year a and a ten thousand dollar fine I mean that that ah and then and then of course he was convicted of a felony yes so\nHe got on two years\nSo that a judge really could've gardening ... a year in jail and and he had been out and eight months\nOr whatever of good behavior I don't know signing two years and he could have been out in a year you're I I don't know how it all works\nBut and he didn't have to give them credit for the year he was on house arrest ... he had that said that he did not have to do that he could have that now that you're on house arrest you with your wife and children does not go out\nAnd and what gets me is a lotta times judges or will base their decisions on\nThe actions of of of the predator of of the ah the assailant and you know they say okay these\nAre mitigating in these are they use different words but right but but there's enhanced managed to crimes like right like the choking aggravated yeah there you go aggravated such and so the choking is is\nWould be an aggravated or add on to it the the Jack tuition would have been at ... at aggravated or an adjustment to the\nTo the sentencing and none of those aggravated I'm trying to talk like a lawyer I Can't even [laughter] I'm I'm I'm horrible at it but anyways\nNone of that was given an any being really disingenuous factually by saying like his hands were tied you know I Know that he's trying to act like well you know that's all I could really do we try to do our job is judges and not you know ... and there were more options\nThere absolutely were and he said well judges don't write the laws we just have to follow them but I'm not I have to take a lot of the line I did a lot he could have given to them ... years um\nOr at least thought harder and also looked at the defendant I don't know if you watch the video but the way he addresses the defendant is what I Would describe very fatherly yeah says oh you can't do this again you know almost kind of talking to them like band and they're like oh I Know how they can't do this again you know this is your one path\n[noise] [noise] that's crazy you know it's like a like a school kid you know like okay you can't throw dirt clubs that the girls anymore you know a ... you got to be have on the on the swing set you know you've got to learn that that's just a a amazes me well you know I\nI I uh\n... what you guys I mean what would you guys think should've been done is there any kind of consensus you know do you have any feelings about it about how he should have been punished\nYou know I'm not a life either yeah\nAnd that's why I say first starting this movement because I'm not a lawyer but I think everybody has the right to stand up and call out there so that at a degree for that the judicial system belong to all of us I don't know I don't have the you know what I think\nAppropriate and then I just know that what he was given let's not put the bare minimum I would've liked them to love notified the victim where the\nProsecutor said he tried her by her phone to notify her and then up to me that's not acceptable and I think the judge should've been that it that she knew about this plea deal before it went through um [noise] I think he should have talked to the defendant differently and I think that sent to\nJail tight and I'm not going to the home I what I think that\nNow there's another level of this is that each ... on one of the Jack tuition or seeming on another person is not a crime in Alaska is that am I did I hear that correctly\nYeah it's not a sex assault yeah it's not a sexual assault in me is it a crime\nThat would fall under harassment harassment id okay yeah but she was charged with another truck [noise] Oh nice right there\n[laughter] I I got to take a break ...
