homeless people in and they're not even the people were talking about argument homeless they're they're they're just they're law breaking people um they're\nJust they're degenerates that's what they are they're they're they're disrupting people's place of business are you in Burke which the mirror I had more to say on it yesterday not this specific issue but on the homeless and crime issue around the city\nOf homelessness and very visible shale in Anchorage bleeding shows it's down Eighteen percent I Want is being done to keep people off the street\nThere's a lot of things are being done we've been able to because we have more police officers we've been able to do things with the police and the firefighters and social workers that enable us to get at problems before they start to exist we have a by name council you know who's on the street or we've done the kinds of things that happened when you form\nGroups with the nonprofit agencies and so we've been able to deliver services more effectively more rapidly they're still a ways to go there is no question about that but the because we have partnerships with the nonprofit and the private sector we have reason to think that the next year we'll see some additional improvements in the\nIn reductions in homelessness and\nWell I Hope we see some reductions to marry but hasn't happened it just hasn't happened and you've been married for um for years now and and and the problem if you go down and you talk to the people the business owners of downtown there they're going to tell you it's a problem it's on any of it\nAnd he knows it to ... they they said they have a by name or a list did they know yeah they know the the\nHomeless people and I mean most people that live I live on in the corners an art in Minnesota I see the same homeless people\nEvery all the time and stuff they even called me Jamaica 'cause I got this jak of this is Jamaica and when I'm not even wearing the jacket they just say hey Jamaica they know me because I Want to get out there even very and I've given them all celebrities like I've given them food I've given the money when I had it\nYou know to the ones that I Know that are are the there and we have when you deal with them all the time and these downtown businesses and you being the old downtown business owner you see the same ones and you deal with them and stuff and yeah like\nThere are those homeless people that are out there they're homeless they don't cause any problems at all but then there's some that are just\nProblem makers and that and the and the businesses that deal with them all the time like the service stations around my neighborhood and the ones downtown ... they have to deal with them all the time messing up their bathrooms you know doing all of it you know the\nIt's a ... yeah yeah it's an alien robbed and they know and even Berkowitz there and there's like we have a by list so they ... by name oh they know they know the evil\nNow this what we're talking about is somebody going now is social justice warrior on Facebook and blow in this place up and like and people that live in neighborhoods where they never deal with homeless people or anything they're like oh we're so outraged you know the men\nProbably none of none of those people actually went down and Rob the place but in inspired somebody to now when they robbed the place does any of that money they stole did they Robin Hood that money that they end up with anyone I bet you not are they\nThey're not they did all the damage yeah they did damage yeah yeah and then they they whatever they got other those cash registers that they do look right or did they turn around and give that to every homeless person to buy a bunch of meals of course was golden corral just packed with homeless people in this guy just like it's all on me you know he ... he went out and bought drugs with that money\n... probably so yeah I mean just because social media you know these people see something that happens they don't understand what went on inside that business they don't deal with it every\nDay and you heard the owner ... who's like being called racist hurts me I my son is a native Alaskan right you know like that that hurts him to be called ... I'm not racist at all\nBecause somebody some business owner made the decision is just listen\nDon't want you eat in here now you buying food that's fine but I don't want 'em in here you know why because they've had time and time and time and experience after experience that it's not good it causes problems that they even said at the end of the earlier in the day they don't they have problems they don't\nThey even say that a failure in ... they don't they have problems they don't act\nAppropriately they disrupt other customers you never know what they're gonna do next and I mean I've dealt with this for for a dozen years downtown of your customers that cafe and that happens to you\nI'm not a lot I Want to go back I'm not going back in ... who wants to go to ... but I don't because there's a bunch of they they they let a the drunks hang out there and ... those croissants are delicious yeah it's not putting up with and and the lady I talked to the lady and and we uh uh on it and we may get one of the family members on\nOn the interview here but you know she says look we give out at the end of the day you know we get all of our our uh uh stuff way that we don't sell\nSo we'll we're not we're not refusing to these people food we're not we're not heartless people were not this or that is just in this situation came up and we were not going to allow these people that eat inside the restaurant they could eat outside\nAnd then\nPeople got a hold of this on Facebook in and blew up and then all of a sudden people decided to take their own\nCorrective action which was\nDo ten thousand dollars worth of damage to our restaurant I mean that's a that's a that pairs bakeries been in town for a long long time I used to be out on mall doing and then they move downtown you know they're they're probably regretting their move but this is a type of things that people put up with and this is a\nAnd listen for you nice people okay let me talk to you for a second let me talk to you all you nice folks just a nice ones the mean people you can listen but let me talk to you nice people you've\nGot your little car and you get out of your house and you go Dr downtown and you're doing your something in your shopping or whatever and you know and and you happen to go to some restaurant or something\nAnd all of a sudden you see some owner being what you think is rude to one of these ... and and and you have to understand that that person\nHas rights to that business owner has rights and they don't want that person in the restaurant they don't want that person and their business\nBecause why because there's a historical pattern there and that says that this ... persons or these persons are not good for your business they create problems there there are a nuisance they're they're criminals that's what they are\nThey're they're they're they're just criminals and and and there's really no [noise] there's there's no\nAh what do I want to know ramifications on there is no accountability because they know there is no time there's no space for them there was nothing they can do to them they know it's a waste of time they got arrested them they're going to take him down in jail they're going to let them go uh\nThere's not enough room in the jail already it it's a continuous problem but the public to understand that they can't just\nBash this bakery and I've been there I Know how these people and this bakery feel\nI noticed like ... to have your store messed up and people come in and and disrupt people in in ... in in in the store and urinate in the store and and do gross things in your bathrooms and stuff I I understand that 'cause see I I've been there\nAnd the rest of the public has the ... in his shoe\nAnd they've got to support the small businesses and and\nI'll be honest when I was in London I I used to handle it with a little heavy hand\nBut I'm not advocating that everybody does that way\nBut but I ... with a little bit of a heavy hand\nBecause I wanted to know don't come down here in a more there's a lot of place where you hang out and because that's where it got to the point where it was it was just becoming overwhelming\nAnd I've gotten a call the police and all this and they can't help me there's nothing they can do you know they can show them off\nBut you have to build up some sort of determine [laughter]\nAnd and sometimes you get a little rough\nDo not eat at Paris bakery and cafe six in ... in Denali Anchorage this afternoon I was denied seating when I entered with to Alaska Native individuals'\nSee what they don't don't do those they don't they leave out the part that these two Alaska Native individuals were problems there were problems before there in the business new there are problems and that's why they didn't want them in there it wasn't just to Alaska\nOr problems and that's why they didn't want them in there it wasn't just to Alaska\nNatives wasn't like they just flew in from Bethel and and hey you know ... sit down here and have dinner I got a couple of your friends from the yeah here for the if then write something nothing no that wasn't there were these were known problems\nAlthough the restaurant was nearly empty I was explicitly told I Would not be seated as the host is ah the people with me when I asked for a reason those said management was higher in clientele\nWell\nUh uh this is not a high end restaurant it does not serve alcohol it's a cafe with three stars on Yelp however it's clearly discriminatory about\nA but not about their food or service and so here here people are taking this out they don't know the story behind these people that\nThey were bringing when with them and the restaurant does the restaurant did they knew the reputation\nThey knew the problems there are there every day they see the same people every single day they had problems with similar people\nAnd and you're in anywhere where there's homeless people you see the same ones all the time right like I was saying they call me Jamaica oh yeah me around my they know you don't you run it was the same guys they probably knew you to\nWrite this is a ... a try while I was ... and yeah and I know who they were the city\nHas a list they know who they are too you're there for ten years they've through you know ... that we have a ... list right they know who\nWho the the you know the the homeless the real home and ... and you know what to think about\nThis for a moment here you got the bakery three people walk through the door they're not very busy according to post\nThere's not many business you know the just says no to people that to to to to enter their bill their business\nI mean how common is that that's pretty rare that's that's like unheard of for the most part right so you gotta ask yourself let's just assume\nThat the owners that bakery and the people that are working there have\nA fair amount of a brain material between their ears let's just assume that for discussion reason\nWhy the hell would they ever say no one\nReally them to say to look at those two people and say no way you're not coming in here\n\nThere's only one thought that comes through my mind there's history there there's history they know something they know something they know those people they've had problems\nNobody in their right mind is just going to look at three people and tell them hey ah you know what they weren't just a bunch of raises an John native beads folks and uh you know we just don't believe y'all be blown here and get the hell out\nCome on people betting well that's not what happened that's not what happened no I wasn't there no but I Know\nCommonsense I Know business businesses\nYou try to serve everybody can because guess what when they're spending money that's what you want that's how you make a living feeding your family\nSo it it upsets me that when people out there who who who\nI don't know are not familiar with the problems of downtown and some of these ... and people are judged these business owners\nAnd and the only reason I bring myself into the deal is the story is not about me the only reason I bring myself in a deal because I put up\nWith it for ten years owning a Chevron station downtown\nI mean I was riding the line I was right in the middle between cars and and beans cafe\n[laughter] uh what you were saying that Facebook posts they weren't saying that they were homeless vague written looking no they're Alaska Native so that paints a different picture on Facebook than what the reality of the reality is a true story really was yeah\nYeah yeah ... it's a ... in even in the what we played I mean that's what really hurt the the owners the most was like being called racist because you know like I have an Alaskan native childlike I\nI'm not racist that really you could tell that hurt them the most ... just as much as getting the damage done to like the damage to their reputation because\nObviously that isn't true they're not racist\nYou know what do I I think most people in town I really do I I well I Hope I Hope most\nPeople in ... in Anchorage in the city they've either done business with Paris bakery before and they know they're a good place\nFor 'em\nThey're able to read between the lines and not and and understand that there's a problem there and and that these owners didn't just you know I've I've already talked to one of them and and and they just didn't you know they're they're not at a habit of just throwing people out at a restaurant\nYou know hey ah check out those to you know they don't look like good folks me let's just get rid of him thrown out of here\nNow and that didn't happen it didn't go down that way anybody believes that fool All right

basically that's what their deal is they're they're kind of the umbrella of all labor unions and he is\nThe main guy um he's the executive director\nAnd so bell charming\nUm he's the executive director and so Belcher ami\nHas been reported that he's got this smear campaign and he's going to put on\nA done levy and it has to do with done levy having a sexual relationship with a guy that worked at the Sheraton Hotel\nAnd now they're so called individual this individual that they're referring to is no longer in the state he's been flown out according the story and since done levy brother's got a lot of money\nIn his ... state put him up some place and uh he's he's laying low\nThat's what the story is so a bill Johnny also addressed allegations made by former Republican Party communications director and editor must read Alaska Susan downing that\nHe was going to be delivering an October surprise smear campaign surrounding Republican or nominate governor Mike Dunn levy\n\nNot listen to listen to a double trauma he doesn't deny it he doesn't deny that allegation what I Will say about the issues since my name was brought up on the record I guess in in the Anchorage Press as well\nIs that I don't care one iota\nWhat a about Mike Dunn levy a one way or the other they'll trauma he said do a group\nOf about a dozen media are men back by more than twenty union members holding mark baggage campaign side\nBut watch more of a concern to me and I would think to anyone who is a registered Republican our actions ring or a Republican Party chairman document Babcock\n\nReal charming went on to claim that he personally had personal knowledge of Babcock hiring a private investigator to interrogate multiple private citizens about their knowledge relating to the permit the is rumors\nAnd and you kinda ponder and and you think about what is taking place over the last three weeks politically I mean you're here you had you know\nIt's done is running for office and he's a Republican and then you had Walker course all the time he's running for re election and then also mark baggage jumps in okay wow that's really interesting that that mixes it up then the whole discussion became\nYou know are they going to split the vote Walker and baggage and split the vote who's ... who's in who's out\nThey have their argument they had their discussion they had their meetings they had their power their people talk to their people entered people talk to their people end up in a bit of bitter bitter bitter bitter end anyways\nIn the end then all of a sudden bang\nMa lot says something some woman that creates enough this stress in the campaign now we're\nMa lots out I mean you're not only a campaign he's resigned as lieutenant governor [laughter]\nThis is quite extraordinary nice guy is resigning from office that that kind of got lost in the whole shuffle up things because it it it it kind of had the parents where he was just leaving the campaign\nBut that's not only that for a minute and then bam boom washes out and you know like we all know is we all went went home for the weekend and then it just a change yeah he a\nLot resigned resigned as governor over that\n... and ... and then what three days later three I think within Seventy two hours\nWalkers it's been longer yeah and and the words to spend as a new word for end terminate complete final final\nOver done baked post it it's it's\nYeah it might be the terminology that he has to use because his name is still going to be on the ballot yet and they they are using men my campaign though which means it's done but money they're going to be on there and you know so now\nI still get more votes into it [laughter]\n[laughter]\nWe're going to hold you to that we're going to hold you

they going to split the vote you know that was a big Liz ticket both\nOn now for ... you know\nSexual misconduct resignation campaign suspension gay rumors I mean\nThis is this is like this is like\nWashington DC\nRaising Lago Louisiana ...\nThis is a big big city crazy stuff that we go with\nHim at a movie like gay rumors gone on marital affairs we're at\nPeople\nGot whole campaign full in the tent gone on what somebody says\n... minimal explanation of ... what was ... ... ... ... from year to lieutenant governor position I mean yeah we couldn't have predicted this craziness is a week ago\nI mean you think about it he didn't just resigned from the campaign\nHe resigned as lieutenant governor or we had to swear in not showing up Monday I'm done y'all we had a swearing in another lieutenant governor\nI mean I don't know if if everybody quite realizes that or not but but that's that's what's happening so and then now we're on to you know my done lady had sex relationships with the with a with a man and and and now all that's out there and\nAnd and the interesting thing I didn't give is bill ... not denying that he was\nA that\nThat he was in charge of the smear campaign he he he deferred the question how how does he do it how did he he he arts skillfully did that\nIt says a bill charming also addressed allegations made by former Alaska\nRepublican communications director and editor and publisher a must read Alaska Susan Downey I I go there are a lot and read your stuff or that he was going to be delivered\nAn October surprise smear campaign surrounding Republican nominee for governor Mike Dunn levy\nOkay so so that's what Suzanne downing assertion that\nAnd then and then Mike Dunn levy says what what I Will not not Mike Dunn levy I'm Sorry Mr bill ... says what I Will say about that issue since my name was brought up on the record I guess\nIn in in the Anchorage Press as well is that I don't care one iota about Mike Dunn leading the pro ... proclivities\nAre one way or the other ... group about a dozen media people\nSo he didn't answer it he he he never he never denied that he was behind the rivers he's never he he he\nYou know some of them didn't start a rumor you would think that yeah it's a good deal that there's good possibility may have said hey I just started that I don't have nothing to do with that I don't know where that came from don't take me with it I'm over here are running our campaign\nBut bell charming didn't do that\nAnd and and build Johnny has a dog in this fight I mean he wants his candidate to win hey there are other there or not they don't know this was not kitty ball this not kick ball this was not will football you know this is real politics is was hardcore politics and then I'm Bill ... is a\nYou know he's going to swing as bad as ours he came in as many times is again and so uh there's probably true to this debt that built charming did start this rumor about\nUh about about a done levy\nBut until they find but [laughter] it's like it's like the mistress until they find the ministers there's no story\nUntil they find this black guy that allegedly had sex with there's no story because in ... is the second person there's nothing\nAnd I I I'm not sure if they're going to be able\nTo do that but what a mess I mean no money nobody could have ... people in Hollywood cutting ... wrote the script\nI mean this is something is just out of the world this is something that I don't think anybody expected\nOr the the terms of the twist in terms of politics today anybody can say anything anybody can do anything anybody can promote anything yet and I'm hopefully enough people believe it\nAnd that's where I read today it doesn't matter if it's true have true\nUh it it nothing matters anymore\nPeople's families don't matter people's livelihoods do matter\nIt's just scorched earth man you're in it to win it in whatever it takes to do it that's what we do\nAnd I'm\nBegging judges um I'm sure it and then what they're trying to do is that the baggage campus had so much problems with not directly with them but being with that what Walker and all the the two there were kind of always put in the same box\nThey're they're trying to get the story away from them back on Doug levy put Doug levy on defense and and let ... be on off in for a while\nAll right it's a twelve

more than a\nA rumor\nOr about a homosexual or whatever in relationship to\nUm to take 'em down that's that's my opinion in and it should um there's no sense in ... it's just we just do\nBelow below ... and I think when people get so desperate that you know they use like this young girl death in ... and what\nPeople do in their private lives and stuff and it it just it gets so nasty in\nNo wonder if people you know I don't want to vote don't want to get involved in politics don't want to do anything who the heck would want to run I mean look what you got to go through\n... you you have to be\nA I'm willing to to to to be beat up and in in and lied about and and whatever else they could come up with\nAnd and so it's um it's a sad thing\nBecause it it what it does is it discourages good

harassing us and you know the thing was when we actually talked to people\nAbout what had happened and why that decision was made right or you know a lot of people were like oh okay that's actually a fairly reasonable yeah we you know we would have met like you know\nThe hostess could have handled it better and we've already talked to that employee and we said you know like we need just you know we need to do this better in the future\nAnd you know we're going to have like an all staff meeting and we're going to implement some training for employees and stuff like that but I mean you know
