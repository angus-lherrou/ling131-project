that I built several very successful companies over the years as well as this program although it's always been very entrepreneurial\nMy time with Disney ABC and then ESPN it was extremely valuable\nWhen I eventually went off on my own you've had your own very accomplished career and in many ways or a visionary and river cruising so I'd like to know what did you are experiences that you know world and Viking teach you that you've taken to another level with your team and I'm a water was\nBefore I joined during the girls actually had my own company as the eye students reveling tenacious no\nSo I headed for eight years has started another company and then I actually I joined the new rules of what I mean\nIt really opened up a it was a good time that uh in Nineteen Ninety two in mind that you know opened up and union rules I was in I was hired to find new\nFederal products and the war in ... was the river cruising or I was there for eight years moved on and open biking river cruises and actually in the end I realize I can do it a little bit on my own\nAnd this guy that would create theme in a Christian and I'm at a real gung ho who's ... who's Ryan and uh actually it it trying to achieve that goal that one day will be the best in it and I think it'd be it'd be up to date\nI think my God no doubt that green Christine since we first met we've definitely sharing a little bit of a connection since we both work with our spouses in our respective family business is very different businesses and successfully I might add\nI Know the un Rudy handle and manage different parts of the cruise company I Would lie for you to tell our audience the impacts that you think you've had in her continuing to have on the ground with him on the way\nThey can marry well where do you like to say oh this is Christine needs to filter he also knows that it takes it takes to hold them do what we already had my cell phone and then they can email the smoky father\nWhat started the company sixteen years ago\nAnd in the course of the company or the really build it up the house no more than ... members in our office have an office seems awful he opened an office in

um so we're always prepare it and trying to make things better bring people and and then as far as the trial is oh my God uh\nEverybody comes it's so funny when on the first to do what Europe does it we execute twenty people but everybody comes here but we're glad they do we love telling them about it and it's a compelling story\nI'm sure than it is on the other Salem historical tours and the haunted footstep goes toward a lovable are there the oldest walking tours in Salem, Massachusetts from what we understand\nYour tourist thing offering combo of history with a dose of those grim details in keeping with the Halloween theme so for listeners around the country who might want to come to Salem at this point hoping to see her experience it goes what can you tell them to come away with\nI'm very good and things are doing are we doing great at a a you know we had a very hot summer like everyone else in the world I Believe\nWe very busy as you know the end of your approach is a really uh you know money factoring craft one after the other every day to bring on the target\nIs a then is good news especially when you were on the airline manufacturing business or listen I Want to ask you this\nLast week Mary mentioned the Singapore Airlines flight twenty to touch down here in the New York area at Newark liberty completing the longest flight in the world currently the flight uses a new Airbus a three fifty jet and I'd like to hear how this new plane is doing out there on the market because I think I saw some stats while I Know I saw some stats earlier this week actually\nThat said there are now about two hundred of them flying in various fleets around the globe\nWhat can I add you know everything robot\nWill try to make sure on his now with your friends why\nYou have to do more than two hundred already flying around the world and you know what a customer airline love it because it is reliable because it is efficient a better job of it\nAnd I think that's one of the main attribute of yeah corrupted it's come to a it is a quieter Kevin it is also you know low income you know to to\nMake the air inside the Kevin low humid that in the current machine that all playing around the world and this is why I think a fool decided to re open the\nLongest flight in the world to Singapore York remembers it used to operate in the triple crown or the ... five hundred but the economy to grow up with ... with the rise of the the fuel price and\nSo the combination of the economy and the Kevin come cook made it a no brainer for them and they had a lot of the men from the business stuff and just to reopen so we're very\nProud that uh the nine hundred fifty nine hundred fewer laws for a long range as do the job and will do so on the flight\n... I Know last time we had you on the program we did talk about the secret jumbo a three eighty and whether that plane was going to really survive long term and we had a conversation about it in one of the points that you made was it's very difficult to make airports larger in most cases that we need bigger aircraft to handle capacity\nSo we've got the U.S airlines ending flights on the seven forty seven and Airbus a three eighty production possibly being cut a little bit and twenty Nineteen so where are we with just like that these days\nI think I should remain the same I read that the market at traffic doubles every Fifteen Years and so you write the summer ice and many of those are both already\nEvery Fifteen Years and that's ah you're right the summer ice and many of those at both the already congested\nThat traffic control limitations are at traffic management restriction as well so that means a now everywhere to believe but on some of the so called trunk crude ... on the way to continue to carry more passenger is really to gauge sawed go for the good lord you so\nYes the creative business a remains a attractive for airline possibly not as high as what we initially planted a both and clearly we do see now are probably more room for the\nBigger a three fifty like the three fifty one as a as well in combination with the three Eighteen interesting that basically\nIs a four hundred ... a craft you go next to a five hundred and five you know five hundred fifty a seat or a three eighty and the combination of those two ah would be very powerful\nAnd you're still moving a lot of people not question I think so asking is next April it's gonna be the beginning of a new chapter in Airbus as the ... you know Tom enters will be leaving in the head of your plane making operation he owned sorry we'll be moving into the executive suite a CEO love to know what are your expectations for Airbus under the new leadership\nWhat first of all elected said it is being a great youthful about to hear that deal more with being nominated I'll tell you it's great to know about the stability in the governance of the company that we can project also seem to come in you know six months without wondering okay we've got to be the next year it's already done it since late\nAnd they did it a new CEO a is now working on you know the nomination of all the different succession the\nFor the you know a wave of succession to be a to be an aid and this is going to happen in the coming months um I don't ... and\nWe don't really expect any big changes in terms of vision we will continue to work on the uh about an animal beneath the were will continue to work on you know the ... uh all the other ... sorry like the kind of acts you know that we we love of the\nBuilding prototypes demonstrates is\nSo we're building or an electrified the one for six which is a chill your member of a it's a foreign Jeanette crops Laura Croft and basically we planning to vote one electrical engine out of the four engine and [laughter]\nWe had somebody on last week or two weeks ago Patti Dr ... Anderson from Embry riddle on the show with us and we were talking about the electric airplanes and coming and that's good news I mean especially it's good fuel savings and obviously one of the four engine it's completely different from the future\nAnd I think it's important for us in the industry to demonstrate things and learn the lessons from there in order to be ready for the next generation Akron off so this is what we're doing and you know talking about a banana mobility and flying drones and the\n... of a it is also important throughout this to be top of what's gonna happen in terms of air traffic control that traffic management\nBecause yeah because there's all sorts of questions now I mean people are flying drones all around the world I heard that in the U.S last year I mean they already had\nMore than one million off we surely registered ... about three million being shipped from shelter to individual is hot so that that you that there's a huge number of you know flying machines violence at some point in time you would need to\nPut some regulation into all of this and therefore we had a boss\nWon't be a ...\nActually leave France already run out of time I would lie for you to talk about the Eighteen twenty and there's a lot of talk about that on their side of the Atlantic I no doubt that has committed to buy a large number of this aircraft we've heard great things about what about his plane\nYeah that was great used to have those on both you know I mean they're choosing between the the products\nWhat I've got I think I said twenty but in particular the three\nTwenty one to three Twenty one is a machine you had a lot I mean take them two hundred and forty four pack a but it has the economy 'cause I think a lot of craft and what's unique about the three Twenty one is that we\nSpend it in the long range version as well so what we've just been talking about the three fifty nine hundred you at all\nBut we'll throw off stretching deranged overall small and would you like do you have to be Twenty one so all of a sudden airlines can fly I think a lot of that cropped across the Atlantic ocean and come actually fairly deep into Europe\nYou know land almost anywhere from the U.S goes to the to to anywhere in Europe and at the cost of a single ...\nA machine and so this is really the what what makes the between the one unique\nWell listen between eight to twenty that Mariano said you've got to be three Twenty one in three thirty three fifty three you've got a great sleep I also saw this week as well that that's some news Airbus is growing in as far as the service thing with the sky wise your data analysis network\nThat's going to be collecting data not only from the delta jets from other Airbus jet so clearly that's grown France why we always enjoy talking with you it's great to reconnect with you and we really appreciate the time thanks for joining marry me get an update and let's make sure we reconnected sooner or in the new year okay\nThank you very much over the exciting cooking for you and your ...\nThank you for instance I enjoy your weekend thank you very\nSprints one we have so much more willing to talk to them about and then we're going to have to come back and touch on a lot of that and maybe in April or several take the show to to win this war over in Europe and to see him on the person the books are reminded of police connect with us on Facebook and Twitter and LinkedIn at heart and will travel what it's like a quick break for\nCommercial messages from our sponsors of the same right where you are a lot more coming up we'll get to it [noise]\nTo join Robert Marion Rudy call eight hundred three eight seven eight oh two by four or five of us on Facebook and Twitter are and more travel more coming right back\nI'm a waterways is taking river cruising to a whole new level with his new mega shipping I'm an actor so did they do in twenty Nineteen this ship is Seventy two\nFeet wide double the size of existing river cruise ships\nJust means more personal space that sacrificing the intimate experiences we enjoy as it will carry less than two hundred passengers there will be multiple restaurant al fresco dining and one bar to go along with a pool health and wellness studio complimentary bikes and more neither first a cruise the Daniel on the on the magna ...
