a message doesn't go at all the debates doesn't feel like he needs to whatever reason goes his his ship it's just been kind of steady steady steady there's been this luck is over\nHere on the side lives do\nIs walk or is it baggage is baggage or is it Walker what's going on who's staying who's going who's going to get out the deadline passes so nobody can get out now lanes it ruined it beyond the ballot it keeps going and it keeps\nLingering questions gracious exit for a bill Walker\nUm\nYou know gracious accent I don't I don't know about that\nWhatever it was difficult to believe what unfolded in front of me friday afternoon and this is Michael Carey talking Governor Bill Walker\nAsked uh the organizers of the Alaska federation of NATO's annual convention for permission to make\nAn unscheduled address and before hundreds of people in a giant ballroom um\nLet's see and the value is let's see you explain the events of the past few days and made it impossible for him to win and to ensure the survival of his values and the values of Alaska Native share with him\nHe was holding his campaign and supporting Democrat Mark Begich\nA ... let me read a little bit more here and then I'll give you some comments in his schedule a march to the convention Thursday Walker explain a lieutenant governor Brian lots departure from the ... ticket was a matter of accountability quote unquote\nBut accountability for what\nThat's what we all want to know [noise]\nVirtually everyone attending the convention knew that ... had been accused of sexual misconduct and resigned\nBut what from what from what misconduct\nThey walkers staffer society and the need to protect the women's privacy would not say the conduct involve words offensive words as a staffer explain there had been no Pauline groping et cetera et cetera Brian lot has\nBeen a fixture at the ... conventions for decades as a native leader\nAnd elected official once upon a time in Nineteen sixty he was um the boy mayor of yeah kept at a public figure says before many a if not a majority of the people in the hall were born now he has disappeared become non person like\nUh so what did what did\nI I don't understand this is twenty eight team\nWhat the heck did walkers or what ma lot said some lady that was so offensive\nThat I'm created all this\n\nMeans he says something offensive most of the time an apology works most Simon apology\nGets past or you know you apologize for what you've done you shouldn't have said something or you were thinking that as you said this and therefore a ... ... you\nMove on well in the times that we have I mean just the words really like compared to some\nPolitical scandals we've seen of of that word weeded and photos or captured recordings and you know I mean\n... you know it's it's hard to believe the words yeah the words the like how like what else is happening like what is this really you know like what does this story\nHigh end up making them does it yeah like\nWhen you start thinking when you first year that I have to be something bigger go or not and vigor about this is just my ... my mind is not saying that there is there anything or to hurt anything right just right just my intuition in hearing this is like oh man\nYou know this has to be covering up so we got to like you know look at this fire over here so you don't see dude I'm with if I'm hard crash over here you know there's something about this [noise] no I'm not saying I've heard anything or not having the intuition of like can be\nGood and the political landscape that we're just words and what we're though\nHey I still get two hundred dollars to find out what uh what was said [laughter] I'll go cash machine go get gas [laughter] [noise] I Want to know said\n\nThere's still a two hundred dollar reward out there for whatever was set I don't really think it's worth much more than that [laughter]\nBecause I\nYou know you don't want to say well I've been in politics for all this time and this but but it's true it's just that you when you've been around this stuff you know like right\nNot even like it is a very it's been around for like you just have to just knowing what's just seeing what's on watching you know that's\nJust knowing what's just seeing what's on watching you know that's a little couple of clips here and there an hour on the news you're like you know just awkward\nLike you know Twenty years ago it would be like oh you must have said something horrible yeah but this has got to like no this is ... is the nature of things and it's just not the way things are all these days I'm gonna apology or you know they were going to ever going to we're going to show we're going to put this out there so they don't see this you know they're going to\nFocus their attention on this is my political paranoid mind though the landscape now you know what I mean that's just the just the school\nEducated and I'm I'm a I'm like you I don't have any evidence to say there's more ...\nNot a bit not a drip just\nWay is is it ... it just a feeling it's just a feeling it's just a ... that we have a song just the feeling [laughter]\n[noise] ah so Brian lot\n\nWhatever reason it is I guess it really doesn't matter anymore or stealing the words from Ivan more it doesn't matter what he said anymore what matters is who's on the ballot and we get to vote for because that's that's what's important to you and I\nSo we have mark baggage on the ballot we have\nA mission done levy on the ballot we have a liberal on the ballot we have a conservative on about there's no two ways about it [laughter] it's a Walker and and Ellen well he's on the ballot but they're not really\nI mean he's there technically but he's telling everybody to vote for baggage\nWalker has endorsed baggage so if you want to listen to the Walker he's telling you to vote for baggage and uh we'll see how that shakes out\n\nOr it's important to remember what a public official when he disappeared or he was not like walkers employee he was not like hired like a bank executives he was not appointed like a member of a cabinet\nHe was elected in twenty four teen bomb most a hundred and thirty five thousand Alaskans who voted for him\nThe lieutenant governor is usually a a a deferential to the governor\nBut the governor is not really his supervisors the governor cannot fire the lieutenant governor for failure to perform his or her duties\nNor withhold his or her pay nor keeping out of the capital\nNow that that's an interesting point in in ... in in the deserve to be set\nThe ribbon e for lieutenant governor\nWho has gone and Mrs impeachment by the legislature the people's representatives or recall election by the people themselves or a general election again the people themselves but as a Walker staffer reminding me any public official can decide\nTo resign and that's what I'm a lot has done is he's decided to resign\n\nBut it does leave or an interesting uh uh I don't know is release a lot of uncertainty that the the person the person who I\nThink benefits the most out of this\nIs courses is a Mr done levy Mr done levy is a sitting back ... or just just\nJust ringing in his hands going wow this is great I just hope the chaos continues and because the more chaos on that side and the more and knowing the more disturbing the more\nSalacious it gets the better for me because hey I'm just sitting over here doing my ideal running my campaign in stand out of the mischief\nWe'll be right back", "year": "2018", "show_name":
