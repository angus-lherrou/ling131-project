jewelry to the wicked witch of the eight [noise]\nUm it actually helps are caught not bears\nWell speaking of helping the causes I think the Democrats in there and er I'm you raise a good point in and let me try to get to it a mark ... is the one thing is is that by Hillary sane is\nWe can pointed out and then people can make up their minds about it and can see the truth right the second thing is is that\nMine's about it and can see the truth right the second thing is is that all of this protest and then all these antics and all this interruption at the hearings and and and\nAnd all the things that have been done over the last couple of years the burning of buildings and the rioting lane and the streets and blocking traffic and it goes on and on and on\nAnd we can show that hey these are the these are those people\nUm but then the second part of that story is when they start violating our rights and um you know I'm I'm not going to lay down I I I'm not gonna you know I'm not going\nTo go somewhere and say well we can't serve you because you're wearing this cat or we cannot there I Would love for somebody in Alaska to say well you're wearing a deadly be for governor how we can't serve you I'd be like well fine I'll just do all this gel Facebook how stupid up a place ER and\nYou won't get any business at all\nYeah\nYeah that's fine yeah I I don't mind that that's great but this musical violence this physical violence stuff has got in and and and um I can just say for myself if it violates me and my personal rights\nThan than than I Am I'm I'm not gonna I'm not going to put up with it you know I I don't expect others to put up with it either I guess maybe that's my point\nUm but but I Want to be within the law you know I Want to be there\nAre breaking the law these left these are this leftist movement out there this anarchist movement this Democrat movement you know these people are breaking the law and and\nI don't want us to do that I I Want us to be in the in the confines of law\nOr under a the defending our life liberty and property\nOpen and unfortunately I don't know if I'm if\nA burqa which would do this if somebody were to go on fourth avenue will start smash windows\nOn the on on the fact is a cabin on Donald got put to the Supreme Court or something whether it be charges filed or not but um\nYeah yeah I I don't know if people have these people I don't know what happens these people in Washington DC who go out and destructive and cause damage and and you know after the inaugural election and all I mean\nUh I I don't know what happens these people I I don't know what happens is people that just made all the million dollars worth of damage in Wisconsin Capitol years ago\nI I'm not sure about all these this one percent anti one percent sit ins that that just a it was just a disgrace all over New York in the Ninety\nNine percent Eddie they're the one that is what I what I've been saying for six years now\nYeah yeah they are and it's the one percent is\nCausing Ninety nine percent in the destruction and the obstruction going on and so anyway he's All right mark appreciate the call five six nine ten eighty five six nine one zero eight zero five six nine ten eighty\nYeah um\nCome on any get fired up your hold them back to\nBe back going to message\nOr Gregg says Hi on Facebook hello folks ah\nIt it it's something that a ... time it'll it'll take its natural course I I don't think conservatives are ready to get out in the street and have at it with them I think they're willing to sit back and watch\nA a and that's probably the right thing to do for now\nBut ah\nOne day it's going to move in our neighborhood and then you might have to\nA decision but I I I'm getting sick and tired of watching it I Know that\nAnd\nBut I think conservatives are pretty good at taking the high road\nAnd um\nYou know and hopefully I object I keep hoping that that that the public will see this and they'll go are these the people that want to be elected in the act this way\nReally I Can't vote for anybody like that that's what I'm hoping prevails here and the thing just naturally takes care of itself we'll be right back\nBut when you have people like the Hillary Clinton who yesterday in an interview ever going to play it and she talks about civility can start again when Democrats reject the Congress and oh so until\nThen let's just ah what tear everything up\nGetting people's face run people out of the restaurants or create violence\nRun people out of the restaurants or create violence\nLet's listen to the ...\n[noise]\nWell certainly I Would love to see us return to civility listening to one another or working out our differences that it is not the Republican Party that exist today and that is certainly not the administration\n\nDoing\nSomething that we have in power right now when the Republican Senate denied\nThe right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland um\nHeard I think you're even wrote that they stole adjusted from that oh I ... I think they did I mean to keep the Supreme Court said open for a year\nOr two denied distinguished jurors they could have voted him down they could have said well for ideological reasons philosophical reasons or we're not going to vote for him but no they still involved\nAnd that was such a breach of\nSenate Ethics and the constitutional responsibility of the Senate to advise and consent on nominations that you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about\nThat is why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nHouse and or the Senate that's when civility can start again but until then the only thing that the Republicans seemed to recognize and respect is strength and you heard how the Republican members led by Mitch McConnell the president\nReally demeaned the confirmation process uh insulted a and attacked not only a Dr Ford but women who are speaking out\nYou know look I remember Republican operatives shutting down the voting in Florida a into south and I remember the swift boating of John Kerry\nI remember the things that even the Republican Party did a to John McCain in two thousand I remember what they did to me for twenty five years in the\nFall too in the lives which unfortunately people believe because Republicans and put a lot of time money and effort and promoting them so when you're dealing with an ideological party that is driven by the left for power that is funded by corporate interests who want a government that does its bidding\nIt's ... you can be civil but you can't\nOvercome what they intend to do unless you win elections and so the answer to everything is to get back to a balance to get back to what a is called regular order they don't even have committee processing our our ... and the idea that\n[noise] [laughter]\nI'm laughing to keep from you know\nPerson probably so if you deny a\nA piece of legislation if you deny through the political powers that you have as the majority party if you deny something then you should be ... in civility\nYou should be suggestible to um to obstruction and violence\n\nThat's what you're saying because we block we because the majority in Congress and in the United states and didn't want to uh pursued a judge jar on a nominee\nThat was the case of incivility ... it's ... it's that the right\nAnd that that was a case for the Democrats\nTo be um to be violent to act out that\nWas an excuse so when you lose and you don't have the votes then\nWhat you do is you don't win reelection you go out and create violence that's the Democrat answer that's the Democrat answer to their problems they can't win elections they've lost over a thousand says Obama started they've lost over ... over a thousand\nState wide local races they've lost governorship they've lost members and allegedly lost the house they lost the Senate ... they've they've lost everything politically across the board so when they don't win\nDidn't didn't they resort to violence\nThat's what they're saying that's what that was the undertone of of what she was saying\n\nAnd it's what you stand for it so if I'm a Republican and I stand for something that is\nIn opposition to the left is Democrats than I deserve violence plays begins to me that's what she's saying that's what these these left these are saying that the messages are getting out there they're in a\nProve all of these\nAre the maggots going out there and cars and creating violence is disturbances obstruction\nBecause guess what because they're not in power they can't win elections shoulder answer is what is violence we'll be right back here on the ... show was more examples of hypocrisy [noise]\n\n\nMuscles I'm Scott jam some emotion mortician around you know general sled dog race seven times was honored to receive the sportsmanship awarding twenty eighty and\nMy wife W. moved to Alaska Nineteen eighty five after I was hired as a\nLessons mortician every memorial join a gym general manager ... seven when WBAI along with George nice me Jim ...

I have noticed here in Anchorage especially if you live in the\nThe shady or parts of town and stuff I mean you know like I said I Can't even leave my doors locked on my car 'cause they'll just break the window steal steal stuff out of it and then I got to replace a window into leaving my window and just get just accept that you're going to get your car routed through that's what I have to do\nAnd you just don't leave anything near where the values yeah so yeah I mean ... I don't have a guitar guns or ...\nMaybe a like a down turn ... or something you know it's dark in there rooting around and they'll stick their hands looking\nFor something and I have left to note of like all my money is at the bottom of the garbage [laughter]\nOver they pick all of that up and down the stairs [laughter]\nFor a rape that the that twenty five people that are yeah he's petty crimes that annoy\nUs people here in Anchorage the most ... it's just great news that's happened in\nThe bank robbers don't don't bother to the average person murders don't bother the average person\nI'm not saying you're not disturbed by and I'm not saying but but they don't have a direct impact on you\nIt's when you get down to these guys are still in you know they're breaking in your house when you're gone and taking your guns are taking your jewelry they break in your car at night they take your sunglasses take whatever value brewery you could maybe I'll want something you left in your car or every\nTime they break into your car you don't even recall the cops on the you know the report that come it's not worth it gives them they just laughed at me when I stopped him about it yeah it's like what he wants to\nDo man I mean this happens fourteen times a night I mean that\nGuy one guy broke into my car and I caught him why because he took my radio back\nI have a bag I have a nice\nDuffel bag I put my laptop in on my radio stuff every day I pack up and I leave with\nOne night I left and then my rig I left the car lot some do came and got it but guess what I had GPS baby GPS yeah we\nDon't have details of of how this thing operation words so because they probably wanted they don't want to give all of again so keep it up\nBut I tracked down to his house to his house he was surprised to see me I said I Need my stuff back\nAnd then luckily\nLuckily I had my son in law and his friend hurt I was that this place and they rolled up it was like having a posse with me then I got two big old Simone do like six six [laughter] I thought OK I'm braver now All right we'll be right back\nBecause that's what really matters I mean that's what's going to matter to Lisa Murkowski when she's looking at how to vote on this thing because let's face it she wanted to vote in favor or a against Kavanaugh\nBecause the ... the Democrats\nThe liberals and and the native population up north in the they have helped her and they realize\nThat and she realizes that and and she you know every now and then she gives them a bone five six Nineteen eighty five six nine ones are all ages\nSo what does this do for you what does this mean to you you know how important\nNews is it yeah it's important but probably in four years depending on who's running I probably still vote for Lisa or you know no I'm I'm waiting for a newcomer\nAnd uh and and so that ... you know that helps answer that question I appreciate the phone calls have you give me a call\nWe got Joe Joe on line one joke go ahead\nYeah Hi I'm just a window to chime in on the lookout for the question first of all I've never been a Murkowski fan I'm no fan of voting for somebody who was appointed by right All right let me say this right I was waiting for her vote for the vote if she\nVoted for Kavanaugh should have had my next not for my fingers for the book again working vote against her veterans if I Am\nOkay so let me let me ... back a little further with you like the polar a pollster may do All right so you weren't you weren't a big Murkowski fan to begin with but you may have voted for 'em and but now no way in hell\nIf that was the question [laughter] that's right yeah right in\nAnd it would I have voted for her if she if she\nVoted for traveling on not just because I think what they do it to him was beyond disgraceful holy destroyed him and his family for political purposes and by the way I Do live oh word for word said because if you think in the background you find out where chefs common\nYet she she was hard I Would also\nVoted for not just because she voted for him\nBut because it was such a close vote and because\nThe Republicans in Congress were calling and yeah that would have shown a great amount of strength part and that would have been even more so that would have been important to me\nStanding up as\nA mainstream Democrat Party\nYeah to me her ... and and and and just one last thing before I got to go on a couple of more callers five six nine to ...\nThat is is that she actually in her she sent a message I think in a yes vote that she believed\nMaybe not all of that but she believed a lot of what was said about cabin on to me that's disgusting that she actually believe\nA lot of that you know or or I don't know what percentage I Can't read her mind but I Do think that was also something that that you like it really does that mean because you had to believe in in order to vote for or against\nHim I mean I Would think right right right yeah I I\nI don't believe for for a lot of reasons but very quickly and you have to go\nI think the most telling\nA problem with for its testimony was wish she didn't know how she got there she didn't know how she left it I Can't because you can't say Oh yes I Know how I got\nBrought me well no you can't talk to me and she said she said I don't know how far that\nHey I've been to a lot of parties ride member I got

know I I Want to voice my concern is I'm somebody is involved in the party and I'm just one person but I Want I Want to make it known that hey ... you know but then again I was never with Lisa Murkowski so just just reenter reinforced my feelings\nAre in the\n... this is a big deal uh the sale of city owned electric utility M. O. P.\nHit a major milestone friday when the city of Anchorage and the buyer to get electrical association released the outcome of negotiations the billion dollar deal the final agreement comes five months after voters authorize a sale in October\nOf since then it's just been if they'd been negotiating they say it's a very complex I'm I'm sure it is a very complex or\nA proposal\nA draft term sheet release friday mostly follows the contours of what was proposed to voters in the spring\n\nSet a lea lea feet fever fiber chief executive of an ... electric association member owned cooperative from customers perspective the deal is still sing\nBrings city one step closer to sail been talked about for decades the final purchase price will come out to just about a billion dollars straight up\nI don't know how to read that that many digits or according according to the terms of portions of the money this is this is what I found here about the most interesting part of the story\nAnd that is\nWhat's gonna happen to the money what are they going to do with the money\nWell one thing is you're going to pay off some debt okay that's cool we got that replace replace last taxes over time\nI don't quite understand what that means I like to have that question is replace last taxes overtime\nAnd last but not least here's the important part and fill the coffers of a city trust fund that can be used for general government\nNow is really to me the important part of this whole thing in and of course there's there's other important parts but but when it's all said and done deals in in in in the money transferred\n\nThe the city\n\nThe the city will deposit some money in a city trust for\nNow what happens is that\nIn and this is the way the city tax cap\nWorks it's it's actually is it's not a taxi cab it's spending\nIt's kind of a monkey spending limit thing that has so many different little levers to it that you can basically spend whatever you want\nA [noise]\nAs you can only if you spend any money after this after these monies are deposited into this like dress for\nOh I could be wrong\nBut according to my historical understanding of this is that once that money has placed into that trust fund\nWhatever is taken out of that trust fun during let's say fiscal year Nineteen love if they did\nIn fiscal you're twenty you cannot tax the people\nOf Anchorage whatever amount you took out of that trust fund you cannot tax the people of Anchorage that much money so in essence\nYou have reduce the amount of money that you can take from people\n\nBecause that's the way the tax cap works\nYou take money out of savings out of the trust fund put it in the general fund for spending that limits your ability to tax up to the cap the next year because the money that you took out of the trust\nLowers that cap\nAnd gives you less money to tax\nNobody likes that ride was said no politicians they don't like that\nBecause now they're going to be whatever millions of dollars they took out they're going to be there that are not going to be able to tax that come to the following year\nSo that's why these drugs funds June to accumulate money and not giving back to you and I as consumers as rate payers\n\nThat that's been a problem for a long time we something needs to be changed and it's going to take somebody to collect enough signatures because the politicians are not going to do this on her own there's not going to limit their ability to tax\n\nThat wouldn't be um you know I just wouldn't be politician of um like him I find a couple of that yeah for that I'm for that but they know they don't have the votes to get anything done so I can say whatever they want us this is going to take a citizens'\nOr something to in order to\n[noise]\nIn in order to say hey wait a minute those proceeds because thinking it from this ... what I'm trying to get across is thinking of her from this way\nYou sell an asset that belongs to the family and so you pay off some debt\nYou get rid of some bills you pay the person who ever sold it for their commission blah blah whatever the you got some hard costs that are around you\nMaybe some you do want to put it in savings Bush shouldn't some of that being given to the rate payers as like a refund\nAs like a death and then from the sale\nYou know like this and you use citizens have been paying into this month's drop all this thing this this this this huge multi ... or ... minutes ... power you've been paying its bills for decades\nAnd were selling it\nWe're going to be right with the money we're going to do the proper things but hey some this some of these millions we're going to set aside and we're going to cut and in dividends and disperse it back to the rate payers\nAre I mean I don't look at it is as someone can help me five six Nineteen eighty what would happen in a corporation worm if the corporation was sold and then well how would the shareholders you know I Know it would differ but five six Nineteen eighty five six nine one zero eight zero\n... how how would that how would that happen in a private in a private setting\n... what it wouldn't it be reasonable that rate payers or shareholders would receive a dip it in because of the sale\n\nOr because of you know I don't I don't want to look at the cause of the sale because of the purchase a you know\nWouldn't that be would not be appropriate five six Nineteen eighty five six I I'd love to hear from somebody that that might know something about that\nBecause I did from from my experience is not uncommon that something like that what happened and I think that the people of all a Grinch who had been pain as customers with their melon pie\nShould receive some benefits from\nThat now now maybe somebody's got an art that's not your money well it's not well it was a minister blown and it got bought out for sun such amount of money and you're going to put some of this money in trust why wouldn't you\nWant to share why would it not be appropriate for angry dresses Anchorage rate payers to receive some sort of dividend that's my question five six Nineteen eighty five six nine one zero eight zero\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nChanged the law changed the charter the tax gap charter\nLet's do something to the to the 'cause people the citizens of Anchorage if if we have\nFrom from one thing we have a lot of trust because we have a lot of a fun balances and and throughout this budget in the state has them too and and if and if the only thing we're going to do is pocket hoard money in the in these balances\nThen um\nTo me that's not the right thing to do the mother there should be a an amount of money that the city needs in order to have a AAA bond rating I think that's where we want to be\nHave a AAA bond rating but once we will stab bullish that AAA bond rating once we are a financially solid city\nWith savings then and then the rest of it belongs back to the the rate payers the taxpayers the citizens of Anchorage there's no reason to hoard that money\nAnd if the only reason is is the horde that money is because that it\nTakes away your right your ability as an assembly to tax and mourn further you're in future years and something needs to be changed\n\nThat's my point and and and\nAnd and I I'm not up to date on how much is in these fund balances are these trust accounts and in each one of these departments have has the\n\nAnd the only thing I can do is I I can tell you about history and history has it\nIt was something going on I Can't remember what we were selling are doing but it came up\n\nAnd I've I've ... I've said this on air before to you and and it came up about the one guy got into the the the cash for the the a comprehensive comprehensive angel financial report the calf or C. F. C. A. F. R.\nAnd when you dig in through the calf or he he was one of the first people I ever heard talked about fun balances\nAnd he was there because the situation warranted the response and he had done his homework and looked it up and found that there were these ... and soon as we talked about says that starting to catch it on\n\nThe elected officials would have nothing to do with that they wanted nothing to do with fund bounces savings trust the jobs they were nothing to do with it\nAnd then we dug in deeper we find out why why why what's the big what's the big push back why is that\nAnd then we came to find out that okay if we give you five million if we get the citizens five million dollars a million dollars or whatever the deal was that that lowered our taxing ability in future\nYears another case in point that you may remember is when Rick my sister and left the office there was what he turned determine was extra money\nThese fund balances he referred to him as extra money we've over ... and he's right there was it's over taxation that's really what it is just because how do these different entities get\nMoney will they receive money from ... from taxation from utility rates from some sort of\nSomehow the government reaches into your pocket and take that money government ... typically doesn't ask for money it takes it\nTry not paying money and see what happens they they they take money and we allow them\nSo Mary my gym said hey\nThere's twenty million dollars\nIn one of these fund balances or something and he said\nThe citizens of Anchorage deserve a rebate a refund or a dip it in a a cash back a wreath or something along work because on the premise that\nIf you have too much money in your account and it came from rates or taxes than we oughta than we've over charge them right because government owned should only receive the amount of money that is required to do its job\nIn order to ... in order to provide the service\nThat we expect them to to to provide\n\nAnd then you have to have a certain amount of savings you as a certain amount of money for equipment and things like that and and all but after that\nThat's too much money for them to be holding onto\nThese the arguments that I Would like for you to to call your assembly person with\nThese are the arguments that I think our our our\nRelatives relevant I think that there are reasonable and and and\nYou and I need to be making these arguments to as this sale goes down that whatever's going to be put in his trust son\nThat a portion of that or all of that or some team should go back to the rate payers meaning you and I\n\nThat's a reasonable question that and and and let's hear from them to see why or why not see what they have to say it's one forty six it's still about forty
