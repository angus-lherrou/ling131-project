doing this long long time and I've known him for a long time and uh he he just uh [noise] their numbers are hard to argue with and and just to go through this\nAfter it's all said and done and you get your the weeds mark are the best bet if\nWalker and in baggage wanna when\nThey got to join up they got hooked up trailers to each other\nWell yes and we'll see if that happens to write but what's interesting to me is if you're playing this as a as an either or you know ... or the other kick it right or whatever it took it that may be\nIs other than done like the others right on this chicken or are are kind of wandering in the wilderness right now they they don't have a path forward and it doesn't inspire confidence\nIn the voting public so I think any type of scenario that they bring up is it smacks of desperation at this point you know and and I don't think desperation has something to get people elected\nThey had to have a shark clear concise Massey Jay this stuff is buying is bam we're moving and\nAnd what impresses me is done levy has been consistent he has his campaign plan and he's sticking to it and he's moving ahead he looks like the the stable candidate at this point and and\nYou know that's a that's a situation where running low on time or at the bottom of the hour but mark that the situation I have a chance to bring up with um I've been more was there's this thing called\nWhat do you call it I don't know this this I don't know percentage uncertain this uncertainty percentage about you\nKnow all the ... all the squabbling and all the ... all\nThe crap where does that go how does that affect the race you know to some degree but like I don't want to vote for either of them I'm not voting for that stuff I don't know what happened that deal\nYou know there's a lot of mixed emotions well and so how much of that dribbles out to eat and to you know we're talking now now three or four points race with everybody counts well\nAnd certainly on the left you know they love plans they love the maps they have things that thought out and it certainly than looking like their side doesn't it doesn't have\nOne and the consumers that power right now that momentum they they just conservatives center right voters Yvette\nEncouragement unfortunately encouragement from what's happened with them a lot gene\nWalker mulatto gene don't go into this uh done Lee they

other\nUh find media outlets have given me being treated uh uh with equal time in equal respect so as to be known that that there is a choice so any you in a few others are doing a great\nService so yeah so I'm right here so just do what our I went on\nWell heck we want to know Billie tone thinks about what's happening now I understand\nThe right thing for you to say right now do you know what I don't really care what's going on them other campaigns they're running their campaigns and I'm running mine and I'm going to stay away from the mud and and therefore I'm Still in the high road over here and all but that's not what I Want to hear [laughter] I Want to you and\nBilly telling things about what the hell's going on over there in the ...\nCampaign well and and I would like to know the only two how do you think that the reason the bats are going to affect your game that is true how how's it going affect you\nOkay the answer to both question All right I'm at the same time\nI Hope they miss each other up big time [laughter]\nDang it either [laughter] I thought you were going to surprise me with some [laughter]\nAh yeah well they're on a self employed version mission\nWell said ah I I think that's true I'm done leaving though is staying on in the lead he's distance themselves a\nHe has a disassociated himself in many ways a ... a to his to his benefit I'm from the rest of the pack what do you think about that\nBut I think about that yeah that is something is going on with that man\nNow now why do you say that because he doesn't show up at the debate she only shows up at some of the debates she doesn't\nWhat what what ... been around a long time tell us what you think you\nKnow something is going on with that man and I have to say that's the extent of it because\nWhatever is going there's something going on but I don't know what it is at this point\nBilly I Need something more than that [laughter] okay [laughter] tiny\nSomething more than something's going on well the letter\nOn I'm OK Now my my guess\nOkay um 'cause there's other possibilities but uh so I'm not absolutely positive it's because right now\nAnd tell I come out with my big game changer which is gonna come soon\nBut until then I Am not much of a of a threat it's ... it's like a thousand to one um but\nAnd then what he's looking at\nRunning in a Republican state with both a\n... with the Democrat ...\nVotes though the to the left to the Democrat vote split into\nPrimarily Republicans and smaller block of Democrat vote cut into it could be that he just believes that he's just some kind of a a shoe in and that doesn't have to do anything and might just damage themselves by having difficulties um\nA difficulties answering some\nOf these ... you know if you don't have to go around dog dirt\nYou know the best thing to do the void them and and right now ah ah the the Walker and baggage camp as well when called baggage but anyways Walker camps duty mess uh and and and and so\nYou had a question yeah belly I you know I Would like to know are certainly a Walker and baggage on that side of the spectrum is\n... you know this is a throne that whole that whole side into chaos is I was wondering how many of those votes you you think will be in play for you\n[noise] um oh yeah that's been blowing around in\nMy head I've been definitely I'm I'm thinking about that ah\nIt's really hard to say but\nGonna do nothing but I think benefit me so you combine the implosion along with the big a game changer that's going to be coming out soon\nAnd um so what what are you going to do what's going to be your big big big game changer man tell us\nMy one big thing yeah\nAnd my ... we want we want an exclusively here with mark fish former chairman of the Libertarian Party and in a ... and myself and so we want to hear we want you to break it here exclusively\nOkay if you're ready for my big saying okay well let's break it right now [noise] um [noise]\nI have well many of hurt my pledge but in a nutshell let me concise it down most of the state's finances over thirty three years have been diverted off budget\nThere's money that was historically destined for the general fund that has been diverted off budget at one time there was only like\nAnd we'll find that it's been diverted off budget at one time there was only like maybe for legitimate off budgets public employee retirement a permanent bond supposed to be off budget\nNow it's past fifty fifty cash pools and it's in a comprehensive annual financial report in the tens of billions yeah oh yeah so the budget is actually a meaningless pencil line around at twenty five percent corner everybody else\nIs hyper analyzing inside that invalid corner now the a\nCalf or the ... branch of annual financial reports right\nEver since Tony Knowles it got an they'd been increasingly difficult to read okay the figures are all their but even my baggage admitted he tried reading the uh uh the budget part in the corner\nI agree it it's a mess it our\nMess that's in a nutshell but I have a great team working and just like when Mark Begich said if it could just read straight across here's here's revenues here some totals the whole thing\nIs going to be an all online\nAnd then everybody is going to see the Scrooge job of proportions but it's been perpetrated on the Alaskan people over the thirty three years they will see total assets of the state of eighty two billion while everybody's arguing about it\nYou know Eighteen billion dollar assets there's a the revenues\nUh they're coming in off budget into these cash walls and then the auditors own words\nNot even allowed to audit these off budget entities so when people see the real figures and they get their heads pulled out of his body yeah budget\nEasy to read so there'll be a breakdown in a few there'll be maybe four or five easy read figures All right and then a breakdown that everybody can read I'm going to be hard and then they're going to be aware of the Scrooge job\nI and I need you to hold up for a second I gotta take a break I got to pay some bills brother and then and then I'm a I'm going to keep you on hold stay right there don't go anywhere area keep going home we come back\nI Want to talk to you about because you brought up something that I'm ... around and that is is that the governor took the David and when he took the death of an infant people he did not put it in the general fund for dinner and he put it in the earnings reserve accounts\nAnd my question is do if you put it in earnings reserve account and he didn't use it for general spinning than what did you need the budget the money for I I don't get that somebody needs to answer that question hopefully you can help us out\nWe'll be

course it's been repeated you've heard it more than once I'm sure that is is uh\nBrian ... a lot the lieutenant governor has said something to some woman that she didn't like very much and so she a\nGovernor got word of it and told the government lieutenant governor go take a hike a and so can we\nUh we have to also say that the lieutenant governor agreed agreed because he he did resign he did not fire\n'cause I don't know the governor I don't think the governor can constitutionally fire the lieutenant governor I think the lieutenant governor has to be removed from\nThe legislature I'm not sure whether resignation or impeachment or the yeah ... yeah and and I believe in anyways Walker or malign knew the writing was on the wall like next man he said okay okay okay okay you know when when ... when do I get on the plane and leave [laughter]\nSo he's he's out of that history that's behind is\nThe question is is where do we go from here we've looked through all the scenarios we are both ... I've been more on the day we've had a job\nA a a which was I shoot which are going to the drawing Billy Joel and on a wall\nSo going to have met Hickman on coming up your ... and uh so we've kicked this thing around a lot and actually I'm I've been more on Alaska's Premera pollsters he he he laid out a lot of different scenarios and and you had to listen to him and and and all made sense but when it got\nDown to the final scenario and you're not just thinking about it\nAnalytically it it it it well anecdotally it and you look at the math\nWhen you really look at the science of it it tells you the best thing that can happen [noise] if if Walker and baggage you want to stay alive and maybe win and that is they gotta joined together\nThey got to join up they got to become governor lieutenant governor and one of them has to why don't we got to be lieutenant governor they can't both be governor and that's going to take a lot of face a and a lot of ego I even think then it's a stretch\nIt stretch yeah they couldn't agree to it before that's for sure because there was a series ... while that went down and and they they they could not agree nobody's gonna you know nobody nobody's going to stick\nTheir head you know another problem is all those media buys by this time all those ads right are are are already scheduled in locked in they are you know there are there would be hard to reallocate resources and shifting around to re message at this point the messages\nIs pretty much established\nA for for paid media\nAnd and you know done levy and rightfully so you can't blame the guy if I leave me oh you know [laughter] you\nKnow swimming pool during black strokes man [laughter]\n[laughter] you know swimming pool doing strokes man looking for my guys [laughter] back and drinking\nDays well I don't think anybody can take a campaign for granted or my experience has been twenty town with a well known as primary Sheldon you there\nBut uh but but certainly a you carry a gun like would you care to comment on this mess and I really do I have to [laughter] just like oh I'll just let a lie there and [laughter] yeah\n... I I think that doesn't leave his best I call\nI've I've tried to get in for an interview and and um and I've had him on once before but I wanted to get him on again I have a young man the best you know best thing don't leave it you can do right now is just shut up they'll say anything just just take to hire a beat a statesman\nUh as long as he stays in ... in the state remains on the island I think he's in pretty good yeah yeah\nYeah yeah I mean\nWhat other advice can you give the man I'm you know come out and say hey it's disappointing that we've seen these other raises crumble ended his ah unfortunate but you know our our our attention is is is focused on the state of Alaska and the people and the permit from Devon in and blah blah blah\n[noise] well I I also am encouraged a belly toy and the libertarian candidate you could pick up a couple of percentage points out of this a Walker baggage debacle\nAnd certainly he's not going to kill off any more of a done ... votes that he has but he can't pick up from those people that uncertain about walking begging to a few points enough to keep the libertarians having ballot access for the next several years and where does important to get a libertarian candidates elected it is\nAnd one of the reasons why third party candidates do run is to get enough percentage of vote on the ballot to stay active so that your name yeah you ...\nWe need the libertarians need to read for three percent of the vote three percent in the top of the ticket of that election or ordered to Maine that bat ballot access without having to go and register new voters to vote against those three percent\nWell I I Hope it gets it I I think you will um I I think you're right some of this is going to filter down and him who knows for sure but um we'll be hearing from a ... a mad Hickman here coming up here after the bottom of the hour\nOr you know and we've concluded that I I think at least for the discussions that we've had mark is that the the only way the only path forward\nFor mark and for ... um shoot I'm getting her Walker for baggage and Walker\nIs for them to join up so we'll see if that happens that is the big question um I I've had messages is in both of them and I I I'm not you know I I'm not important enough for I'm not first on their ah call back lists are okay so nobody's giving me any information I'm sure\nI'm sure they're still trying to figure it out that I I don't think they figured it out either to be honest with you I it it just seems like the entire media is in total in and this is folks you you got to\nPlease take it he is in you know this is not good news is is not good news for Alaska politics but this is an earthquake this is the seismic earthquake this\nIs on a political scale you know this is like an eight this is a nine kind of like\nI haven't seen some something like this since the John Linda our campaign ... yeah yeah\nYeah yeah\nAnd Linda ours didn't blow up because what what was his story on that I forget his blew up because one of his running mates quit\nWell it was it was it was ... you know from my understanding and recollection of the time it was after the primary got the the nomination and then it was discovered that he had ties to unsavory theaters in Chicago\nYeah yeah and that's not as bad as sane [laughter] inappropriate died too young lady from ... and we don't\nKnow what we don't know what we do not know lemme repeat we do not know exactly what was said from Brian them a lot to this lady\nYoung lady older lady we don't know that that that part right there so I Want to make it clear I don't want to end for anything but we do know that he said something inappropriate\nIt it is in a room or hasn't rumor\nHas it there's a song has something to do with Pocahontas so\nAh it appears made Bryan lot went up and Elizabeth Warren's in the news right now I'm Pocahontas was in the news you know the president but our drop and all that\nAnd and I guess Byron has a habit\nIt's he's known to have some pretty sometimes off color jokes\nAnd I I'm not\nWanting to complain about anybody okay I I I I don't I don't run anybody else down because I I'm In no position to to you know\nWhile I think we've all left a joke for that when you were in a ... right right right\nRight [laughter] and I'm sure I've made a few inappropriate show so so ah you know I I don't\nCriticize anybody hey he said it to the wrong person I don't know the sister situation but obviously didn't work I'm it failed and if there's something more to it we will find out sooner or later\nIn this environment comedies tough really\nOh yeah yeah you know you know and and I don't know you know who was and all this kinda stuff but uh we are we're hoping that uh we're going to hear something real soon I Would\nThink I did did we get an answer on whether or not how soon I've been more thought this decision needed to happen I only got about\nThirty five weekends he said by the week yet by the week after what he said yes so uh so we've got a in person voting start of it and when they yeah in person voting starts Monday so we got three or four days they figure this deal out and um\n[noise] but you know what\nYou got the best thing it's all the it's confusing it's chaos for or or stability or chaos stability or chaos and people are gonna pick stability we'll be right back\nNow I Know there's no one's going to write any articles about me because everybody's ... writing articles about a dozen levy or or walk or andme a lot or somebody else\nWhy go dig it up new story right you know hanging fruit you have any a journalist or lazy okay they're lazy people and uh they ... you go give him a story and do all the research forum put all the ads in there\nIn the ... I mean look at the ... I mean\nYou know believe me look at the fire or if that was issued on a on the Trump campaign\nAnd and I I Would encourage people to to think about this too is that the governor and lieutenant governor only two people in this in in the entire government that makes policy there's been sixty other folks and a lot of ... those are up for reelection yeah they are and they're going to be establishing policy too so\nI don't forget to look carefully at at the other folks down the ticket that you're that you're a voting for yeah that that's\nA good point Marc speaking with Marc Fisher who's our house candidate out there and I'm\nOut in the valley or is it stopped eating area in a ... a marked fishes won the endorsement of of you former U.S Senate candidate Joe Miller talked about how march great person and a personal experience and\nPerson that has been a great personal experience I'm running for office a how he's always stood up for our liberties or he's absolutely committed to a free and prosperous Alaska\n... I mean from the gym or I'm Sorry Joe Miller just gives you all kinds of ... I Know you worked hard for him during the Joe Miller for a year in a campaign you were there with him and ensure with you know\nAnd you know and and we work hard together but you guys ...\nIt it's not just from work and it's not a failure for word for it is because he believes and yes he he knows who were where your Bones Are\nCertainly and and there's another endorsement on there that that I I I think highly of to is\nIt shows that you know jump green yeah Second Amendment task yes yes and and what really sticks in my craw and it's not only for me but other libertarian candidates running as libertarians are very pro Second Amendment yes\nUh I mean the absolute is when it comes to the second amendment yet the n._r._a.\nDidn't even see fit to send us a questionnaire\nSo we could even compete for ratings really ... and\nWhen they're weird things not in our area and when their endorsements came out they didn't even bother to list the libertarian candidates at all not even with the question is that an Alaskan issue or is that it is that a national issue\nOr have you have you ... well I'm not I'm not sure there's much of a different ... we had any ... any any any some ask them any used to be the uh the\nChairman state chairman in our I forget what his last name was only ... only reason I Know is that he ... he used to work for a ... and the legislature um and and it used to run the in Ari I don't know who runs in our area up here now you\nKnow I I don't even know if they had a state leader or what the deal is\nOr frankly you know that is one of the reasons that we went with a and helped organize that the second amendment task forces but yeah we felt that there was not enough local action taken in defense\nOf of gun rights well Chuck greens been uh he he's he's been a part of this for forever forever who's ... founder basically running and uh I Know you've been a part of a\nYes he he asked me to empty the first meeting they had down there and two thousand and eight at a Martian theater Oh nice and I think I was there I really do I think I ... and you know uh\nWhen I was in Anchorage in in close to those four yes uh I attended um most of their meetings and worked on strategy but\nIt was always a network that is more strong on gun rights and they're you know it's important we were so strong on gun rights that it actually he got a ... a very much scrutiny by law enforcement and of course\nUh most of us whether that quite well we all were were up\nStand your ground law abiding citizens who had nothing to hide and you know yeah yeah I remember that dust up I remember that dust that they were trying to make\nYou guys are your people trying to make you guys look like you were some sort of wild character is out here are going to start shooting up the town and taken over to federal building in this\nArea there are a lot of the there are certain populations of people with rice and actually carrying them at ... yeah that's scaring them you know frankly I was probably responsible for that dust up in the Joe Miller's parade\nOver there a calling in some of the second amendment march with all that was funny\nHow you guys odds are guns on your margin of trade and you're strapped you got your a are strapped\nOver his shoulders and said well it was funny that was cool and it freaks people out but it did but I find that at the ... in the context of the times to it got by the way I got Joe Miller his\nFirst national interview but just to several weeks before that we marched down town Anchorage in support of gun rights as a\nHeart address or something or on the parks yes something we did and you remember the applause of the crowd and turned the corner people were very very supportive of\nThat yeah yeah but I Will get it so it it it it's funny how it turns but I what gets me yet as after all of that risk that we can talk and all that scrutiny and everything the n._r._a. won't even bother to ask us where we where we stood on guns\nI I I truly hasn't been that precedent Ari I Know they're the largest blah blah blah blah blah blah and they control all the political strength and everything but but I I I I don't know I I've been always been with him I think gun rights of a lot of gun rights for America I think that\nThat group there is a often it's a smaller group but I I think they're more here to gun rights and sure supporter of gun rights gun rights or for America so\nAnyways All right we've got to take a break last segment coming up one forty six we'll be right back [noise]\n\nRobert build up your story ...
