are many areas along our southern border whether it's California whether it's Arizona whether it's New Mexico whether it's Texas\nThere are many areas that do need fortifications\nAnd some of these wall prototypes or the hybrid of taking to different ideas from some of the prototypes I supported I support the building of a a more fortified impenetrable wall in multiple areas along our border I'm fully on board with that\nUh but as far as sending the military\nOr if there wasn't a threat of war or a you know other threats against the United states I I can see where a military could be used in

favorite airline because of my uh my flight status so on United were crammed backing coach we might have been like\nTwo rose from the from the back a bull headed bathroom and the flight attendant just goes nuts on my wife nuts over nuts\nAnd she peanut allergy I Love my God you're going to\nAnd we're like wait a minute these these are not peanuts are these are these are almonds uh my wife had a mark coda ... if you haven't had Marco to comments from Spain the best and they they lightly fry\nThem are ... it's much different than an American um and I was I I like American almonds I eat raw almonds all the time I support California almond growers but mark ... is a whole different flavor their lightly fried and olive oil and lightly salted and they are good\nIf you haven't tried marketing so analysts why these are not peanuts these America and\nThen uh I mean it was bizarre I she ended up apologizing to us and it was just a weird weird situation with this flight attendant but it just seems these allergies and the sensitivity and you know try to restructure the planet with somebody and it seems like it just happened to know where\nIt's kinda like you know the R word you know and I was I've never found that acceptable to ever make fun of anybody that is mentally challenged by you know calling them retarded or return\nThat always incense me and I I it it you know in my childhood I Would come to the defense of kids that would get teased or had a mental challenges so you know it's I'm not a bully and I've defended but\nLike with the R word organizations were cold you know I'm selling so organization for retarded citizens there was one in in ... County Florida\nOr the Pinellas Center for retarded park P. A. R. K. and the R. R. P. A. R. C. for citizens are seeing those County Florida the art was for retarded citizens\nAnd I I was listening to some old radio shows and there was some PSA is talking about uh you know for the mentally retarded and then suddenly you know back I don't know Fifteen Years ago\nThere was this whole movement that if you order the word retarded that you were the most evil person on the planet\nOr you know just these\nThese causes and and I would never want to use that are hurtful fashion that's the way they they they position that was the oh even using that word\nIs hurtful but yet organizations and groups you know using that word\nThat we're there to help these individuals' anyway so he'll pumpkins folks are means that no food allergies 'cause there's no food being being given out\n[noise] uh this year we've given got bad knees or meatloaf which I think will be a nice little twist a also a couple of Halloween stories here\nAMC movie theaters or they're saying that they're not going to allow any masks\nFor Halloween all the bars on this new Halloween remake\nWhich are Jamie Lee Curtis is actually giving him his old Mike Myers deal on the buses are enormous and this could be a monster an opening for Halloween or for the new movie but the AMC Theatres are saying uh yeah no no no Halloween masks and I know\nA lot of Michael Meyers or\nWhatever he wore none of that\nUh and then on her and I'll get to the kangaroo story grab your phone calls have you on hold hang on a this is another\nHalloween story and I'm you know this is unfortunate that anyone took it this way but wasn't intended this way the stories that uh Houston I saw this side of the Houston Chronicle\nThat the Houston museum of natural science has had to apologize because they sent out an event email with what people said was a questionable subject line\nSo this is what happened\nThey issued an apology they sent out there by weekly email distribution and\n\nWhen those that were on a mailing list got the email from the Houston science and technology news or Houston museum of natural science the email from the museum had the subject line\nParty with spokes S P O O K s that's what I think his spokes folks I I think it goes from goblins that's that's a sport but in a spoke as a ghost but others thought\nIt was in sensitive that it was a derogatory term uh for black Americans and uh I was so I don't see it that way I Would I don't think that way I just think of ghosts and spirits but the president of the museum told the Houston Chronicle that\nAh it's a tie your annual Halloween party which we've been doing for ten years the word was meant to be a rift on the word spooky\nA Halloween party which we've been doing for ten years the word was meant to be a rift on the words spooky\nThat was the intention I Believe that but again you know we're in a in a world here were seems everyone wants to find the worst possible explanation and I just don't think that's the case a kangaroo story who boy\n[noise] Potter Nebraska the school district has fired their cook\nBecause he served chili with kangaroo meat to kids and the cook who makes kangaroo leading to the chili that he made for students at a Nebraska Panhandle school is out of a job part of the school superintendent Mike Williams said Thursday the junior senior high school had cook\nIn Potter Kevin fry\nIs no longer employed now you said in a letter earlier this week the parents to fry told him that he augmented the chilies beef on October tenth with kangaroo me because it's lean and nutritious\nAnd he is right and it is also delicious I've had kangaroo I think I've also had\nWaller rule as well or Waller wall or be a when I was in Australia I I had kangaroo I capital I had some weird stuff we went to some we went to a Mongolian barbecue place in Darwin bingo eight buy me\nA and then there was all kinds of meat on that thing and I I ate I had kangaroo there than it was absolutely delicious\nA Williams says he didn't think the kangaroo meat was unhealthy dangerous it's not it is healthy and uh it's readily available in Australia I just I didn't I didn't know the kangaroo meat was was available and Potter Nebraska anyway they apologized\nAnd are they hoping that didn't cause any mental anguish or this or that and if it's not going to re occur uh\nAnd he said that if a family wants to eat exotic foods they can do so on their own time not at school\nSo I ...\nI don't know if I Would have fired the guy over kangaroo me a couple of quick easy or will last squeeze in some calls as well so a stand by\nA ... or will also have to do here oh yeah I got a couple of things are going to do here so I gotta I gotta do this quickly of the commercial out of Arkansas\nAnd ah this commercial is to support Republicans but it's a inflaming the uh the Republican Party in Arkansas or listen to this this is radio adage running in Arkansas it supports congressman French Hill\nAnd it's targeted toward\nA African Americans in this district in Arkansas and this is the ads that\nCan think about what's happening in Washington\nCongress may bring two and a Republican you know but that's dangerous to change the presumption of innocence to a presumption of guilt especially for black me if the Democrats could do that to a white justice of the Supreme Court with no evidence no cooperation and witnesses including her best friend said\nWhen a white girl lives on them now why Democrats", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Anchorage", "day": "21"}
