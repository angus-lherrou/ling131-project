to back up his threat with any bomb making expertise the lawyer went on to describe ...\nOr as a confused men who had trouble controlling his emotions\nSo I mean everything else near you can probably\nUm put in your imagination cap and and and you probably mostly right ah\nBut it it it does it does bring us to a broader issue and that is about this this is talk and and the talk has got a\nCool ... I\nI'm not one to criticize people for what they say generally 'cause I I say things I'm On the radio it's my job as we get paid to do I get paid\nTo to to um you know express my ...\nPaid to do I get paid to to um you know express my views and but uh\nWhen you when you watch some of these these politicians in in in you know I Know Democrats are going to say you Republicans do Republicans and Democrats\nBut but if you look back over the last few years\nAnd and and I don't have a list in front of me to count them and and it really I guess doesn't matter that the Democrats are far more or they violated thing far far more often than Republicans do\nI'm ...\nBut you're going to give the argument let it go both ways you're talking like you know in general I guess yeah I Know now these are extreme cases if people bringing food to violent means with\nBombs weapons going that's crazy you know the the thought that you know that it is just not acceptable behavior was above even said that\nWell exactly exactly anybody doing anything violence during an acceptable but when you get Maxine Waters and in in Nancy Pelosi and in\nIn in the former attorney general and saying you know we're going to kick 'em and and we're ... you know get out there and getting her face when you see 'em on the street you confront them um it all these you know police he got shot\nA few years ago the uh the congressman or out on the ball field\nIs eat these things or or was it Rand Paul got beat up his own yard or you you know these are Republicans ... and so what I'm trying to say is that\nThe talk is what you know\nSome of these politicians are doing some of these political leaders are doing\nBut when it happens is is that the you know\nMaybe they're fairly level headed but when it gets to win that dribbles down to these\nCrazy people you got crazy a crazy Joe ... crazy Joe takes that well hey we're going to confront and when he years we're going to confront them and and we're not gonna go high we're just going to kick them um you know getting her face all these things\nThey take it to the extreme because see their cuckoo so they're gonna take it to that higher stream\n... and\nI think this guy here he sees these people beating the crap out of out of Trump and so what does he do he he takes it well you all want to say what you want to say oh I'll get back at you and I'm not justifying that I'm not I'm not saying that's okay because it's not\nDon't anybody confused what I'm saying I'm not saying that's OK I'm explaining in my opinion what I think it's happening some guy like me for instance I may be like you\nYou hear this constant bash drawn bash Trump bass drum bass drum and sometimes you get the feeling like dang maximum needs a smack that person in the mouth and make them shut up or something\nNot just the far right\nIn ... would do and do something like that you'd never get anybody to do something like that\nBut one political leaders say those things\nOn national TV it gets down the somebody like say a year and he goes yeah yeah I I agree let let let me go out and do something I Know at all do our mail a bunch of packages that are I'm\nSupposed to be bombs in you know all cause hysteria it\nThe words no matter what side you're on they trickled down in the crazy\nPeople act that's the problem is that the you know\nThe more sane people they're just gonna okay wouldn't let it roll over the you know roll off their back anyway we'll be right back\n[noise]\n\nThey go on and on about it where you and I we may\nGet a little frustrated we wish we could answer back or something a lot of people do that on Facebook talk radio five six nine ten aid you can do it right here\nBut some people will hear things and cause them to say hey I've heard enough out of these people bashing the man I voted for it so what do they do they react\nI'm not saying it's right\nI'm just saying that's what happens because\nRight\nI'm just saying that's what happens because\nLook human beings are just that they're human beings certain human beings are easily upset and there's different degrees of that right then you get someone who is a little off the rocker\nAnd and they have a some mental health issues let's call it they hear some things and they don't just get mad with\nThemselves they go out and say I'd heard enough and I'm going to do something about it\nAnd that so that it it it it's that type of of I think what we've been hearing constantly about Trump is what caused this guy to do this doesn't make any excuse I'm not making excuses for the guy\nHe needs to be punished to ... percent of all let's make that clear five six nine ten eight if you've got an opinion on what do you do we need to punish the guy the full extent of the law but we can also understand what happened and what happens in these situations\nNano psychiatrist I live in a\n... interview this man I Know nothing about this guy\nOther than what I read right here\nAnd I consider my eyes by reading reports about him\nThat he liked trouble lot he liked the American flag he was a Republican I'm sure it's probably pretty conservative guy I'm\nAnd\nI'm sure you just upset about the things are being said about Trump and that's\nWhy they are too easily able to have somebody other conservatives run a male her last show\n[laughter] I don't know if I don't know I got a question some of them serving the value of a man you got it got to make a living or are they got to make out of\nThere but [laughter] not saying I'm just saying you know what I mean I Know that's a good point good point\nHey everybody got to make a living he he looks a little weird he ... he ... he just wanted to injure\nA\nBallard Broward County sheriff of leaders you mean is ...

language like that is just disagreement\nLike maybe you say hey I I disagree with the homosexual lifestyle\nI don't think the homosexual lifestyle the healthy lifestyle and you can be talking about that and doing that and and give out reasons and the amount of aids and how aids is transferred the percentage of aids is as transmitted from in the homosexual community and and blah blah versus the the uh\nThe\nHeterosexual community and so you can do it's not about that hate speech can be derived in many different ways\n\nAnd it's about and so I uh I\nI'm not interested in making laws that control people's speech I'm interested in people ... you know what what is the Supreme Court justices you how do you improve free speech more free speech\nNow do you do you go out and inciting violence that's probably not a good idea you know\nThat's what free speech is about is giving you the liberty to make decisions like hey I'm a politician my name's Maxine Waters mining Hillary Clinton\nOn the former attorney general Eric Holder should I say these types of things that on national television as as somebody in the stature to the national audience\n\nYou can because it's within your rights under the first amendment doesn't make it right probably not\n\nBut when it comes to us conservatives it they're all over us\nAnything that we disagree with that may be\nTied to to to to a a left this idea to socialism to liberalism\nJust being opposed to that in general [laughter] some people call that that's hate speech\n\nI encourage people to to to be boastful beep beep oh that's a word not to to to to\nTo be strong in in what you sneaking into and say what you for you there's appropriate places to see things in there is not appropriate but don't be\n\nDon't be pushed by political correctness to where you can't speak your mind you can't say what you feel you can are articulate a grounded thought just because somebody else may not like it\nBecause you don't want the people who who are controlling speech\nIs the last\n... they're ... they're the ones that seemed to be tolerant where's the tolerance from the left where are where is it\nI mean winter burning down buildings in burning up some guys limousine and\nAnd and destroying property in and blocking traffic after Trump won and all the riots that took place in the damage in the fire and and and the chaos that goes on because they don't get what they want they burn down their city\n\nWhere's the tolerance wears a tolerance because if if if if I don't believe in homosexuality to say\nI think homosexuality is not a healthy lifestyle I don't care I don't personally care with other people do doesn't bother me whatever you want to do that up you you're not hurting me that's your business right\nBut\nBut then again if I split if I fundamentally speak that I'm opposed to it\nThen I'm a bad guy I have to be like\nA lot of people say I don't I don't understand how you say some of the things you say on radio and I mean they agree with it there's nothing really wrong with it they just they that there there are so scared of same things because of the political correctness these days\nDon't be don't be me articulate no would\nYou want to say you don't have to be rude and and and say the things that need to be said or that you believe are\nRight don't let this other side control you oh I Can't say that you know 'cause ah you know the people at work you know\nBill ... them I just think this has to do you have to do is\nNo that that's my like someone says hey I think that sounds racist or be like but I'm not racist or the other students like I'm not racist\nBut not necessarily believe a negative is hard to hard not to prove like like you know hey a a I don't beat my wife\nYou know how to how how do you prove that I mean\nYou know what I mean I don't I don't think one of those things though that you see I'm seeing the choir you'll get in\nConcerned about proven that I mean that's what I Would just ...\nOh I well I'm not boom\nWas don't have to prove ... calls me raise that I'm not racist I've got a ... that I made ... years ago because they called me a racist or big it home for a\nWhite something and I think all of that other you know I put it all on a T shirt I thought it really is funny but the but I made it into a a A R chasm because you know what I wanted to do I wanted to point out because I disagreed with a rally an ordinance\nThat game homosexuals or a certain class in the city and it's now been passed\nAnd that was an a or an assembly ordered so I was speaking of opposed to it\nI was articulating my opposition to that\nBut what did they so what did they call me a racist or homophobic or I don't know ... whatever word you can come up with derogatory they were calling that that's not right I should have a I should have\nThe ability to voice my concern is that's not being tolerant they're the ones that says are so tolerant walk them they're not tolerant of my views\nAre I don't know any ... I guess I don't know if that's what they think that what you're just bothered by what they think I'm just saying there'll be bothered by what they've thing on mother by going to say family I'm\nBothered by the hypocrisy in what they say and what they do that we'll be right back here on the ... show [noise]\nYour actions proven you burn things up\nYou you you you\n[laughter] whatever it the list is too long the to to to go it's just you know you\n... people's property you know you beat people up you shoot people you kill people you you you are looking at the damage that you did to the uh Wisconsin Capitol\nThere was over a million dollars in a during the ... the Governor Scott there in his are firing of the union and all that and the number is in a place and burgers and then\nAnd then what was it in Oregon as well but\nI ... it's too many I Can't really let me read can really go says ah you're right any political correctness was designed to control the masses instill fear in individuals having an opinion\nSo they follow along and don't share their opinions and that's what it's about it's a form of control it's a form of control it's not it has nothing to do somebody a shuttering and law here\nFear is what what controls everybody all the time were always you know oh it and ultimately if you let your fears control you that's when that's when you lose power you know if you let your column you lose your independents if you let your confidence\nYou know and your self control you and stuff than if\nYou will be there but here is is that once you have to fear you know they should they be able to\nPut something on Facebook or or or or say things in a public at you know in a public forum\nAnd and and not be you know almost go to jail over you know or or or or lose their job over it or you know just because you weren't sense of humor incentives and say I don't mean\nThat you know if we talk about it on like the massive scale with celebrities like yeah Roseanne you know there's there's much more implication there with huge stuff but you know a little people here you know I mean you certainly don't want your\nUPS job or whatever you may have to be affected by a couple of opinions you had on your private Facebook\nYeah well you know ... to ...

King George yeah still seeing George said hey listen I've done um I'm going to the other side because King George wood ... own property\nWell in in in in the in the government owned property new wouldn't allow private property rights and and and watch just said okay that's it I'm done I'm joined in the ocean\nAnd the reason the reason for a reason for that is is a\nSeat in America this is this is one thing we're a historical context comes in you know a\n... in in the old system the only one that had any right we're we're the land here and okay and they got there you know they've got their charter from the gang and and then had control of all this land and then there were people that came with the land they called it serves\nA and and now a passport New Year's to America um you know if you can say well I'm the only people that make the decisions are land holders but now in America that America\nEverybody can be a land ... that's right it's the power because I think you would
