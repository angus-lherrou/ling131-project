[noise]\nAnd and I don't know what this person understands about Second Amendment or not but that right there folks\nThat right there you and I know that that's the heart of the constitution that's the heart of the meaning of the second amendment\n\nIt's just a powerful thing\nTack yourself and things like this you never know\nSelf and things like this you never know\nIt's a good thing that you're allowed to carry screwed up and said and it's a good thing you're allowed to protect yourself and things like this you never know\nThat that\nIs the meaning the depth of the you know or the second amendment to the United States Constitution\nThat right there\nAnd there's even ... and you know because the second amendment was never never adopted\nFor hunting that had nothing to do it\nIt was to protect yourself from mature radical government that's what\nThey felt they fought a war\nAnd they knew they as citizens now's the time the mosquitoes was rock and roll and they didn't know all these other weapons are coming up\n\nDressed me government got all the guns and mad [laughter]\nThey're not going to have you know because of the matter\n[laughter] that this wouldn't be right\nSo that they are control of the situation and\nUh but that is\nThe the Second Amendment is there to protect yourself it's there to defend yourself ... to protect your own life others' lives property\nOr ... and of course like I said the major things is against a tyrannical\nGovernment um if people don't think that that could ever happen here I think people tend to believe\nMostly that we live in the United states were different you know we we don't have all this third world you know Venezuela Gadhafi you all these people we don't have those\nYou know\nIt's interesting that people think that this somehow this little did we are going on here is going to continue to last\n... and history says it doesn't\nKnow I Can't predict the future but then again I Can't argue with history and history says it does\nEverything repeats itself you know that that's that's the rule everything does repeat itself history repeats itself\nAnd we've seen you know just ... and\nNot necessarily in my lifetime but\nYou know in the forties we had it or I mean we've had Mussolini we've had stall and we've had I mean that's not that long ago that's not that long ago and the move is on the way\n\nThe move is is there the powerful countries of the world that oppose us are are are\nAre there they're not land sleep and the second amendment is is a is our only weigh in yeah it's a chance the way today with the modern technology that people have specials government\nBut\nI I appreciate miss describing for saying that about the second amendment about gun goes that gun was important him the rich people they they have bodyguards is if in in the police will they have guns\nThe bad guys they have guns so let me see the rich the police\nBad the evil\nThey all have guns and then there's over there you and I\nYou know there are people don't want us not to have got not to be able to defend ourselves even though they got a body guards standing right next to them with a forum where the ... caliber\nRight maybe two [laughter]\nAnd and so they get their protection but they don't want us to have ours the differences is we can't afford an eighty thousand dollars a year bodyguard that's that that that stays with us and rolls ... and all of this they can\n\nBut they think we shouldn't be able to defend ourselves that's you know leave his comment that that's a I I I'm Sorry John a guy going on a

down hard yeah [noise]\nYou know I was talking about the second amendment earlier and ... and how important it is that people know that the second amendment was never ever design a it was the second amendment was never put in place to protect\nIt was the second amendment was never put in place to protect me from you or you for me it was always\nIt was there to protect us from government\nNow the people in the left I don't know why you guys think this is crazy but you do\nYou love distinctive batch crazy you guys need that that\nThat that a government could become tyrannical ... a government ... or a republic\nSuch as the United states could become tyrannical ... they're like it's it's not possible\nIn and you know the old ...\nSociety generally only last about a couple hundred years\nThat's all the last\nCouple of hundred democracies especially democracy is only a journey last a couple of hundred years\nAnd then they're done and\nShow I mean the United states has a republic but it's still a it could fall into that democracy you know sort of a atmosphere and that's because people are slow off the soft second\nAmendment but people started to vote for their large as people start to vote they start to figure out hey a Bible for this person this is better for me\nThis is better for my life this makes me more money it it may not be good for the country but it's good but it's good for you personally\nAnd and that's that's the beginning of the en\nMasse when people are are at a point where now their\nPersonal ... their personal beliefs their personal greed is over ...\n... ... it it\nIt's no longer what's good for the country it's what's good\nFor me and and that doesn't last ... each society that's done that and then they started electing people who bring them the largest right been there then that's the beginning of the end\nYou know when when like to take and what you just said when I hear people say you know we need to run this country like a business and stuff and like that's kinda scary because businesses\nCare about the bottom line more than they care about anything else if anything we should try to run our country more like a family because you care about people in your family you know what I mean you care about if you had\nA business only puts like we joked about handicapped spots of business only puts up there because we make them do that but if your family member was disabled you do everything you could to help out your disabled family member\nYou know so sometimes you know sometimes what greater for everybody in your family isn't as great for you the person in their ... you know that's kind of mirroring what what you're saying you know sometimes if you're thinking about everyone you you have to sacrifice certain things about yourself\nLike you know hey this is similar to what I hear you say about Ted Stevens\nYou know he brought a lot of pork back to Alaska you know\n... and what did that do overall do the ... century ... is a it was may be great\nFor Alaska no question about that but what do they do overall for the whole\nFamily does that say you know what I mean\nYeah and and I understand your argument your arguments right and\nThere are you know um sometimes I get a little weird around ... calling society family you know but but that's\nAll right I mean just not fair to just the way to think about caring about it like trying to just say what you were saying among the right way right right maybe it's not in your family you're not ever just\nOh it's all about me when I hear about other people\nToo I mean the jewels should have a right the individual's Rights Project you know we don't have to do that necessarily for the collective I think that's a big difference between the United states and western Europeans the socialist countries is that\nIs that the human rights\nAre are rooted in the individual not\nThe collective and so I'm ... and but those rights can't conflict either those rides can't\nJust because you're an individual doesn't mean you get the interrupt the rights of the majority or others are and I and I being laws we keep that in context that that\nThat's fair that's something that people I think and believe in\nUm\nDo you have any more to add that grass\nNo I think you know we're we're pretty much say in the same thing sometimes you have to you know I mean it is easier to go like hey that's the best for me you know that's usually the easiest thing maybe like looking out for yourself but sometimes that's not the best for for our democracy our republic like you're saying\nYeah it I'm I'm agreeing with you yeah you you have to you have to be able to to stand yes but what do the individual's rights is important\nAs well but then you know to work the your individual rights are different than you just like\nIt's all about me you know what I mean like that's not what I'm Talking about I don't know what you're talking about either absolute you\nKnow you're the individual rights as important\nLike they decided in the Heller case in the second amendment that the individual that the that the constitution was rooted in in ... in the individual\n\nThat's why health care was such a bad Obama health care it was such a bad idea just because of Obama's healthcare was rooted in what's good for the collective\nIt didn't give the individual's right to choose it didn't give the individual the right to determine his or her her own destiny it it was it was what governments thought you needed and then therefore forced you to buy it\nThat\nIs not good and that\nWhere the or the collective are wrong\nIn the individual should always prevail we'll be right back [noise]\n\n[noise]\nNow I Know why people say they come down here and

you go to gas stations\nYou wherever you go to the story wherever you wherever you go you\nGet in their face and you have a camera couldn't quite understand words you use but anyways you know\nHey get it out that's her\nNot about the Trump is talking about people coming to his own venue come into his rally\nAnd he said don't where I can put up with that I shouldn't have told people show up push 'em and face or something knock 'em out but hey so even if it's someone hits you you're you're you're entitled to defend yourself so whatever take it from that\nBut what she's talking about she's talking about going out and the private people's lives in her private dinner they're private outing with them in their family and friends\nAnd interrupted him that's bully that's what a bully does that's what\nThey want to do they want to bully you see they can't win the election booze\nSo what do they do\nThey call for ... mark said mob violence mob violence\nAgainst members of our government you're right mark\nMob violence that's what they're about see they've lost a thousand during all bottom is stretching lost the thousand\nSeats local state wide seats\n\nThey lost governorships I forget the

Trump is the poster boy for the money that's what she said\nOh bright mark captains disagree he saying what what she's calling for his mob\nViolence\nAnd I think there is a big distinction because we I purposely wanted to bring up what you said about Trump because you know I Want I Want I don't I don't want to be accused well you you're not you're you're you're trying to hire early signs that\nSaid violence than what she said she was particularly speaking of harassment you know by the ...\nYeah is I mean\nYou know not striking or you know we're we're like\nOh no no you get in his face yeah yeah they interrupt push push bag yeah push that I mean what what's that it was a little cold but I'm trying to in the life are so I'm Glad I'm matter man I'm trying to walk I have a right to walk down the aisle down the street down the sidewalk\nAnd if someone comes up to me and steps in front of me\nThat that's a form of violence that's a form of aggression so that's where she's advocate no\nBut I'm not arguing I'm saying what if I didn't hear any bailout one ... or anything I've just withdraw it well that's a desert where when she's talking about the other side she's using those terms like they called for punch\nThem in the face and things that you've already said that that happened at the rallies in response to violence\nThere because they can't wasn't it wasn't like came into\nThe ground in standing in front of everything going say and you need to go out to a restaurant and punch them in race or you need to see the right filling up a gas and punch them in the\n... and she does and this this is a ...\nReaction to security that's happening there at those rallies right stand right right\nAnd she is advocating that they take the initiative is that her fans take the initiative\nTo act scene as them up as a mob correctly\nInterrupt disrupt obstruct\nAnd when you do that to people when they're out trying to enjoy the night out\n\nSome of that can be can a cornered
