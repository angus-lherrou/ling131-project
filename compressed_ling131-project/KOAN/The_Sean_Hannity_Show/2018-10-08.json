this are happy\nRide is upset a\nQuestion is can she pull it off and four and a half years and I'm not going to venture that uh I I was wrong about her I I I\nUp until the end up until she said she wasn't going to vote I was thought any in Murkowski\nWill vote for ... ... and I think ... the second thing and he's the chairman of the Republican Party ... he says it was a it was a big surprise it was just shocked\nI think it's a shock to a lot of people I think I think a lot of people who follow politics in the state of Alaska were you\nKnow I don't know that I was much different than them it was thinking hey this you know in the end yeah she's gonna bark and wine and this that and everything and she's going to hold out and and you know blah blah blah and and then the and she's going to come around and she's going to do\nWhat you know\nWhat the party and what her other colleagues are going to do and that is both for Kavanaugh\nInch but she didn't she did her own\nThing\nShe did was she wanted to do I guess I don't even know she did what she wanted to do she just been worn out from the other side too I mean that's just as easy\nSo I'm\nYou know I I don't know where her emotions were where her\nPriorities we're we're\nSo called a you know allegiance was I I I don't I don't have any idea about that I you know is this a pay back pay looking here\nMan I voted against cabin all all you left wing or is looking there I can do this because it's four and a half years away and and those conservative I'm\nRepublican people that that they'll they'll they'll give me a pass in the end 'cause heck it depends who's going to run against me and if that person doesn't really have any money or is really not a big ... you know unnamed known person who they are going to get the run against me\nSo I I think she at at all but going back to a Sarah Palin Sarah Baylor she's going to run for office surveilling these do a lot of ... around the state\n[laughter]\n[noise] [noise]\nI'm

in ...\n... you know I got out and we'll oh good yeah wherever she wherever the heck she resides that I'm Serious you know people have been around for a long time no I used\nTo be a big fan of

think be as honest about it I Am always I up straight up\nOr so [laughter] I I I\nI think Sarah Palin was sitting on her couch and\nWatch ...\nAnd just decided she'd be snarky and it was pretty funny you know 'cause you know the whole thing I can see twenty twenty\nYou heard from my house you know hurt me laughing on the other side of this glass oh yeah yeah it it's fun it's [laughter] it's good

kind of a political guy anyway so maybe your minds already made up but where are you at least to supporters to begin with\nAh let me put it that way\nSupporters to begin with [noise]\nAh let me put it that way um I did vote for her twenty sixteen but look that but they do that we for Puerto Rico Republican Party\nI I did all that I mean so so let me ask you this so she runs again would this vote deter you from voting for her again and you know or and a half years in\nFact that you know we still represent ... that she doesn't represent bad up\nThere so this vote was ... that that this vote was not that critical you seen gabbing all on the United States Supreme court was not that important it's not because of\nYou know you know you know what I'm you know I'm you know what happened recently and constantly it right it was it was that little girl little boy that with ... year it's that don't don't don't go for this like ... ...\n... ... say that again and what did you do say explain that one more time\nI'm a ten year old girl little beret way right into or by the way\nIt's even you know ... and so mark you know that that young innocent girl up there in ... view was raped and killed\nSend a message that send a message\nTo Syria or to to Lisa Murkowski and spirit send a message into her yeah now how do you know that I I Know what yeah what kind of feelings do you get inside your body that tells you that that's true\nUm because of the fact that it was talked in that case the you article to actually\nShow there was an article that said that showed that Lisa Murkowski saying that that little girl ... or is that what you're saying\nThat this is my little mind thinking about going by Lisa Murkowski had that tells you anything\nOkay so you're going inside of Lisa Murkowski's head and you are coming up with the conclusion that this little girl's book to her\nFrom God to view yeah bless her heart and and and that's that was the reason why Lisa Murkowski voted\nThe way she does because that little girl spoke to her and and and you know this because you got in Lisa Murkowski did\nExactly exactly yeah I had\nThe exact powers of doing that the don't ask me how I got it\nYeah I don't know either I don't know how you got that either but when you figure that out [laughter] when you figure out how you got those powers let me tell you something I Want to be the first you know [laughter]\nThat's\nOkay I Want you to come to the studio and we're going to do a one on one interview [laughter] 'cause I Want to see what other things [laughter] you know is

that's\nNot you judge Ted Stevens would have if Ted Stevens and his all his years very always voted for the Republican nominee the Supreme Court nominee and he always did that him and he would have he would have voted for job and all I I I\nI strongly but hey he's dead nobody can asking so we really don't know but that's that's an interesting news breaking point there is that is that you know that someone spoke to a\nLisa Murkowski so I'm a little bit of debt are alright mark thank you for the phone call five six nine to five six nine one zero eight zero\nFive six not I I like know how would you think\nI Want to know if this is going to affect your vote in the future will this change yeah I Would have voted\nFor ... but there's just no way in the world I'll do it now or just the opposite or a a vote for before\nAnd I'm going to vote for again so whatever way you are I like to know about it ... for a Democrat over her\nOh I'd vote for a third party I'd vote for like the libertarian or something like that yeah I did I did that during Ted Stevens I voted for Bob birds that soft Stevens off because about three thousand others voted for Bob burn cost to Stevens lose but you know Ted Stevens spent\nTed Stevens stop the the idea of being a senator was raped the federal treasury bring all the money home and look what it caused the nation may cause of the nation a lot of problems so

chamber is absolutely dead set on defeating his nomination from the very get go before he was even\nNamed easing even\nIn the situation here comes the excuse standard\nIs that a judge must act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in independence integrity impartiality the judiciary and she'll avoid him impropriety and the parents of impropriety\nThere goes there we go and after after that the hearing\nThat we all watch last week last Thursday it it became clear to me was becoming clearer that that parents of of impropriety has become an\n... so so oh I'll just say just just just so so what what you say is because judge Kavanaugh responded to Democrats who were who are being extremely rude to him and I I thought he handled himself quite well um I I don't think there's no way in rural I could have done well she did\nBut when they were asking him rude questions and being belligerent and all this stuff he happened to kind of pushback he did he push back a little bit I thought it was inappropriate\nYou didn't get out of line you just push back he's a man they're questioning his integrity is his qualifications are making accusations against him\nYou know and he he just push back the little bitty use a little bit of a heck I Want to see him be human that's where she's talking about she's using all of this is pushing back his strength his\nWell we for God no I get it he's a man\nHe acted like a man yeah the thing now I get it that's the\nProblem he was acting like a man he's acting like\nYou know hey\nI'm only going to take so much and then I'm gonna politely professionally with a little bit of strength push back and and not let this total a\nBashing of my character take place I respect myself I respect the Senate\nHearing but doesn't mean I Can't push back oh\nBut that's being a man see that that ... thing is being a man I think being a human being\nBut that's what she's talking about here let's let's let let let let it play\nIf you can't I don't know how you stopped at known but if you can let it if you let it\nGo forward and let it go forward if he can't understand this let me know\nAnd now he's a good man he's a good man man but he's not good enough\nClearly a learning judge qualified in my conscience\nBecause that's how I have to vote to end of the day is with my conscience I could not conclude that he is the right person for the court at this time\nBecause the NATO led reloaded or no\nOn cloture today and I will be a no tomorrow I Will\nIn the final tally be\nAsked to be recorded as president and I do this because\nA friend and colleague of ours is in Montana this evening and tomorrow and just about the same hour that we're going to be voting he's going to be walking his daughter down the aisle last night he won't be present to them\nI have extended this as a courtesy to my friend\nIt will not change the outcome of the vote but I Do hope that it reminds us that we can take\nVery small yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I don't hear tomorrow she's used on\nOh\nFive six Nineteen eighty like to know what you think five six nine one zero eight zero five six nine to ... even if it's opposite what do I think that's\nThat's the best phone call but actually\nFive six Nineteen eighty five six nine\nOne zero eight zero or if you depending on what you're getting\n\nThe Murkowski need an excuse right we're all leaning excuse my dad needed excuse to what\nMy ass you know my mom needed an excuse to tell my dad what I've done wrong during the day I'm my you know we all need a reason I'm not saying are phoney excuses always but what everyone needs an excuse or there's something that drives them to do something so\nShe needed something that she could plausibly put down on the table that was plausible that was um people could you know hooked or rancor too to some degree and she can sound legit\n\nSo it all boils down to cabinet falls entire life was boiled down and Lisa Murkowski's opinion to his reaction to a\n\nA smear campaign that took place in the United States Senate during his hearing\nAnd because he pushed back a little bit because he stood his ground because he projected himself\nInto sexual assaults Doug that didn't matter just knowledge was perfect his judges experience Germany's gray but hey you know you bark back a little bit too much so I I Can't support that is the most ridiculous crap all I've ever heard [noise]\n[noise]\nBecause I had ... and I had a belly laugh when you're ... yeah [laughter]\nEspecially if you get every you know if you know the history of everything and\nThat really uh helps out a to understand [laughter] it's like you as a comedian you know it's hard to tell jokes that people don't understand the backstory to right is it they tend not to get them telling people saying so Susan Collins\nHas come out and and well we all know that she came out she voted yes on Kavanaugh or she\nIs a\nCheese typically a burn\nOr Lisa Murkowski are connected that to happen a lot of times on in their ideology and all Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins on Sundays slammed opponents efforts to\nFundraise against your vote to confirm break Cobb and off for the Supreme Court calling them nothing more than ... employs to buy votes\nIn a future election they're asking me to perform an official act\nAnd if I Do not do what they want two million plus is going um to my opponent I think that that is if our politics has come to the point where people are trying to buy votes and by positions then\nWe are in a very sad place calls told CBS News sixty minutes well I think that's been going on for a long time that's been going on from the beginning of a beginning of time\nI mean we had a big deal about it up here with a a\nBill Allen in the Republican Party and then some Democrats about paying people off\nAnd and and that was a\nThat turned out to be almost nothing burger or that people were you know any ways that that's a whole nother story but um\nAnyways\nGiven people money ... people's campaigns in paying people because in giving people money to other people because one person doesn't vote the way you were you one is is is common practice I'm not I'm not saying it's always you know the best way but it when you come up with a\nBetter way than let me know five six Nineteen eighty five six nine one zero eight zero what do you think uh I

Murkowski in four and a half years you know just just plain and simple you think she'll ... she'll stick around\n... you know Chris you come up with a good one and and I think that is is that she may just leave she may retire from the Senate she may have already know that she goes she said herself listen I'm retired from ...

were told to do it I I don't know what happened okay I have no idea\nGet confused whether or not I should even mentioned the guy's name because if you mentioned his name he's given\nCredibility and so I'm hesitant about for for now I'm not no I see\nIs the name it's just been Schneider because he's he's a you should look out for him he's he's not even a third on the sex offender list but everybody should know is Justin Schneider he lives in Eagle River and he's not supposed to\nDo you think like saying his name is is is what he deserves\nRight yeah yeah 'cause you get out there are no and no way he doesn't have to register as I got one vendor Justin Snider living in your neighborhood know that he's a predator and he doesn't have to register as one\nYeah no I I'll I'll go with that I like that I like your attitude\nIt was just you attitude alone that that that that is what\nDid it for I mean you know these it was your ... doing it for fame and he's not doing it for any one of the ankle monitor he wishes this thing will go away\nAnd yeah you know ooh thank you thank you to my lawyer that I don't have to be registered as a sex offender those die life but believe me I didn't have ankle Melbourne Ronnie no no he's he's done he's out there walking around the school the best thing for Justin Snider to do to move somewhere else because\nIn this town I'm going to make sure his name as an forgotten that OK plenty and I like all of this rally will too I like it then All right if that if that's if that's the avenue were role and then let's roll\nBecause if if that hurts him by mentioning his name and that's good\nI'm just saying if he doesn't have to register on the list you got to keep on yourself to the ...\nThan he used to create a the crime\nWe'd go back to it there was a big rally or Saturday we had Elizabeth Williams you're on the show\nWho is heading this up she's social worker and she came on the show and explain are in great detail about everything in her case and what she thought why she was doing it and all that and we we really enjoyed having er here um\nAnd then of course ah she was promoting the big rally down at the courthouse and I'm not sure how many people showed up\nA but anyways er there there was a there were there were definitely people there and and in the daily news\nEditor or not editorial but didn't in the story breaks it down and sections in it and I\nCould go through it all but\nOne party or ... talks about the crime and initial complaint based an initial complaint based on an affidavit by an English detective interviewed the twenty five year old victim provides the only on record recounting of the crime\nHere's what the complaint says\nOn the afternoon of August Eighth twenty Seventeen Eagle River air traffic controller and father of two just didn't Snyder picked up a twenty five year old woman from the parking lot of the holiday gas station at the corner of Minnesota Dr and spin art road\nPromised senior or ride to mall June instead he drove over to a dead end street off Wisconsin 'cause remember this cat's going to work he's going to the FAA he's gone he's a he's a controller he's going out there to the tower shoot he's not\nHe's not going back to the mall do where she wants to do of\nCourse not he's he's on his way to work\nIn steady job or to the end is dead and industry to Wisconsin\n\nAnd and and for some people just may be offensive so I Want you to know that it while I'm going to read some of the details of the crime and it is\nKnow that it well I'm going to read some of the details of the crime and and if it offends you than I Would suggest you turn down the volume here just for a minute\nThere the full on tackled her knocking or to the ground you tried to strangle her told her he was going to kill her she lost consciousness\nThinking she was gonna die the F David says when she came Jews Schneider was zipping his pants she realized he had masturbating any jak elated on\nThis is a detective telling the story\nHe explained to her that he wasn't really going to kill or that he needed her to believe she was going to die so that he could be sexually fulfilled any Jackie late\nThe detective wrote\nShe told police demands license plate number later in the emergency room at the hospital detective show drew a photo lineup of men matching the descriptions you've given she picked Schneider\nYou don't forget the face of the men were almost killed you she told police\nSo there it is in\nIn a very brief instant sing way those are the detectives words describing\nWhat he had learned from the uh the victim and a ... and her testimony to him\nAnd this is a case in which\nI Hope this legislative session there will be pressure\n\nAnd and I understand you know that there's a ...\nI just can't get over how he choked or said I I'm going to kill you she passes out thinking that she's going to die right and then somehow that that is an attempted murder even when after explains I needed her to think that she was going to die like this is\nIn all cases this is attempted murder right I I at the very least\nAnd that only a sexual assault oh yeah yeah beyond that I mean yeah this is too horrible things but if he just sat around for a year on the ankle monitor for this crazy\n\nJackie lady unwanted jak elation on another person or to another person armor that grammatically works\nIs not a sexual is not deemed as a sexual assault which was ... as harassment\nI think I was told her it's ... right right yeah which had a hell news to us so far not out\nFor the life of me I Can't figure that out\nNow\nA Jackie elation on to somebody else should be a\nCrime and if in the proper context should be a sexual assault because if it had the intentions\nIf they prove that he had intentions as a sexual release or a sexual it was part of a sexual\nWhatever whether it was in his mind or or or I ... I Can't figure out the human brain that that should be a sexual assault in just many many many many people around Alaska that are just like you and I ... that are wondering what the heck can you Jackie\nLate on a woman unwanted almost almost killer on Iran yeah any on any one woman or yeah or you know these are yeah any any on any\nOne and that and I and then not be a sexual assault I think that is the biggest\nPiece that the people are trying\nAnd and then of course the bigger story is why isn't he in prison me why didn't you guys do a couple of years\nIn\nAnd leave them hard some hard time before just a year on the ankle monitor at home playing your X. box doesn't seem like punishment enough\nYeah I yeah I ... it the law\nAnd and the decision by the judge doesn't make a lot of sense to I think a lot of us\nYou know we're not lawyers were not judges but we're also not stupid\nAnd and and and we understand it when you choke somebody out till they become unconscious\nAnd then you perform what is a sexual act\nI mean beyond the secular if if if I grab Eddie ... throat and so I'm going to\nKill you that's so slow to you pass a I'd probably go to Yale Law enveloping Schneider\nDid you know I'm pretty sure to me and you got into it at that extent no say no ... no one's paying muffin somebody ended up in jail for a long time know ankle monitor\nOne of a civilian jak your legs are me somebody going to be be beyond that if if I can just if I could have ... um someone's yeah just that to me that that they're going to do they're going to do jail time\nI mean a lot of them are in a moment if you put your hands around another man's throat in in an address of the way people that is I heard an animal ... of a of a misdemeanor crime if not a felony\nAnd I'm sure that has to do some sort of in ten you know if I had a specially with the threat of ... I'm going to kill you and then and then the prosecutor made excuses for the defendant\nAs while you were you know he really didn't want to kill or he really just wanted to get off sexually and oh yeah oh good okay so that made it okay [noise]\n\nAre we crazy five six Nineteen eighty I'd love to hear from you five six nine ten eighty [noise]\nDecision to make like there wasn't other options for him to use in order to further punish\nJustin ... the sexual abusers Snider\n\nSo ... so the sexual abusers Snyder was led off\nNot because not because there wasn't more restrictive things are more there was a a political punishment\nThere was punishment\nA higher degree of punishment that could've been applied that could have been given that could've been rendered against a Schneider but but the judge chose not to\nThe judge chose not to do that he was convicted of a felony\n\nWell the felony easily could have been given a couple of years now he would have done what\nA year year and a half or something like that or is that I don't know how that works but you get off for a good time so let's just say he would have been out in a year year and a half alright\nThat have been something\nBut not for this judge judge Korea let this guy walked free\n\nAnd entering a little bit of the uh\nOf of the daily news article that try to kind of coincide what we're talking about prosecutors initially filed three charges second degree\nFelony assault third degree felony assault\nAnd first degree harassment prosecutors conveyed a grand jury convened a grand jury paperwork shows that the victim testified after the grand jury a kidnapping charge was added\nFrom the beginning none of the charges concerns are constituted a sex crime the kidnapping charge was an unclassified felony\nThe most serious level the assault\nCharges for strangling the victim we're B and C felonies\nThe harassment law Schneider was charge under was a misdemeanor for putting bodily fluids on a person without their permission\nThere Smith law was crafted in response to correctional officers frequently found themselves the targets bodily fluid blah blah blah\n\nWalker ministry ... plans to push for legislation orders close this gap up\n\nClose the gap up the bottle of fluid right you 'cause there is what is it it's to protect the you know\nBut here hole that they use them for right when you spit on the officer or something like that right the exact you know driving laws in one day there you go through all kinds of ... or prison guards yeah I've heard all you probably heard of ... oh yeah yeah yeah\nYou never know so that's the the bodily fluid thing is for for like spit or something yeah yes whatever I mean there were I mean I guess the human including that right I'd ride I so I mean whatever they get out of the loop hole\nThat it wasn't sexual ... that's what they're trying to\nTo fix is that if the money is involved that will be considered a sexual assault now right\nNow the editor as well and I think there's ways you can do that they'll give me the difference of a kid taking semen and throwing on his friend and the different as as being eroded jerk of the weird thing the bill yeah being weird yeah and and then re of that one weird\nCase shows up you you can take that ...\nWell yeah 'cause there's different there's different factors of it threatened to hit and what it was all about because I'm\nPretty sure that little factor is going to be more rare than than something that Justin Snider here did\nExactly and the legislature can work things in work there now they have attorneys and all that kinda stuff and they can make it constitutional and make it work they can they can make it where it's a political to the crime that we've just we've just witness\nBut from the here it is you know from the beginning none of the charges tossed to the sex crime\nAnd and that's one point the\nKidnapping charge was an unclassified felony the most serious level so they threw
