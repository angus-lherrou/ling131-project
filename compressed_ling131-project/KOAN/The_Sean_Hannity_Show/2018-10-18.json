security guy was there for this kind of odd\nThat strains any\nSuggestion that oh we we have no idea what happened to give me a break now as far before I go to phones on this and I got to move on on the Trump threats to close the border and use even military or a\nAssets I Want to get into that here in just a second but as far as this interesting little media twist for the past couple of days we have the Washington Post and they've asserted that the Trump Administration has been\nPro actively helping the Saudi royal family come up with this ah this cover story on how to wiggle out of this whole cause show the mess\nAnd that the administration um try to help them come up with some type of plausible deniability here uh that's the Washington Post\nButts\nCNN yes I said CNN is\nSort of coming to the president's a defensive coming to the age of the president's a Washington Post they are tremendous ration cover story helping the Saudis out but CNN is offering a whole different scenario here\nWhich reflects well on the White House now they're thinking of the Washington Post is that Trump and palm pay or giving suggestions and more importantly I give them the Saudis time to get their story straight I don't know I don't care how much time they have\nThat this is a stink bomb that they ain't getting out of the post reporting indicates that the favored narrative at this point is this interrogation that\nWent bad that uh that the Saudis are the crown prince only signed off on a questioning and interrogation nine of murdering a an acid bath or a or this or you know and I said this numbering beheaded whatever\nAh which again I I just I Know buddy ... especially the one of the top security guys for the person has got to take any matter like this into his own hands without the express consent as the prince not knowing about this so I'm [noise]\n[noise] [noise] the claim is always just walk through the this is what the Saudis are are modeling apparently it was just interrogation we didn't sign off on you know dissolving human asset and and\nHacking his fingers off one by one at apparently this was capture an audio which leads us to believe that the Turkish must have had the Saudi conflict bugged\nWell the Turks or Turkish they need to release this audio I don't know why they're holding on to this and have\nHave U.S officials have been given the Saudi has pumped pale and the White House and top intelligence officials have we heard this audio or that's still a question\nOr to be determined now of course it would be a massive mistake for this administration to assist with a cover up or ally of this magnitude and I just don't think that's going to happen\nYou know I Know Hillary Clinton or trying to uh you know cover for the Obama administration by you know trying to sell us on that anti Muslim video as the precursor the the ignition point for Ben guys give me a break\nI bought a so I don't think the Trump Administration as they got themselves into this kind of trouble here now\nThese implausible cover stories they they don't work out very well historically I I don't think it's going to happen here so the Washington Post is trying to suggest like I said that the Trump Administration trying to assist the Saudis but CNN they have\nA different story CNN has different reporting giving assistance to the Trump Administration and again with the Washington Post is asserting\nCNN CNN is reporting this here's a quote\nFrom CNN quote a source familiar with Tom Perez Tuesday meeting with Saudi Arabia and crown prince Mohammed bin solve on tell on CNN that the smiling photo op between the two should not be read as an indication that the meeting was friendly instead\n... told been saw him on in no uncertain terms\nThat he had to own the situation and that every fact is going to get out\nAccording to ah the source they have who added the smiles between the two ended when that photo op ended\nAnd we're also hearing now the administration was not happy that that's how it was portrayed a but listen you you don't don't give the media a photo op in order to you know throw that back at it at you so here CNN is giving the administration some coverage here\nWashington Post is not I tend to think that that reporting is accurate and the Trump Administration is going to do the right thing or a story I'd uh I got to move on to other things I Want to grab a couple of phone calls first and then\nMilitary sense of the border to stop crossings\nSummer up in arms oh my God what we've gotta addresses so we

below sea of these campaign events and the president has been doing all these rallies as we head into the mid term a final stretch here we're only a couple of weeks away from the mid term elections\nAnd you know again which way is this going to go to the red white and blue wave and you know\nWho who knows the big question is again voter turnout and there are numerous reports from around the country that\nThere's still a concern that while there is a whole lot of enthusiasm that both sides have charged you've got immigration obviously you've got the Kavanaugh issue I mean there's you've got the anti front crowd on the other side\nThe issue here is that\nThere are reports coming out that many while maybe energize they don't plan to vote\nIn the mid term elections so I saw this piece um it came from the Houston Chronicle as the Houston Chronicle but it looks like it might have been to a wider peace and it's just talked about you know this is the day right on the story was Clarksville, Tennessee\nInterested in the mid term election isn't a fever pitch and much of the country of both Democrats and Republicans far more passionate than they've been in more than a decade could this be the year that Tennessee's Montgomery County shows up two votes\nLocated northwest in Nashville along the Kentucky border discount the often has one of the lowest voting rates in the state in a state that often has one of the lowest rates in the country\nAnd in the country that has had one of the lowest rates in the world trailing other developed nations so it's just an interesting piece that you know and and this is a study on on this particular area but again what remains to be seen as a larger picture\nIs that turn out for the midterms going to be\nSimilar to a presidential election year\nNow I've seen that some of the cable news channels are going to treat the mid term election night they get a tweet that Tuesday night and early November as if it were because of the importance of the men terms\nAnd the hope that that the Democrats have to hopefully not take back the house of representatives a long shot the Senate or that the the cable networks are going to treat that Tuesday night as if it was ah the importance of a presidential election\nSo again voter turnout who's turning out is it going to be a a bus or is it going to be a a boom as far as voter turnout all that you know obviously remains to be seen a couple of things you don't want a lightning round a few items here and I thought this was interesting\nI don't know if you're if you heard the story about big bird\nRetiring well listen big bird the character on Sesame Street is staying it's the guy inside the big bird outfit\nWho is retiring that's not the story although it's
