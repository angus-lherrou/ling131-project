due to China a\n\n\nWait isn't gentleman Mrs Caesar Martin sense of filling in for any Burke today and want to give him and thank you for having me on his show today um ladies and gentlemen we have the man himself\nThe king of liberty the hunk a hunk of burning limited government the man who sends fear in the hearts of all those who advocate for Marxism and those who conspire with them ladies and gentlemen Michael chamber in Studio ...\nUse these are I'd say I'd say you are you you're much more value than I deserve\nWell you know I uh I I think Michael you have a tendency to undervalue yourself so I'm I'm happy to promote you so my car you know heavy in Studio today\nAnd a topic that I Want to go over with you is this a government oh man because Michael you know we talk a lot about federal overreach and you know but you know you you're a guy that you go into governmental for each I mean you you talked about government overreach in every level and so today in our city\nWe live in a city where we've got property taxes going up whether that's ... you know a residential or commercial property taxes at very high levels\nWe've got a situation where we've got um a plastic bag ban going into effect next year um we we just got a whole bunch of assaults on our economic freedom going on in the midst palate of Anchorage and so what are your thoughts Michael and you look at ... government and the state of Minnesota pro government from a liberty perspective\nWell ah you know the first day I think the most priority a thing that I look at is is a with regard to\nThe prior um assembly before the liberals took over a actually voted to have the election moved to November correct and so then we had the liberal folks come rolling in and immediately I mean the dust wasn't even settled on that and they immediately moved it back to a special election\nAnd in that special election they always say well we don't want to have it in November because the uh because of the candidates for city would be overshadowed by all the other candidates\nWhat in actuality you get is about a Fifteen Percent voter turnout\nAnd that is the way that special interest is consistently a rural area the elections and so if in fact we don't get that election back to where we can get to a higher turnout you can rest assured that we're going to continue to have these liberal policies\nI Would agree with you and you know Michael when you look at 'em when you look at the president majority that we have on the acreage assembly ... you know in terms of ... you know what you see there as as a philosophy deep deep think it's fair to call their agenda Marxist agenda\nIs no doubt you know ... one of our best friends is a Amy Dembosky and I\nYou're listening to the Eddie ... show on conservative talk K away in Ninety five point one ... fan and ten eighty am and K O R A n FM dot com\n[noise] ladies and gentlemen this is a Caesar Martin and filling in\nFor ... for and I am here with the king of liberty themself Michael Chambers I Am here ah with him in the studio we're discussing municipal government and the need to pursue a liberty agenda\nAt on the Anchorage assembly Michael er last segment we were discussing the tax payer bill of rights we believe that it's necessary to enact one here in the city of Anchorage\nOh I think it's extremely important in as as soon as we went out to break\nThis money comes from a citizen you know I'm the early ... this whole idea and it's not that I don't have this notion of ... representative government\nBut I really take issue with the representatives of government that say well they're representing the people and therefore we're going to raise their taxes okay I just you know I just have an issue with that and so when you're really talking about taking the\nUh you know the fruits of their labor out of their pockets ah you know for governments\nAre you a a you know I just have a problem with it because you you know you give the government um a dollar and they'll give you forty cents in return with regard to services and so to me or you know I think that there should always be a question\nRather not government needs the money that they do because we don't get the return of the money that that they take\nThat absolutely and you know Michael\nAre there other you know because one of the things that in conversations you know within the liberty movement as you sort of get into this back and forth of the you know do we need it you know is it an issue we need the right people acted or do we or is it do we need structural changes in when you look at them and ... and some of the issues that we're facing\nI'm with regard to taxes and just regulation do you feel we have a structural problem or do you feel we need you know the right people liked it I mean what do you think where do you think liberty advocates need to go as far as making changes in our city\nWell uh you know that's a deep philosophical question there but I Would I Would suggest that are most definitely you have to look at the structural problem\nAh you know does it matter who's running that structure absolutely it does so that's a to do edge sword you're talking about but one of the things that I've always uh appreciated about Dan Sullivan a mayor\nOr a sees me senator Dan Sullivan is that he ran on a a an issue of uh you know cutting back on regulations of government\nNow I think that he had a real gift handed to him in a Donald Trump\nBecause that's where Donald Trump was going is cutting back on the regulations as the federal government unleashing the power of the the economy and that's a perfect example that our economy is taking off ... nationally because of the lowering of red regulations in the unleashing of the free market so here in the in Alaska\nWe have a tremendous amount of regulations and process that's in the way of unleashing the economy and so I think that we really need to get back to you know the reasons why most people live here in Alaska or moved here to Alaska for it because they want to be left alone\nAnd ah these regulations or draconian or they're they're they're they are because they say well you know human beings need to be regulated well I think that human beings need to be responsible\nThat's what I think I don't think that human beings need to be regulated to the extent that it is affecting our economy\nAnd uh you know we have the lowest economy in a nation is time interested you know wake up\nSmell the coffee and get her roll up our sleeves and say what is in fact the root causes of the economy and I would highly suggest that the regulations that are put on the municipal in state government is a substantial amount of the reasons why our economy's in the dumps\nUnderstood and you don't like when you look at so next year we're going to have some seats for the acreage assembly that that are going to come up\nYou know the the Republican Party has has struggled in the past and continues to struggle in my opinion was getting engaged\nHere in Anchorage at them and their support level and even at the school board level and you know what are your thoughts on that I mean what would be you know as a libertarian speaking of the Republican Party what is your advice criticisms et cetera\nUh well mine is uh when I look at the Republican Party I I think that they have some structural issues themselves [noise]\nUm I don't think that uh I really honestly believe they need a coup by our moment and they need to bring their uh their individual members you know they pride themselves as being individuals' well have you know that's fine but the fact of the matter is if you have\nFactions within the Republican Party that's causing a a ... disk communication\nA then you're then you have a problem and to me I find that there's a tremendous amount of Republican candidates out there\nThat aren't even being supportive whatsoever within the within the Republican Party and it's like they're picking and losing a picking winners and losers within their party right which makes no sense to me whatsoever if a candidate steps up and they want to run on the Republican Party ticket you'd think that they'd be all in\nFront of you know and so to me it's like ah and I guess probably and I say this with all sincerity\nI see Republicans and conservatives in two ways number when I see them as being very lazy when it comes to getting involved and number two I see them\nAs being very lazy when it comes to getting involved and number two I see them being very cheap\nAnd I know that that might offend people out there but the you know I just tried to tell the truth and I and I been consistently involved in what I Would call the conservative a movement for years and years and in fact I consider myself to be even much more conservative than a tremendous amount of Republicans out there\nAnd uh and I just see that they don't get involved\nAnd they don't spend money that's not all of them there are some very good people out there that really do open up their pockets and they learn his ear and everything like that but overall I we I suggest that uh they they don't get behind their candidates and they don't take the money that the end you know the other side they have special interest money\nYou know on one side you have individual money on the on the other side you have special interest money\nWell I've always come from the fact is that if the the individual needs to step up\nAnd uh you know it just comes to our educational content that if you raise somebody that they're that they're responsible and they step up right then you know so I really look at the the foundational principles as you look you have people out there that are candidates\nWhen they step up then the citizens need to step up and say I believe in their policies I Believe in their principles and I'm going to open up my pocketbook and I'm going to help them out\nUnderstood so so Michael just be clear so you believe that you know with regard to next year\nThat you don't believe there's ... that that and even look at past history but going for you believe that the issue is in finding conservative people to run from it as simple office or even school board you believe the issue is getting them those individual support that the party does not adequately supportive\nAbsolutely I totally believe that if you build up a ballpark the players will come a understood and and from a from a a campaign perspective the best ballpark you can build is that they know number one they're going to have people that are going to step up and help them\nBecause you hear this consistently that candidates go out there and they run for office and they have absolutely nobody steps up and helps them they they feel like they're all on their own and number two you have to have people that are step up and say you know I'm going to support that person in the best way I can do that is to give money to their campaign\nAnd when you have candidates that didn't know that they have that support and that they have that uh they have that financial backing then you're going to grow a a tremendous crop of liberty loving conservative candidates\n... understood Michael and so Michael\nWhen you look at the policies that are being implemented a by the left here in town whereabouts the gas tax the plastic bag ban um some of the other things that they've done strictly with raising taxes\nDo you see this as I said that this was a two part question number one\nDo you see these policies are implementing a sort of a foreshadowing of things that they want to do or that they will do or attempt to do with the state level number one and number two do you see the candidate that provokes on the assembly that are pushing these policies do you see these folks as\nFuture candidates for the legislature future candidates for mayor or governor cetera but I'd love to get your take on the first and then the second question\nSure well hold on folks it looks like we're going to break\n'em we will be or we will be back on a conservative talk Kaylee and with Michael Chambers it's Ninety five point one Afghan and it is ten eighty am in a number five six nine ... thank you very much [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\nA higher government are they believe that they can serve the citizen you know by you or you know escalating to another\nPosition rather be state or national or whatever like that but ah it and and I don't have a problem with that would I have a problem with is is that they hide their agenda that is where I'm going to a problem\nUh so if if they are to open up their agenda now some of it is open okay I they do open some things like as an example of the gender neutral bathrooms you know I thought that was\nYou know I mean they were really quite candid and wide open and they got that thing through and they you know they got it through like kind of on a liberty\nLevel and you know so some people say well Michael if you're a liberty person why wouldn't you go with gender neutral bathrooms while I Do believe that there's a certain amount of decorum and decency in the society and\nI certainly wouldn't want my teenage daughter like showering with the males staff member and it's just that you know there's just certain things that I guess it from a puritan\nPerspective that you know I don't appreciate that kind of agenda\nYou know so uh we're moving into a much more liberal a much more\nSo uh we're moving into a much more liberal a much more\nAh you know I'm kind of a mentality that you know we are basically\nStarts setting structure that is not really not structure and and I believe that human beings to have a tendency to be able to evolve into the next intellectual round by having structure\nUnderstood and you know Michael one of the things that um\nYou know that I that I've said in terms of like when you look at the state that we have a serious problem with the liberty side of the equation is that\nYou know we don't you know I think you would agree that the that the Alaska dispatches definitely not a a liberty or get in terms of it it it is very much in in the column of the left\nAnd so it was one of the issues that you see in this town in terms of the ability of liberty minded people to resist this agenda being that we don't have a news outlet that really disseminates our viewers sort of exposes a sort of waste fraud and abuse that the opposition is fueling admissible government\nWell a ... I completely agree with you a these are but I Would say they're on borrowed time finally\nUh because they're such more diverse vacation with regard to getting information finished um and uh you know the Internet Facebook and you know people might say well if you get your information from Facebook then you you know you really got problems well\nI I Would suggest that Facebook is probably as illegitimate just the local news outlets outlets have been for years and you know so they'd been in the tank for a long time but you know a lot of the ... liberal left they have a real problem with Donald Trump with regard to him calling it fake news but you know I really appreciate that because\nEven though I Know the first amendment covers news and covers the way you know their freedom of the press\nI really question whether or not the press should be set up from a from a perspective that they can go out there and push the political agenda without a whole lot of ah what I Would consider to be facts\nYou know so that you're there pushing it and so I appreciate the Donald Trump is out there putting it in their face call fake news and things like that and I think that the majority of people in Alaska you understand that the uh liberal press it consistently across the spectrum has always been on that side of the equation\nAnd uh you know and so there's just this whole uh blogging you know a lot of people out there like a the Michael do show you know he comes on the talk radio shows all these you know putting out information out there that is much more conservative in nature\nYou know we don't have any liberal talk shows is kind of interesting because the last liberal on the talk show was Ethan Berkowitz with a\nWith Bernadette that's right man died but it's very difficult for them to sell their product on TALK radio because their product does doesn't it doesn't entertain you know it it's all about just grabbing you know the riches of a\nOf the citizen and you know and so that agenda you know it doesn't resonate so I think that the conservatives or I look forward to the future because I think that the diversification of being able to communicate is even going to become substantially more and it levels the playing field\nDo you know Michael is there a\nUm is there a conservative you'd like to see run and twenty or twenty Twenty one when he thumbs term

I went to some of these meetings and expressed opinions about it you know hey\nIt since since you know we have to spend money on security now as as opposed to spending it on ministry right right I have to watch what's going on\nAnd uh and and it was like it fell on deaf ears nobody hurt you know so that kind of got me interested in you know as the Ninety One started looking into it and just found out that it's just that\nProbably wasn't rank just\nPieces of legislation that was ever written understood and I'm so that was the catalyst was was that something needed to be done and of course I I don't live in the district with my church is in fact you're running\nA district but anyway he uh uh we we um I live in district twenty four so uh that seat was coming open in the ah the assembly I mean are these some of the uh the state legislature so I decided to film a name and and uh and and that that was that was at those catalysts\nAnd Steve what what did you learn from that experience I mean is there is there anything about that and experience that really moved you you you know that either emotionally intellectually at the can you speak to that at all\nUm what I Want to figure it out is a\nIt it's not a very easy road to take and it seems like people almost like\nThe establishment as opposed to people who actually want to make a difference and want to make a change\nAh I did a lot of door knocking man I'm uh during the\nPrimary uh got you know about six hundred votes which is good I'm not you know that that's great you know but a lot of people voted for the incumbent in the income and you know is not\nOf current interest rates are still very low comparison previous low right now is the time to take advantage of this uncommon phenomenon we'll look back at this period as a golden opportunities to buy or sell homeowners planning to self should call us had to for for his early to what we will be happy to come out and do a comparative market analysis at your convenience called Jonathan Martin Harrington in companies\nTo four four zero eight to one that's two four four zero eight to one [noise]\n... says the Eddie Burke show on conservative talk K away in Ninety five point one ... eighty am\nLadies and gentleman was the Caesar Martin and coming back on the hour\nAnd we have pastor Stephen do planners are bringing down bringing down the spirit and the studio and lift them is up\nI'm Steve on the previous segment you were speaking to the fact that we're not bringing in the gospel with regard to dealing with homelessness in our community and and first of all I Would agree with you but Steven I I you know to broaden the conversation\nDo you feel that we have in terms of dealing with homelessness dealing with the you know the crime do you feel like\nYou're part of the issues that around that or or overall lack of spirituality and our government and I'll give you a historical example to compare it to now so\nThat the ... you know when we were going through um you know the bloodiest conflict in our history to the civil war I'm President Lincoln um probably well in excess of over two hundred times in the in his four years\nUh in in office or I'm In the presidency\nIssued multiple proclamations calling for prayer calling for us to get down and Ernie is an and pray to God and and asking for God's to he ordination um you know even at the height of World War two\nI'm President Roosevelt issued proclamations for prayer for our troops who are fighting the Nazis or overseas and you know you fast forward to today\nAnd we don't see I mean you you can look at the governor you can look at the mayor we do not see proclamations prayer we do not see\nA real coming together you know in prayer and turned bringing for pastors or even bringing rabbis or a mom's together to praise the community over our issues and so as as a pastor is someone who who looks at our presidents society do you see is who's having kind of a crisis of spirituality\nOh absolutely yeah um the the the thing is is that for the last ... the church has been asleep the church has been compromised it's been I'm\nA ... just ... down like lazy since early sixties when when when prayer was taken out of schools that was that was the onset of it from there it's been\nYou know it's been all downhill um and and we're ... I Believe that we're in this situation\nIt's been all downhill um and and we're ... I Believe that we're in the situation\nAs far as our country is concerned is because the churches and stood up and said something\nNow it's we have a a a window of opportunity right now right understood I I I'm In fact are preaching this couple of weeks ago [noise] excuse me\nI'm back in the day when when uh when the Israelites we're um we're banished from Israel and taken over Babylon\nAnd then Cyrus came in and in and took over right and he was like in the new king and they they had been in exile for for for decades\nAnd he\nGave them the opportunity to go back and rebuild their homeland right so we kinda have that now I'm not saying that Donald Trump is Cyrus but in essence we have that because we're\nChristians have a lot more um opportunity to do things now in the last two years since he's been president\nYou know then we have in a long time so if we don't take an opportunity right now to jump on this and do something about it we can turn this thing I'm believing in turn around\nYou know because think about this the book of revelation write a book of prophecy and I would leave Isaiah book a prophecy is ... vocal prophecy the thing is is that if if people would have heated to the prophecy the prophecy would not have been fulfilled\nSo think about this there's still time the book of revelation doesn't necessarily have to play out if we do the right thing if we listen intake he do with God is saying right now right\nWill that happen I Hope it does but ... we have a plan of what's going to happen if we don't\nYou don't have idle ... absolutely Stephen ... is even to the point\nYou do what do you think needs to happen you know for those of us who are faithful Christians in who who'd ... to live the gospel who try to live the gospel inner seeing that the sort of a cultural decay in our society\nUm you know how do you feel that that we can you know I mean you know in our state in our city how do you feel that we can try to reclaim the square or to try to revive the spiritual conversation is not being had in your view\nUm we can do it by it exactly what I was talking about with with Cyrus there was there was three guys that took\nControl of that situation as the rubble was as ... in the ... okay they all had visions of bringing the log God back to Israel rebuilding the temple and rebuilding the wall\nRight speaking about a wall but but but to do you need a wall for protection is in the Bible they build the wall around so these three guys caught caught fire they caught a vision right\nSo that's where I'm at when it came to running for office I caught this vision that yes these things can be change if we if if the voice gets in\nYou know if we get enough people and and then look what happened you know\nIt it Israel was destroyed again in Seventy eighty right and they were exiled again but hey man Nineteen forty eight they came back\nOkay so God's word is true okay so if you follow him and what he does he's he's going to come through on what he says he's going to do and um uh if if if we can get enough people behind us which I think we can ... do I've talked to I don't know how many hundreds of people I've talked to that feel the same way we do\nYou know brain but they were afraid to say something about it because we're I might lose my job I might lose my position and in politics I might you know whatever it is to get that cause in light of eternity it's nothing\nTo do in other words even when it comes to the church and believers you believe that we have to have courageous conviction joined that we have to we have to speak our values\nWe have to stand for values are regardless of the consequences that may or may not come in from speaking or values and to that point do you believe that you know as far as on the electoral side\nThat we need to be asking the question of you know for let's say a candidate for mayor you know will you wish you proclamations of ... you know will you bring us together as a city to pray for city and um I mean is that there's not a question we should be asking candidates for the assembly are candidates for mayor\nI don't see why not I mean we have a Jewish mayor\nWhy isn't the you know it it it it's beyond me I I Do you know some security work with the synagogue here in town and know the rabbis and men who these guys pray goodness gracious man when I'm there on ... bought it it it it's a it's it's\nI got saved in Brownsville assembly a God during revival right now they're honest with ya I at the same presence of God that was at Brownsville\nIs in the synagogue on survivor and it it brings you to a point of repentance right and and repentance changes your life so prayer can do that ... can do that in in in and and it's beyond me why people don't even hey\nLet's try it because when you're in a ... if you're in a tough situation who who do you first cry out to your credit to drive right if you get to the diagnosis of cancer or heart attack or whatever it is you know row God help me\nOut to dinner and there's no there's no question about that Steven and there's there's no question about and you know for history I mean to get historical here are you know our country from it said it's very foundation\nUm you know the founders when they were in the constitutional convention had a moment of per frack Benjamin Franklin stood up in the assembly that are calling for prayer we need to have deliberation with our create or\nTo you know because we're doing serious business and we need guidance on this uh and every I mean when you go from George Washington um\n[noise] you know going to George washing up into the twentieth century we had presidents who called for prayer um\nAnd it's amazing to me you know that you know ... you know when you look at our history our institutions are are are founded on the on the idea that we have a creative work mhm that there is a Supreme Being that created the universe that created us our institutions are predicated on that truth\nLadies and gentleman or we have to go to break here at on conservative talk killing in Ninety five point one FM ten eighty am the numbers five six nine ten eighty we'd love to have you call in and join the conversation thank you [noise]\n\nYou know I mean I think one of the reasons why when you turn on television the reason why people use so much offensive language is because they don't have a real language you know what I mean they don't have a real\nUm they haven't been trained in literature they have been trained you know to have a ... of words that they can use to describe an express themselves and so we ended up with this violent offensive language because it's the only way that people\nIn today especially in the media or an entertainment can really communicate ... I mean you have any thoughts as a pastor on that\nUm language is is a A R language is\nIt's complicated but then it's simple because some things means something that means something else English language is weird All right that's what I'm getting at\nUm when when we were coming up the you know I remember I don't know if you remember George George Carlin rhyme him yes he had an album or that I think it was a seven words you can't say on television right [laughter]\nAnd he would say of course back then and one album in ... kids listening to of course yeah I did my dad had the salmonella sneaking out and listen to it [laughter] he also had Richard prior to that kind of funny\nTo hear like romance cuss words you know and he's saying them and he's a seven words that you can't see on television and all of those seven words of being said on TV [laughter] you know so ... go\nFigure where we've come from you know we've we haven't you know people think that we're we're you know I'm moving forward\nIn society wouldn't actuality with declining it's almost like we're going backwards Diaz Lucian becoming dumber and not smarter and and because people can't think for themselves I noticed that if I Do you know any any Facebook commenting and in in from the campaign I had to\nUh let off on a lot of that because you know I used to comment and a lot of things and back in the day\nThen you could probably dig up some stuff that I'm kind of ashamed to say and you know but it it's there I mean it is what it is I'm not going to deny it you know and because when when face book first came out that was a platform to\nTo express your feelings you know because nobody had that you know we'd sit here amongst ourselves like in the room like this and talk but on Facebook you can get a lot of people and they would agree with you I didn't you can fight and you can do all this other stuff you know and argue and um they settled down a lot with that but the first thing I notice when you say something that's sensible\nAnd logical it comes back at you with cuss words and you're an idiot you're more on your your this year that because there's nothing there there's nothing to combat logic you know 'cause like if if it's logical in sensible the only thing\nIf you don't agree with it is going to be degrading someone and tearing their character down\nBond in front of that Steven ... is we don't teach logic anymore I mean it used to be\nWhen you were in elementary school and you were in high school I mean we talk logic courses we actually taught knew what you know we taught you know the logical fallacies the strongman fallacy\nUm you know we actually went through logical power season so we had you know there there was you know when kids came out of of K. through twelve education they could think logically they could make rational arguments because we taught them how to do it and we were and it was something that informed our culture\nAnd today if you're getting a logic class you're getting it in college which in my opinion is way too late the as you're you're really not going to engage in absorb that material in the way that you should and so\nYou know and and when you look at K. to twelve education in general we're not we're not educating our kids were really not I mean especially culturally you know one of the things even on a personal level that\nI have found just heartbreaking is the fact that\nYou know we don't we you know when you go through our public education we're not teaching kids you know we're with the kids aren't reading you know the count of Monte Cristo they're not reading sort of the great books you know the elite at um you know et cetera et cetera and and they're not and it's not just that but they're not\nReading Hunger Games there well I mean yeah they're reading the hunger I mean you know they're reading the hunger games or they're reading kind of which\nI mean if they're you know which I mean if if you find a kid who's written that it's like I consider that kind of a victory 'cause at least they're reading on yeah they're they're reading something but it's incredible the wave that we're not transmitting culture or at least for transmitting good culture because you know some of the books that are coming out\nYou know Steven his post modern garbage I mean it's all about you know wallowing in your self pity it's all about you know feeling bad for yourself mhm it's it's not about you know kind of going back to the Bible it's not you know suffering has meaning there's a value to your existence and I mean do are you seeing that as far as the ... through twelve education\nOh yeah yeah and and I also find that that I'm a\nThat even now the ... they don't even have to read I mean because they can just get an audio book and just put the headphones on and they'll read to you right now and and um\nYou know the the libraries of getting smaller you know in in technology is great don't get me wrong you know but ah my son ah ... wanted me to read this book he's been reading and it's um uh it's not recommend anybody wants about leadership is called extreme ownership\nUm is written by a Navy SEAL and he had it on audio book\nAnd I was like he wanted to get it for me for um for my birthday and I was like well could you give me the real work because\nI don't like having all in an audio books and and you know a candles and stuff like that because that can be changed you\nThe Kindles and stuff like that because\nThat can be changed you know the printed book you know like all the ... I got a ton of books right right and and I will continue to collect books because they'll always be there right correct technology goes away if we lose electricity or something you can't read anymore at least you got that book\nAnd if that book was written I don't know if you guys notices is good for instance\nUm the newer version of the of the uh new in the international version um Bible was I think two thousand eight copyright uh I don't quote me on that but the original one and I have is from Nineteen eighty four right\nIt's changed its change go look up some some scriptures in there and it's changed to to suit better ... our culture is right now and it doesn't say what it said back in Nineteen eighty four and before that so we're changing you know stuff is changing in\nWorld War we now have a I mean Steven will cover this on the next segment but we're seeing some some crazy stuff coming out in the culture ladies and gentleman says conservative talk ...

himself the chairman of the board the guys who stands strong to protect that PFC Jim Crawford Jim\nAre you on the line I'm On the line I Know you're very welcome gym so Jim I I I'm Glad that you called in so tell us Jim uh how how is everything going as far as a convincing the voters that they do not need to have their PFC go to government\nYou know I I think the voters understand this I have an abiding faith and voters and especially as it relates to the permanent fun yeah we've we've been dealing with the same formula for thirty five years\nWhich more than satisfactorily and equitably split the income of the permanent five fifty fifty fifty eight percent was to go to David in\nFifty percent was to be available for a priority spending by the legislature fair deal everybody agreed and then bill Walker was elected on a promise not to cut the evidence of any kind of not once but three times and the legislature allowed him to do it\nI'll tell you what I'm not a lot of doors I I've been all over Rogers Park and and uh Geneva woods with college ... but our doors now I I grew up in St Bernard people understand this issue very well the fiscal plan or the Democrats and I include bill Walker\nVery well the fiscal plan of the Democrats and I include bill Walker as a Democrat since he has operated they Democrat admitted administration now for four years\nOr so ... we're we're not going to hide behind the independent label anymore we're going to call it the way that it is you get to Democrats on the side and then you've got a soon to be governor done levy I Hope I'm going to vote for Mike and I hope for all of the conservatives in this state both from I can hear when\nYou know Jim ... to your point you know as a legislator going down to Juneau\nYou know obviously your priority is to protect the dividend in ... were you and I both know that to you that we cannot protect the dividend until we deal with the growth in the operating budget and quite frankly the waste and inefficiencies in the operating budget and so Jim can you for the listeners out there\nWhat's your commitment what's your desire what do you want to see happen as Senator Jim Crawford with the operating budget\nWell there's a couple of things that I Want to see one is a consolidation of Alaska housing finance corporation Alaska industrial development an export authority between the two of them she's are they've got two point eight billion dollars of capital that is not necessary for their mission\nAnd you can test whether or not they use it for their missions by looking at their prior year financial statement is it at a to point a to point eight billion dollar net worth and that's carried forward and they're not using the money for the mission I think everybody should be able to agree on that so if we want to put government on a diet first thing that you do\nI'm doing very well so John you know you are in abolished the fed guy you know you're you're in that Ron Paul you know we gotta we need to go back to the gold\nStandard days of American history and you have been shopping around what I consider to be one of the\nThey have very an idea whose time has come with regard to tenth amendment restoration financial restoration for states or localities and John can you explain that concept told the liberty minded folks out there\nAbsolutely you know I've been a financial been in the financial services industry for about Fifteen Years and after the two thousand two thousand nine financial services melt down I started looking around for solutions what can I Do to protect my clients are assets and\nHow do we ah take back our currency and the\nAnd the financial services world because it's just appalling to me there's there's no protection or there's a tremendous amount of manipulation and the\nAnd the individuals that created this a\nFiasco back in two thousand two thousand nine are still at the helm there running the ship\nAnd a number out in the jail and it's and and so we started looking around and I started looking around and and one of the pieces that came out to me it was a a book that Dr Ellen round wrote called the Web of debt and getting rid of the Federal Reserve\nBy returning the the monetary policy back to the state and she pointed to an example of the bank of North Dakota which is a state\nOwned bank on before people get to up in arms and say oh we don't need more state government\nAll or remind them that they're the only state in the union that did not take financial and the two thousand two thousand nine financial or melt down because they did not clear through the Federal Reserve they don't clear to Wall Street\nThey offer their local banks in the state a clearinghouse alternative than the fed\nAnd we can do that here in Alaska I Believe we can do it responsibly we don't need to send our money back to the wall street so speculators when we can make sound reasonable decisions here and provide a economic growth\nRight here in Alaska with the capital that we have in the state coffers already\nSo John's dead for personal or I just wanted you know you're no Jack that I I mean it's a beautiful concept\nTo me and I think it's one that\nIt is very much in the tenth amendment the state's reclaiming\nYou know their future and so the question I have for you is how do you think that you know for example if we were if the legislature word to create a state bank based on the north Dakota model how do you think that would help our state alleviate our fiscal situation\nIs that old created a tremendous amount of transparency number one and then it would consolidate just like Jim Crawford talk about\nConsolidating some of the state agencies and and the coffers of the money that they have can be a reality that are paying for our own government\nWith the fees that we would save instead of giving them the banks in Wall Street we can use those to pay for our own local government\nAnd we can uh the way it works is it's a public bank concept it's the people's\nBank of Alaska it's it's\nAn stopped it's the people's\nBank of Alaska it's it's not a socialist idea it's a very much a capitalist ideas and the fact that we we just to give the local banks\nOf viable source took we're through instead of having to go through Wall Street for an example let's say you had a\nTen million dollar project and you go to your local bank can you get your approval through them right now the bank said sure we'll give you a ten million dollars but what they don't tell you is there not given their ten million dollars will only put about ten percent skin in the game they'll\nOut source that through a bond or a debt obligation and sell it to Wall Street right on those\nThen the the investors in Wall Street turn around and give the bank funny and the other UPS\nIsn't the ... of the world the big banks they give the local bank money to lend to you\nSo you find your project me as a financial advisor I looked for investors qualify them and provide them a coupon that they can clipped so they send them money to Wall Street and you get paid and you get your project though now through a public bang\nWay that would work as you still have your ten million dollar project you go to your local bank get approved and they go to the state of Alaska bank of Alaska and the bank of Alaska funds that project it's that it locally is that it through their\nTheir local bank channels already it's not in competition with local banks it gives them an alternative to clear through instead of sending it to speculators and Wall Street it's common sense\nRight in John So ... you know have you reached out so for example you know add raspy as soon as someone who is a leader in the banking community in this state and really still isn't a number of ways have you spoken to him or anyone from the raspy sin foundation as far as getting support around this idea I mean have you done any outreach there\nWe've done a lot of outreach in fact a Jim Crawford with is a knowledge and expertise and the banking industry I welcome we need that uh there was a bank build that was put forth earlier this year how school three Seventy six\nAnd there were some provisions in there that gave way too much power and authority to governor a and I'll just call it crony capitalism because they can control and manipulate who's on the board and we've got to protect that we have to be able to make sure that it's not\nA given away to political ah wins\nChange every couple of years\nBut bill responsibly just like the bank of North Dakota ... we don't need to reinvent the wheel we just need to adopt a ... a program a bank that's been in operation for Ninety nine years the bank of North Dakota it's been operating outside the feds for almost a hundred years\nSo a very nice guy that sport or John this is Michael Chambers I wanted to ask you a question um yeah you know you just recently ran against a Don Young in the primary uh with regard to um you know being the representative a day at the federal level\nWould you ever consider taking a you know this um information in considering running as a candidate a you know ... at a state level so you could affect the\nYou know legislation with regard to you know these interests that you have\nMy appreciate that Michael and you know I'm not sure what the future holds but what I Do see is this needs to be solved not only on a state level but a federal level as well we have to restore\nThe constitution and give that back to the state of Alaska\nMost of the issues that we face for states' rights issues and yes I did run on the Republican primary uh to provide Alaskans in alternative solution to a congressman who served for forty five years was eighty five years old not getting any younger\nWe have to talk about a transition strategy in a succession plan\nAnd let's call it a soft landing for the next Congress men who serves in Washington DC and he has to send somebody back there that has knowledge and expertise and who better to send back to Washington than a financial adviser\nWho deals with Social Security Medicare Medicaid and healthcare those are all in my wheelhouse I haven't been in hand a little bit and John but you're not going to say no to Michael I'll just say it's up for consideration\nAnd in John too to it yes you know she you know you ran you one area of your campaign that you really ran on was you spoke about returning to the gold standard uh as as a candidate for Congress in ... to as a financial advisor why um\nWhy you feel that that's the direction that the federal Congress needs to take us\nWhat we need to audit that's bad you know there are private organization there is nothing about the Federal Reserve that is Federal Reserve their ... their private company\nThat's in business to make a profit and you know there's multiple things that we have to face but\nReturning the state's rights issues we have to address issues that belong to the state to address I Am licensed the financial advisor I'm licensed in the healthcare industry in Alaska\nOr John we got it I says with the Federal Reserve John although we got to go to break the ladies and gentlemen Mrs conservative talk Kaylee and Ninety five point one FM ten eighty am in the number is five six Nineteen eighty please join the conversation\nWe want to step down all\nThese uh we had this bank robber feel less my body shot brains All right\nI'll give you the last boy you feel\nWhen you bring in and I was feeling re rod magazine\nHeadache strange thing\nThey come up with everybody\nThe money and my own little by little by\nAnd we have to get away from this derivative economy that we we live in and hundreds of trillions of dollars of derivatives that are in the ... actual reserve lending is destroying this world\nRice a debt based economy that is totally unsustainable well that's not going to happen overnight but we can certainly mitigate issues that Alaska has by protecting our state\nJust the way the back to North Dakota to protect North Dakota right and that's by not are operating participating in the Federal Reserve system\nRight what do you know I since we've got\nA a man in who's been involved in supporting a Congressman Ron Paul you know Michael I I Know you you know where someone that was really animated with Congressman Ron Paul's campaign strictly around\nThe issues of debt and the and the you know go gold standard and can you speak you know as a libertarian and someone who's been involved in that movement and supporting Congressman Paul do you do what you felt he brought to the table and what's been moving forward and the libertarian movement on those issues\nYeah absolutely or John I appreciate everything that you uh bring to a discussion here\nUh you know but in particular I I think that do you run power resonates through all of us here\nI Know he certainly does you are ... are there haven't really why you absolutely across a you know do the liberty liberty a crackdown on John I Know that you you know if I got your veins that a little Ron Paul's would probably come flowing out onto the table and\nYou know a A N Ron Paul has just been you know a a hero of us all in that regard so\nYou know it's a those principles in process of living within our means you know a very few people know that uh\nYou know Ron Paul never asked for pork barrel earmark or in all the time they set in Congress you know he had a you know just is responsible nature to end the ... you know we have to live first under the um uh idea that we can't spend money that we don't have\nRight in and it's interesting the seventeenth Amanda how about we ... we we addressed that\nBack in Washington because that's that's the recall that everybody watch it's called immediate recall when our senators do something that does not serve its constituent you pull the trigger and you're recalling immediately well why would we have to wait till next election\nBlind and when you look at you know the the when when the concert and our our country was founded and you know state legislatures were involved in selecting or senators\nWe we had as a nation we we we did not see the federal overreach that we see now and you know Michael I I you know is that um I I mean it's kind of a long shot\nThing to do but do you think that there is merit in what some and the libertarian and conservative movements who've said about you know repealing the seventeenth amendment and going back to you know states being engaged in the selection process with the upper chamber\nWell here's here's where libertarians come from we want to move tyranny as close as possible to home [laughter] [laughter] so we're a major advocate of the tenth amendment [laughter] so ah\nYou know we believe that the most over and is the individual so uh you know the second most would be probably ... municipal government and then\nOn on down the road there so anytime that we can bring the tyranny of govern government back home and the seventeenth amendment is a perfect example of it is pretty much expired the tenth amendment or you know by virtue of a ... and\nYou know so to repeal the seventeenth amendment to give a legislators that Robert opportunity to be able to make sure the representatives of government are representing the majority interest of the state of Alaska I I Can't think of a time right now John you're bringing up [laughter]\nThat is more pointing in the in our Iraq representative senator absolutely out of a you know out of sync with the yeah the cheese is literally out of order and it goes\nThrough with this goes through with the Supreme Court these people were never designed to live in a operate on the Supreme Court until they die I mean that's absurd you know they if they don't uphold the constitution I mean that's what it's all about the way the laws against the constitution and then let's see\nAh wait a minute courts issue opinions not law that's a federal law makers to issue law the courts interpret that then they say oh well this is our opinion\nWell and we have visited a state level well here's a prime example a walk or just had a judge say the a campaign sign\nCan only be for a flood by eight foot I mean has a judge come up with those figures you gotta like a ruler in his hand and he's going to decrease where that is and and and and the law ... says the signs are in violation it doesn't say political science that are temporary are in violation so years Walker using a judge\nTo push your principles upon the citizens of Alaska which are in violation of the first amendment right because I I you know I just recently made large science for both had run Gillum and Michael Dunn
