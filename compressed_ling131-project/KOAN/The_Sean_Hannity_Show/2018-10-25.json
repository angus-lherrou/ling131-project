having me hosts a host forum today ladies and gentlemen all you liberty loving people out there we as the king of liberty himself\nFormer chairman of the Alaska Libertarian Party the man that makes for Republicans and Democrats shaking their shoes when they're pushing the Marxist agenda Michael Chambers in Studio with us now hello Mike\nGuy hello good morning Caesar glad to be here with\nYou are absolutely so you don't Michel ... first stop on the on the hour I Want to have a conversation with you about the shakeup in the governor's race you know I Know that you know bill Walker was your least favorite politician in Alaska and his campaign\nFor governor has been suspended duty the sexual improprieties Byron Milan and so Mike I Want to get your perspective out there you know for all the liberty ... minded folks out there I mean how do you see the race shaping up now with with Bill Walker being out and it coming down to beg it should've done Letty\nDuring his ... where are these are you know most a talk show host these that kind of start out with a little bit of sip of\nCoffee but you went through some red meat right out there that I'm telling you I Do yeah well uh you know I ah you're exactly right\nUm I checked the mailbox every ah December and I haven't gotten any Christmas card from the government that you know I think you're exactly right in that regard I have a few of 'em up they're not just a Governor Walker but uh yeah this whole issue with regard to him suspending the campaign\nYou know a lot of people say well it was a set up and all that you know I I seriously doubt that the lieutenant governor or\nA more would take that kind of a hit with regard to the ... for the for the team taking one where the team you know uh I I seriously doubt that I think that there's a lot of validity in the allegations out there\nRight you're I I Would definitely agree with you Michael and\nYou know it's it's sort of interesting because you know you've been waging a battle against bill Walker for the last four years on the P. F. D. and the budget\nHammering them on Facebook go into public forums and hammering in public forums and so how does it feel cheap for you personally to see a man that that you've considered to be a disaster from day one\nOf his administration to basically now he's going to be a one term I mean this is yet this is the end of his political career I mean what are what are your personal feelings about that\nWell you know I think that there was a tremendous amount of people out there that contributed I did as much as I could do contribute and I can only say that my happy meters been packed here for quite a long time now and uh you know it was really interesting\nOr four years ago you know Governor Walker or a Kennedy Walker came over to do the cutting home and sat down with a you know a large group of a United for liberty folks\nAnd he uh made us very a prophetic statement there he said he's going to be a one term governor because of the positions that he would have to take with regard to lowering the footprint of governments\nAnd ... you know at the debate with Mike Dunn levy in fear banks at that that was hosted by the chamber of commerce up there\nUm I he was essentially walking back his position by saying well if there's any issues with ballot measure one I'll be able to fix it as governor which\nJust as a as a point of information for listeners out there if ballot measure one has passed\nThe governor cannot do anything about it the legislature can't do anything about it for two years our constitution states all ballot initiatives if their parents cannot be amended\nOr repealed until two years later so if a ballot measure one passage we're stuck with a job killing measure for two years so I mean aside from the fact that mark baggage clearly indicated that he does not understand state government and hasn't read our state constitution\nYou know Michael what is your take\nOn on the walking back of his of his support for ballot measure one and other issues\nWell it you know it's really quite um an obvious or one of the issues that he has is that a consistently across the board the entire uh a native corporations and the native tribes have been in favor of a no on one\nYou know they've been against the stand for salmon um Bristol Bay is the only one that took a neutral stand on that but uh but they didn't come out in favor a stamper salmon so uh you know Mark Begich obviously trying to play to the\nThe native or vote out there and try to walk it back\nBut I think the real thing is is that he realizes that uh the stand for salmon is a is a job killer it it would destroy our economy and you know those aren't uh you know I'm not doing hyper boy here I'm just saying very clearly our economy\nIs in a ride in the on the edge I think it's worth the economy in America you know so\nWe have the highest unemployment in the nation\nUm I mean we are sort of slowly um ... you know we are in the sort of a slow recovery because of the increase um in production on the north slope and we're starting to see 'em you know jobs coming back in the oil sector but you know to your point Michael it's very clear\nFrom any reading of of the ballot initiative that it is a threat to our to our economy I mean the amount that the amount of uh the permitting that you'd have to do to even be able to cross the stream for example on your TV\nI'm is significant and when you have I mean there is so far there are four hundred and Seventy five businesses that have joined the stand for Alaska no on one coalition and I think that's significant I mean I I Will tell you that\nI have never seen a ballot initiative campaign in our in our state\nUm that has drawn that many businesses are into the coalition not to mention labor unions I mean the AFL CIO um is is strongly opposed to it I mean when you get Curtis there of the state chamber invincibility Romney in agreement on an issue that's significant\nOr not to mention you know the threat that it poses to a economic development in rural Alaska but\nIt was that being said you know one of the other things about Mark Begich though I also find interesting with his campaign as he's made it very clear that he wants to amend the state constitution to guarantee funding for education\nThat's correct and you know Michael you know you're a teacher you were actually an award winning teacher and delta junction yes I'm you're someone that has been very passionate about education in terms of what it takes you know as far as teaching and engaging with children\nTo help them in the learning process so what is your assessment of Mark Begich is we're going to guarantee education funding in perpetuity well you know it sounds good you know I'm\nI don't think that there's any citizen out there in Alaska that doesn't think that we shouldn't invest in education I mean that would be like crazy but you know reality says that uh there that we are as Michael Dunn levy says very succinctly\nIs we're looking at a consistently the import of money instead of the output of performance correct and uh you know the bottom line is is that enough is enough ah you know it doesn't mean that are funding in education should be there but our main emphasis should certainly be\nOn a on the outcome of education and my concern is is that when you have an automatic payment going to education that is not accountable\nIt would even add even more so to the fact that they just have a you know a\nA a large amount of money without any uh accountability whatsoever so I'm I'm extremely concerned about\nThat uh it sounds good uh like I say but you know just because it sounds good doesn't necessarily mean it is a\n... absolutely and you know Michael one of the things I also wanted to ask you about is\nYou know Michael Dunn left the\nIs it is a guy that has been for the last you know twenty um the last twenty five years of his life has been very involved at every level of education you know he's been a teacher he's been a principal he's been as superintendent\nUm he was chairman of the the match to a school board before he was elected to the state Senate and twenty toll I mean this is a guy that has served it yet and you know he's got a teaching certificate principles certificate um two master's degrees in education I mean this was a guy that has served at every level conceivable in our educational system\nAnd yet the NEA has endorsed Mark Begich they're not supporting Mike Dunn levy for governor um\nThan Doris Mark Begich they're not supporting Mike Dunn levy for governor um and so what are your thoughts you know being a former teacher with a with a dynamic shaping up in the race\nWell that's a very interesting point you bring out there ah she's our because uh I find it very interesting any a has always always supported teachers\nEven to the exclusion of education\nOr they have supported teachers on a regular basis Michael Dunn Lee ... is exactly the only candidate for governor who has a teacher's credentials there is an administrator or as as you said the judge or the president of the school board as a superintendent\nYou would think that the NEA would line up and say this is a person that actually has some kind of a\nA vision or an experience with regard to ah to dealing with the real difficult task of a of a bringing education back into a\nSome sense of order that we can appreciate in and and feel good about two and a free any aid come out squarely against a\nA Michael Dunn levy just\nA is a it's a clarion call to how inappropriate their positions are have become\nA absolutely and you know Michael when you look at you know at the uh you know going back to mark baggage\nYou know your comments about the fact that you know I was er agreement I should say that you know the campaign is sort of been\nYou know developing its talking points as it goes along you know do you see 'em any tightening up in the baggage camp or do you think it's kind of too late as far as them creating a cohesiveness around the campaign with regard to their talking points\nWell if you look at their talking points you can tell from my perspective they're desperate\nAnd the reason why I say that is is because mark baggage is coming out in the majority of conversations you having and he is\nThe people that are carrying his water are negative in nature and it is a consistent dialogue that if you're behind you go negative\nUm it didn't work for me to read well um it's not going to work for a Mark Begich show I I don't think that just because they come out and try to attack Michael's record or\nAttack of the things that Michael stands for or making innuendos out there about some kind of impropriety Michel might have any is in his ... his skeletons in his closet or whatever like that\nYou know I I Want to hear the visionary I Want to hear the leader I Want to hear the process of somebody saying you know we have a difficult time here in Alaska and I'm going to step up when I'm going to a you know what I'm going to run with a vision that is right beneficial for all of us and I don't hear that from the baggage campaign what I hear from them is mirrors\nTactics and all kinds of process to take down a good man Michael Dunn levy and and I think it's unfortunate that charge a state has a devolve down to having candidates of that nature of running for governor\nI hear where you're coming from you Michael another thing I wanted to ask you do you think there's a real fear in the baggage camp because the public safety employees union which represents the state troopers um\nEndorsed Mike Dunn levy for governor the chill is the corporation has endorsed Mike Dunn Libby for governor I'm you know Michael has has been getting um you know support in a number of different areas um it toward his campaign\nYou know when you look at Mark Begich of his campaign has struggled financially uh in terms of of getting money into his campaign he's gotten no support from the Democratic Governors Association\nI'm so folks we got to go to break but just so you know I'm back on the hour we're going to be getting into it with Michael Chambers uh this is ten eighty I Am in uh Ninety five point one and I found the numbers five six Nineteen eighty thank you [noise]\n\nKeep intact and and I appreciate Dustin Darden but uh I understand that adjacent grin uh because uh Dustin is a registered Democrat or you know obviously Jason grand has a concern because Dustin would be taking from his numbers and I applaud\nDusten darker and darker to take as many of those numbers fondly can from Jason grand you know but uh you know I call Jason grand the grim reaper\n[laughter] and why is that Michael why why is he the the grim reaper in your opinion\nWell I I mean if there's any lapdog of a Governor Walker it certainly is Jason grand I mean he has a the only expenditure that I recommend a at the in Juno is that uh we need to replace the carpet between a senator\nIs that uh we need to replace the carpet between a senator ... office and Jason ... office to the governor's office because it's been worn out\nIn your wife or when you you know as I because you've you leading the we the people movement\nTrying to you know trying to advance those three principles of three in my opinion critical policy objectives what has been you know you've engaged with all forty house members all twenty members of the Senate would I didn't hear engagement with Jason grade as he ever reached out if you ever had conversations with him about what needs to happen with the budget\nNo pay 'em I shared with all those folks are rather not they wanted to consider a signing because I I Believe that those are nonpartisan issues when you're talking about protecting them permanent funded and that's a\nUh in the constitution as a nonpartisan issue um when you're talking about a taxpayer a bill of rights that if the legislature was to pass a state income tax or any statewide tax should the citizen have the the right to be able to vote on that too from that well of course the money comes from the ... and\nSo and the third thing is is a tax capital with regard to a resident okay yea or excuse me up spending cap with regard to whether or not we should live within our means\nI I think that those are no brainer so you know so when I uh and it's not just Democrats but there are there are Republicans out there also that they have a reluctantly said that they you know that they were not interested in signing a pledge of that nature because they don't like to sign things well to me it's like a\nCommitment you know I mean that's like going and wanting to get married\nAnd then you and then the justice of these are the or the pastors preachers he says well in order to consummate this uh marriage you have to sign on the dotted line they say well no I I'm I'm not into signing pledges [laughter] so [laughter] you know to me it's just like a it's a no brainer\nSo so when you look at someone like like Jason grand\nIn other legislators that that have an ... that have refused to sign the pledge\nDo you see that as essentially a statement that they believe that you know the P. F. D is up for grabs at the state can spend\nYou know money with without any regard to future generations the or you know and that the people should not be able to weigh in\nOn a decision to not only imposed taxes upon them but to raise the existing taxes on them like alcohol tax I mean what are you what is your assessment of when someone when a an incumbent or ... or even a candidate doesn't signed the three principles play\nWell I think the message that I get is is that they want options open so uh you know and I and I think okay well what options do they want to open they don't want to protect the permanent funded in\nIn the constitution because if they don't if it's not put in the constitution is not protected we we certainly know that over the last three years for\nA year or so is it that they want to have the authority of the legislature\nTo ah to beat the surface of the kingdom whenever they want to with regard to imposing income tax and sales tax and looking at us as the revenue\nOr and they went\nTo they want to maintain and retain that as an legislative right to do that\nA and a ... and the third thing is is is spending women are they saying well you know it's not our money so it doesn't come out of my wallet comes out of the ball to other people so it doesn't matter whether or not we deficit spending we're spending our children and grandchildren's\nFuture so to me what option are they looking at I to me it just doesn't make any sense\nAnd in Michael ... have you ever had ... someone who didn't sign the pledge give you a reason I mean or do they just generally not go there with you\nThey generally not go there or they will\nThey'll just say that they have a difficulty signing pledges of one or the or the second thing is they'll put me off on their campaign manager or something like that and give me the run around in ... re you need to get in touch with Joe blow you know and\nTo me as a representative can't stand up and give you a plane answer and they have to take you through some labor into a\nYou know managers or whatever that I Wonder what they're going to do in general as far as representing the people if they you know if they can't make decisions are without consulting or\nYou know the people that are making those fundamental decisions because these are these are fundamental decisions I feel that uh you know how how do we as a symbol government\nAbsolutely so Michael ... where do you in your constellation of you know sort of critical things that have to happen this year how critical is it for us to take back the state house\nWell I'm assuming the ... when you mean uh she mean conservatives censor absolutely\nOkay because uh I Am a major advocate of mark a fish out in a big like a he's running and I'm you know when I look at his race\nAh I consider even though mark as a libertarian or it might it might surprise people but there are extremely conservative libertarians in the state of Alaska I'm I'm In fact one of them and mark fish is one of 'em and and then you a I have a libertarian roots and you're very conservative as well\nSo there's a tremendous amount of conservative or libertarians and so when I look at that race out there with mark Neumann and mark fish I Know two years ago when mark Neumann sat on the I chaired the finance of the house finance as co chair\nI he added back three hundred million dollars back into the budget\nYou know do the Republican legislators worked or their tails off to find cuts within the budget and then the coach air just in one fell swoop added three hundred million bucks back into the budget so I have a real hard time calling a mark Neumann\nA conservative based on his record so when you're talking about conservatives taking back the house I Would fully agree with you that is absolutely\nBecause again my identity needs that to have an effective administration\nI I Would uh I did where you're coming from and you know Michael when you look at\n'em\nYou know and I want to have a conversation with you with regard to\nYou know what do you think the priority for the next legislature has to be in terms of you know let's say the Republicans get the state house back let's say that that happens what do you you know January twenty Nineteen what's priority number one for the new speaker majority leader co chairs of finance\nWell lie you obviously want them to line up behind governor done done maybe\nAre and what does that mean while you have to look at what his vision is okay ah he has a very large vision on a multitude of levels\nBut that there's two major invasions that he has one is is that he wants to tackle the crime issue\nI mean uh the the essential\nOr responsibility of government is to make sure that the citizens are safe correct and so I you know that crime issue isn't just adding more police officers there is a it is much more complex than that and so uh you know Michael wants to be addressed that very directly\nAnd the second thing is economic development I mean if we don't have an economy we're not going to a deal with the crime issue because obviously a lot of crime comes with the you know a diminished economy\nAbsolute folks this is my Michel chambers the king of liberty on the hour this is ten eighty am Ninety five point one Afghan number five six Nineteen\nOne PIN number five six Nineteen eighty [noise]\n\n\n[noise]

FM dot com\nAnd fight for\nFree speech is your First Amendment rights expression\nAnd gentlemen Mrs Caesar Martin soon with the king of liberty Michael Chambers back on the hour we're discussing property rights and there are the importance of property rights in protecting the environment so Michael you were addressing the fact that in the state of Alaska we only have one percent private property in the state of Alaska\nAnd so from your perspective you know how does the sixty two percent\nLand ownership in our state um you know with regard to property rights in the environment what what are the negative impacts on you know that you see there\nTheir property rights in the environment what what are the negative impacts on you know that you see there\nWell first off I Want to talk about the twenty four percent that the state of Alaska actually does on the sixty two percent we can work on that a little later on but you're talking about the uh twenty four percent the state of Alaska actually owns\nTo me um if you take all state highways which we do you know we we don't have as many as we should have but for those that we do have and we have a Jason property\nA that is state owned I Would suggest that we should get into an aggressive convenience of that land into private ownership\nBecause you have access to the roads and uh so I'm not talking about you know some small planned out mental flats or whatever\nYou know I'm Talking about are conveying that land directly to the citizens in a very aggressive manner\nA and there's a lottery or whatever like that you know I Would I like to see that 'cause I don't want you know just the well to do or have you know the the ... of the land private ownership\nBut once we have that to go back to the specific I address that you were talking about is with regard to environmental concerns\nI'm from a libertarian perspective where are we believe in a three things are are foundational a philosophy is life liberty and property correct\nAnd so when you look at property a perfect example of that is if you look at the history of environmentalism in Alaska the uh you'd have to go right back to the valleys oil spill is\nProbably the most devastating a environmental catastrophe that we had here in Alaska other than what the federal government brings here because they're the biggest polluter in Alaska but we won't go there\nSo uh in specific to the valleys or oil spill I founded egregious that ah that in fact that those are the individuals that were impacted\nOr without oil spill went for years and years and in fact many of them passed away without having any kind of a you know a ... or ... or ... remuneration with regard to the ah you know\nThe actions of a a lost income and lost property and so as a libertarian we believe that there should be a direct connection with regard to the violation of your personal property to you being compensated\n[noise] you're listening to the editor of show on conservative talk K O away in Ninety five point\nAM and K O ... dot com [noise]\nLadies and gentlemen this is the seas are Martin sitting back on the hour with the king of liberty the numbers five six nine ten eight and [noise]\nSo you don't Michel ... the question that I that I've been asking for wanting to ask you um\nYou know and it's in regards to you know I I always I always love getting into history with you 'cause you're such a well read individual when it when it comes to history and so forth and ... you know when it comes to\nYou know a ... a conservative\nCourt or liberty minded person running for office\nYou know who is someone that you would recommend you if you if I went to you Michael and said hey\nYou know I I'm a liberal minded person running for office\nUm you know who's who's you know as sort of a historical or a figure that you always recommend that people look at if someone in your mind you know who's been an advocate for liberty someone that was really a defender of free markets and sort of the open society I mean my recommendation\nOf someone that I always sort of uses historical example is Margaret Thatcher I mean I've always sort of use tourists were the models someone who really defended free markets in the open society but who's your person that you kind of look to from a historical eagle\nWell depends on what subject matter if you're if you're talking about education there's nobody greater than Milton Friedman\n[laughter] you know that's the bottom line there so it depends on what subject matter you're looking at um if you're looking at a you know the human condition um I think that you have to look to Martin Luther king\nUm you know so uh you know it just depends on what perspective you're looking at um you know ... I mean you know incredible person um I happen to be I'm\nFortunate enough to be on a in Lafayette Park you know we're Lafayette Park is I I Do not it's across the street from the White House and I was in Lafayette Park when I'm a knock them begging and Anwar Sadat\nA sign the Camp David accords I happened to be there at that ceremony out in the in the yard there and I was a you know I was inspired and move by Anwar Sadat because uh you know he was a man of peace\nAnd uh and that was saying something because any any gave his life for that because he was a an Arab and he said that you know we can't continue this conflict for thousands and thousands of years we have to come to the\nTo the table of democracy and to the table a peacekeeping and he stepped from the ranks of the of the Arab nations and made peace with\nAnd he stepped from the ranks of the of the Arab nations and made peace with a with the a nation of Israel and I was moved to tears in that regard because uh I was a you know able to witness that\nThat coming together and that spirit of human manifestation that we can in fact to exist on earth and and be peace loving and and uh be people that are recognized and appreciate the\nThe other people the the the people that aren't necessarily um you know a line with us ah you know I think it's really easy for us to love the loved it's much more difficult for us to love the un loved\nAnd so it just depends on what you're looking at from ... perspective of historical figures uh to me I I don't think that Jesus is\nThe best I think that Jesus [laughter] reality in a certain\nWay I look to his a consideration for his sacrifice that ... that he gave all of us so you know way if I'm looking from a historical perspective I certainly would recognize that his a contribution to humanity\nI absolutely I you know Michael you mentioned you know you mentioned Mahatma Gandhi and and Dr King and I you know my my family um the strictly my grandmother was involved in the civil rights movement and at one point in her life had the honor of actually meeting Dr kidding\nI'm having a face to face with him and so you know from a liberal you know from your perspective you know from a libertarian perspective I suppose\nYou know what what influence would you say Dr King or or gundy have had you know on you personally in your activism as a libertarian but or even what you would say would be their influence more broadly on the libertarian move but if you see any\nWell it's very clear um to me you know what a doctor a king spoke about as he spoke about the contents of a character\nAh everything else has diminished from that uh you know too many times we have a man that's one of the things I have a issues with the left\nIs they have a tendency to ah to block people up into the correct classes and uh you know and so when Dr as being a king spoke of the content of a character\nA that is the most important thing and so when you look at the content of a character what does that mean it means that we all have a meaningful existence on a on the earth and that we should in fact be reinforcing each other's meaningful existence instead of you know tearing each other down\nAnd so to me what Dr King ah stood for as he stood for that ah that we all are on a you know we're all on a continuum of looking for what our legacy is what our destiny is and what our legacy is in the ... and we should help each other out in that regard\nWe all fall short of that I Do uh I think of human beings do\nUh but I think that we should keep that in mind that ah you know to ... raise up the individual to the highest potential possible and that's what Dr King speaks about very uh poignantly is is that uh you know we're here to to make the best legacy as a human being that we can\nI you know Michael ... with regard to that you know with regard to your comments I mean I you know one of the things that\nYou know I find interesting and in you know I mean Dr King's wife and his public witnesses\nOr influence my life in terms of my mind gauge meant in politics um that I can actually send me the reason why ultimately came to the liberty movement was because of\nMy family background with the civil rights movement because you know the civil rights movement was was really predicated on two things you know the holy Bible and the declaration of independence you a spiritual freedom and political freedom and\nYou know when you look at at at what the left is doing in terms of\nUh those two issues I mean the the spiritual freedom is not there especially when you look at the first amendment attacks that they're watching on\nUm forest bakers and others and and even what we're seeing our college campuses denying people the ability to express themselves and you're definitely seeing on the political freedom um you're seeing the regulatory state and the assaults that are going on there but\nYou know one of the things Michael about Dr King is always amazed me is that whole idea uh that that notion and a very powerful notion that he put forward about content of character has really been lost\nIn our modern age it seems with the rise of identity politics as gray and the and the and the sort of what I call the grouping of American I'd love to hear your perspective on you know have we\nYou know fifty years after Dr King's I'm very public witness do you think that something's been lost in translation as far as his message and you know his his public witness I mean do you feel like we've kind of in some ways in in our modern political environment do you feel like we've abandoned certain principles that he was putting forward\nOh absolutely absolutely um [noise] I guess uh you know where are you know if I'm looking at a device or mechanism to to um encourage us to be more fulfilled in our life\nI Would suggest it probably education is a one of those mechanisms that we should certainly employ as much as possible and you know it really bothers me badly as you know a former educator and uh that are that are public education program has gotten to the extent that it has\nAnd uh you know Abraham Lincoln said years ago you are you show me who controls your education and I'll show you your future\nAnd uh you know I absolutely believe that so you know to me if we're going to look at it as social mechanism to move forward\nI wouldn't suggest that the education a construct is probably the best and that's where I come with I'm Milton Friedman is he believes in the free market of education and I fully him embrace that\nAnd your wife when you look at education\nYou know and I know you either you are I Believe that education is sort of you know you would agree with me that education is the civil rights issue of our time absolutely in terms of in terms of the outcome and what's happening especially for um for you know for children of color especially in our inner cities or even in rural Alaska\nOr what's going on folks we have to uh go to break but Michael and I will be getting an education and the uh what is your is not happening or it's a ten eighty and Ninety five point one FM the numbers five six nine ten eighty please join the conversation [noise]\nYou know and that's my perspective but I I guess what is your perspective around the case\nWell my perspective as they only ruled on a one on for a items of complaints and the one that the superior court ruled on first was the first item and as a have you seen the decision or have you read the complaint I\nMy I have a I have not yet unfortunately I've ah I've not been able to but I'm please go ahead\nOkay well as you are no judgment and that's what they got a decision on they both agreed to ask for and pleaded for some regards to the ... burrow\nA admitted to certain facts\nOf which has taken place and uh I like you I sort of wonder about ACLU but they weren't backing to other individual\nThat ... that had been discriminated against and and they allow them at one time to say a vacation and then the second time around they as they come up with a new policy and eliminated them from it they're alive the problem\nAnd that was what the case was about first there was three other items under that complaint one was the first amendment right to speak\nOr the other one was due process and the other one was the right of assembly and from what I read of the complaints and the decision I I Believe that the sphere court right or did the right thing and they said at the ... the judge said at the end\nThat it didn't I'm I'm getting a how what was the right of the word like I've got the case with me but I'm On the road it didn't reach he didn't have to reach\nTo make decisions on the first amendment or the other two come fight so under certainly judgment as you might know that if your school on\nLaw cases in which I Am because I Do the borough before under and might might be able to tell you about that so yeah and I it's something I don't really want to elaborate on but I get\nA have a ruling against me by somebody judgment and that I Am I correct in a different way and there's pretty vital a\nConcerns within our borough I find I Believe despair court did the right thing I Believe that currently until they are changed the horror of the race resolution\nThat they're in violation of our state constitution and that's pretty bad when you have somebody is where out and then the court finds them in violation so that's where I stand if not about and it was not about eliminating prayer at all I Am supportive of\nOkay it was a lemon adding those that go give prayer but\nI guess the the I guess the the issue to me as an end part of it is I'm familiar you know and with with the federal jurisprudence\nAnd you know if you go to you know the federal jurisprudence particularly the\nUm the township of Greece a case which I which is a case out of New York\nUm where the Supreme Court and a five to four decision ruled in favor of the township of breeze um you know the federal the U.S Supreme Court has established that you know local a city councils and in just one of the city council but legislative bodies\nHave extremely broadly way when it comes to the invocation of prayer in terms of who they who they want 'em to\nUm give the invocation and you know the Supreme Court has established essentially that religious leaders bodies\nUm do not have to give you know do not have to let him read denomination everything needs to be represented as far as the invocation of prayer goes and\nYou know so without being said from the from the federal jurisprudence I largely agree with that jury springs because they think legislative bodies as a whole need to be able to have to have the freedom if you will to to determine you know internally who you know who and and and you know it was going to do that\nUm so that's you know the federal jurisprudence that I Am familiar with I haven't actually read the case it would be interesting to see if it goes to the Alaska Supreme Court in ... Alaska Supreme Court would rule with regard to the establishment clause of the state constitution\nWell um he did or you know elaborate a little bit on those protections are under our state constitution the right to privacy and some other comment the millionaire a particular judge in this case\nAnd you know I'm On\nThe way I read it it's pretty clear if if he made a summary judgment based on the fleeting and after Pearl and in fact pass something that says you got to be a nonprofit recognized as a religion and on the Kenai finance or otherwise you were not going to let you\nUm you know because there isn't\nA mile a mile a mile and a a a strong Muslim a\nOn a keen eye because there isn't a strong Jewish faith or a church\nBecause there is strong Jewish faith church a these are the people that were amongst others that are going to be there and the court ruled on that\nYou know we got to go back and why it first came to America\n\nRight it went into it and I\nDon't know yet I gotta\nI gotta cut you off because we're going to break folks it's a ten eighty am this is Ninety five point one ap in numbers five six nine ten eighty\nThese shows you know the the

you so\nYou don't have to form you said they did get into the issues regarding you know waste in state government in right what what was the response from the Democrats at that debate\nI you know each of them said that they couldn't ah is it there may be a waste there may be some things because they thought we had cut to the bone already know it puts his perspective\nA\nFive hundred million bucks last year\nThat's not cuts guys I read financial statements I was right here for three years and a perfectly I'm I'm the worst nightmare when when people are engaged in reading the financial state and you see that they they come home and they say oh\nYou know we got to the ball and we can't cut anything else uh if\nYou're the Washington Monument strategy that's been played a federally for years and years and that is if you if you tell everybody you got to close the Washington Monument because of budget cuts then you don't have to cut other stuff and uh\nBecause of budget cuts then you don't have to cut other stuff\nAnd and the other stuff is where the problem is you know we need to be to to have an accountable state government as well as an accountable federal government and we can't yeah we are so blessed to have the permanent on as an assistant in that thing because\nThe planning on a permanent fun\nWas to have those investment earnings be able to replace oil when the price of oil went down or the volume went down\nWhen Jay Hammond put me on that little group the investment advisory committee planning this\nIn Nineteen Seventy five we planned the investment strategy for the permanent and finally planned the corporate structure for the fun in Seventy five we knew that oil is going to go down we thought that brutal day\nWas going to last for Twenty years and then be done it's now forty one and it's still life Neal gal let me tell you that they find a new feels up there and we're actually adding production\nTo or the like\nThe Democrats don't want to talk about that they don't want to talk about the note to the financial statements on the spring of a revenue forecast that says that for every dollar increase\nA past sixty three dollars or the state revenue goes up by Seventy five million dollars per year\nWell Jim Jim we've got a Michael Chambers and he wants to ask my question\nYeah yeah you know Jim you got a two weeks now to a you know run the court here you know a foot ball in a basket you know and uh so I obviously a minnow the you're ... you're not a an extremely wealthy man\n\nThis is Caesar are Martin ... and Michael Chambers back on the hour I'm\nAddressing issues of liberty and politics and the great state of Alaska I'm Michael I have a fun question that I Want to ask you so one of my favorite science fiction writers of all time is Robert Heinlein\nIn one of the reasons why I Love Robert Heinlein is because Robert de highland um is really I mean he brought libertarianism into science fiction\nA and really promoted a liberty and and ... you know liberty in the science fiction genre\nAnd so a question that I have for you is there someone you know from a cultural aspect to writer painter I'm sculpture et cetera that you consider to be someone who's been an advocate for even musician\nWho's been an advocate for liberty and who's used their cultural position to push it you know liberty or in the culture\n[laughter] well that's a open ended question there so uh I'm going to take it someplace else okay so uh I think George Carlin\nWas okay it's just so we are just the\nPerspective you know I I think George Carlin is just a hero of mine you know in the sense that are speaking for free will perspective a and you know some people might find that that's a kind of crazy because you know I I uh have a spiritual life and I'm a Christian and\nJoined it as you things to say about\nThat but uh you know I obviously if you look at the history of our accomplishments through the music to to uh\nYou know I I Would I was raised in Idaho where the bar so I listen to an awful lot of country music over the years you know and you know I've always uh really appreciated the Okie from Muskogee and [laughter] so\nUh in Nineteen sixty to my mother had we listening to Willie Nelson when nobody knew who Willie Nelson was so uh you know but uh you know in the art you're looking at the individual and uh you know you're looking at their accomplishments a rather be through music or through the or\nWe can get into an entire genre of a art and art history because obviously that's a substantial background that I Do have but ah\nYou know I if I was to look at from our perspective from a painting perspective I uh you know I obviously I'm totally in love with a bunch of them go and what his accomplishments where with regard to are leaving his legacy of expression and from an individual perspective\nSo Michael you as an artist 'cause man I I I I got to get into this with you on an art now you know Michael when it when it comes to our I think that\nYou know I mean I think art is you know is it just incredibly beautiful medium and um you know especially with regard to painting I mean I I have um you know my preferences but you know what ... you know but you've been a landscape painter\nI'm going to use your work and it's absolutely beautiful I mean ... you know it's it's I mean the the the the detail and just you know what you do with canvassing the pain is is incredible but\nUm you know there's different schools in in painting you know you've got the hubs Hudson River school you've got neo classical broke you know what's a what's a school or movement in painting that has influenced you in your in your life as an artist\n... well you know that's an interesting question um you know obviously from a landscape perspective landscaping or as a where I even though I Do portray a portrait\nThe landscape painters or where I even though I Do portray a portrait portray work and things of that nature mostly I Do landscape um primarily because I Want to tell my story and you know if you want to tell your story and here in Alaska and art is the you know\nBe a little bit hard for you not to tell the story of the land\nA bit the Hudson Bay a painters in the late Eighteen sixties Eighteen seventies the uh is very interesting because the very first international artist or because you know the rest of the world was looking at a America what was going to be our expression\nWhat would be our contribution to the world of art\nAnd by the Hudson Bay painters and Frederic church was the very first recognized international artist of of America and he was recognized for pure landscape\nAnd a lot of people find that kind of surprising that they think well didn't they appear landscape a prior to that in the European\n... experience and they know they didn't so it was very unusual for them to have your landscape and he was a ... or you know had castles in it or things of that nature so the Alaskan expression was a ... and the ah American expression was pure\nAn adult rated landscape and his purest form and ah so are people that want to look at our\nHeritage from an art from an American perspective a pure landscape and the beauty of the land\nA is a ... is our first expression internationally expression and it also is a Frederic church was very much into manifest destiny and um he\nExpressed ... manifest destiny that what made us different as he or from the Europeans was our\nAh was our land and so he expressed that through the painting medium of the awesome beauty of land and I think that uh whether you're born here in Alaska or do you move here to Alaska that's a major part of a of who we are as is the relationship that we have with land\nYeah Mike I Want to ask you a question 'cause I you know I have always been a a landscape painter that Israel\nHas moved me and I I consider her the greatest landscape painter the twentieth century was George ...\nWonderful I mean I find her her desert over murals particularly her desert murals and just her paintings around life in the desert [noise]\nUm I mean some of it has left me in tears to be quite Frank with you it is just so beautiful what she captured\nOr in the desert of New Mexico\nAnd when I've looked at your work I mean just the way sometimes the strokes and so forth I I've seen it maybe it's just me but I've seen you know a little bit of Georgia O'Keefe in your work and I just want to ask if she did you ever study her work has she ever been an influence on you or is that just kind of me seeing a bitter for work in yours\nUm you know I really admire ah Georgia Keith ... especially her\nYou know she had a lot of sensitivity toward the paint 'em which was amazing and so I really like to look at it a lot of different artists in a in look at you know their expression but ah\nThere's a lot of ah if I were to look at a contemporary pain hurry and not so contemporary but Edward Hopper or the way that he painted in the emotion that he put into his scenes\nAre in the light that he had any scenes you know so it's one thing to paint in detail and it's another thing too but to expressing emotional content in paint is you know truly amazing and especially from a ... perspective because\nYou know I think that it's relatively uh easier like if you're doing portrait you're and you're doing human figures because you know the viewer will always take a a human and say can be ... and the emotion there they'll see an emotion\nBut when a painter can actually painted emotion into a landscape that to me is amazing and you're exactly right George ... keep did that\nYes you did I ... you know is there a particular period in you know kind of getting in our history you know you've got broke you've got neo classical you've got Roman Greco I mean is there a period Michael\nThat you know if you were if you if if someone came to you and was was speaking about art or trying to get into you know trying to find inspiration a particular period of art history for their own\nYou know either study or just trying to get into the the artistic a career is there a particular period that you would recommend that you've looked at that's been inspirational to you\nWhile a you know I've been a lover of a of a lot of different expressions of the arts um what I Would recommend to folks is to look into the ...\nWhich was a post ah impression is them\nUm they had such a free use of paint and the expression and uh it was kind of like they found the medium between paint and the person\nAnd a Vincent van Gogh was right on that edge but the farms are very interesting because they uh they divided in pain itself and\nAnd so they're landscapes were real vibrant they you know abstract in a certain nature but still impressionistic so if you really wanted to study a particular one I Would say there but you know I mean we can go with\nIt but you know here in Alaska\nWe are incredibly blessed because there is no state in the union that has more art uh cultures than the state of Alaska we have like seven eight major our cultures right here\nAbsolutely folks we got to go back to break but ah we're going to be back on the hour with Michael Chambers and looking at are looking at art history it's ten eighty am Ninety five point one FM and the number is five six nine ten eighty my\nMom is that no one is\nThat all my son they learn it stars the bad loans turning\nMama couldn't tell me\n\n\nWant to ride momma\nAnd and it was the most photographic painting you could ever imagine and when you've got to close since I was phone thump rent that he actually did as just like the mechanism of genius\nAnd I also was in the modern museum of art and I came around the corner and they had a piece of plywood there\nAnd I was like wow that's crazy a piece of plywood why would that be ours [laughter] when I got closer to it I realized it was a painting of a piece of plywood [laughter] and I thought wow you know that is an expression of our of us\nYou know of our culture right now I mean what is more quintessential\nThan a piece of plywood you know so I understood that communication between that piece of artwork now would I say that that's up there with the Sistine Chapel of course I wouldn't you know but as far as what that expression was\nI also saw um oh I I don't know they were probably eight foot tall or Mick Jagger I'm Andy Warhol he painted Mick Jagger needed five of 'em and they were in an amphitheater of ah five and they were all exactly the same but colored different and I stood in front of the painting and I heard rock and roll\nComing out of paint and I and I got it I understood I thought wow this is a genius that he could actually paint\nIn a modern sense that I could hear rock and roll coming out of paint\nSo you know but I again getting back to Alaska we have such a rich tradition of a of the ... amazing that we have such a you know\nUh we have the claim it and we have the ... with their blankets and we had the Clintons with their totem poles and their carvings and their\nTheir ships in boats and we have the ... with their kayaks in with their spirit masks and we have the new the act with again with their suit spirit mass and their carvings of ... and things of that nature and then we have the ...\nAnd ... and there and then we have all the sub um you know the sub categories of the different uh the ... in the you know in in the Athabaskan with their with their work with the um the leather and\nMoves hide in there and they're a beating and things of that nature you know and to recognize that ah\nThere's just something about art that's in ... it's in the DNA of every culture on the planet earth and for us here in Alaska to have such a rich tradition I Would highly recommend that everybody go down to the uh live or to the museum here\nThe only thing I don't like is obviously the admission charge there you know but uh\nYou know to go down there and to see what a rich history we have um I had the opportunity to go visit with a a a Bob Gillum before he passed away here uh recently I I went to his office a couple of times and he had a actually twenty seven originals\nOf a sudden you Lawrence and while I was just a totally amazing and\nThere was one that he had which was a water color of a of Sydney Lawrence in Sydney Lawrence didn't do very many watercolors at all beautiful thing and so the second time that I went in I asked Bob I said could I could I get up close and take a look at that and he says oh by all means\nAnd so I got up real close and took a look at the water color or sitting oranges and\nYou know as an artist where he tried to do is you try to absorb as much as you possibly can with these people and let them you know it's just like going to uh it's just like going to church you know why do you go to church where you go to church because one it's you know it's the house it'd be a father but the second thing is you want to be inspired\nSo so Michael if if your Bill Gates came to you know Bill Gates came and said why climate billionaire and you know I I had the ability to really invest in our you know for personal collection and I want you to be my personal advisor\nTo to help me build an art collection you know what would be your advice CIA to the gates came in and said man we're going to I Need I Need your assistance Michael to build a ...\nUh that's interesting that you could say that you know I I've knock\nOn doors for years of you know many of the people that know me know that I was direct sales person for years and knock on a person's\n... was actually a carpenter for Bill gates and his house\nAnd a a a bill had about three hundred carpenters they show up when buses you know when they were working on each house for years and years\nWell this guy had been working there for years and he came a to Bill Gates house at a time where there was a that that it was a vacation and people were gone and it was a a holiday so\nThe the security guards knew him quite well so they said well you know whatever you can work on whatever you want to the guy was an amazing uh\nWith uh with woodwork and so he ran right down to the um to the\nLibrary of Bill Gates or and the reason why he did that is because Bill Gates owns the books of Leonardo da Vinci\nSo he bought those so why he bought those books you know we see those things have or helicopters and tanks and all that Bill Gates actually owns\nA ... a books and this guy was thumbing through them sitting there and his library something through a litter or did Vinci's a book so I I don't know if I could uh I if I could top that but uh you\nKnow a bill most definitely has that uh if I if I were to say bill you need to invest I Would\nHighly recommend are there's quite a few people I recommend but certainly Vincent van Gogh would be right up there you know with regard to the work that he did a rather not he could\nGather any of his work because you know the law that's definitely good bill has money so possibly but\nI I mean I think probably the most emotional piece of for me from a from Vincent and goes crows over a cornfield which they attribute that to be his last piece\nWhen the last three or four days where you could really see a Vince has worked falling apart you know the human condition he was losing his spirits and\nYou could literally see it in the paint and so to have any of those pieces of those last a week of uh Vince is work would be a you know beyond measure\nSo Michael you know I I ah folks we've got to go\nOn major\nSo Michael you know I I ah folks we've got to go to break but we'll be back on the hour ten eighty am Ninety five point one than the numbers five six nine ten
