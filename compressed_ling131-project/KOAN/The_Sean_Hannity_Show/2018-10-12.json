this problem or is this just way it is it's just part of a the cycle of of of the earth\nI mean are are we do believe that this was specially made for us in that it'll never change and it'll always be the same way and therefore you know we'll have this cozy place to live all all of our lives\nAnd you know for hundreds and hundreds of years to go forward or do we believe is at some point in time to

uh\nArticulate but let's face it\nWe've seen dinosaurs we seen animals change we seen things we've seen the earth change you know I I don't claim to be any sort of environmental professor for everyone I've talked to many of them\nAnd\nFor every one that says oh well you know the world's coming to an end men you know we're we're faced with this climate change in more global warming and and and we're all just going to die [noise] and and then for every one of them do you find you find somebody else a\nDisgrace the same\nDisgrace the same you know\nThere's people that think the earth and still flat empty so\nWell yeah and people want a little bit and he's er legit but I'm open like these people are legit groups\nYou know one ... edible\nCredible scientists you mean yeah yeah I don't want to ask anybody I can find anybody to tell me your story you tell me your love me\nBaby [laughter] just tell me your love OK you show I mean\nYou know the yeah throughout history we have ice ages and how you know there was an article at one time millions of years ago scientists have proven that it was a tropical climate and they found\nFossils of tropical plants there and stuff you know I mean on the on the time on\nIt all depends on the timeline you know on a timeline yes if anything's possible for millions of years they have all of these changes and stuff but you know I think yeah this is a factor to be said about the the earth just being its own system of of change like it is\nBut I mean I don't know if I'm ... but the increasing\n... the issues no doubt I mean when they had the Olympics in China they had to move like half the cars out of there because it was the air was so polluted\nMuck China's got a lousy well yeah I mean they they are they're lousy at it but it is our men and women were better at controlling the climate but there's no\nThere's not disputing that a bunch of engines running isn't that much I don't care about smog no no they they only did that for the Olympics yeah though yeah they don't care and it just it just because China doesn't care does that mean like we shouldn't we'd like hey that okay so we don't care\nYou know we shouldn't have that attitude either you know if you get a neighbor that doesn't go as yard do like forget it I'm going to start my own my yard no you just sit there ... what's your neighbor would keep up with his damn yard literally\nLike most stuff grow\nBut I've just say you know there could be factors everywhere and yes today it's fifty four degrees when you remember it being fifty four degrees this late in October but for never yeah exactly [laughter]\nSo I mean it I think that there's I think there is warming going on I think there's I don't know if it's global warming but I think Anchorage has changed\nI mean I think ... since I came here and Seventy one is a little kid nine years old ... winners don't seem as ... as rug it it does seem as no does seems snowy\nMaybe I was little so you know I thought a foot of snow was huge we're now I mean I think that ah I don't know what it was I I but I as a matter of\nBeing the kid here you know a um [noise] and you know when in the late eighties early nineties you know a\nThings are different trick or treating and that being you're walking through the snow yeah we're we're we're all bummed out yeah basically all we were were a bunch of kids in the winter gear\nWearing masks that's all you know you couldn't [laughter] it wasn't then it costs\nYou see your costs as you got a three inches down code on\nLike riding in ... when he was younger you are the spider man costume where they had to I mean it was always trying to pick his coat off you know because we want to look like spider you still look like spider in with the\nCode on [laughter] things I can show up my my costs and uh but when I get I get old sideways about all this\nI guess sideways about the fact that people claim that it's managed man made that that that that\nYou and I are the ones that are causing this uh this global warming now I don't dispute that the weather changes um I don't dispute maybe that the earth has warmed that's a fact scientific they can show that door earth has warmed up um I Believe in Anchorage\nJust weather has changed in the last Twenty years or so\nI I'm just not sure it's it's it revolves around me or I I think it's more cyclical and it's part of a a [noise]\nIt's just part of the world and the way the world turns um [noise] I I don't buy off on a lot of\nThis man made issues and that's just that's just me and and there's plenty of scientist that back that up and there's plenty scientist that disagree\nEstimates the same as in the facilities alone to say it could be about three million I don't know what that has to do with\nA direct connection as do as\nClimate change and whatever I mean how does it cost more when there's less no [noise]\nOh yeah I I don't have to ration or more with less my problem is with the climate change people I just don't believe a lot of what you say and and so I when I read things I I read\nDid you say and and so uh when I read things I read it in probably sixty percent disbelief and and and because I I think it's less than climate change that if\nThey can find some way to save three million dollars I'm for that\nYeah if if there is normal reasonable thing to do they have\nThat how much is going to cost of looked like we said\nThe gamblers psych versus just [noise] cats are so expensive well I'm going to buy me a fifty thousand dollar Toyota or\n... or whatever you know ... and so yes ... is that what it is again elect Rick I don't like them yeah whatever piece a tin can thing I can run over my Yukon and when we see in a fiery crash in\nOne of the things I probably wouldn't even notice that I probably just run right over it just like a like a ball Priuses\nAre are pretty steady and we talk about those smart cars more small priest and Amy other\nThan English people spent forty thousand dollars on one of these cars\nOr they can do it I you know I'm not real good at math but if you think the new payment\nAnd the money spent on his car you're spending more money to save some money on gasoline now I'm sure if you own a car long enough you can advertise\nThis this this situation\nOver extended period of time and and you might you probably can maybe\nCome out ahead but I don't know how long you've got to do that because if you got to go down to spend four or five hundred dollars a month on a new car payment and the one that you trade and then was paid off even though it it it only got fourteen miles\nA gallon of gas and this one here it gets forty two miles a gallon gas or one thirty\nDollar a buddy of mine uh he he owns a big dodge yeah hit a moose right in that thing but then they actually gave them a previous is alone or has alone and it it's a he traveled from the valley right when he was like wow really notice the guy oh I bet it was a crazy but like the car\nWhen the engine does that electric it makes like no no no no is it all of like\nHe rolled away like say goodbye to the holy coil I heard was like but we like like it was being like just pushed by an invisible force it was weird 'cause I've been in a few ... yeah yeah I Do yeah\nThey start off and there's like no no sound and then but you know like they go faster than than than an engine kick\nButt heads the expense of any new cars\nBut yeah so you when you start adding up forty thousand dollars for a new car\nAnd the payment over five or six years\nOr even if you pay cash for whatever I mean I [noise] and you start calculating the difference in gas prices and then how much cash miles yours gives versus the ... I don't know\nBut\nI Know a lot of people by them I mean they they go oh I got to save money on gas and they go out and buy a brand new Prius\nWill how much that cost you are you really saving money\nHome but I'm saving the environment [laughter] Oh yes you are [laughter] you and\nYou're lonely self ... even the ... year just if you don't live in a good thing they can get another saving gas like my by Fred driving the pre if we have lots of gas but then you know you go to a less money in\nA park says he parked to that for you if you open up his garage has got you know for motorcycles six no [laughter] you like we've got no problem burning up you know like so I I'll save in gas in my previous book and burn it all up in my in my machine a motorcycle side by side [laughter]\nSide by side those things like twenty around so I\nI don't know it you know I I don't know the whole deals with this city program and I'm sure it's all done in good faith ... good intentions and\nAll that but um I I don't know I'm I'm not\nA big believer and all that in a I think it\nJust sometimes it's just it's more about\nIt's like the I Am pro career remember the I Am program\nMemory used to have to pay thirty dollars and then ten dollars for a ticket\nThe summit the city so you have new license plates I did that\nI Am program a zone Chevron station and originally I was the first one of the first people got into the industry and probably one of the last people leave and\nAnd that program lasted for years\nThat program lasted for years when it shouldn't have that that's the God's honest truth it it took it took at least three years for that program to end\nBefore they became a political pressure and the political votes on the assembly to end it\n\nIt was true we ... I attended the um\nThis is just the way government works to some of these environmental programs is not really\nExplain though I Am program for ... no well we all had to register or cars or OK yeah for those of you don't ... the station standpoint like I Want to know like how involved you are because you were you the ... a service station that you can\nCome up and get your whole yeah yeah there you know handle the ticket and we have to register and gives them a year and everybody\nDid yeah yeah so so the deal was with the with the ... let me just for those of you that maybe weren't aware of the of the um I Am program we call the admissions program inspection and mission litter anyway so\nWe did this since back in the late eighties\n\nAnd I'm Still about what five years ago so something like that and the whole idea was ... at first\nIn their early late seventies early eighties and all you know and people were knocking out the re the unleaded deal in their gas tank and so they could put regular in their cars so they could save a nickel or whatever it was a gallon gas and\nPeople were modified and our cars and kids remodeled foreigner cars and putting all these other things on it and and it\nChanged the whole emissions problems with cars and into cars just getting old and\nAnd and they just think right they get old and they're still run as well as like human beings right and so\nThe whole idea was hey we we got this emissions problem in our city and\nWhat it was as an inversion when when the cold weather came in they would lock there'd be like an inversion and it wasn't a lock their smog this dirty air in Anchorage that was a problem we had it wasn't wasn't wasn't necessarily a car problem but it was um it was an environmental problem\nWhere when cold weather came it would centrally just put like a lid over Anchorage and hold this\nDirty air right here because there was no breeze to to move it around to circulate\nSo smarter people than\nTo move it around to circulate so smarter people than us decided in the city that we're going out of the submissions program and we started the admissions program and we went all the way through and we did it for a long time we did it for twenty some Thirty years I don't know it was\nAnd and then when\nThe what happened was as people put modify their cars because they had to pass the I Am so and that is that kind of era left for kids weren't modifying or ours like I did\nAnd the cars coming out had better emissions exactly you know all the newer that had better mission actually you just nailed it\nIn the end\nIt wasn't about what people did to their cars that that ... you know stop doing their cars it wasn't about really the gasoline or anything it it was because they they started making this ethanol gas and and and and it was a little cleaner burning and blah blah\nYou know what really the the deal was is as time went forward as time went on the cars became more efficient cars became cleaner\nGM Detroit they they just made cars cleaner over time and what it ultimately did overtime\nOvertime it's solved the problem that just and all those old cars or now what they're dead right there and the junk yard or Twenty years old they're no longer on the road\nAnd so time attrition technology is what cure the problem but the but but what the deal was we had a problem cured\n\nBuddy Jim online [noise]\nLaws street rallies and the ...

gratified himself then he drove to his job and remember\nThey never charged with a sex crime in here in his own words he sent a needed her to think that I was gonna killer so that I could sexually gratified myself\nBut for some reason the court said oh well that's not a sex crime\nOr that isn't so tempted murder because oh you didn't you just needed to her to know I think that you think ... yeah well that's that's assault met\nHim in every choke somebody committed\nMurder yeah it doesn't matter that you didn't [laughter] it was important that she felt like I was going to murder I wasn't going to go to murder so that's okay right [laughter]\nNo it's not OK doesn't that changed the whole intent process right [laughter]\nI mean that would be his argument mine would be like no it's still attempted murder\nDenny drug dealers jobs in air traffic controller wall nice joke out some woman and Jackie laid on or kidnap or whatever and it's getting your truck get up there and start\nTelling our that's her poor aircraft encouraged tower [laughter] please turn right [laughter] I mean\n\nSince the woman did everything right she this is this is the former prosecutor talking\nThe woman did everything right she called nine one one went to the hospital detective Brett cyber said uh she was so traumatized she could barely speak like imagine so but she did the detective did everything right he got he got her to trust her to talk to him\nGathered physical evidence filed charges Schneider was quickly arrested the things I cannot reconcile or the apparent lack of support for the victims Schneider sentence\n\nAnd are just three days after the assault she appeared ... bail hearing she oppose releasing Snyder to his wife supervision and ankle monitor and thirty thousand dollar performance bar saying she feared for her safety\nThis is the victim prosecutors agreed with the arrangement Schneider got to go home the victim added to live in fear she testified at the grand jury shortly after this\nThat was the last time records show she appeared in the case\n\nOver a year later the prosecutor said he tried to reach her by phone for the sentencing he said he would have ah had the Senate detected to contact her he should have\nInvestigators you handle these cases are dedicated I Believe detective or cyber\nWho she trusts you would have gladly contacted her an offer her company her\nDo the sentence I Believe he would have done the same for the trial the department of law website describes victim witness coordinators their job to stay in touch with the victims answer their questions provides support and connecting with services\nI relied on the ones I I worked with immensely\nI see no mention of their role within this victim this was the prosecutor former prosecutor look in this case saying hey you know I I've I've witnessed see things have been involved in 'em and I don't see any connection with the witness\nCoordinator at all that victim coordinator in\nIn any kind of a response like that they had no no contact with this lady there with the services weren't provided\nBack the Schneider Schneider was sentenced to two years with one suspended and credit for time on house arrest no jail time to serve the prosecutor agreed to this\nHe said the citizens the range for Snyder's offense given his lack of criminal history was zero to two years\nShe says well that's partially true\nWhat was said is he could have filed statutory activators and argue they should've significantly increased that range what did we talked about\nWhat did we talk about Chris with with that Kimberley Williams lady who was heading up this rally Phil ... and we talked about mitigating factors aggravating factors and and that that those that I\nHave not having a criminal record before this you really jumped up you know this this is like oh you have no criminal record this this year for like first DUI so that when this is this is\nLike this mediated circumstance like you know despite you not having a real criminal record you really jumped into a real serious crime here and we've got to\nTailor a never ending centered aggravating factors mitigating bag right right and aggravating factor says normally is what happens in a case that's how you break it down and that's how you since people\nNow last week when I was talking generally waves I said listen I I'm no attorney but [noise] and and then and then I I brought up this aggravating factors and all that that none of this was an end and she agreed she she was\nYou know kind of and and I I think most of us are in an off about the whole thing\nDo\nWhat she says you couldn't uh filed statutory aggravating aggregators and argue they should significantly increase that range Snyder's case warning to statutory aggravated his conduct manifested delivered cruelty\nIt was among the most seriously included in the definition of the fence [noise]\n\nShe claims that I'm\nSchneider is a statistic\nIt's about power chaired that good gracious\nWill learn more when we come back [noise]\nBut somehow it does constitute a sexual crimes and everything about this story is about sex there's not one piece of is not about sex\nSays years is that the the former prosecutor writes the judge a\n... and this is something that that it goes directly to judge Corey the judge didn't have to accept this sentence the party's proposed he could have rejected it is too lenient which has been titled Snyder to withdraw his plead the\nProsecutors would have been been negotiating with the leverage that the court was not going to accept no jail time the judge could have deferred sentencing and ordered a pre sentence report\nThan down here she makes no she says Alaska law require judges balance certain factors in sentencing they included\nDefend its potential for rehabilitation the seriousness of the fence harm done to the victims need to deter the defendant another's community condemnation restoration of the victim and the community\n\nAnd the judge had other pet\nOther uh opportunities at his disposal judge Corey member that judge Corey judge Couric could have done more\nHere's another person who who's a former prosecutor coming out today and writing and linked to the editorial about the whole thing\n\nIs there was no mention of the victim or her harm\nCourt room of white collar professionals including the defendant all place more value on the defendant's possible future than the victims\nAnd what she had already suffered\nIf I a professional was self advocates advocacy skills and status impacted by my trauma were the victim I suspect the sentence would have been different\nThe\nProsecutor says the ... and it was losing his job was like a life sentence it wasn't it was a collateral consequences criminal conduct\n[noise] that's it that's exactly it\nLosing his job with the federal government for a lifetime is not a part of a sense\nIt's part of the collateral damage for his actions that's exactly right\nThis lady's got it vow van broccoli\nThat's a great last name ...\n... van Brock sounds like a huge wrestling is a former state and federal prosecutor in Alaska now trains and writes nationally and internationally on criminal justice leadership and ethics\n\nAnd then you know to me is you know let let's let's ah I don't use it like to play this card but I I think it's relevant in this in this story\nLadies' native\n... and that's all be ... and let's all us white folks out here and be honest okay let's just be honest one\n\nLet ... let me assume a couple of things first\nShe's native\nShe probably wasn't the most uh you know up and mobile person in Anchorage\nShe probably live you know close to the street not far from it probably wasn't you know headed to work or anything most likely maybe she didn't have a job\nShe needed a ride to her boyfriend was where she is that what the deal is needed a ride or ride on a she was a holiday it's been hard right though to looking for a ride German word for her boyfriend\nI Believe it was on this issue in that she probably isn't you know of upper status middle class that middle class upper status I I'm assuming that for the story\nAnd I'm ... it's an art in Minnesota and I'm probably right\nSo you know what the court ignored or you know why not ignoring her because there was nobody there to defend her see the judge\nThat you see when it goes down here and says ah there was no mention of the victim or her harm\n\nThe court room of white collar professionals including the defendant all place more value on the defendant's possible future\nThan the victims and what she had already suffered that's what happened in that courtroom\n\nThat's exactly what happened in that courtroom or you know whatever\nAh you know whatever\n\nYou just just a native ... native lady on Bernard wrong whatever them knows you know out running around the streets it ... it up in ... you know how those people are yeah you know then people\nAre yeah no I'm sure it's meant a lot of white folks she got away all of it on this Justin\nSchneider's the eagle river he works at the airport yeah but he came as a nightmare suit who made a mistake or something yeah this is just the ... that they weren't going to kill anybody you choke somebody and Jackie later this isn't a mistake that you make this is a walk with\nI'm guaranteeing judge just not or would grab some lady coming out of the ... of the house down town and she was dressed up with a briefcase and everything and getting ready to get in there are a fancy car in age actor and all that I bet you'd be a different deal\nSome white lady\nI'm Johnny I'm playing the race card here it goes I think is true I think they give a rat's ass about that native lady be honest with you I don't think they really care I think that there was a you know what\nI mean if they get they would have been there there would have been something in this story\nYou there's nothing in the story I don't care what story I've read there's nothing you're about to judge you know talking about the victim and the victim and you know this isn't that man it's all about the students all about this like a ... aircraft control guy\nYou want to talk about some races that some races crap right there John ya\nAt white folks need wake up and and and and be honest

anyways a at a at a place or will it will be here but anyways uh soon we will be speaking with secretaries VA so there you go\nAh [noise]\nYou know I Know it's a it's not the pro probably appropriate question it it has no bearing but but when is the sexual stuff going to stop you know we got now we've got to\n\nNow we got a trooper or a village safety officer I guess that's how you would refer to him as a tribal police officer in ... river near Bethel has been arrested for sexually abusing a minor\n...\nYou know look it was a teacher here last week and it's it's just crazy Schneider guide or for the FBI or of course this lady as an adult\nIt it it seems like I mean every day in the paper or\nWherever you're reading somewhere that there's some ... some some kid getting molested it's just\nOr worse like or a little girl on top of you you know\nThere you go see our forgot about her that poor little girl\nYeah and and it happens\nAnd and some things happened and we don't know about that's that's the ones you know a lot of them happened we don't even know about it here I forgot about that poor little girl because if you already that on that was two weeks ago\nAnd uh\nAny ways that the arrest was part of another investigation into a sexual assault on the job Alaska say ... percent\n\nYou know these via cells or village safety officers are hired out of the village are there they\nLived there and you know they're not they're not troopers but but there are there that try to there are there are representing\nThe troopers trying to keep some peace in order to make sure that people don't get to outline they got a little holding thing they can hold people live if necessary and and until they can get the troopers and they call the troopers and they fly in and then they they handle it up gay somebody got you know a little bit too wild\nUm the via cells play an important role\nOr they don't get paid enough and they're probably you know um they don't have a lot of support a bit but anyways that's got to be a tough ... you know you grow up with these people you know there's two three hundred people in a village\nYou know you know everybody in Iraq whatever they you're probably having to deal with your cousin exactly somebody you know oh yeah oh yeah yeah everybody first name oh yeah\nGot to be a tough job but still action like this anyone molested it's not a ... yeah use\nYeah the job might be tough that don't mean you got to go out and molest little girls\nAnd\nAnyways the arrest was part of another investigation of sexual assault on job the agency's violent offender unit on Monday arrested twenty two year old\n\n... not the act I don't know how to say a tribal police officer William Smith for second degree sexual abuse of a minor\nAccording to a trooper dispatch Thursday they're asked was made during a separate investigations charges Smith sexually or assaulted a woman in his care for protective custody at the public safety office trooper said uh they describe that as an unrelated\nTo the sex abuse case investigation continues more charges are to follow true per se\nBut this is a this this is just some of this is just\nGetting out of hand yeah war one is too many and man who answered the phone Thursday at the village tribal office said no comment sorry\nUm\nThe village traveled government never submitted Smith named to the Alaska police standards counsel as required by notification of laws Alaska department of public safety spokesmen Johnson Taylor said Thursday I didn't know they had to submit so for some reason they didn't submit the guy's name to ah\nFor for ah for clearance a rarely followed state regulations says village and tribal governments are supposed to notify the council within thirty days of a new police higher so I guess it's\nPar for the course\nIt's probably hard to get somebody to do the job who who who who wants to do it you know who wants to go tell their uncle\nFred that hey you got a pipe down or I'm and a half to arrest you write or your Uncle Tom or your brother neck or somebody right 'cause that's how it is and again\nThe walking into a domestic violence yeah scenario where you know the people you know why is your own family I asked my cousin ...\nYou know they're all in it and then they look at you because like maybe your the younger brother to tell you shut up right\nBecause it's all family and I and I lived in the village for a while with my father\nHe was doing some public health service work the building water and sewer projects and stuff and so I Lived there for a few years you know I went to University in high school or junior high and all that so I I I Lived up there in in ...\nAnd ... and and so for a few years so I became very very much custom to village life and how it worked so I speak with some ... some authority I\nHope but hey I don't know Fleetwood Mac there man I wouldn't solve Fleetwood Lyndon I did a few years back down to the coma dome or or what's\nHer name Stevie Nicks she was getting it girl I mean she was just on fire oh yeah she had all the beads and uh\nOh I mean she was just on fire oh yeah she had all the beads in the in the ... the scars and
