I I I'm trying to put together in my mind her her political a pathway to victory in four and a half years or ... we'll see a lot of people forget\nYou forget about this this is well this is a lot of people forget you know and a half years as long a long time a vice president might even think she'd be doing the tactic like this if it was an election year\nA vice president might even think\nShe'd be doing the tactics like this if it was an election year\nAre\nProbably not probably not have either I really I you know I'd have to I have to apologize listeners 'cause I I I was wrong on this deal was flat wrong in this deal and uh\nAnd and I I I thought I had it right I thought in the end um and and I don't know if I was alone or not but I thought in the end Lisa Murkowski would would would come over oh I\nWonder how that was I felt the same thing you did I mean I thought I thought she was just you know elections for those those people that wrote her name yeah to be Joe Miller I but ultimately she was just going to side with the you know what her daddy's\nHer her dad and her dad his party her dad would have voted yes we all know that anybody knows Frank Murkowski knows even voted yes ah so ah she broke she broke from her daddy since the first time she's Verde or against the United states well Supreme Court justice from the Republican Party\nThat the Republican president has nominated this first time so uh\nIt it's ... and it's an interesting day it it's it's it's\nYou wonder what the Republican Party itself is a going to have to do in the next ... months to come in and who knows it it's hard to get it's harder to get a feel from it because it really is right now\n\nYou know I Know I personally feel I'm very upset about this I'm I'm a stream Lee upset about\nAh it was our senator who voted no it it it it it sends a you know it's it's people around the nation and look in Alaska and go oh there was one it was somebody from Alaska that did that\nIt is kind of like

get enough in Oregon\n[noise] ... you know\nIf you're going to be in the paper it's always nice to be in there for ... least reasonably be good [laughter]\nBut hey all news is a you know advertisements good advertisement or so it is just going to take time you know a lot of us sit around and and I guess\nWe'll wait till tomorrow and see what the actual vote happens in a she if it's in my shorts at correct and uh she continues along the path that she is a Lisa Murkowski will vote no on final passage tomorrow Kavanaugh\nWill some people myself included is that the Supreme Court vote has almost every thing to do with who I vote for president almost everything\nIt's like in the end you know you you you you may toss around a little bit but\nWhen it comes to the vice president or when I'm when it comes to the president and his ability to appoint Supreme Court members\nI'm I'm looking for a conservative\nPresident that will put on conservative judges locked him for president put on conservative judges out that\nIn a ... and\nWe have one here in ... uh and I hope that cabin all if things go as predicted tomorrow and he is pass pass through that he turns out\nTo be a good conservative a Supreme Court members [noise] but we still got to deal with Lisa Murkowski that lady's gotta go folks she's got to go she's got to go she's got to go she's got to go to eleven thirty

where she will change part I don't know let let's put out a campaign heck let's\n[laughter]\nLet's put out a campaign heck let's\n\n[laughter] let's get a limousine go pick her up bring her over to the Democratic party\nAnd drop her off and\nMake sure they got a welcome home San for that's what any job and all these jobs at least more jobs you just need to leave the Republican Party\nI I'm sure she's probably making any I get people say that about you [laughter]\n[noise] oh that's fine at least I I I'm a conservative at least that I stand up for I guess you stand up for what she believes into huh that's why she's voting no day\n[noise]\nBut that's what that's what needs to happen calls need to go in her office to zero ju ju ju triple six five I think it is to zero ju ju ju for triple six five\nColor now the washing or now go now\nTo zero ju ju ju for triple six five ... office blow that phone up\nIt's not going to probably change anything but you know she's\nDo we have a we have anything that we have another clip that we have a a package that yeah that one day when that was on his cabinet oh yeah we got all that we had a something before that were put\nThat other one on um\n... oh oh okay that goes on Murkowski flick gifts because you know\nAll right let's play that looks a little clip your flicking Murkowski callers are doing this\nThis is a CBS News special for it and I know John John Dickerson Gayle King Indiana goal and drink\nIn New York the Senate has just voted to end debate on Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination that keeps Republican leaders on track to hold a final confirmation vote early tomorrow evening a procedural vote ended fifty one two forty nine with one Republican voting no that's Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and one Democrat\nBut I mean yes Joe Manchin of West Virginia important indication of judge Kavanaugh support and going into the final vote\nThe nominating process has been delayed for a week because of the FBI inquiry into allegations that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted one woman in high school and exposed himself to another and college public in the Senate leaders say the FBI interviews failed to turn up any evidence to support the charges\nSenate Democrats complained that the pro was too narrow and failed to interview a number of potentially important witnesses\nSo um what's interesting about this since I was four senators who we were watching right\nThey have moved forward the only one that vote and only Republicans voted no was Murkowski that think that she might vote no in this final vote and we still don't know yet how perhaps centers like our center Collins will vote ultimately about whether who shovel that's right this end the\nDebate but it ended the interminable debate of a filibuster there will still be discussion in conversation before that early evening vote tomorrow and those three other senators other than Murkowski could all vote no on the final vote on on on this is just the vote to keep the process going so we get an indication of Murkowski's into Nora but we don't know about those\nOther ... makes me think about that picture of guys that we saw last week with Diane Feinstein Lisa Murkowski where she had her ... and against the wall because she ended up voting no that'd be curious to see what went into the Susan Collins thinking and Jeff Flake because they were clearly on the fence\nI Wonder what was something that that tip them over Collins has said\nThat she after reading the FBI inquiry that she thought there was no ... I have an operating evidence for the doctor for\nThey are and that's ... that's good we've heard a lot about that there were there was never any ... evidence there's just you know it's sad uh\nNobody's been you know nobody nobody won\nNobody's winning I I think everybody's lose and\nI think the accusers are losing their if their victims I mean they're losing I think the the public we're

I don't know that's the route side of\nIt that there's there's a there's a\nI think a very very positive side in masculinity\nI don't even know why there has to be a negative side because I don't think being wrong to other people is Mac ... I don't know why that got connected into that shouldn't be just masculine things should be ... should be positive and uh\nI Know sometimes people can't help but because things happen in marriages\nAnd all and uh and and I know it does have an effect will be right back [noise]\nI I wouldn't get ah I I just no matter what I just wouldn't get on his bedside as far as name calling and you know in public I I don't he he just has a natural ability when that debate it's like\nTrying to be funny with a comedian you know like a a do they do this I just want to do for a living you know like the idiots who sit in the bright idiots sit out in the in in the bleachers or whatever at the tables and and then you always got the guy that Jeff\n... ... ... drunk and everything he's wanting to be the the comedian you know and you got to ... sometimes comedians that tell them hey\nThis is what I Do for a limit on gay I I'm going to make you look stupid sometimes the other I don't believe in a smarter than I Hope\nYou don't run across another comedian right\nWell I mean Trump or any body standing on stage or you and I are advantages we got a microphone Michael from here yeah that's right in the end you know when you're the president of the free world or you're you're pretty much always getting recorded whatever you say ... or\n... or\n\nAny ways that so Kavanaugh Kevin all is a\nIs moving forward and uh it looks like he will win the majority vote tomorrow it will be next spring for justice a we were talking about this was suffocation of America Christian\n... uh she brought it up actually ... and it reminded me of a because it's the story that I talk about every now and and so in Christ that brought it up I I thought to myself oh I haven't talked about that in a while and and and um\nYou know I don't know a lot of I I you know the science behind it and and like\nI was trying to explain earlier is that it is part of our society kids are being forced inside there's lot there's not there's no reasons really for people to be outside or to to a large degree a everything that's fun and that's enjoyable is typically inside\nAh computers are you know you can't stop technology you can't you can't impede to try to create something that um to create masculinity I I guess but\nBut I think we have to recognize that we're losing masculinity in our in our in our boys in our young\nMen and I'm not just talking about a a physical sense or in\nIn either\nMasculinity is is something that's it's a little deeper than just a a a physical sense or hold the door open or or whatever or\nI'm being able to make decisions and and being able to make the\n... and Lisa are getting into discussions with them to make the right decision sometimes you try your best and you don't make the right decision but anyways you you\nIt's it's these young men data that are losing that they say they're losing a day they just seem to it just seems to be the\nYoung men are becoming more like young women and young women are are almost becoming more masculine it's like what rules are almost changing to some degree\nAnd and it's\nIt's a little strange to watch and I think at my age to ... at fifty six I ... you see things that you know you know what you've seen right you've lived ... you've lived life\nAnd then when you see the young men today it looks\nDifferent and it's a different feel to it it's a it's a different different chemistry to\nAt all and you're trying to fairly think back like okay wait a minute while I was Fifteen how how did I how did we handle\nThat as young men as young boys really what what we do and and um there just seems to be a different tone a different tenor out there\nAnd and I know the political correctness has has been a big factor in this in it and I think but what we've done and and and I hope well you know it's it's my opinion but we weave through some of his political correctness and I know this has been set a lot of it but we've taken out masculine\nAnd he we've shame that down\nYou know ... bean\nBean masculine isn't isn't um [noise] a lot better word it you know sometimes this political correctness amazes I no longer sexy slow longer good she no longer a rite\nOf masculinity has been blended with evil and and\nThat so therefore it's like oh well wait a minute 'cause masculinity promotes domestic violence\nWell that's not true\nWhat the heck doesn't masculinity have anything to do in fact masculine any is the antithesis\nOf violence\nIt might mask you any me doesn't even have anything to do with violence\nI'm Matthew ... is is politically correctness of of something that\nWell it's not always good\nIt was of of something that well it's not always good well well water or whatever is not good\nThat you're referring to as masculinity is not masculinity beating the crap out of your wife is not masculinity that that's that that's just that's just stupid that's all that is ...\nAnd that's of my generation we come from a lot of broken homes so we've seen a lot of the masculine men do that be abusive or just abandon I mean I come from a generation with a lot of kids that didn't grow up with fathers 'cause they just walked up you know absolutely there's there's also that like what what\nBoys have witnessed you know our generation and now we have boys\nWhat we witness you know uh as as the example of of the generation of of men who did or did not raise us you know I mean my uh my father passed away he didn't leave me on purpose right but I was a lot of friends that I have their fathers they don't have any relationship with them as our fathers left him\nWell my mom and dad blow when I was twelve so sometimes\nSo that masculinity in in my generation gets a little war if they're like oh the that's what men men walk out and stuff is\nThat a man that but I ... I don't get the ... some ... matter of men\nThat are raised in this new generation of boys we didn't have that example say that that that the baby boomer generation had of their fathers\nAnd all I I you know I I I mean I think there's an all day and that that could be a factor not maybe not you know you know there's a feeling of it's kind of what I what I think what I\nWould I Witness at at that as as my age group of of people now and you know I have an Eighteen year old son and I have friends they have you know boys that are varying ages in their teenage formative years you know that we're trying to do our best to\nTo raise them as a you know as a man or you know I'm teaching my kid out of how to cook things because I'm pretty sure he's going to\nBe a loner and learn how to ... ... well a\nChristian says Krista ... says look at all these\nCrazies running around trying to shame on men it's disgusting and there is there there's this there's this shame men thing\nAnd and unfortunately we are ... are we deserve some of it\nUm again like I said if your employer that walked out on your fat when I was getting ring that that allow you to hit ... yeah\nIs that by not and hey listen you know I ... sometimes people think well he taught me you must be perfect\n... know whoa whoa whoa wait a minute\n[noise] back up [laughter]\nPump\nThe brakes I I'm not perfect I'm not dying insinuate anything when I'm ... and ... were just talking about the ideal situation in the ideal situation is course a man\nAnd a woman in a household that's the ideal situation scientifically that's the ideal situation that's just part of nature\nYes it it it it just makes it it it just your chances ... states are\nPhenomenal\nFather a father lives home in the home I Wish I grill it our our ... my father was homeless far greater for the kids to fail not finish high school not have a good job history is just the numbers are there\nAnd and I think it has a lot to do when you have moms raising boys\nNot that moms can't do it and like not that there's not a lot of ... a good moms out\nThere busting their ass every day trying to raise their good kids\n'cause there are there some moms out there that are taking care of business\nAnd and that's a beautiful thing that's a beautiful thing and I think\nBut we had to get away from this this ... and men need to work at it but we got to get away from this male bashing the get away from this bashing masculine again wafer bashing what were we were born to be\n\n\n\n[noise] oh I Am not even on the on line or your family\n\nThe Fox news alerts a turning point in the U.S Senate and the the Brady confirmation now considered likely\nFor the Supreme Court nominee who picked up two crucial votes today\nMade Republican Susan Collins after a lengthy floor speech concludes she will vote in favor of judge Brett Kavanaugh for a Supreme Court seat\nThe allegation fail to me the more likely than not standard\nCollins says a presumption of innocence plus a lack of corroboration means sexual assault allegations against having a do not fairly prevent him from serving on the court shortly after Collins made her announcement and other undecided\nHim from serving on the court shortly after Collins made her announcement another undecided Senate or West Virginia Democrat Joe mansion said he too will vote for Kavanaugh both announcements likely secure enough support for Kavanaugh before Saturday confirmation vote boxes\nGeron helper and on Capitol Hill where protesters have been keeping up the pressure on him camping outside Collins' office others confronting mansion [noise]\nThat the White House is praising Collins is so is former President George H W.

and and she voted against him you know what I mean and and you're going to use the second point I think you made\nThat though it was good is that this this is a deeper vote we kind of brought up

five six nine one zero eight zero\nFive six Nineteen eighty has this cause you to cross over ... were you Murkowski supporter and now you're not are you still the Murkowski support\nI liked I haven't heard from anybody yet that that says hey listen I\nVoted for Murkowski last time and and yeah I'm going to vote for again because I I I Want to hear that I mean\nI I'm not gonna jak you you know I mean you it is what it is I disagree with you of course been but I but it is it is valuable\nIt's valuable to listen to people who have different opinions because it it it sometimes it it opens up discussions about things that you don't you know maybe I'm a man I don't think that way I'm a woman I don't think that way uh I'm white I'm black or whatever\nAnd just you come from different cultures you come from different backgrounds and you'd think different ways and some different things you mean more to you and and so it doesn't bother me that someone is a Murkowski supporter in ... the especially if you're a Republican\nI because there is a party scene that that's attached to this and ended and some people call this a party line vote\nTyler five six Nineteen eighty Tyler welcome to the show\nI just had a couple of comments I don't feel like a summer jobs is\nDenying him or her role in the grocery store to her conscience um she I think she truly\nI Believe this is not the kind of judge she walks are in office so she she voted that way I think the problem is she doesn't stand with conservative voters she doesn't stand with Republicans that's why she got beat by Joe Miller right\nI'm not blind\nI think there's a lot of talk about our you know she's denying got the standing of our government you know she's she's doing what we want to senator your voter Rogers who just the wrong senator\nWell ... and you know when you peel away the onion you're you're really right I mean\n'cause she ... she is she is she's a she is a left this Republican or a moderate Democrat however that sounds really loud I don't know where\nYou're at if you can hear me now but but it does it anyways I'll keep going the ideas that are ...\nShe is she is\nAnd and I I think it was a who is that right there I forgot I forgot cause name\nUh she she is who she was Tyler Murkowski voted who she is\nFinally going to get this out\n\nShe's always been a liberal it's no secret\nAnd she's still a liberal and she voted exactly like Tyler said or is it then I get that right Tyler you still there after\nA ... and we've known this thing she's gotten away with it\nAnd I'm now it's just it will there be somebody who will step up that is a credible candidate and and give conservatives choice or [noise] or would you vote against her ... you you would voted I think you're just you're a writer for for a different candidate are more conservative yeah yeah yeah\nI voted Joe Miller as well and yeah I think there's enough a moderate and and I figure it's not a Democrat it around a supporter and get her in office\nI think um I think we know where she stands I think we're gonna continue to see more of this um and so I that's what people are expecting I I think you know what you get\nWell hey I I only got forty five seconds I Want you to answer I already I ask you just one question how do you think this is going to shake the rhinos the leadership in the party ... part of the party what what do you think's going on up there\nI think should happen out of this right it's clear ah you know Republican in name only way I mean there's it's a perfect example of that and so the leadership needs to do something to prevent that from being the case\nYeah I I think that'd be something to keep from a fall out hey thanks I appreciate the call thank you so much we got to take the heartbreak you're it's one thirty we shall return\nConviction time was a year at his house they already\nDid and ... and he lost his job at the airport\nDid loses a job which is probably the most important thing\nBut
