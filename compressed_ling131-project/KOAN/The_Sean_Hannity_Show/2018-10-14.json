let's let's dive in just a little bit deeper here\nBecause I apparently it's evidence here now with alleged audio video proof and this gets pretty gruesome\nThe reports are that the the Turkish have the audio and video of him going in being interrogated him being beaten and then him being killed and there have been some reports that he was caught up\nThe embassy that he was actually dismembered with an electric saw\nAnd then take it out taken out and pieces and there's even\nA report that they use that I mentioned this yesterday we heard about the saw yesterday there was a report yesterday that they use the bones saw and now new today is that the Saudis might have actually employed or brought in a forensic\nSpecialist to this member of the guy and take them apart I mean folks this is I mean this is pulp fiction event me this is crazy stuff here\nThat he was killed he goes in again essentially a marriage license his fiance outside and she's panicking when he didn't come back out on October second they felt they were going to get away with this\n[noise] so a head of that we have our American intel uh claims and when we saw this earlier the weekend maybe Tuesday or Wednesday or stories were coming out that us intel\nApparently intercepted communications from Saudi officials and they were plotting to actually lord Jamal ... back to Saudi Arabia\nThat's I guess what they initially wanted to do because of his very outspoken efforts against the Saudi kingdom and as I mentioned the Saudi crown prince this Mohammed bin some on\nSo [noise]\n[noise] we know they wanted to take him to get him out of a a turkey or detained them in Saudi Arabia that was at the very least that they wanted to do so I it's not known at least not to us when\nThe communique was actually intercept it but it's believed that it was some time last month sometime in September and this is when the show he's column started to well ramp up and amp up and be very critical of\nThe Saudi kingdom and its its rumors\nAnd incidentally he never called for any regime change but he was very critical of the Saudi royal family and\nUh the crown prince et cetera now the condemnation folks as far and wide on this\nUh business circles a political circles here are both Democrats and Republicans in our uh governments are very concerned about this the condemnation is getting louder and louder\nThere's this uh this uh Saudi summer's coming up and I see a lot of the news organizations have cancel plans to cover it a ... there's economic summit a minute you and the secretary the treasury Mnuchin is still going to last that we had heard here\nAnd a President Trump's in a pretty tough spot this is again a bizarre situation you know you can have governments are murdering people well I guess a Vladimir putting does it all the time\nWhich is something else which we probably should deal with her trying to kill and poison people around the globe that's a you know Vladimir Putin's deal but I mean this is a very very complicated issue you know also\nRemember turkey and I've got a lot of issues with turkey or to God and his government the clamping down the uh the the freedom is being taken away a more of the the the radical Islamic ah thinking has come with Oregon\nYou had that coup attempt a and well we we know what happened there our relations with or to God I've been a pretty strained you know we just have this big story earlier today as well with the the preacher\nWho has been released now a who was accused of being part of a plot to overthrow\nA the the Turkish government and Oregon\nSo that was a Brunson so he's out and although if he's not in Germany he'll be in Germany shortly or to undergo a some physical checkups et cetera before he's brought back to the United states so you know we've had our issues and problems with turkey and turkey a NATO member a NATO ally\nHas increasingly over the last couple of years they seem to be drifting away from western principles and\nWhat a member of the nation in NATO should be about and more towards a radical a physician so ... is our relationship with turkey getting but anyway this is a very complicated matter Saudi Arabia folks is the main cog\nIn our foreign policy in the middle East that I've said this many times Saudi Arabia is an absolute power check on\nIs an absolute power check on Iran and also the Syria as well now Saudi Arabia\nIs one of the main components will even call it the secret source as far as Jared Kushner's Middle East peace process is concerned than what he's developed in what Jerry ... trying to push so to say that this is very sensitive it's a clear understatement\nBecause Jared Kushner or a Jew by the way\nHas cultivated a very deep friendship with the crown prince with Mohammed bin some up\nAnd he and the family I mean they're now implicated in this disappearance that torture the beating the interrogation the murder the bones saw cutting this member meant of ...\nA U.S permanent resident and then we have the arms deal here\nAnd we know that this came up at the White House yesterday and the president is actually said no we're looking into this we're investigating got people on the ground but it's not going to interrupt the arms deal this a hundred and ten billion dollars are going to\nA U.S companies to us a an arms manufacturers so Lawson is the number\nA hundred percent accurate is really a hundred and ten billion dollars or who knows I mean that's all that's a lot of money anyway slice it certainly the Saudis want to buy a whole lot of crap and a whole lot of course there's no doubt about it\nA and\nSaudi Arabia they do leave the list as far as us weapons exports now the president\nIs well in a tough climate right now and and there's many in our government both sides of the aisle who are isolating the president for him continuing to stand with the salaries on this I certainly think the Trump is being a little bit more\nAmbivalent are cautious than it needs to be\nNow I'm not saying that the arms deal leads to be canceled\nI you know what what Trump is saying here is that he's trying to save the arms deal because he doesn't want to see a U.S jobs evaporated\nI don't think that our foreign policy should ever be tied to jobs because that gives the other side in age\nAnd given in she'll take a mile and then other countries are witnessing what's going on as well and that's not a good position to be in you know the arguments\nWhat should occur here\nIs to essentially make this a twofold situation if you know bottom line is if the Saudis if they don't get the arms from us then they're going to make deals with the Chinese they gonna make deals with a lot of reporting in Russia\nSo it's going to give the Russians and the Chinese it's going to give them more of a foothold\nIn the region so that's you know obviously a problem as well so listen it's not up on a cut and dry matter I mean this is a very complicated situation you know if we sell the arms to the Saudis\nAnd then they need to come back to us over time for service and parts and tech support\nYour cold the answer to four to five minutes so I mean we do have some leverage you know over the Saudis in that fashion so I don't think he cancels sale I think you leave the sale in place but a lesson\n[noise]\nTrump needs to quickly get with our intel people and if the Turkish if they're accurate about what happened then we're going to have to target the Saudis with some type of sanctions somebody's got to be done they can't get

insult his rivals\nReally we've come to Vince now what am I going to the top you up was that the fraud that did\nArnold ever see that what about it's not ... you know from kindergarten cop for real so Arnold Schwarzenegger hold men's health magazine he wishes that he'd use the term but not for the defense if the woman or feminine men\nI call them you're only met because they weren't willing to take risks afraid of everything is becoming\nInsanity dish niche [noise]\n\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval\nFirst we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your eight states blocked but you've rates go down your rate drops either way you win call us today at eight hundred quicken or go to a rocket mortgage dot com\nRacial upheaval only about when I turned thirty or six or eight months cup of coffee permission conditions equal housing winter like economic effects and I'm like thirty thirty visual conditioner exclusion maple\nI used to lead voice mails for myself because the only one I could trust you get something done right was ...\nYou may remember to order the goggles what's on your way\nBut now I use Granger rangers got the technical support you would expect from America's number one source for industrial grade supplies during the business of helping my business so no more talking to myself now I talked to Granger because when it comes to keeping your business running ... got your back\nAnd then there's crap we don't even know about and they're not even died as whatever you know they did it yet and we probably wouldn't even find out half these things\nSo this is going to be fascinating to watch if the proof rolls out that Saudi assassination squad\nRolled into the embassy where the conflict knowing that can show he was going in with an appointment to get the paperwork for the marriage and then they send this hit squad that ten or Fifteen people I think that the Turkish government that I think they cling Fifteen came over and a private jet on a commercial flight\nAnd assembled and they took this guy out\nAs a carrying their luggage ... is our bones saw was all kinds of torturing this member of equipment and in the luggage that's pretty eerie to think about\nSo as Trump is getting ready to talk to the Saudi king how the hell is this thing go right eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine hey President Trump will be a girly man on this you got to stand up I'm not saying cancel the arms deal\nBecause there are also huge geopolitical steaks here with the Saudis or check on a rabbit the Saudis are not totally clean folks they don't have clean hands\nI don't trust the Saudis ah you know what it is what's good for them is what's good for them whether it's good for them [laughter] you got that if you understand that\nAh otherwise uh they go the other direction and again I saw lots of questions on nine eleven and who knew what\nInside a certain levels of the Saudi royal family\nSo President Trump don't be a girly man here in in dealing with the Saudis\nBut whose side is from going to take and is this going to be fascinating to watch here hey uh back to the hurricane back to Michael and again uh my thoughts are with all of those in the panhandle in Georgia and the Carolinas and Virginia as this storm is ... obviously\nThe images the buildings are raised the apocalyptic atomic bomb like damage\nIs just heartbreaking\nAnd again I still don't think we have any idea what the death toll is we've got people that are unaccounted for folks that apparently we're going to write out the storm in the panhandle in Mexico beach area who have not been accounted for so who knows you know ... where this thing's going to end up\nAh so again my thoughts as I see all these new images as as new drone images new drone footage an aerial helicopter shots come in a it's just unbelievable the amount of debris\nYou know the stories of of people saying uh this is my house this wall blow the outlook of this couch or look at look at this furniture\nOver here this isn't even mind you're having people that have furniture in their house that came from somewhere else and deposited in the remnants of of their house\nThat's just

all the the weather folks to the news people standing outside as long as they can you know bracing against the wind\nAnd water and rain bidding against their face and microphones branched out and they all want to get that shot I guess it's just it's a hunger and it's an expectation\nThat ah the\nViewing audience has that we got to see you know I'm Jim Kent tore or our road gr whoever from Fox or CNN getting tossed around by the by the weather Jim can't touring the report is that he was almost impales by debris\nAnd I've always said that at some point one of these reporters is going to get

they actually put out a trespass warning I had no warning or reward a you know the press past warning Jim Kent tore don't show up here\nAnd of course it was tongue in cheek because they were saying hey Jim can't toy don't come here because we know that you go where you predicted project\nThe weather is going to be\nThe worst\nAnd the report was that can tore it was almost taken out by a metal
