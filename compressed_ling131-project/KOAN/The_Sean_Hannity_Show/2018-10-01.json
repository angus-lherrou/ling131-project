I'm Sorry I meant was that the ... ...\n... a URL same like a member of the yeah yeah he was part of the leaves and the ...\nYeah yeah what what was his deal and ah he he's um he gave the Seattle but he was being wheeled off 'cause he 'cause he was blocking the guy caught a pass from Arizona and his leg buckle anyways broke his leg\nAnd so on his way off he was gone he was on the back of that card\nAnd they were wheeling him off the field and he was going down the sidelines of the cardinals and they're all high five and I mean I mean like like he was a former teammate or somewhere or are they really liked him and he just looked over and gave the finger to the Seattle bench as like\n[noise] and I didn't know the story it's a ... ... what what what what's going on here this is ah what's weird stuff and I I guess there's just a a ... a contract dispute\nAnd and he and happy with it and now\nWe have their championship running over they done spending that money all that promised money on that leads and boom defund [laughter] so it's just business pro yeah your I mean they've done and if you can go get greener pastures that's where you should do\nBut they're just not by any broke his leg that's how it is and championship runs they shell out money and then when you know and they won that championship now they're like\nHey we got a dial it back and spending this money goes that guy Thomas Earl Thomas ... got\nIt right and he was him and like you know what they got rid of what's his name uh Sherman like last year right after he got injured so you know once you get injured\nOh yeah yeah yeah yeah come alive really and in the play out to pasture\nThe contracts are not guaranteed ... you know yeah you can get guaranteed money is written into your contract with those contracts with not guaranteed and they will ... if you start costs too much really oh oh the exit you\nYou do to curb whether or not no go shape your new contracts as why why he's upset well when you think about\nThose guys in the NFL is in a lot of these big pro date we hear about\nThese guys you make millions and millions and millions and just it's just over the top it was an old social like\nVery a very very few ... it was in the league with a one percent or ... one percent of you know what I mean related\nTo the rest of those ... that's the one percent they made a minimum wage which is a lot of your four hundred thousand dollars a year is a great\nJob but you're only paid by ... dolls in dollars a year is a great job but really the realistic thing is those guys make that much money they're only going to make that a couple of years they're not they're not that's not a snapple deal now it's not a job you know for not game at four hundred but I mean everybody thinks\nGone I mean not every one but I think there's a lot of people out there who just assume I'm going to go play for the NFL well you're just gonna make you know fifty million dollars and that's all ours do it I mean that's just not true\nIt is for some but not not for many\nIt's a I mean it's it's a very limited job you know I mean you see them on Sunday you think there's a lot there and stuff you know uh but yeah there was only fifty for actual players on there then they get like another eight for their practice and that's all the actual players like fun\nNow those guys that make you know those guys that run around catching the kicks they got the x.s on the stuff that work at the stadiums they probably make a pretty good decent living compared to me you know those ball boy probably started\nOh sixty thousand dollars a year for a team and that ain't bad the carry around a ball and from gate squirting that gate or a ... mouth when they're coming off what a gig huh would give you see them over there the trainer like what if\nHe's he's in the deep getting some deep massage I'm that guy like wow he's regular that guy's making some money that put our money together to shame maybe\nYeah ... those trainers they are they're making a couple of hundred grand a year just to\nBut I mean in a tough job and it's a business and you know a URL Thomas's matter because it's ... your your your your days have done there in Seattle and you need\nIt's ... your your like your your\nDays have done there in Seattle and you need the day's might be done I don't think either you know all he had and how bad this year he broke his leg so yeah yeah that's the other thing about like running back like especially running back when they get a leg injury that done\nYou you're not the same anymore do you broke your ... your leg I'm Sorry man though but or your your your leg and then your outlook of her job\nOh yeah yeah it's um it's\nAbsolutely crazy uh sorry about this other a computer but yeah it\nDoes seem like you know I mean the looting giving the uh the one finger salute your team seems to be quite a statement yeah yeah that that\nIs a I don't know more reflective of the times now because I don't think you would have seen that\nYears ago to your own team ever you know what I mean\nYou just don't think there have been that much uh talk back you know that that that boldness or like there was it just um no not really quite seen\nThat before or or there's just a normal amount of coverage of everything now you know maybe we would have never seen it goes you know I mean just like news sports like everything has a twenty four hour cycle now where they're just microscopically in depth with everything and stuff you know\nYeah that'll be nice and it was a a rise of fantasy\nFootball I Can't ... you know that's not even normal football talk sometimes it's just all numbers for a big fan of the guys at least a vision of\nA drag pale and tracked pale in in the news man\nOr this is his third time you know and it's got to do with the same stuff you know and I feel I ...\nAt every at every juncture live ... you've got to start dealing with the taking care of a dry too there are things that are going on and interacts head that that he can't control\nOr a you know I I think we should have I I'm not saying they have sympathy for drug dealing but I think we should have some empathy\nOh well we don't know where you went through in the army we don't know we always deployed he was there was a striker brigade I don't know what causes be GST I I'm not I wasn't there but I'm just going to okay let's just say All right so he does have it we all know that and uh it can be very serious\nAnd so\nI'm not sure what what the whole deal is you only you beat up on his dad he he he pled out a deal on that you know and here he is what four months later five months later something a ... he has another problem\nIs is a then says a bomber ... ex girlfriend told last they jeopardy hitter repeatedly\nOn the head late Friday after a according to a charge document filed and Palmer court over the weekend then\nWent three ... came to his mental legs on door arresting the twenty nine year old father with him and try to hit but one of them says a sworn affidavit fall by trooper Jason uh Summerville\nTaylor's son of former allies give us some where a was jailed in the ... the remain there Monday morning the judge journey hearing Saturday set painless bail at five hundred bucks and secured and release on electronic monitoring\nBaylor's ex girlfriend Jordan low came to his house friday to drop off after a young son according to the affidavit pale and blocked are actually when when she tried to leave\nLittle told Somerville then he told her or she couldn't go\nSo then I'm sure that's when the um and that's what I read earlier was that's kind of when it got a little crazy anyway she calls the the ... and they show up\nIn and and tracks got to get this stuff together brother I feel for you man but but but [noise]\nShoot dog you got to get some help I don't know I don't know what to say it's ... it's tough subject but you got to get something going on because if you're not and some bad is going to happen next it's time bomb getting ready to go off we'll be right back\nNo there's no one there you are to hold the board or anyone else accountable you know are they I I I tried my best to reach out and and and you know are offered by a very prominent opinion of their uh misgivings\nAnd and poor decision making and just bad judgment but uh they know that fell on deaf ears no one really cared yeah there were people that care there were senators that reached out to me ah we track well reached out to me right you reached out to Corey there was a we had a pretty good I mean pretty\nWell people you know Governor Walker was involved um\nDirector of commerce that's currently was also involved there was a pretty good amount of people that ... that were in the where the situation\nWas also involved there was a pretty good amount of people that ... that were in the where the situation the attorney general I spoke with her personally but it's just in a Harriet mills I'm so that it's not like this was just like some random scenario and\nJust happened with knowing knowing about it it's like it's just very uh it was a very ... it was pretty big of it because one of the very first penalties been handed down to a candidate related business for ... you know promoting bonsai consumption or promoting\nA or a allowing us sanctions and like you know\n[noise] then you have high time or the\nTemp best which is the other one and they also find so I Want to you know of course the fines first ah one of them for the candidates classic that was a they got fined twenty thousand a Fifteen thousand it's been in that in five of it\nThen if that was five Fifteen with the most of its suspended and they had a at a bad sign of a twenty five hundred and believed that I've ever since you're on the amounts are I Know they've they've also change but they're also going through appeal processes\nOkay hold on just so we can stay clear not too far to weed out all of this pertains around\n... generally one thing and that is public consumption or or does very well it comes up right right oh it's different degrees of public smoking right unloading a public option you didn't even know and that's the big deal and each one of these entities\nUm their promoters they they put on events they put on festival I'm a ... different like a\nState fair I mean that's the best that right I just use that analogy every time\nThey put on these these events and all the fair or whatever and and so then there becomes a open consumption whether they like it or not and then they get fined for is that is that a fair assessment of what happens there\nI Would say it isn't fair says it and it's a\nMicro related that leaves the question that I really have a problem with and that is the the regulation of marijuana it is to me and my eyes it is three times four times the amount of\nRegulation over and above what they do with alcohol I I'm I'm really kind of perplexed about that I understand it she voters voters need to be feel safe\nAnd when the Senate voted for something they want to make sure they're all safe and so they put in all these the noxious rules and laws that are not needed and then maybe in time we'll all figure out that it was not necessary and things will get\nA lot of voters really responsible for that I mean the voters are the ones that ... system in place a regulators and the you know stay are responsible for that if I can blame anyone\nAnd Governor Walker at this point well you know that that could be true and I mean\nIf you look at other if you look at other states I can you know draw really great conclusion I mean look at Oklahoma right now I'm from Oklahoma say give you you know they're probably one of the craziest\nBible like Bible thumping right you'd ever ever live and they turn ... non existent industry into an industry and less than a year\nRight Nevada also did that so wide Alaska take two years\nWhy is the license process taking an entire\nYear right now if Governor Walker's really doing his\nJob in regards to supporting the marijuana industry you know I don't believe that that's that's\nNot a lot of sense administration that makes a lot of sense I mean is there\nYou know all this dragging out just seems to me and I don't understand it nearly as well as you do but I just see all these regulations and all these ... and it takes so long and all these loop spare you got to go through and to me it's just amazing like I you know owning a business owner Sharon station I thought you know\nWe had to remodel that plays ... change you know all these permits and everything and I feel like\nMan that that wasn't nothing compared to what you got to go through to get this uh marijuana license inopportune\nThat I I ride on now give you a big deal\nI mean I don't want to I don't want to get too far off topic but those are the specific events because they are really really relevant to today's uh I mean it uh the industry today right on but I Do want to say that though is that this timeline thing and and\nUh I I Want to emphasize more I'm ... I'm I'm also a victim of that at this point in time of uh my last my standard called the fishing license which I was a one of the very first businesses in Palmer to get a license um\nUh the uh\nEntire year we've been licensed I have had no noticed the violations we've done really good job operating and\nUm we've done a lot of construction and whatnot but the or the ... it only took about three months to get that license right um ... it's ... it was about five months total process from the time that I started at the time that I actually received my license\nIn my aunt this time around it's ... it's a ten month state review processes and it's going to want a one year progress wow so I mean if you think about\nJust the general person if you're starting a business you're gonna have to pay rent for an entire year before you can even make a dollar\nYeah that that's that's crazy that's great and the amount of money it takes to start one is is phenomenal title\nOf the day at this point in time the way the state has everything works strayed it would cost just for a retail store which is probably one of the cheapest types of licenses is out there right it would cost a quarter million dollars just do that one way or business\nYeah I and and that's if you don't have by the land or by the house in winter around them you know your rent yeah that is if you rent and the place and all that and and a half hours that's\nAnother I mean that's what I mean they're not the numbers keep going up to yeah I don't belong in the process has gone up the more money it costs to get into the industry so they're it's essentially they are creating artificial barriers of injury to the business to the industry yeah\nYeah and it just drives cost up in uh anyways uh we know what happened to prohibition so uh we don't have to read his repeat history hope not I feel is on I really appreciate you on the show today thank you so much a ... year\nAnd one thing I Want to end the yeah yeah yeah you know\nThere was two events that were find that there was Canada's classic was fine broadside consumption rice hemp best that was fine bronze consumption but there was an event that I said that would not be fine um and it was high times right and so no one's fine them more investigated them so far I'm Wondering why keep in mind when I was kind of curious right [laughter]\nI I'm ... you you got you got my use [laughter] 'cause I was a big time a company and there are a big you know I\nYou know I Can't speculate here and the reason why they're not being investigated guess that'd be a question for the state yeah hopefully they give us a good answer at some point I\nThat sounds that sounds like an interesting question maybe I'd follow up on that for you thank you so much Irish do\nAppreciate that they ... how's it going\nAll right you've ever buy All right we'll be back more a minister a bill Walker coming up on the show at one o'clock bill Walker on the show taking your calls live in the studio we'll be right back [noise]\n\nYou ever thought about saying goodbye to your job just walking into your boss and saying I quit and how would you like to commute to work without ever leaving your home well not long ago with thirty nine year old entrepreneur from billionaire family it's been twenty million dollars\nForty nine year old entrepreneur from a billionaire family spent twenty million dollars in three years to find the best home based business in North America\nHe researched Seventy different companies and when he found the only one that had real long term potential he bought it and right now he's looking for people to help him turn this company\nInto his next billion dollar success story so if you're serious about making money from home without having to leave your home will grab a pen because I'm about to give you the address of a website where you can learn all about this unique and rear opportunity write this down\nNew page today dot com now get on your computer and go to this site now part time or fulltime your income is based totally on your performance\nGo to new page today dot com new page any W.

know I I look at this thing and you you had yeah Sarah yeah Frank you got\nA I don't know maybe Tony in um who came Sean yourself this\nGas lines just seems like the gas just isn't right just not expensive enough it's not their Senate pack Chinese are pissed off drunk 'cause he's got he's putting them tear Saddam so they don't want they don't want to buy our gas what's gonna happen\nWell you know here's what's gonna happen and we're going to build the gas line let me tell you what\nYou know the all the way you described for for decades we're dry called the last decade we were going to take our gas or the hungry and markets a little reported\nThere were no hungry market now for you there are now there are ... ... ... of Newcastle so finally we're going in the right direction and what I inherited was the uh uh the project the a K on jeep project right I I Will I Will not start over overplay their hand I have and so and I have and so\nYou know what difference does this significantly different is that you know when the producers came to me about a year after I was in office and said would I be willing to as a state of Alaska for us to assume this infrastructure project like a like a highway road to those kinds of things\nWill build them you know build the infrastructure and they use live the resource an unit right now and then there's a deal it's worked out that makes everybody happy\n... exactly right that's the that's the line when the model and which is the typical model around the world so we went to the marketplace and said here's our interest and we went to the ones that I went to the White House and and talk to the president of rice and all of a sudden you know all the world's came together and and uh you know the Asian market I met with President moon of South Korea I met with President Xi of of a\nUm a China we had with President of a I'm a Vietnam we talked about you know Asian market right where of course Japan's grow August Margaret so many of the market and do things you need any need need a market that is most important quality of the gases well well we've you know there's\nAn hour or so to speak right well and you probably wouldn't be able to store and we can put we put the product inside the store but we needed customers come in the store and buy it in ... he wanted\nTo do is to customers by ... by it on a long term basis for Thirty years Thirty years\nThat Enron and he was asking me is that Chinese mostly have only\nA Korean a Japanese and and a Vietnam Vietnamese those four or the foreign mark it up\nSo if we had those guys lockdown locked into some sort of contract or we can be in business is that is that backed away every I mean the thing about it a bill store you can put some groceries and the groceries courses gas and and this is how it's going to go down and\nGo to different as you have to ... that was all you don't you don't have orders in in order to ... and and that's the way ... in the world has done exactly where we're\nUsed rigidly thinking of using the did that in in order to back the money for the pipeline because the banks wanted to see money of a rather than a revenue stream to back that gas line they wouldn't do it just just on paper alone\nNo ... there's not been my plan and okay and as I heard I mean we don't get while I was really the reason why you wanted to ... know need money to back cash up on that what what backed it up as the product the product is ... and like I said that's\nThe that the commodity that that uh the bank roads the whole thing is all the long term contracts in the market take her baby contracts in the marketplace and capacity agreement contract\nWould I'd ever today how are you going to get China you can't get it you couldn't get him yesterday\nHowever still we're still working with China of course we're working with Korea working with Vietnam and all you can only guess low much I'm On you know I mean I mean I won't I mean I'll give you that it is that's the terror of tensions as I say it's tough of hasn't hasn't improved it but also it's not driven him away in fact we were\nWe were um we have a team over there right now right or they're headed back and and so there was a\nYou know there's they ... they've had a big groups several big groups have come to Alaska go they've got off the north slope spent some time up there and looked at looked a dead horse\nWhy does China need our gas why why why what's what's your biggest leverage with them we got about a minute left\nThey want to convert they want to get all they want to they want to clean up their environment they want to clean or ... or ... or one that came to Anchorage we had dinner he looked at the beautiful black guy and said we need some more of this and and that without her way of they're gonna buy it from somewhere if it's not from what I was going to be from Russia is going to be from your mall is going to be from Australia\nSo we don't get in line it is our opportunity to build this you know\nTwenty thirty thousand construction jobs twenty thirty thousand dollars a month to pay a you know that yet on the ... oil pipeline\nI got ... seconds they're gathering you you've been awesome come in here ... my ... I've been disappointed you do for fun you know that you know we've everyone's got thrown day Denmark out not run on account but\nNot saying it's an act either\nI I don't think he lives I I don't know I I don't you know I don't think that's part of who he\nIs I guess I'm just telling you that way I Believe that you might think totally different now you may have done something you know why not in light but\nBut ah\nAnd I think you could have cut the budget I think there was more to cut I think I think any reasonable person could come up with a plan it says there was more money there to cut\nNot whether or not you got the political courage to do it and whether or not he could have got legislature to go along with him to do it and all this we don't know the answers\nSo you not only have to have the governor you got a Twenty one and a house in Lebanon in the Senate\nYou know you governor can't just say you know well I'm going to do something about well [laughter] I take that back he did do that through a veto power on the David in which was an interesting way of of of doing that\nBut for the most part it takes Twenty one in the house a Lebanon in the Senate and governor's thing that you're in order to get anything done and you know\n\nSo\nThat's what I got left here with will say he's got to have a stronger case\n\nHe's got to have a stronger case to me he there's got to be some meat and potatoes in that case in order for him to sell it to the average guy because the average guy\nIs about seven when it comes to this permit funds seven means that's his anger level that's his mistress level\nIs the seven\nNow there are close there are people that are eight lines intense fat you might find them maybe maybe seven is a little low could be average person could be close to about an eight\n\nMaybe that's I feel a little bit better my stomach feels a little bit better at eight than it did it seven I think seven I was trying to\nGet benefits that are really depends on your individual situation yeah I'm just overall ... I'm just a single guy with the my kids are so what's your anger level what's your frustration that not as much as somebody with you\nKnow I didn't ask you all that what you're frustrated or probably about a five year about five yeah OK I'm surprised it wasn't the six maybe seven\nBut you know I ... granted you know I mean\nI'm not defending on that money as much as somebody with that is getting for dividends you know like that's quite a bit of money see I never even looked at it like you know so I always and good and then they have more people depended on that and stuff and that's something that yeah that you know to me it was Thirteen hundred bucks I've already spent it you know I don't have that much\nPressing things but you know if you if you're a family with two or three kids\nI mean you're missing four or five dividends that's that's chump change yeah so what would\nYou ever thought about you know because all my kids are grown and everything and I don't I don't have any of that yeah yeah me too like my kid yeah you're wrong practically a gene is is is he just turned Eighteen and so so does the news last night here that you know whatever I'm not I'm not a struggling new family\nAnymore like you know somewhat led by busy I get ... be a little bit more\nBut isn't it are aren't you just just upset that that they're just going to spend it\nOh ... well like you just took it and then you just give it also been date in the ... yeah yeah yeah but yeah I'm Upset that like yeah because you're not you're fired up about I don't think you can do better with the ... when over history and time you've proven to be just as irresponsible if not more than me with my money\nSo yeah there's that anger and stuff but what level you think that's that well\nThat yeah for me yeah that's like eight okay yeah that's that's what I'm getting to the principle of it you know I'm just saying there's different\nFamily man some senators can he make an argument\nCan the government can the governor make an argument to switch your vote\nNot really no no\nI I saw your and honestly you're in a ... I ... I think other people have that too and it's I mean you know\nI don't think anything that he can say is going to get us to like understand why he took the evidence and maybe that's a little us being greedy like that's my money\nBecause I think most people see normal budget issues is just that they just see him his budget issues and they always find the money and yeah yeah and and and and the budget issue was about ... excuse to take our David if I'm not saying that it's true\nTo how you look at your own budget at your own home you know when things happen you like oh well we got to cut back on our spending you know and you just write to your neighbor and say like hey you know I got I like ... and I don't have any money can you help me pay my car note you're not really going to get help from your neighbors for that\nYeah\nSo you gotta you gotta make sacrifices and I mean he\nHe's he was in tears displaying some of the sacrifices that the state has made right even before they took the evidence right though he was trying to break down a jobs and all the jobs at least so the the cuts that were made and so on I mean just hearing all of that it still didn't sway me and I don't think it's going to sway the regular voters\nBut you know the problem is and I'm not saying that I'm right\nI'm not trying to contradict the governor I'm only telling\nYou what what I've been able to look at and other\nPeople that I feel are credible told me that is a state\nActual spinning has gone up ... and but that is because of\nSome Medicare Medicaid doubt some some some entitlement type things that continue to grow but at the but real reductions\nWere made sparsely they are really\nWasn't you know there really wasn't any really deep cuts made\nToo many governments they three thousand jobs that sounds like a lot right and wrong on that number was Rene down jobs but\nHow many how many how many thousands of jobs how many how many of them were attrition I'm not actually oh I Know I Know what I'm saying\nAnd and how many of them were attrition I'm\nNot ... oh I Know I don't understand I I don't I ... I was about to say that you know right here the number three thousand ... like a lot but then you could probably explain to me how it's not as well and because it could be ... if you'd be like no these were you know\nExplain this how important these jobs wherever it was tough to cut it so that I mean you can work these numbers and I want right right right and that's the problem\nAnd I think people have been laid you so much that they have trouble finding the truth but I think that's where it's imperative\nEight listen I'm In no position to give the governor any campaign advice but but if ... if if you happen to still be may be this next to me I don't know if he listened in or whatever but but I I Would he's got to come up with a better argument\nIf this was like it up a pre trial thing a jury you know he was near tested it out I was telling me you got to make a better case you got to make a stronger case with\nPeople as to why you cut the budget or why why you took their ...
