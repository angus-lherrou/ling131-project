[noise]\nMexican federal police in riot your points\nTo cut them off now we're treating over concerns about physical or violent confrontations when there are so many children most in the caravan

seal off the voter before they come into this country and I'll bring out our military\nEcho that threat on Twitter Monday morning making an unsubstantiated claims about middle Easterners mixed in a caravan than continue to attack the Democrats for the border crisis tweeting every time you see a caravan or people attempting to come into our country illegally think of and blamed the Democrats\nPresident Trump went on to say remember the midterms and tweeted that the U.S would now cut off or substantially reduce foreign aid to several Central American countries\n... you know everybody one oh prove what was the middle eastern well prove there's not how 'bout that proves there's not a Middle Eastern ... I did do me this\nThis will jump to ... to me there is not bad people in the crowd out of seven thousand people prove to me that ah um\nThat there is not bad people mixed in there that's the that's the real you know when you think about in your back up a little bit good phrased it a little differently because they're trying to make Trump look like oh well\nYou don't talk about man there's no Middle Eastern people in there it doesn't really matter where they're from it matters what their intentions are matters about who they are as individuals it matters about what ... what they are the what they may do once they get here\nOr there are a lot of people who are suffering and in our ... and just looking for a better place to live absolutely one hundred percent sure\nAnd and but there's also people that are are are are looking to come here to to to um make thin and ... and they heard about the gangs and you've heard about you know hey you can join yes you can do this and and you got a life set up for you and and and so there are people\nI mean you got to be a little bit off Iraq or not to believe that there's some bad people mixed in there and there's bad people everywhere so why wouldn't it be bad people in there and I don't I don't know if they're Middle Eastern I don't know where they're from\nBut uh\nBut they they can be they're fleeing gangs in Honduras there could be Honduras gang members or what is it must Thirteen and ... Middle Eastern\nParticularly but there could be you know I mean they are coming from Central America a very a region of the world that is known for for gangs and and some of the murder capital countries or that these people are fleeing from\n'cause why do you think the good people are leaving yeah I Know I mean\nThey're you know it's it's understandable that there's going to be a mix of some of those those elements we don't want in with the mouse or upwards of a Seventy five hundred people\nYeah and there's another the reports are there's another ... beginning\nA further south\nIn Honduras or ... wherever I'm a I'm a real familiar with the area so geographically and all but anyways there's another ... another caravan beginning\nIt's my understanding is a couple of thousand people\nSo so what's gonna what's gonna happen if these people reach let's just say they reach ... do you want the some of them are reported it had to deal with ... ... do you want\nLet's say by the time they get there there's two three thousand people left and they all lined up and they're all there at the border of Tijuana\nSo what's going to do well I mean what what should America do if they start storm in the wall the gates the fence\n... what do you do you shoot him well you know most people\nWould freak out if he did that especially if you started you know you got innocent looking women and children did\nWhat what what are we going to do me storm to gauge to Mexico to get through at the southern end so so what's going to happen\nAt the southern end so so what's going to happen when they get here\nYou know that that's that's a big dilemma that that there is a reality that that has to be faced\nAnd the choices are not are not easy\nBut the bottom line is you can't let all these people in your ... ... this idea of just you know coming up a storm and the gates and just busting your way through a like they did in southern Mexico well according to a job he says that that's not going to happen here\n\nLet's see Danny Says we should not need to worry right ha ha\nThis is just a symptom of the root problem well what's the root problem\nWhat's the root problem Danny that's what I Want to know the root problem is poverty\nThat's what I'd say the root problem the root problems poverty in these countries the real problem is crime\nCrime in gangs and and and and in in countries that governments that are just just out of control or or or whether they're out of control All right they they have there there is no control\nIt's it's total anarchy the gangs running the show the prisoners are running the prison that's what's happening and and and ah they're so\nThese people are headed our way it's a tough choice\nOn now there's discussion about they want to get it if they want a some sort of asylum that they'll do that in Mexico\nAnd then proceed to the border the United states border but you know\nI don't know what the answer is but I Know that we we we cannot let seven thousand people just walk through our border\nI we're we're letting them come through in now unfortunately they slip through every day\nBut uh as far as uh just letting them through the problems are Adam Adam rights says the drug cartels which is only a problem because of the U.S war on drugs\nOr decriminalize you everything like Portugal and and the problem goes away\nI don't think but\nThat's an argument and and and you may be right Adam but\nThe problem is is that America's not they're not ready for that and they're not going to legalize their drug and and I'm not sure every drugs should be legalized\nUm you know I was a big supporter of the uh\nPot being sold a retail and all that and legalize here in Alaska because I Believe it's a it's a liberty issue most of my conservative friends disagreed with me called me all kinds of names and [noise] but I told him I said listen to if you're if you're really for liberty\nOr ... marijuana is is ... more harm is is is less harmful than than alcohol or\nIf you want to get down to it I'm not seen either one of them are good for you but if you have any comments on his five six Nineteen eighty five six nine one zero eight zero five six nine to eighty five six nine one zero eight zero\nBut anyways and a lot of my conservative friends were opposed to me and you know\nAnd and that's fine because it that they were looking at it from a moral or religious issue and and they got wrapped around that instead of a liberty issue and and liberty has it that that you know legalize marijuana you can\nThat's that's what liberty so tough is that you have to allow other people to do things that you think\nThat's what free speech is is about is allow people to say things that you think ... and its tolerating them as they tolerate you\nAnd so uh that's the difference but moving back ah we just can't let seven thousand people come through our borders and and I don't know what the answer is but that's not going to work we'll be right back here on the ... show\nRight right so given as the years ago in in your ugly they they legalize marijuana and then the government started selling it for a dollar a gram\nWhich which is you know that put the black market 'cause they couldn't compete with the prices so that does all the black market for for their marijuana in a very ugly so I'm I'm sure Portugal is using the same kind of thing you like the black market can't compete with the prices that the government produces\nA the heroine right is what we were so or or whatever I quibbling terra I'm sure if so another\nUh the heroine right is what we were so or or whatever I quibble and Sarah I'm sure if\nSo now that we're subsidize the price of the drug to make it do you make your subsidize oh you don't\nI mean you know are there are people who go buy it from their dealer because qualities or whatever but\nI mean there's a lot of people I talked to who didn't smoke because it was legal and wanted legal and she wants it and they only want to hear from you know shop right right right ... that's going to be a huge part of the population right there also kind of take the excitement out you know I'm doing something illegal you know I mean it won't want to become\nThe rest of us ... thing I mean obviously you know money on the\nStreet that programs and and just hurts you use public interest that is\nA man I I wanted to go buy some pot just so that I could like walk into a store for the first time in actually walk up to a counter and purchase it and not have to go behind the building I mean can you can you come out to the car and I'll get it for you [laughter]\nOut\nA lot of stuff but they're\nNot going in there to ... I'm just just like a bucket legally use it but I don't want to share that with Porter [laughter]\nI'd be cool to see that\nAnd that was the we're the first time ever a bus driver what hey this is really strange man I I'm used to when I was in high school we used to go across the street west high\nOver in the woods and and [laughter] and then he got you got anything you know this is the first time ever went in the store and and actually bought stuff\nBut lots of environmental here uh excuse me so speaking of which like I Am a person who smoke pot before and after legalization in all of that and to to echo what\nThe the whole black market let me tell you it dropped the price of everybody that's just sell it and not in the store you know the black market here in town or the prices dropped on that since it's been legalized too but\nAren't an actress driving up marijuana ... aren't the taxes on marijuana right now\nPushing push the price up and so I I don't I'm a little\nBetter now that more supplies come up with more grow grow up came out but they're not going to be more expensive than the black market but there will be people who are always going to get from their friend quality but I mean there's just a convenience store you can walk and you got a huge variety but no like water to whatever your sketch\nViewer has a you know you're not safe either have to go anywhere sketched Anita\n... drama you know quality is surfing is posted quality up significantly to\nYeah I I you know I I I guess I have a\nHard problem getting cross this legalizing heroin\nJust seems like to hear that that's a big step\nYeah but you're the other side of it is when you put somebody in jail and give them a felony or doing something like that I'd never robbed anybody you know they're recreational use or on their own and they get busted with piles of heroin or\nCocaine or whatever [noise] you know they're like really you can't get a good job you can never vote again on a handgun you're just incentivizing them to continue to grow up you know a lot of people they go through the downward spiral that are all they realize you know what they're doing to their friends and family and they got out of it\nI can I can I can deal with that you know they're ... it'd be a different deal it eight if if we just walked in your apartment and by the way you're shooting up heroin so we are rescue 'em but that's a whole different deal\nThen I'm doing crimes that are involved with heroin you know what I'm saying that you that parade to to to where you don't ruin the guys live because he's just using a man why why mess with me I'm just using okay\nA versus the guy that's out there doing criminal activity that there's a connection to heroin\nRight actually I have yeah that's the point is that what you're trying to say yeah cause that yeah I I\nStarted we go to Rob somebody thought the different heroine right or if he's Robin\nAnd Robin Robin right all\nRight All right but just for the guy that just if you you know\nThe guy that you just decide you know I don't even I Would never recommend anybody doing it um yeah it's terrible it's horrible stuff a horrible horrible I don't know

state operating budget that doesn't borrow annually from the state savings to meet shortfalls be specific\n\nUh he says the fiscal gap can be in a can and must be close by reducing the state spending to a sustainable level now we've we've heard that from every governor there is an by growing the economy through natural resource development we've heard that discipline on the spending side is crucial we've heard that\nStays there is not controlled no amount of taxation or raids on the permanent fund David in will be enough to rescue us that there\nCenter raids on the permanent fund evident

fraud\n\nHuh well you might have to explain that a little further because I don't quite understand that going to be a lot of the river or the voter fraud stuff 'cause I mean we never get a vote or big voter turn so\nAnd and we don't really have a voter fraud issue up here and then we we well we have a two women were or early voting and had gotten ballots by mail oh maybe she means that\nMay maybe they were voting someplace and they are and they got ballots too I'm I'm not quite sure on the comment in when I joined the vote fraud by voting somewhere and doing the ballot Maine but that's about

clearly a major\nDriving force behind are rising crime rates\nHow would you administer um the opioid crisis what are your suggestions you increase performance of Alaska Public schools if your ideas involve additional spending where would the money come from here here's a deal with the schools you just got bulldozed the whole system\nIt's not a problem with teachers is not a problem with you know the schools the buildings it it's a problem with\nThe system that's what has to happen this system has\nTo be torn apart the system has to be\nBulldozed in in in reconstructed from the ground up and

catch me with a couple of things you or something then I'm I'm not aware of\nBut education probably the most important thing that we have as parents for our children and and an education\n... and ... and we ... you know it's so ridiculous about it is that we'll allow it to continue we allow this field system to continue\nIf this business if this business of education was out there like on regular

show\nPatty Hi I just wanted to clarify my comment on Facebook yeah personal experience yesterday I went in the early vote yes\nTo women were standing there and they were talking about getting their mail in ballots and they asked the lady said if we got ballots by mail\n'em and now ... no longer in the race right can we don't vote and she said no you can't because you got here and they said well what if we haven't mail and\nI think that you can do so they proceeded to vote\nWhile carrying on a conversation that I were and the ones that are that we're not going to get in trouble because we've already now in our boats are we\nOh my gosh\nAnd I I I was just appalled I looked at him I said you know at ... fraud and radio exactly I Know it's your business\n[laughter] nice nice folks [laughter]\nYeah break the law in and then tell you the F off my life [laughter]\nYou got to be\nA sign of walk right in front of me so it's not going to be too hard to trace that\nYou know I I only worked division of elections one time and that was a in that Joe Miller Lisa Murkowski fiasco and uh I counted balance and things like that I I\n... you would hope that they have a way of saying wait a minute this person voted here and now we've got a mail in ballot for him here um\nWell gee it is I I Hope that there is some sort of you know ... what do you call it\nA checks and balances checks and balances there you go is\nWhy we need voter id\nBecause right here in the state of our labs you know and and you can you give your voter registration card\nYeah or you can give your driver's license K.
