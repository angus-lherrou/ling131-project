P. dot org yeah huh you can read it it's about sixteen pages as well foot noted\nOh you are an outlet writer in in in in in ... professor the professor and that's what I like to call you okay\nBut ... in it you will see that Ted Stevens as an Interior Department lawyer illegally wrote probably being coached the statehood act\nDuring the Eisenhower administration after it put it in a couple of years as a the district attorney in Fairbanks right so he admitted that was illegal yeah what a can of course was give us the appearance of statehood when they're actually we haven't really been a full fledged uh stayed on equal footing with the other forty eight\nI say forty eight not forty nine because a lot of Hawaii in much the same situation we are so then when we have\nThe D. to disaster of Jimmy Carter did Ted Stevens joined Mike ...\nOr what you were talking about earlier what where do you think America is that right now Bob\nApathy or indifference right right right of corruption and the\nYou know Ron Paul found out when\nWhen he brought a somebody before one of his committed if it was part of the state department bureaucracy and he said what about war declaration and and the bureaucrats said or chocolate rations\nWho pays any attention to those anymore so I mean that's part of the constitution if you want to go to war is supposed to declare it\nSo uh that's the coughing in difference we have because most people kind of shrug it off way I've since Korea\nWho was the ... who ... who would I think in today's time would be a conservative back then what's the sign up\nYou know ... percent was a libertarian there's no question about that\nRight although Jefferson was one that that I Do agree and you could you could align yourself with if you were why do you disagree though yeah plays\nWell just because you had slaves has nothing to do with being a libertarian you can't be a conservative and has no he said he was a libertarian yeah I Know that you said you ask who would be conservative and he said to live with Jerry I'm I'm afraid that and you said I\nDidn't read Jefferson very clearly because when he wrote the declaration of independence\nHe rejoiced in private letters saying yes they didn't touch my phrase all men are created equal\nHe was afraid they were going to put in all white men are created equal and they didn't back to them not to do that because what see what the thought of their minds they would've put it in\nSo he said this means that we will be able to that these people ... percent you will see that is very consistent on that\nOh yeah but he owned slaves and he had a slave mistress\nOr the other slaves ... nothing but Clinton of propaganda I'm Sorry\nThat's not true uh yes it is true is dark matter\nNo to a different reality is like we are in need of hell reality and Clarence Thomas reality and we have ah the\nWe have your white men reality then we also have DNA proved that he had a mistress will move\nOn if you are talking about ... percent because he had his own and consistency\nYeah well I don't have any ... wait a minute to quit or get off your high horse really look\nAnd it could get off your high horse really look slavery was part of businessman plus as part of course if you're claiming that all men are created equal yeah you know ... and you have a minute what happened to have and that was part of commerce\n[noise] like I said the mistress thing as Clinton of propaganda\nIn their DNA proved that what you know it doesn't matter yes it does matter even to the to the ... to the to the ... uh it it it's sort of our white men to say things that are hypocritical\nWhere they say one thing but I Do another what is it what what is it will be wondering what is the ... was was white men\nLet's talk about feminist ...\nAnd ... you're not talking to a feminine born children you're not talking to a feminist buddy well you're you're talking like one yeah you sound like one well I I think you need to prove that\nYou can I Do not I am a conservative and all nine months pregnant but I think that you know you come on and use state what you think you believe your name ... I Love ... answering\nThe question about are you in favor of abortion on demand fall nine months pregnant\nYeah I Am against abortion unless it kills the mother yeah right I Am against abortion so how do you want to get your dream for you started dating or the\nOf people pointing out ... but they say very little about sixty million unborn baby which thirty million are female\nWhite jumped to abortion all of a sudden because of your neck you know we are we asking Hamilton yes I wasn't talking and we're not seeing Jefferson you just say hey hey hey hey you know what happens you know what happens when you can't get your facts\nStraight when you decide that somebody said something that's different than you agree with you immediately jumped to crack\nYou and me and how we shouldn't have them naturally mirror\nMy dear Michael\nThere there you go All right\nSo ah I I Want to get back on subject here this is Tracey I'm what so out of the ... out of the out of the founding fathers what was so you here's Jim you got Jefferson and who else would\nYou think we would ideology or there would match up to what we're talking about today about being conservative and and all that\nMakes them and Henry Madison or\nUnderstood it probably wrote an imperfect constitution and he admitted it and when he found out that the Hamilton was cheating on the limits on the constitution in Jefferson courageously put together the Virginia and Kentucky resolutions to bring back states' rights\nYeah and and and then uh and who else do you think might have played a bachelor and Henry ... George Mason towards me of\nThe some of the anti federalist names are pretty obscure to man I'd have to look grandma\nWell why do you think uh what what I guess so what makes it ... what why do you see such polarizing\nEffect today between the far left in the right it seems like now lose those who we call the socialist Twenty years ago well denied denied denied it and then now today\nThey're they're they're self proclaimed socialists or it it's the same it's the same thing was I\nI don't think our society has a grip on reality we have a society my wife told me the other day that claims that there's eighty three different shades of gender and when you got to ... when you got a society thinks a abortion on demand all nine months of pregnancy is justice\nThere are too afraid to utilize the constitutional tools to stop that that's that's about as mad as situation as you can get and so now we have the idea that men can be a woman from day to day and go inside a woman's locker room or woman's bathroom\nYou just decide who you want to be\nI said it's your own reality it's your own truth [laughter] back and we were seeing this here so I mean if you got your own truth and you're I'm supposed to respect the truth that you can fly until you try to jump off a building and you find out you you can't fly\nHow crazy is is that that that that now they're not going to put their states that are allowing for the the birth of the child to be less blank\nWere mad and you can't talk logic reason and words have no meaning when you're in a society that has meant a society that have gone mad lots of time that the English had their civil\nWar crime wall and the Puritans were mad\nThe French had their revolution the jak bans were mad\nThe Russians had there's the communist they're mad they they they cannot understand reality truth the meaning of words and so a society Spain and went mad in the Nineteen thirties um\nHad that was my interesting it is you know every time you think this nation may be going down and the Republicans falling the republic seems to heal itself a Bob is if you think that's because Alex tight\nLearned that poem that I was talking about earlier talks about do there's never been a democracy this last it over a couple of hundred years they all they all implode they all are and so\nIt's kind of his warning about the United states or were two hundred and forty five or six years old or something and and ah you think we have some longevity left\nI think what we're saying is something more akin to what happened to Rome or the Romans did not like losing their constitution and they were always efforts to try to restore it and for every three steps they took backwards they took one or two steps forward\nThey ah even under Augustus who is considered the first tour on my number where\nHe kept a lot of the forms and placing had certain respects to the rights of the Senate and so forth\nOr if you look at Claudia the he wrote that he wanted to restore the old constitution but they never could\nWhy are we are republic and not a democracy\nWhere republic because of democracy mange that the people rule and a Republican means that the law\nThe rule of law must be followed by all sides and there you go off I have property rights but you want to vote them away that's democracy under a republic no our property rights are respected whether you like it or not because\nPower is rooted in the individual right\nOf power is rooted\nIn that so I'm I'm Sorry all I've done a heartbreaking I've got to do and I appreciate your time I'm
