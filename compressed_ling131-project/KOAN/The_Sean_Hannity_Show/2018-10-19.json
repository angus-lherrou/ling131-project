articles of police wrongdoing um officers in the\n\nIn here here's a logic and hope you don't mind me up you know get bored with me going over this if you have a problem within the household\n\nAnd the car payments late\n\nAnd and and you got the three hundred and fifty bucks to make carpeting what do you do with the three hundred and fifty dollars do you make the car payment or do you put it in earnings reserve accounts your your savings account\n\nOkay so let's say most families going make car payment alright 'cause eight they liked the car they want it to stay in the driveway and in order to make it stay in the driveway\nAnd uh the the ... not come get it is to pay the bill and then the car stays in the driveway so why in the world would you want to take your\nMoney the three hundred and fifty dollars for the car payment and put it in\nTheir earnings reserve account\nNow let's just let's back up a little bit let's just say that that father blame it on ... on the dad that's always easy\nSo dad says hey listen I Need to collect some money I Need everybody's allowance I mean you know\nEverybody's extreme piggy bank money because we got to put three hundred and fifty dollars together in order to make this deal work to make car payment\nOr car payments some very important thing you know transportation gets back and forth to work and I mean for for various reasons car payment it having a car's important\n\nSo so we we all as a family get together and we we based on the consensus based on the understanding that we need that in order to save the car\nWell we've been told\nIn a in a you know if I'm wrong men let let me know\nWe've been told for the last couple of years that if we don't give up our permanent fund David and we're all lose our schools were in a loser houses\nI mean we're we're going to lose teachers weren't lose I mean ... ... says\n[laughter]\nI I can even be more ridiculous than that you know buses aren't gonna run you lose your job you'll lose your house economy's gonna fail economy's gonna just collapse you know I mean it it it gets that bad\nBut when we get but when we do get the three hundred and fifty dollars it doesn't do to make the car payment it doesn't go to pay the bills it it does in their reserve account\n\nI I Know [noise] if you tell me you need a hundred dollars if you're one of my kids and you tell me hey\nWe're having hard times of the house I I Need a hundred bucks because you know that's just what is going to say OK bam a hundred bucks there you go problem solved but\nI find out that a hundred bucks is not a\nBut if I find out that a hundred bucks is not\nOr if they lied to me about what it was for which there's no reason to there's no reason why I don't care what you need money for if need money just asked me for it and in fact and give it the I Will\nI understand telling me it's an emergency gives me a little more incentive that that to reach my pocket and get it if I got it I probably got to go get it from mom anyways\n[laughter] mom got all the money uh so if I got to go get it from mom\nAnd and we got to throw it in the bucket and then we find out later you lied to us about it\nAnd you really did need it you got it over here in this you're putting it in this weird savings account\nSo what does that mean what does that mean\nIt it it it needs to be explained and I've been asking people to explain this ... and I I'm having difficulty time finding somebody explaining it and I happen to know a few people\nFive six Nineteen eighty five six nine one zero eight zero in a break I'm gonna try one more person here see if I can get a get a hold of them see if they're able to to join in five six nine ten eighty\n\nYou know is there is is there is or is or some some sort of a sudden I don't understand as there's something about the budget that\nYou know okay we put it here and then we can drill in the news or because listen the constitutional budget reserve\nIs often a budget at the end of the legislative session that there's generally billions of dollars in there and the legislature king go Rob it but the trick is is they need two thirds vote\nSo the problem they run into is that the people in the majority\nWho got to have the money because they're the ones responsible for balancing the budget\nThey gotta go get more money and the only way you can get more money is from\nThe constitutional budget reserve if that's your that's your choice\nAnd now you need to let Democrats\nHave what they want so then it becomes a big chicken fried you know like everybody's yeah on it\nYou know our\nMancini why don't you need access to that account well heck Johnny once\nBall field they need new harbor extension and in in Juneau um they need new airport deal and in wrangle I'm learning new lighting system in in Petersburg\nThey got to have I it just goes on and on and on I mean there's there's projects all over the ... they're all over the state that need to be done\nThere was a ball field it needs to be built there is a PTA meat or a name in the school needs some bathrooms\n\n... the question is why aren't we utilizing those monies for for the crisis that it's intended for\nHow can we how can we claim that there's a crisis and then lock the money up\n\nAnd another thing is is why would they take well I think\nIf I sat down and talk through this for a few minutes on my bill figure that out as why would they put the money in their earnings reserve accounts were only takes a majority\nTo spin\nWhy lock it up an account where it takes two thirds majority just seems like if you're in the majority you don't want to have to go ask the minority permission because once you have to ask the minority permission to spin a pot of money or a portion of a pot of money\nThen you have to be you have to go along with their request right because it's not just going to say oh yeah go for it yeah go ahead and get in and do whatever you need to do\n... no no no that's not how it's going to work [laughter] they're going to sit back and say oh by the way uh in order to give you access to that and money were no need a couple of billion ourselves for our projects\nAnd that's just what you got to do and that's why a lot of times they don't like opening up the ... the the earnings reserve cab because that's what it creates it just creates more spending and then they have\nTo say well the only way we can do it was open it up and blah blah blah blah\n\nSo there's a lot of things that don't make sense about it\nUm I'll tell you what we're going to do let's let's take a break and let me let me let me try to get a hold of one person who I I might be able to help us explain this a little better and if he can get him on the air and and if you can't then\nWe'll we'll we'll we'll try to get somebody else even today it's a much day friday so we get some maybe try to get some\nMonday I Know I've been talking about this last couple of days and I've been asking the same question and um\nI I I think it's it's it's very very important to crack open something that maybe we don't want to hear we'll be right back\nThink I don't know [noise]\nNow well [noise]\n\nNo [noise]\n[noise]\nThe uh\nThe earnings reserve the the ... the permanent fund monies that are taken from the people get stuffed in earnings reserve but yeah\n\nI Know I'm obsessed with this but this is\n\nBig because one of one of one of the story is true that really the only reason they took the permanent fund dividend was to put money in the bank account so that they get back to the gas line okay let's just get it all out there what if that was true\nWhat about the real reason\nThey needed the money they didn't have a budget crisis necessarily they hadn't pots of money the other way they've already use and the reason they wanted the Bernie from the permanent fund evidence from your permission from the dividend was to fund the gas line\nWas to create an account that had enough cash in it were the backers of the other other gas line\nWould okay the construction and and and go hand in front the money to do it and that stream\nOf revenue that we established job the earnings reserve count and we're gonna continue to make deposits\nAnd that would act as a ... uh as as a backstop to the project\n\nOver what if that was true how would you react five six nine ... nine one zero eight zero\nWould you would you say that was okay would you of wishy ...\nWere asked first do you think the governor should come out and said hey listen this is what we want to do this is why I'm going to take permanent find this is what I mean\nWhat what what would you what would you think on that five six nine ten eighty\n\nBecause see when when it first started it all out when the when the governor first to go over that was some in the ... that was some of the questions out there was that well that was not some of the questions that with some of the statements that were going around the governor is going to take the permanent fun reasons you take Bernard first\n'cause he needs he needs cash backing for the gas line\nAnd so he has to take the permanent fund given because that's the only that's the only money's got that's the only cash dreamy can eat ...\nFive six nine ten eight and let's go to John John welcome to the show\nAt a yeah I that's a good idea what you're talking about but I thought originally when I heard that it had to do with a now like someone that embezzled money I'm normally don't think about doing it when you invest money but when they get taken to court and get found guilty they have to pay that\nRestitution right I think he was stash in there because he wasn't sure he was going to get away with it\n\nThat way you can just you have it right back if the ah legally couldn't keep\nIt from okay now will well wait a minute and say that again you cut out there for a second she you think your your your your theory was that he was taking the money from the people of Alaska in order to do what\nI I don't know what he was going to do with it other than pay bills for the state okay but I had thought he put it into the account\nOr separated it like that because he wasn't sure they were going to let him get away with this and\nYou know our Senate they did\nYeah because it takes more and I don't know I haven't thought through how this works maybe others can it takes more votes\nTo get into their earnings reserve account than it does other accounts takes two thirds\nOh so so so see how that throws a kink in in in in in in your in your kinda you're thinking and and that's what I'd been struggling with this is is\nNow he's got direct access I mean\nWell he doesn't have direct access he actually actually has to go through two thirds of the body in order to get the money so\nTo me it's counterproductive if you need that money to write and I'm just\nA you and I and you and your wife you need we need money for the car payment well heck we got to scrounge up ... all the money and then we ended up the parents we find out parents don't pay the car payment end up sticking in in some reserve account we're going like what ...\nSo did eaten required two thirds to take the money yeah oh\nNo I'm not [laughter] no [laughter] no I just took him to take it but it but\nYeah they don't have to apply now\nWell put it in earnings reserves so now to get out of their earnings are older are only two thirds vote so now you've got to ask not only are a majority but you got to ask members of your majority minority\nPermission and if you ask them permission whether they want\nThey're gonna want a few billion out alerted to raise their projects right\nRight right something right\nRight right so the whole
