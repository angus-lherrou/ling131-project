and he recently wrote a piece for travel weekly suggesting that Labor Day just doesn't fall on the right day running the show nice to have you here\nThanks for having me lead to talk\nSo the first thing I learned from your piece was there in Nineteen Seventy one something called the uniform Monday holiday act in a nutshell was passed in a nutshell what is that after what was that act\nWell it's a it was an access Nineteen Seventy one when Congress decided to move a bunch of holidays as some of us are older old enough to remember when Washington's Birthday Lincoln's Birthday Columbus Day\nI'm an actual days they moved around making Seventy one all the holidays or moved to Mondays to create three day weekends\nIn theory to drive retail sales and and this is but also so people can take longer vacations stuff we at the ... seventies kick or saw ... cruisers traveling around it was to drive the economy and Dr visitation\nOr you say that having Labor Day and the first Monday in September as it has been since Nineteen Seventy one doesn't make economic sense for a lot of reasons maybe a couple of army will\nDecay so someday to make sense to life forces on July Fourth Thanksgiving is always been traditionally a harvest festival so it's always in November\nBut Labor Day is arbitrary it doesn't celebrate a specific date or action or cause it it basically pays homage to a movement and the ... not in the air may so Labor Day it was chosen to be the first Monday of September\nThe problem is what it really has become instead of celebrating organized labor for most of us including me it means summer's over and if you have a kid especially if you're in the northeast school begins\nThe irony is that if you're in most of the country school of colleges and grammar schools they are now going back in the middle of August so Labor Day just just when we shut everything down\nAnd summer isn't over in most prominent any parts of the United states or the first week of Monday in September generally speaking\nTrue I mean according to mother nature's summer doesn't and still the equinox on September twenty first and I'll give you a very brief example of that I live in New Jersey and two or three years ago it was over a hundred degree share on Labor Day and on Tuesday or the lifeguards went home peaches shut down\nEverything closed the governor actually had to order the state beaches reopen and it's a higher lifeguards so people in the state it gets to the beach because of the it was hot because it was so summer\nSo if you were a number of the United states you suggest we move Labor Day to the third Monday in September but one of your main arguments Renee is that uh it would be an economic who's really handle that fifty seconds left but you're single for fourteen day period about thirty nine billion dollars in directs\nSeconds left but you're saying over fourteen day period about thirty nine billion dollars in direct spending unclean taxes in trickle down benefits would result by extending Labor Day and having people stay on the job\nLose by trying to move the day or two weeks us travel you took that thirty nine billion dollars you're talking about hundreds of thousands of jobs instead of having a holiday that effectively shut down one of the country's largest industries travel\nCould actually keep it moving for another two weeks two or three weeks long weekends people would be happier\nAnd country would probably be economically better off there's just no real downsides is\nWhen they make is president of perception here with an interesting idea pushing a Labor Day back city or a third week of September Rene thank you for\nNothing that into our heads I have I have to shift the Africa\nWe'll be right back after this break

now are we find him on the street in Mexico city Nico welcome to show nice to have you here\nBy great to be here thank God it\nAll right so let me get this straight someone goes your website or cause you whatever and says surprise me and I know they fill out a questionnaire um but what do you have an ... and you're going to take them away for a weekend or a week has is it a fixed amount of time or is that is that negotiate all\nThose years and you said it's actual budget officer that pretty much all politics ability across across the board so we kind of started the idea of what's bought traveled a lot of people are more idea that let you more or less what they want to do and how much they want to spend but not necessarily work to go\nAnd do a lot of people here just that there's a choice overload and you don't really know where to begin to research and so the idea is that there's a lot of packaged\nUm tours and and and travel at dinner pretty out there getting sold online but there really isn't just a a questionnaire that you're just about yourself on question what you tell us about what our dog we travel all over the structure you comfortable with um\nWhat are you looking to do on that trip and and then you know you can kind of ... and\nWhat we started was applied strips jealous idea that you just get descriptions of photos and do get a very solid you or your experiencing but you don't know exactly where it is and of course the question on the questionnaires ask you if there's any place that you've already been do you do want to go back to ensure that nobody has a really good experience or else\nAnd I presume you tell them whether it's a warm climate or as winter climate or whether hiking is involved in things so they can pack pack intelligently\nExpect like ... or cured it um died which tried to tell them what they what they get to the age of what they can do to ... with us practices out as well in terms of what's going to be ready for 'em so the dogs here that the world for whatever auditors are yeah\nAnd when did they learned their destination\nSo we have we kind of a package where they are old to open at once they get to the airport so they know what time they have to ... and then once they get there they open it and they get their flight number and I could see where they're going to hope that that is pretty\nPretty last minute and I'm waiting for her but the people that want something um something different so it's funny because we've got a blend of people that are well traveled about what somebody else\nSo it's funny 'cause we've got a blend of people that are well traveled that want somebody else would you also get the novice who just doesn't want to do any of the trouble finding himself or herself and just wants to outsource that whole experience I just thought it was a big job as a way more excited\nMy guess is ... ... he is the co founder and owner of a travel company called ... ballots Jay you B. E. L. dot CEO not dot com Nazi of human look into the ... ... ... C I how many folks have you taken or or surprised with these a surprise adventures and how long have you been doing it\nSo we've been doing that for we've been operating for two years now and we've sent a three hundred clients just about on supplies trips wow\nAnd and tell me honestly as anyone tells you bag is it you know what that just wasn't what I had in mind\nSo that we had one uh only one negative experience that day was actually a great learning things because on the questionnaire um when you're when you're supposed to find your travel offices you you're asked if you want a multi destination experience or if you'd rather spend more time in one place and really immerse yourself there so it's kind of a a travel pays plush and right you don't do so with that\nAnd also if you want to go to many devastation just kind of stick around one and that was all tied up in age and I'm\nAnd their budget doesn't really allow for you know our country hopping by carried by just on the ice under which has multiple nations with an Iceland and they didn't say they watch your life but they have they thought that they were to go to some other countries as well and there were a bit disappointed but all their budget when you're just a trip would in Iceland and this was like one of our like\nOne of our first twenty trips that we did and it was definitely a learning experience so that was the one negative in Utah where um we definitely have to adjust and make sure that we were out you know we were getting information for people in the survey that we do exactly what they want and\nLuckily we're able to reach out and make 'em make it right by them that we actually sent them to the broad neck in August and we planned a response of the entire transport them so they can have a positive experience that your role and and and you know thousands of dollars a night\nOf redemption they're nice reconciliation\nGreat idea well done Nico good marketing one out of three hundred not bad so I I Know that uh we can get you think about a thousand dollars I Know there are companies that do this in charge twenty thousand for weekend um is that is that a fair price about I mean is that can you can expect to have a great weekend with you planning and surprising me for only a thousand bucks\nYeah so that's that's the average right so I mean we we will will with other budget you have so we've actually sent people anybody from you know executives have extremely high budget or anybody that wants to more luxury experience to the to the hospital backpack or that yeah it's really what we found a juvenile under the premise that\nWe give you the luxury we'll give you out of the value added electric travel agent but we\nBut we don't you know we we work with in your budget within your means and that's yeah yeah because right now you know planning a trip it's there's there's a lot of options but luckily traveled more globalized never out of you know but if you want to really find an experiential trip so many\nAlmost estimation trip but that really a quite a bit of adventure culture nature I think that if they're more ... says you have to either do the research yourself and having
