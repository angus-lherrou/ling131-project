your car across the bridge to get to your destination\nI'm not kidding about that is joining us to discuss how this phobia can clearly curtail travel plans for some people if Ken good men he's a licensed clinical social worker who specializes in the treatment of anxiety and CD in Los Angeles\nWelcome to our own world travel can\nOh thank you very much for having me\nAppreciate you being here today so let's begin with the crux of his Sylvia and how inhibiting in his for people who have it when it comes to crossing bridges are driving through tunnels to get to the various destinations\nOh it is terrifying I've had so many patients over the years with the fear of bridges and it comes in variety of different forms\nUm but it is terrifying and people will avoid it at all costs have had a patient who would rather drive thirty miles out of the way than drive over a bridge particularly if it's higher has any sort of traffic component to it\nSo I you know I have a friend who lives in New York City and she literally doesn't want to leave a steady because the only way out of the city is through the channels are over the bridge and she's so paralyzed by fear and I'm curious can someone who's that paralyzed he helped\nOne hundred percent but you have to want it you have to really want to overcome that fear and if you do connect with a therapist who specializes in the fear of any sort of anxiety or they can help you use cognitive behavioral therapy and exposure therapy and\nBy taking small steps over the course of time week by week\nPeople can over overcome it absolutely\nInteresting or the grandmother of suffering without as well almost didn't go to a wedding right frankly\nPeople avoid major major life events because\nOf that yeah it was a big show I remember that but I suppose marriages mentioned when she introduced us America is a great place and there are actually companies out there\nOne in particular we know who operates in the Chesapeake Bay area that Dr fearful drivers over the Chesapeake Bay bridge for twenty five dollars and they say they're getting dozens of Dr overs during the summer season clearly profiting from this phobia\nAny thoughts on this service and you know kind of be helpful\nThat's a great service however for some people it's not a matter of them driving even if they're a passenger they won't do it because they have lots of fears in their mind about what if there's traffic on the origin and I can't get off what if there's an earthquake and the bridge collapses and it would have had a panic attack would have\nYou know there's traffic and I have a heart attack so there's lots of fears that people invent and their imagination that might cause that service not to even be\nOkay can for someone listening to the segment or around the country really tapping into this and has a fear of crossing bridges are tunnels any suggestions quickly on the air that you could give someone\nKnow start slowly so let's say you had a fear right now the patient with she came to me because she had the fear of driving over high rent it and so before we even went to a bridge I wanted to take her to a place that was high not even in a car not even operate in\nA car so we went to the top of my building to deliver to the topic was like eight floors and the goal was to create things I wanted her to ... learn to tolerate it learned that she can deal with it and then we can move on from there but\nWhat happened was she got to the top and she wasn't anxious at all the while I was about four feet high it was kind of a big plant or four feet deep and she never felt like she was going to fall off so that was kind of a waste but when we were going down we took a step down there was a metal staircase you can see through the flat and that's where she became really anxious even though this last only about maybe five inches\nThere was a feeling she could fall through and she can\nSit down and so we worked on walking up and down the stairs first holding on to the handles and maybe just one and then just standing there on one step without holding on any\nUnder the handles and maybe just one and then just standing there on one step without holding on any and she didn't learn that you could tolerate that discovered step by step one by one you're increasing your level of intensity in terms of the anxiety tolerating discomfort tolerating uncertainty and learning can handle anxiety\nAnd it sounds really get to that point you know really really isolating within ... and then you're gonna incrementally take steps towards that right I really appreciate your time today we are show that discusses everything and anything in the world of travel thank you for helping us help others so absolutely\nYou're

but that was a long time ago\nWell it's the same as it was then I guess it is it's the same as it was a thousand year I really just a thousand years literally a thousand years old and ... and it's really beautiful beautiful countryside so what are we are coming up this hour Mary\nIraq coming up in a few minutes and our personal connection segment we'll head down to Embry riddle aeronautical University in Florida to speak with Dr ... Anderson about the national pilot shortage crisis that's unfolding and address and new technologies going on that could help the situation\nShe said the captain Patrick Smith returns in segments three to talk about the fiftieth anniversary of the seven forty seven and he'll also offer some thoughts on membership only airport lounge has\nShown a slicker will share his findings for places to get that some of the best that grilled cheese sandwiches across America later I think it is I'm simply my way through that 'cause it's making me hungry just don't get that\nWill wrap today's live broadcast of R. M. world travel with a travel check in with the CDC in Atlanta pick an update on some travel tips during flu season which is upon us as we speak is I certainly I mean you had a guest holding on the line so\nWe do a folks you know right now between today Saturday October sex and next Sunday October fourteenth the international ballooned fiesta happening in Albuquerque event creates such a picture is seen as more than five hundred higher balloons from over a dozen countries filled area sky\nAnd to give you a taste of what's transpiring now right now as we speak\nAnd why it is such a popular of and joining us on the show hotline is tight young the president of the Albuquerque fiesta hello tai thanks for joining Mary really invaded I\nHello there my pleasure good to be with you\nWell good to have you here with us I Know you've got a lot going on right now we'll get right into it you know as we speak right now just after eleven am eastern time a little bit after nine AM mountain time on October second set the scene for us on exactly what's happening right now at the forty seven Daniel Albuquerque international balloon fiesta\nRelatives are kicked off day and we had a full mess ascension today with nearly all of our five hundred and sixty seven balloons and a box wind effect will join play today so it really kept the blues near the field you're still a few up even though it's warming up quickly and it is just been a perfect day for us\nWorking for the show ... nice to connect with in the\nBank randomly appreciate it a less we've got a lot we want to try and cover with you so I'm going to get into this I guess depending on who or what you want to believe\nMost of the sources out there that we've seen their own projecting commercial airline pilots shortages somewhere between twenty five hundred and five thousand as soon as twenty twenty so you know here in change we already have major shortages that we're seeing impacting most heavily the regional airlines an example is green links airlines that shut down completely earlier this year\nSo what are you seeing and hearing out their path and do you agree with us that this is a serious issue that's going to impact all of us who fly in some way\nBut it is a very serious issue because we're going to need a lot more pilots the uh the pilot population\nIs aging or we have a significant wave of retirements coming up which is making this pilot\nShortage and we also see that the number of pilots has dropped off some of that is then because the airlines in previous years have been in a little bit of a wall and people didn't want to go into the that area in that situation\nAnd those two things overlapping has made a significant shortage in the beginning of the pipeline of putting piled true as commercial airline pilots\nAnd another thing that we want to hit on on top reason for the commercial airline pilot shortage\nIs the FAA changed back I think it was twenty Thirteen their rules to require a a minimum of Fifteen hundred hours of flight time to component commercial flight it's been a controversial rule and resulted really if I think about it and a six fold increase from past requirements\nSo there are some exceptions obviously I Know military pilots and we need seven hundred and fifty hours there some others\nHow do you feel about the Fifteen hundred hour rule and what do you think about some of the chatter that's out there that they may be looking to make some adjustments\nSo it's a it's a very interesting controversial rule as you said what are the things that it impacts all over\nThe country is the fact that airline pilots go direct from their two hundred and fifty hour pilot rating into an airliner and that has some good effects and some bad effects as it turns out it might be better for the safety standpoint\nUh although we're still working on data we try and be data driven about those kind of decisions\nAre looking at how that impacts on an airline good impact that it has right now is that\nThose folks have to go from two hundred and fifty hours of the requirement for the airlines are going to end up being played instructors and if you think we have a shortage of airline pilots we even have a\nA more difficult problem with a shortage of piled instructors and so that population would probably be significantly smaller if this Fifteen hundred power ... wouldn't be there\nIf this Fifteen hundred power will warn wouldn't be there and people were jumping direct the airlines so it's sort of a double edged sword\nThere interesting Hi I'm pat I'd like to talk about Embry ran out clearly\nCollege leader and aeronautics and an aviation I can think of some other and thank you think of preview that comes to mind Embry riddle clearly a high standard is your university standing to allow more students into the school and are you seeing a noticeable increase enrollment as students that are looking to become pilots\nYeah so we've been lucky we've had an increased enrollments for quite a while a those have been small but noticeable increases this year we have a a very large upswing\nIn the number of aeronautical science students which are a pilot track a students and we also see that in engineering for aircraft so aerospace engineering any other engineering associated with the whole aerospace community of building up the infrastructure for airports in her life\nSo all sectors of the field that's good news All right I'd like to get your thoughts ON Technology and the use of technology and whether it's attracting um\nYou know and your students as well to help with the shortage and rapid and I actually have a son and he's had a Tech University in New York state and whenever we're on campus or even talking to him he's always so excited and engage with what school is dealing with the technology and it's really impressive and I was ... it is and I would think it's a good time to be\nInvolved in this field and and be getting into aviation so what are you guys doing it and we're able to connect with your students and and attracts future pilots and as you said um engineers is smiling aeronautics\nLike I tell you it's a really exciting time and when I go in and teach classes\nOr I'm sort of a little envious that I'm not sitting in the seats instead of being up as a forward because uh the new technology is going to bring about changes to to aviation uh that are came to some of the movie as we've seen like avatar and your vendors\nAre some of these vehicles that don't look like classical airplanes are going to come out because of advances\nIn technology so it's it's a really vibrant areas design new airplanes I think the first one you're going to see is is urban air mobility which is the idea that we can take a water essentially very quiet a retelling\nAutomated helicopters and use those to replace a taxis and overlay commission right being able to fly in urban areas wow\nYou know I've seen some of them out there I said let's unpack that a little bit more here because back in may Bonnie sent me the president of Jet Blue ventures she's an act upon herself she was on the program with us and we talked a little bit about one of the companies that they're supporting ... which is essentially is developing regional electric aircraft\nSo with what you just said combined with what Susan Aaron's doing how far along as this technology you know in a world where Tesla electric cars are now navigating our streets you know will it be that long before we are seeing electric Thomas planes flying or ...\nWell we're at the beginning of it but a lot of factors are racing this to an employee very quickly much more quickly than I've ever seen\nIn our industry so as you type thing is they are\nAn airliner it's what we call it in the whole electric airplanes are in that promises to bring down direct operating costs things to emissions\nAre and then the other side of that is a slight little helicopters and what ties both of you together is we're point in the stuff that we've learned from the automotive industry in hybrids and electrify propulsion and using that in airplanes to do sort of the same things where we're reducing the cost and the missions\nAre but we're doing it to make a mission that we couldn't do before so these\nAre little helicopters and might have a whole bunch of little rotors we we couldn't have gas engines that would do that so liquor five propulsion and many different ways is a allowing this really large expansion into new fields of aviation\nI find that fascinating so I Would think that reducing emissions is one of one of the items that what are some other overriding implications that some of the electorate can autonomous technology is going to have I guess in aviation awesome for all of us here on the ground\nWell it's kinda funny um the F a a a has been classically conservative in the certification of autonomous flight controls and when you move to electrify propulsion that has to be baked into that pile already so it's a little bit of a Trojan Horse toward moving forward\nOr the automation of airplanes that I'm Talking you know relatively sophisticated automation because uh most airlines right now have the capability of flying from as soon as they take up too when they land\nBy themselves so we're talking about automation is a point of the airplanes making decisions on Rudy and stuff like that I find themselves and that was brought on by like five propulsion as well\nI I Love the technology and six times you can hear the personal connection that you have to actually has a passion about it and I thought really it was interesting your comment about wishing that you were the seats versus from a divorce but\nI wasn't really nice to connect with the day we thank you very much for sharing your inside some thoughts we'll look forward to staying in touch with you have any back in the future because this clearly is going to continue to unfold and\nProbably a little more rapidly than most of us like\nVery exciting time thanks for having me\nTo pat ...\nAlright mariners are overview on the pilot shortage situation and also just the technology and honey exciting yeah yeah it's interesting to see one of those little helicopters I think my I for some reason that appeals to me more I don't know why how high they fly\nNorth right now we're going to take a quick break for a few commercial messages from our sponsors remember you connect with social media are him with traveled to the west says well we hope we can
