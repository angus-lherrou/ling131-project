discovered why Obama wouldn't tell that Islamic attack for four years but just recap and what you said to me last night\nAnd then this morning it was exactly what I was told the other big forces you know that are high level but obviously can't come on the show you all repeating it about the Democrats and the Chinese out where it is a divide and conquer ...\nConquer you divided approximate what you said that five minute conversation we had last night as you called me like I was in bad that took the call my wife sitting there and then I said I got as a grandma Tamara here's what you said was beautiful and\nThe cats lead in my own research but also people notice I didn't comment on this this this debt journalist in the top story last week I was trying to figure out what\n[laughter]\n\n\n\n\n\nTo kind of slow things down to kind of get things on track which I think it's appropriate which I think it's very important because what we have not seen as we've seen in the rock St presidency is incredible\nAcross the middle east credible firefight incredible just emailed the attacks in the incredible you know all this stuff because it was self inflicted and it was a night when you get to the CIA aspect of it but it was very ... obviously were neutralizing it but what you have is Trump\nPromised stopping the global as global destabilization plan to flood Europe and and the and the rest of the world with radical Islam is ... and\nHe has so yes so the Saudis a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of rape yawning going equipment\nOkay that's fine that's good\nIf they're legitimate ally and they all are legitimate ally because\nThe ... you didn't see has changed\nThe sure we saw the reforms what am I able to drive whether or not being killed for no reason choice ... obviously the left doesn't want that you know ... so how do you set that up\nBut nobody saw was people strung up by their feet in a rich Carlton that's what nobody saw that country change um tell you right now that country change and there's a legitimate reform there\nBut the idea of criticizing and doing things there right now it's very strategic and it was it the play but it's it's dangerous you killed a journalist which is very dangerous because the story was working on motivation why it is um it's problematic\nBecause he was exposing something that I think a\nLot of people want to know I think a lot of people want to see I think a lot of people want to understand what's going on in that part of the world and when you kill somebody and you blame it on a government\nIt's so problematic you didn't blame it on yeah man you can blame it on rock you blame it on the sole provider of a defense\nBuying a capability in the world you you you you you're blamed it on the Saudi you blame it on Saturday they just about a hundred and ten billion dollar and stuff you blame them oh they they've automated there and they killed them come on\nLet's just stop right here right now it was not in Saudi Arabia in in the media would have you think it was in Saudi Arabia and the Saudi\nKilled them it wasn't it stand bowl to be clear it was in a consulate to be clear and the DNC Clinton ... ball killed that individual like they killed that rich and I would put my life on it and if you want to come after me I got hit her with me but\nHe can pull back from that because you you you talked to a lot of folks who I Know as well and then and there are the ones\nYou know it's obvious there's no Saudis in stand bolt killing anybody that's not it just\nFor what for for who\nWell it's clear that like just like\nKavanaugh when I say he's guilty he's ripe all these women and it's proven out between were just told by CNN that show you got killed by Saudi Arabia in Turkey are big arch enemy now\nAnd we're all supposed to believe in and out all fronts deals are supposed to be over and now it prompts doesn't shut down Saudi Arabia or have regime change he's involved killing journalists yes there's been no judge no jury no conviction no proof nor raft\nThis whole rush to judgment is like babies any banners Nineteen Ninety having their brains bashed out to go to war with Iraq\nAnd none of it was true I get it I see the script\nAnd ... ... ... in in guess what I'm saying that big of that\nI have celebrities I have reach it's going to happen\nAnd if you think you're going to reach out to me if you think you're going to touch me you're not going to do nothing I'm In mirror cash if you went on find me on find me the people who you want to kill me like me more as you you're not gonna do it God is great you're not going to do with the you're not going to do anything\nWell I Will say ... who's Zachary Lee a sleigh language but about I'll say this I I've talked to some of the sources and talk to you\nKnow you are talking to ... billion talking to you on I'm friends with these folks and so there's something you said it's all come through and I've
