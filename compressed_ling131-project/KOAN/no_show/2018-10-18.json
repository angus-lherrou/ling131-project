Republican but she's voting for me you\nAre a aligned peace up garbage you say you want to ban all semi auto rivals if that's if you want to open borders you are an enemy of this country you are a globalized piece of felt the cobs\nMaybe Shaq\nIt was just watching it makes me want to vomit effect on the only frat boy blue blood chicken necks\nIt just watching it makes me want to vomit you know fake on the only frat boy blue blood chicken necks carpet bagging down here in Texas go back to it\nFor us to make sure that our elections are free and fair that your vote goes to the intended candidate this this is beyond party politics is getting a this is getting our democracy back on track and when he days it's constantly\nOn track it was I was it's a Democrat trying to censor all the Republicans and all the conservatives and all the questions it's the Democrat threatening everybody but you're talking about our democracy is under threat your friend you little piece of crap sorry just go go back to them\nWill do that I was proud that helped lead the effort to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court I was proud to help lead the effort to confirm justice Brett Kavanaugh to the court\nCongressman O'Rourke would have voted against both of them and he wants to stay like Hillary Clinton promised to appoint\nLeft wing judicial activists to impose their own policy preferences from the bench I I don't think that's what the people of Texas what we want to do the justices who will follow the constitution and follow the law this is what you can expect over the course of this debate a Senator Cruz is not going to be honest with you\nI mean even made for news had met she talks like Obama which is totally fact talk was running as Obama an Asian doesn't sound like that\nFor almost for Bernie Sanders' view a border to what people do but what if you want to be poor you know they're just more watch brutal ... wrote have your own as Obama like for president point three points to\nBoth know trigger finger large both looked like they could still could golf ball through a God and both both us gone back to the contrary let's go back for both looked like they got Mr Ed to avoid\nIf you read ... with Stormy Daniels you would actually have a real horse boy you really bring a jackass a donkey with a horse you get a meal you'd have a mule and a little baby mule oh get both of my screen I'm Sorry I\nI oh I'm so sick of these facts here there you go back to Peter I mean yeah yeah but you know you're\nGoing to be honest with you he's going to make up positions and votes but I've never held or ever take his dishonest\nAbout them yeah I saw it I thought if you stop that after\nThat and that's why the nickname so because it's for congressman O'Rourke\nNot only opposes the costs are getting back to that but the second you know Trump said line Chad\nAbout things that happened in the campaign headquarters always have to promise about votes that's what matters and he did make me mad he did do some flip flopping in the campaign and if you said about Trump but to sit there and use Trump's quotes veto when proposition doors Ted Cruz\nIt doesn't fit when you're a Democrat sang to Ted Cruz when Trump has endorsed Ted Cruz got to get a nickname\nJust looks like a big fat pedophile to me I mean most Democrats are anyway that levels up who knows I say guilt by association I probably not about to fall like let's just she just looks like one let's go back to her\nName's saw because it's for congressman O'Rourke\nNot only opposes the wall\nBut he has said we had too many fences walls already on the border he wants to tear down the ones we have an outlet he brought up El Paso\nEl Paso is right across from war as one of the most dangerous cities in the world three thousand murders last year there was a wall there that wall is one of the tools you can use to protect\nUs all you've heard from Senator Cruz and that's what we should be afraid of 'em it's a campaign based on fear it's it's the same person who is shut down the government is United States of America for sixteen days perhaps because they thought too many people had too much health care as\nLong as again for Obamacare ripped everybody off and tripled prices but Democrats shut down the government all the time to get what they want\nYou can\nTake away health care for millions of American families and vows to repeal protections for preexisting conditions are able to have more health care I won't be able to be well enough to finish their education\nTo go to school I Want to bring people of Texas together which is already likes to Democrats returned from Port Sudan and make sure that we that we understand though than anyone\nElse if we are reducing the barriers whether it is to Mexico or Canada or China or anywhere else so we're selling more that's a good thing if we're renting barriers and shutting down trade that as a bad thing\nReally interesting to hear you talk about a particle circus after [laughter] on it um\nIf you have this special relationship\nWe hit it must have been there the ones that live with all the fixed up and they got beaten they were the circus not the Republicans continue\nUm than than where is the result of that um we were all talk and no action um the terrorists that the president has loving the praying wars that he's entered this country into it's hurting no state war than it's hurting Texas are farmers or ranchers are producers are manufacturers in our exporters\nI think the lowest point we have seen as the confirmation hearings for justice Kavanaugh where we saw Senate Democrats\nBe willing to smear judge Kavanaugh on his family be willing to repeat unsupported uncorroborated allegations and bill after him in a way that ... that I thought it was shameful it was important\nThat that process be fair that doctor forget\nFor every one way better electric rows of the Senate this was a national emergency me not elected\n\nNever wonder how bitcoin at a theory him were created\nRusso media has helped hundreds of companies and individuals make their own crypto currency decentralized watching solutions are
