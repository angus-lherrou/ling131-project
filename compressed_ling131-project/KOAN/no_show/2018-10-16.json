heritage\nAnd the next segment but the Boston Globe has put out a made her was fractured it turns out she's got the lowest level of Native American blood probably ever found in the United states the average American who has an answer for going back as you about one\nPoint six percent Native American and DNA test but it turns out that she has a tiny fraction of that one in one\nTown a zero to four\nDue to a mass ... misstated the entrenched percentage of potential temp generation relative it should be so now it's got to be in generation\nAnd now it's truck back and fever ancestors go back in generations than you know it's a lie now let me find other things like ancestry dot com and twenty three and may\nSee I said I cover this next segment I'm already doing it\nThey just for political correctness I don't know why at six percent African on there because they're saying the the ana seat in the precursor or the founder of humanity at an Africa [noise] more and more study showed that that's not really true but that messes up your whole model\nThere are large groups of people in Asia and other places that they have no connection to Africa they must pose a sheet of humanity a it is true a lot of the genetics of one of the middle east in other areas are out of Africa but what I'm getting at is these boilerplate type deals are are are are very politically correct\nElizabeth Warren ladies and gentlemen have understand anyone with Asian blood\nIs also a match for Native American you don't see the average Mexican walking around saying I'm a native tribes person\nOkay\nBut again they have a large percentage of what you call\nBut again they all have large percentages of what you called Native American blood which is exactly the same as a Japanese or Chinese or

shares struggles seemed real\nWill always be just\nTo\nShow this is a sick joke from geneticists because they know that most European ... you can go to Europe and go find a German family that has nothing but German anti free going back thousands of years you test their blood they're going to have more Native American blood and Elizabeth Warren because Asia the addict blood came into the area\nThe Muslims invaded who're part Asian\nOn average Arabs are part African part Anglo and parts ah Asia that's that's what Arabs are basically genetic background is generally and some people were wider some people are darker you look at the Saudi royal family some people look like they're black because they are are there black half African shown looked like there is wide as I Am\nThat's south of genetics work with the east and the south South Africa the east being Asia meeting the\nIce age populations of Anglos Caucasian you know the ... mountains is where the Caucasians basically starting in show you can do test anybody and they're going to have little genetic pieces of this and that unless\nThey are sub Saharan African like the pygmy try they've tested pygmies blood and each one hundred percent African and it's even that tribe only because they've been isolated for ... in that area\nI mean there's I have been isolated and him reading and things are also very short very little and\nI've read the books about that very very interesting but the whole point is is that\nThis is absolute pure bowl\nTotal complete hoaxes usual and now they're saying oh sorry we estimated that she was way more Native American where she had one drop of that American blood basically now it's one tenth of that or one one twenty four thousand says is that I use that\nSo so so here's it should be this is the Boston Globe dot Madame shop place [laughter] it should be one\nOne\nZero two for one in one thousand twenty fourth [noise] my goodness shut say that'd be like saying yeah my dog's a pit bull it's one one twenty four thousands and you're like you're dog's a Chihuahua they're like no it's a pit bull [laughter]\nI mean you've got Elizabeth Warren's cracker asked leftist but\nThat is obsessed with being something other than the white she gets into major colleges she gets all these a scholarship saying that she's Pocahontas and the fact is she's a fraud and the fact is she made it up I mean she dances around the fire at night and get to the peace pipe and smokes it\nGets on believable ladies and gentleman that I Would not call myself out of America\nBut my dad didn't go to one of these Native Americans but he was a kid or were they would you know it'd be a tourist trap it said they were Native American I mean they went to the deals everybody dance around for three days

is not this this is not\nThis is what book on us looks like very very pretty by the way you know savannah looks like a ever thought of that uh the one of the great books or is your job is but she does not look like Elizabeth Warren\nAlso known as cracker but [laughter] 'cause there's nothing weirder than a leftist virtue signaling that they are a minority when they are so let's continue here\nWow
