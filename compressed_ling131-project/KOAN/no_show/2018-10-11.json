no build up to this really it just kind of like came out of nowhere so it's not even as big of a story so like the the last ... hurricane already forgot the name of it huge buildup we build up days of build up\nAnd then it kind of came and you know it happened but they are\nAllowed gay they had like we can have a buildup and ... you know it was okay but not the worst thing and then hurricane Michael no build up a you know nobody really talks about it then it's actually like a really bad one and it's got a flood almost the entire northern panhandle\nAnd and it's like well okay maybe gets a little news coverage so it's just it's just like everything else and\nTelevision news it's all scripted it's all fake it's all for ratings\nAnd um you know it's just whatever but interestingly enough\nSome people are starting to understand how fake news is on a much larger scale study economic boom largely ignored as TV's Trump coverage it's Ninety two percent negative so it was\nNinety One Ninety One we need to go up to Ninety two\nSo you never hear about the record economic numbers the record jobs growth\nEverything else the record low unemployment and then Gallup passable only\nTwenty percent of people have a great deal slash quite a lot of confidence and TV news even less in Congress see folks and that's why everything they say\nOh you're the blue waivers inevitable blah blah blah blah blah blah blah but\nPeople aren't buying it people are not buying it anymore and so they know all the negative coverage is fake so so you notice though I mean the numbers pretty much correlate
