equals destroy an honorable man's life\nMatt Damon is far more guilty than judge Kavanaugh of raping me because I was going to fly down to the studio today is you know and I sat on a tarmac today 'cause the plane broke for six hours\nAnd allegedly Matt Damon broke the plane because he didn't want the secret out like there's a couple of people being like no as Matt Damon and I'm like oh that is my rapist\nSee anyone can just make this stuff up it's it's just it's ridiculous and and we need due process because you can't prove a negative I Know you've had this Alex and I know I've had this when you're accused of something you can't prove you're not something it's a logic\nInverse that that makes it to someone can just have control over your so that's why instead of just been a constant state of back title I now and I'm just doing the same thing to them except in a way that's obviously that tire because I don't want to bear false actual witness\nNow trying to destroy their lives but you're lucky that really Matt Damon is a gremlin you can take on that forum got ended up going to point whipped up some of the ...\nThe grim one you can take on that forum got ended up going to point ripped up some of the phonics and things could have been worse than on the wing of the plane and then the him and\nWanted me to survive though because he doesn't want to kill his victim because he likes to know that I I get triggered Everytime I hear I like them apples or even if I use an apple product I think about good Will Hunting and of course the vicious rape so it would have been of mercy jail if he did take down the plane\nYou know that that doesn't have was Matt Damon ... and ... the screen this false memory that planted I guess it stand well\nShe's part elephant and ah he has little and and Ben Affleck was there laughing all I remember so laughter out 'cause I don't remember where it was I\nJust remember that there were stairs and laughter and for that I Want seven hundred and fifty grand and or any of my other enemies want to talk smack well guess what you were there to rape and away and I want more money and I want you fired too\nWell right she re seven thousand as of the day she testified what is it now and it was over a million\nI'm sure and and her ex boyfriend just came out did you I'm sure you saw this where I'm sure they used to always be on prop planes she witnessed her and he swore this he's he's just war this ah ah with fear of perjury that\nThat he witnessed Turk coaching another woman how to take a lie detector tests and she got 'em for bank fraud this this news just came out like late late last night and the mainstream media won't report it like she's a proven liar\nAnd they're not afraid to fly and it's not like we just have to believe him we have the witnesses of her own since user globetrotters lobby to fly fly some places are sixteen hours away\nWell yeah and it's you know the left his use our own morality in our own sense of honor against us and and I'm I'm I'm I Do I'm at this point and I know you are as well that they will just use our deference to actual victims that really do need to be heard like the victims of Harvey watching for example\nA ... and they'll use that and they'll use that to put us in a state of fear in a state of immobility and that is when they just acquired power and if they get total power wearing ... and that's why\nMy role is to fight it was satire like I'll do these it's time videos and stuff and and jokes and stuff like that and that's good at waking people up to the absurdity of it\nUm but you know everyone has their role to play but at this point more Americans need to shoulder the burden of fighting or the left is global is nonsense is truth everything is power this Machiavellian nightmare that's happening because\nIt's easy to be if you just say what you believe that really matters is drawn should get a break come back and point Mitch McConnell saying they won't be bullied you want to collect polls show\nI'm gonna get too many come back that major shift in battleground states\nFor Republicans for Trump now the ... just a witch hunt went too far and all the witnesses saying it didn't happen in her memory not the house or the year or whatever but she had a beer and what they were wearing in the room and but she didn't tell anybody and then none of the friends saying it's true and then she's a globe Trotter but a lot about that and then the whole family CIA leftist\nTooth balls I mean it I really think they have gone too far\nYeah they they they woke up a lot of people like I had just this week a few people that are more\nA higher up in LA that haven't talked to me in a while like tax me how I'm doing and stuff because I think they finally saw that appeasement just means you get eaten last\nAnd it's a lot harder to dismiss a cabin on like this centrist\nEagle Scout you know yell guy it was like the left is trying to prove that they can do it to anybody at any time even Mike Pence who never as along with a woman they could do this they could say well it goes was touched\nLike they they they're they're trying to do a power display where no one safe and that caused the show there's going to be a red wave a hundred percent\nThere is no way of people that I Know that aren't we never would vote and think I'm Crazy or like dude we can't let the Democrats take over the house these people are in saying they've weaponized rape accusations like that's a sacred thing like rape is horrible and it's like you can't do this demand 'cause matter naturally protective\nSo we're we're gonna believe women a lotta times and then when you see the obvious you know Feinstein this archaic war reach like when you see someone like that and they're real motives that makes you\nJust all that shit is they are raping the truth and then you have this coach sharing our team got raped by the raft and he gets suspended or fired or now they're even raping language\nOh well the rape of the language is how the left does it you know I'm starting to realize the reason that they actually banned uh to kill a mocking bird my mom teaches a literature\nIs a it's not actually the N. word which the ... and where it is no by the way but it's because it shows due process it shows what the story of a to kill a mocking bird\nExactly don't have any standard would come up with him about this they were at war with the due process\nYeah oh yeah because they need power oh and that is a professor Sam on the left wants to ban he's a nice white guy\nTo be a good guy which is what abolition and all that was well you can't have\nGregory Peck wasn't liberal by the way\nYou can have a white guy and a good role\nThat is the ... of them were white

creepy and weird and given women loser getting ... they're coming to his house I I think there's some ... going on here and I'm not just defending him he's a conservative blackout as it is I mean I'm not defending I think now the jury found him guilty okay I I but I still have some questions\nBut cabin all there is no history of that she's done a pedophile airplanes he's not settling ripe Asian
