correct and the ... that currently\nA real rep pill at fourteen million years off the planet and Doris\nHillary is one of my ...\nHillary and one of my heart Clinton's\nA pariah lineage and that's why I'm not allowed to criticize so uh what do you think Mr night\nWell I think if we could show that she was at least zero point zero nine percent reptilian DNA then that should qualify disliked Elizabeth Warren qualifies for being a Cherokee but no Alex you know we look at the Elizabeth Warren thing it was it should have been considered to be satire\nAnd I thought it was perfect for the battle invaded that story saying that after looking at all is with Warren's thing ugly Hillary had her own DNA tests and she said those conservatives are lying I'm not a hundred percent reptilian DNA I'm only fifty percent now what what are the Daily Beast it\nWas really reprehensible on a number of levels they came out yesterday at five twenty six pm eastern standard time\nOr they came out said Alex roses into wars that lower permanently banned from Twitter in September ... moved seem to be a death blow for info wars just weeks before the kicked off a platforms like YouTube and Facebook and of course they don't mention the fact\nThat YouTube and Facebook and apple were looting they did it within hours of each other all of them doing it at the same time and then of course they also colluded with the press and we saw this pattern happen again last week\nUh we had another eight hundred alternative media sites that were shut down Facebook and Twitter within hours of each other the press had already been notified the press already had their stories ready to run just like they did with us\nSo they're they're wringing their hands of the daily be saying well they should be down but they're still up how are they still up how they still are communicating with people and how do we get them off the remaining social media sites\nAnd so they then site me they said in fact two months after Jones and infowars supposedly Shandong a number of accounts for may live tweeting on Tuesday the Twitter account for infowars real new show with host David night promoted nights claim that Hillary Clinton is quote fifty percent reptilian DNA\nSo they put that out there as if I'm taking that seriously you know it is a satire or Elizabeth Warren's claims are satire but Alex the real amazing thing about this to me is that it was the Daily Beast that was attacking Danny Williams when he was asking a real question a Bill Clinton\nAnd that was please take a DNA test so I can know who my father as you've paid a highway patrol in Arkansas every Christmas they would deliver cash my mother my mother who was black says that you are my father I looked like you I'm lighter skinned and my sister\nCan I please have some closure on this we please take a DNA test either a ... a witness to rest and show that it's not true or then to uh let me know that I've got a father and do and you know walk in the end of the family\nAnd he was vilified\nVilified by the press there in that press conference especially by this reporter from the Daily Beast and she was so bad Alex you you remember that it was live stream here on air force\nI at one point attacked her instead of talking to Danny Way as I said how dare you treat him like this is who are you I said I'm David ... says oh in Fort Worth and this is the Daily Beast the shutting down one\nLand on ... ... let's expand their like how dare they be able to communicate because they want\nTo be a whole lie about us and saying we want violence in that we want to attack the press well hey call from going up the White House all Rosie O'Donnell calls in the military to take crop up at the White House while they say hash tag\n... Republican hall they cannot Baron ... and I think all they say all of this insane crap they want to silence us everywhere\nAnd then when you read and say it's a satire articles I've seen the video replay it later and he ain't hell about a satire article and make jokes they misrepresented were saying and we've only rap points are rising from that not only said that's not only did it just like I said I say\nThat there's Martian motivation was lame silver offered a million dollars or more miles from Star Trek this is not real health and everybody knows that\nThey'll probably say in fact the last time I was like five years ago they said don't think letters or rail and dressed up like one of the show they take their own readers don't get that power this incredible mental illness\nOf what these people are doing and it just gets more and more and more insane David and\nAgain do you agree with me that ahead of the midterms they're planning something really really big but they're everywhere saying Trump's going to cause violence I here's one right here\nUh I mean just today there's just tons of each a shame that Trump's going to get a bunch of people killed Trump wants to media dad a vox editor Trump ... supporters will murdered journalist I mean this is incredible they're the ones calling for violence David\nWell Alex you know they could be laying the foundation for that but let me tell you something they have overthrown our government and our foundation and our constitution and our individual rights if we allow them to get away with shutting down the free press and free speech free speech\nIs separate from the freedom of the press is bad enough to take away the freedom of the press but what they're doing on social media is taking away the building of people\nTo read the press and then comment on what they agree with what they disagree with and that's what they're taking down and they understand that satire I I honestly don't think they're that stupid I honestly don't think the Twitter that stupid they did it within a couple of hours of this\nThey know it's a frog David and again in a Twitter use more than telephones now in many areas or as you know the head of Penn and teller came out and said that it's more power from the courts now show they silences and then they demonize this and they defame much and we don't have\nAny way to respond back or post legal notices are challenged their lives and they are abusing their authority big tax out of control even the head of Google Now admits they're censoring people and says yeah we're helping China he told Congress in a letter last week censorship can help the government it's a good service were offering\nMhm yeah and we can use is outside of China as well and then we saw the good sense or document that was in a Breitbart saying that we're not going to follow\nThe model that has been the historically an America where we have a free market place in free speech we are going to follow the European idea that we're going to have dignity instead of liberty well that's not European idea really that's BF Skinner a behavioral modification idea he wrote the book or\nA beyond freedom and dignity that's really where they're going they're trying to modify our behavior\nThat's right and they take your popular Twitter account down very genteel professional show you out and then a lie about you and say you believe space aliens run things and that a Hillary rap joy and engage in fake news fraud against you when they silence you that is the criminal activity we're dealing with\nHunters anglers campers and survival is get back to nature expand your horizons with the highest quality most versatile unique slingshots and swing votes on the market that swing vote dot com flu votes on us or contact and models start from just Seventeen Ninety they're perfect\nFor your buck outside or story in your vehicle give yourself and your loved ones the excitement and tradition of ... a new frontier in archery and truly modern twist on this primitive survival tool feels the thrill only sleep boat docked huh\nI'm David ... founder of ... where we're proud of our hundred percent grown in stone American Made James whether you're out for dinner working on a farm or on the road diamond guys of genes offers a full spectrum of spouses sizes for any occasion defined year's visit vested dot com that's G.

Williams want to know if a Bill Clinton would take a DNA test to verify or to deny his fraternity but of course let's talk a little bit about the DNA of the Daily Beast\nOr it was just a few days ago that we pointed out\nThat the Chelsea Clinton such on the board of the company that owns the Daily Beast and she's been rewarded with six point six million dollars for doing so so I guess that makes a\nA Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton part of the DNA of the Daily Beast is their ancestors show the parent and the grandmother of the Daily Beast but Alex I Want to say something about Puerto because you know we've had the situation with a\nA fair con coming out and saying uh Jews or he's not anti Semitic he's editor might then they said well that doesn't violate our rules because he didn't say that about a specific person they're saying that I violated the rules because I had targeted harassment of a specific person in other words Hillary Clinton and you know being a reptile\nVoice I figure they're not saying it's bullying so if you I she calls me a dark art in the worst person in the world\nBut yeah I I I Can't say anything bad about her\nAnd she serious about that but let me you know when we heard this a statement this interview with wired magazine the Jack Dorsey had talking about Twitter CEO of Twitter\nAnd he said all that stuff about us being the free speech wing of the free speech party that was just a joke you know they become a joke themselves but they went on to say a lot of people come to Twitter they don't actually see Annapolis service\nBut they kind of looks like is a public square and they have the same sort of accept the expectations of a public square and that is what we have to make sure they get right also make sure that everyone feels safe and that public square so he uses the term public square three times when he testified before Congress to use the term public square five times Alex we have a Supreme Court decision\nThat
