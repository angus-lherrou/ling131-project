good to break the wheel of a double edged and how they want to turn its against each other show very shouting things out we're having some positive stuff go on but I I Want to ask Matt again everything the global if they're doing is falling apart\nBut they're not going to give up that's the one thing is that's an ask if Hillary and other she's planning to run I told you that first falcon fine I mean she's crazy that may change but currently she's planning or telling Democrats just don't even don't even try to you know I'm I'm I'm gonna get it\n... the show with all that these bad things happening to them what are they planning to do next well I think it's plunged the stock market plunged U.S Treasury which China and you are open like trying to do with the Federal Reserve what does the president do\nI think it's time for him to go after the private for profit fellows revenues is real power through Congress put pressure on them to stop the interest rate hikes they've already had eight out of them and uh stop announcing they say five more at least the next year and and and you know the signal hey you've done enough because clearly they're trying to kill this market\nWe're getting ... take on that first one to give it a big nose\nKelly is out and NBC just forty eight hours after blackface scandal may walk away with sixty nine\nAnd NBC just forty eight hours after blackface scandal may walk away with sixty nine million dollars\nIn payout from her five year contract this woman is a corrupt lawyer in my view a liar I told her I Believe Shani has happened she edited the type where to look like that and and I'll just want a buddy now that she's obviously going to get litigated again and it's all ... out of Connecticut\nSo you went to the jury and her body sees that and the deception and we've got not much more time to fall on her but and I just want to remind him I'm gonna get I'm going to get to that 'cause you know she really is amazing and\nHere's the thing she made the point that image Halloween I mean like ... you know you've got a white guy playing a black guy or or vice versa the idea that you're being racist it's all the intention actually agree with her on that statement but here's the point\nThey use that to get rid of her just like they use sexual harassment they covered up forever to get rid of all those other people in Beijing and the here and people at CBS show it's just funny to see her destroyed and the jaws room political correctness or where they eat their own\nBut the false flying all of it is to distract from the economy to distract from the Democrats pushing for that distract from the caravan you agree with that Matt Bracken or maybe she'll orders expert best selling author function shyness enemies foreign a magic dot com the girl that I just said and then and then it got level instinct level you're sworn says\nTwelve days out let's not get too cocky here or what what else should we be worried about\nTheir just a comment on on on Megan Kelly\nI'm I can relate that also to what's happening with Curt Schilling you know he won he was two thousand and four Red Sox World Series hero than for PC reasons east is invited because he's considered Islamic phobic for a report where like posting a you know a cartoon on social media\nSo he's he's being on person by his own organization the red Sox\nHowever more and more people are seeing this as the looney left going further and further out towards you know crazy ... PC World\nAnd I think that more and more moderate liberals are peeling away and getting red pills by this so I'm hopeful that while they're quick craziness is cranking up and intensity they're losing membership and we might see that reflected in the midterms\nBut as far as what we're going to the next I I think that the uh the bomb hoaxes going to be a fizzle especially if it turns out to be an a liberal doing a false flag\nNo I agree and my fear is they're going to go from fake to real but but what you think about my point they don't have command and control anymore that's why they're going with ...\nThat that's all they've got now at a at a much bigger level we've seen sores over decades willing to crush the economy's you know trash currencies to um you know to destabilize control he's always had a hard on for the U.S [noise]\nBut where the main enemy we're there for him where the main enemy the global is cannot permit\nTo exist any successful ... nations\nThey need to bring every successful nation down to the media and which will be incompetent or\nBalkan knives tribal low I surreal unsuccessful serves and then they'll be the the elite masters of all are they ... they have to get rid of the good examples that twice Sweden Germany America or the or primary targets for this\nBut you know I think that people are seeing it for what it is and and that's I think a lot thanks for wars and and Matt Drudge a few others than my first novel that I wrote in two thousand and three\n[noise] excuse me it starts with a false like it's a false flag novel and in that one the shooter allegedly should send a football stadium or is it is a a deranged semi you know a semi nuts homeless veteran\nAnd he shot by the SWAT Team so he can't you know defend themselves\nThe clues were all left in his trailer you know he he didn't do the shooting but he set up to be the shooter so it could possibly be that when they find the bomber it's at the end of a of a chastened a shoot out in a fiery crash and inside of the car you know will be some right wing or\nCan't rule it out just want to put it out\nThat's exactly and everybody knows that it's like the shooter with Mark Wahlberg isn't very real type scenario\nRight point of impact by Stephen Hunter was the novel the novels a lot better than the movie I'm actually ah but yeah they they they'll they would like to do that but I don't think it's really possible I just put it out as I ... in case that does happen if if the guy is killed in a shootout in his body is burned a well except that he really was the\nRight well I'm Glad that she may have just been low level anti forgetting what the false flag narrative out of New York and doing it even a certain professor I think we're not going to show him and I just I'm just saying I was kind of the ... these people and and then now the global is can't help but jump on it to use it but then it turns out to be a patchy false flag\nWhoever did this I think is in danger not much but but but from the global issue now I've gone with the narrative and they're going to try to find out who it is I mean for the FBI can get to him kill them\n... and play it more right wing material on them and and don't and don't let's not forget about the carrot and the caravans only on the back burner but as they more and more of them get put on in buses and on a flatbed truck\nTheir goal is to get to the border before the midterms ... no mistake about that that it will take all fourteen or twenty thousand just a couple of thousand mostly you know as many women and children as possible storming the border and the visible place so that our troops or tear gassing them or\nAnd then it can shape and then we have a civil emergency and an adviser excuse me start burning buildings and trying to trigger African Americans having riots which we know from Alexander sauces on rent the plan is to get blacks arrive\nThat that is something that's going to work with the ... and that won't work with the caravan no no I was just so much talk more about the care about when we come back when I give the number out for law enforcement and former military and expertise that he OD on screen as long as you're calling in on the subject is what you think about fish\nThat was what you think as experts only law enforcement and you know the military personnel straight ahead I'll given on

they thinking about the timing the mode of\nUh and and so much more eight seven seven seven eight nine to five three nine but at the time we have left thanks for coming on with us or what are you really worried about now they're cornered rats I agree with you what are they going to pull next\nWell I've got a few more things about the bomb that are just occurred to me um by by showing the the address is the big labels the fonts\nThey've made it very easy for copycat they basically provided something that will look like it came from this bomber that anybody can generate at home and son from anywhere\nSo they ... they are kind of encouraging copycats that way I think it was a mistake the show so much right off the bat that picture I think gave away too much information\nUm it just helps copycats that that actual hoax bomb there with the wires at each end and the fact that it was PVC and had no black powder tells me that it's not somebody even capable of making a real bomb what you suggested you know to show that they're serious\nI don't think that the person that made that could make a real bomb or they would have packed black powder in it even with no initiation method\nJust so that it would be reported that they had black powder explosive and explosive or potential\nThe way they are there no explosive potential\nIf if somebody was really tried to make a effective folks they would have put like palate er into them even with no ability to to detonate them so I I think that um that they're they are encouraging copycat and we could potentially the a real bond but it would be from this bomber ... not just on\nThis bombers done and I think there'll be arrested\n\nAnd show it was just somebody responding like you said at the political pheromones to do this to fall flat Republicans how embarrassing let me to the Democrats\nIt'll be devastating if it turns out to be a a a a left wing or but on the other hand you know if if um if it's more elaborate plot than we know and and they've got some uh some Patsy stashed away to a you know dying dying issue swatch shootout\nOr then who knows but I I don't think that's very likely I think that in fact I think that's very unlikely\nWhat about the economic ankle I mean the Federal Reserve admits they're trying to quote or make the economy stop overheating when it's far from over here and we're trying to recover\nI don't think that they can do anything in in this time for him I don't think that there's some some button they could push without really giving away their game you know a big moves in the stock market
