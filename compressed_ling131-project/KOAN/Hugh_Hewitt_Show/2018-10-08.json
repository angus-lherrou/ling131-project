snowflake\nWe've gone too far you know we let this political correctness this a snowflake generation take it to a level that's untenable until they're chastened about remember the professors that they want us to have only blacks on campus they end up at evergreen college\nAnd his wife professor didn't get the word so he's on campus they chased him off to college and he never went back so that's the type of thing you're saying and look we're talking about name calling look there was nobody on the planet that gets called worse names in a black conservative I could give you fifty without even break a sweat\nAnd I'll clean one up for you I get called coup but negro in a different way a step in such an Uncle Tom cooler the man up or Thomas Rush Limbaugh want to be all kinds of things and and and they get worse than that\nI mean we've all seen the ice footage and nobody like thirty officers and two or three I'm going to be black and white people are screaming and weren't at him and then the left and I said okay as long as they're worked for the government that is if you work for the government now you deserve to be called out of your anybody\nOh let me tell you it's okay it's funny I was talking about this the other day Alex and it's okay to call up for a white person to call a black man the N. word as long as you're you're renting at a conservative blacks allow it and white left this will allow it to be in the tolerance of that side of the aisle is ridiculous and that's why when people ask me what do you do I tell you I Will get in your grill\nI Will fight you back in uh New York minute I'm trained to fight for that reason and it just it's a sad state of affairs that I've had the train for boys\nDid it there three of whom are men now to fight\nJust to stand up for what they believe in but this is going to take more beatings and finally killings I think we're on with us being the victims and then finally we start fighting back and then they did it start happening to them

the opposite because they go out\nAnd tend to one when these and if a method of white guys morals clubs but with extend them all the time to try to tell him they fight back and not come out in the

writer\nUnbelievable\nWell let me tell you I'm going to be kicked off Twitter because if I'm ever in one of those situations you gonna watch me go to jail but I Will uh taken out about ten or Fifteen of those books because that's the thing is that they don't want you to fight they that's what they want they want to beat us down verbally and then they want to beat us down physically\nAnd Alex let's face it over the past few decades man will we exist if the Republican Party at the conservative movement was doing what it's supposed to know what I mean we\nMan I don't know what you like to do I got better things to do\nI I got a lot of I Love to go out hike I wanted to go fishing I don't want to make us all the time I I don't want to go out to a restaurant with my family to walk up and go after you not seeing knocked my drink over on my face right\nAnd so I look at why are we doing this week and it takes some guts to to get up in the morning go face these people face to face and and I'm not doing it for myself\nI could if you either we could go into obscurity never be bothered again for the most part and they would be happy they got rid of us but we do it because this this country means something in the fact that we have children grandchildren and and I see what's going on in the world and and\nI Am I Know it's not saying it's kind of get a lot worse that's the thing is they say they want to imprison conservatives they say they want to break up families I mean they're really villainous\nThink about it Alex they want to break up families because we don't want to bring illegals into our country they want to break us they want to put us in jail because we use the wrong pronoun in California I mean when you ask me how ridiculous it get I Will tell you wherever we are right now wait a day it'll get even more ridiculous\nWhile I was talking about that may raise this to you and I might even read this on air San Francisco chronicle it talks about people\nCutting themselves and clapping on themselves with the official parades they bring children's too and how foreigners to see the naked people why of San Francisco covered in human feces there's the guardian\nAmericans flee blue states in the hundreds of thousands outta high taxes leaving fewer and opinions of Democrats tab\nIt's red state and in Folsom Street fairs ... consent I meant leather B.D and sham and it says they will teach a consent and stop the Republican rapists by cutting themselves and clapping on each other and I'm not even going to read all the stuff that says here but I mean it's like\nThese this is what happened when we got rid of the lunatic asylum ...\nThink about it in New York you have people like the Blasio who now says it's no they don't even outlaw people deprecating and kissing in public\nI mean you can just do it right there used to be they I forget what they call it but they had it was a nuisance thing and I'm like yeah so now it's no big deal so they have people running around it would make it pay which you know look I'm gonna do it I see some of these girls are hot but would you want your kids to see\nThe whole exactly that's the thing is go do it the private play somebody running around old street\nRight I mean in town square you know and then the busiest place in New York so this is what we're dealing with they they want to tell us that uh yeah I look at teaching ... little kids how to put condoms on all these other things and then they get mad and\nOh yeah what about the world Boy Scout conference and they handed out a hundred thousand condoms six year old ... what the hell was that you send your son to a boy scout convention and they're going to forgive them condoms\nRight well it's no longer the boy scouts anymore it can be any scout so look there is no limit and I am telling folks forget about the the Muslims forget about the illegals coming over the the worst part of what's going on in this country right now is the left us and the
