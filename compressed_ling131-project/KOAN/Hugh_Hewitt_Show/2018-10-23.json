the blood of the people will be on your own hands if you do and the people listen there'll be shape if they don't listen and their blood will be on their on their hands\nI'm I'm blessed to have a guest with us today in Studio vendors Jonathan Shuttlesworth based out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nGrabbed a hold of the fire and be annoying to go into cities and when the last ... which is what we're doing we're working tirelessly to go in and bring the gospel message of Jesus Christ\nTo change the hearts of individuals' and I'm\nJust a few weeks ago Jonathan did a program that he had on his television program one hour just about Christians voting President Trump shot thought it'd be great to date\nTo happy let's talk because there's just two preachers talking to date which you're probably going to hear some things that you don't get paid to talk about dark and great to have you with us here rather than al show let's talk a little bit about\nWhat what did you just address on the program\nWhat you are open what's in the beginning you know everybody's going to see life through a lens when you see life through the lens of Bible prophecy that there's an anti Christ system that wants to one world government\nThen it takes all the personality out who to vote for Hillary or Trump\nWho's had an affair who you like better\nYou understand that you know if you don't have the Bible then you'd say what's wrong about the border being collapse but when you see in the Bible that it's not going to bring about peace it's going to bring about the seven the worst seven years planet earth separate known then it takes all the personality is out of it and you see what's going on right now even at our southern border\nIt's not a bunch of people that want to make it to America it's a contrived\nAttempt to collapse the last sovereign nation on earth to\nBring about a one world government and that's what we're fighting for when America falls or if if you let America fall all of civilization collapses with it and it brings about the one world government that the Bible says we're supposed to actively resist\nA sharp and you can see the leaders calling for it you see that Israel from France Italy lead up to Germany's leader to the pope even calling for open borders right that is not Christian\nNow one of the convention things in America has been the fact that well how could people even vote for Donald Trump so talk a little bit about that\nWell you know they'll they'll always try to play on the on the holiness thing to get Christians to vote one way or no or not vote away so they bring up affairs Donald Trump said how can any Christian which is what I titled my program how can any Christian support Donald Trump\nSo they'll bring up look he's had affairs uses foul language well number one the election was between Jesus Christ and Donald Trump it was Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump and so any any fault you find with him you can find with her\nBut like I said when you pick the personality out of it in the Bible not only talks about the anti Christ\nIt was her but like I said when you pick the personality out of it in the Bible not only talks about the anti Christ with a capital a it says there's many anti Christ with a smaller than anybody that's going for the objection\nOr the objective of a one world government and one world money system the Bible says and revelations Thirteen that's the anti Christ system\nThat he ordered every man both great and small slave in free to receive a mark in their right hand written their forehead and no man could buy or sell without that mark when you see people pushing for that objective I don't care if they have been married for fifty years and go to church every every day\nThey are of an anti Christ spirit because the spirit of God like I heard you teach before they got actually likes nations got lakes God didn't Institute one world government he loves nations and friday and so all the conflict UC right now is over that\nRichard Gere said like with breakfast with the British people voted to exit the EU there like a middle son Todd around the neck where they can't even fish the water's they cannot have ten percent of the fishing threat and there's a Norwegian trolling off\nCatching all the British fish and Belgium is deciding where you can't grow strawberries or whatever and basically they actually in person and have no clue\nSo now you see the marching band the breakfast and all that kinda stuff because after all push by the globe the Syngenta because they want to destroy the nation states\nThat's right and it ended demonic and that's why you see any time a group of people are a person tries to flow in the opposite direction of that all hell breaks loose you literally can do anything you want on air if it's supporting a one world government and the liberal agenda that's actually demonic\nBut then if you do anything moving the other way like they did on the show everybody moves against it because it's it's not the media that's behind it or the aluminum ... it's the devil bits in back of a one world agenda but that's what we're called the do the easy things to lay down and say well what do you take a lot of heat for doing that\nBut the Bible says actually that anti Christ spirit can't accomplish what it wants until he gets in the way is removed and the he's the church so\nIt's not optional if you're a Christian just stay quiet we are anointed to resist and destroyed that spirit and God as an interest in seeing that destroyed so God's not up in heaven saying I Wish people wouldn't be so political from the pulpit\nGod is looking for people like Dr some or all doing all all the guys from before why America never cave preachers used to stand up and address that stuff because they understood it's not politics it's the devil\nLooking to Institute an anti Christ government and God doesn't want it done\nWhich the same thing came again stranger that's right so the anti Christ\nIs anti Christ and the preaching the gospel Yukon preach about the cross you can't preach about repentance you can't preach about the blood you can't preach about the virgin birth you can't preach about the resurrection that's what it is being shed\nThat's right because those things when you preach them change people's hearts\nAnd if people get enough of the seat of the word of God in which is what happened in America in the last election America still had enough of God and the people\nThat they smelled Iraq what's Hillary Clinton and even people that couldn't specifically put their finger on it just new there's something about her that I remember hearing about in church when I was five years old that that that's not right sure and so that's why it's important for ministers to speak because\nGod when you get the word of God in your heart it automatically puts a resistance to anything that's of globalization\nYeah so I mean basically you have two options or three options you don't vote\nWhich actually if you don't vote you voting Democrat that's right or your vote Democrat which if you vote Democrat yes you're voting for the socialist agenda because the Democratic party has been taken over by turtle comment is right on there's no question about it\nAnd even though I have my problems with the Republican Party that's the only ... that you have at this juncture correct to hold the taught\nMe um what is it because in actual fact\nTrump is not actually a Democrat or Republican he's a popular they both tried to stop it corrects the Republicans hated him Democrats hated in the media have him the banking institutions hated the Christians hated him but yet the American people loved them and I believe actually yes more support now than he had when he was running grit even do you see\nThe lives of the polls coming out you know it's gonna be a landslide rod when we get back off of the break we're going to talk about what you can do as a Christian I Believe in God or a patriot that loves America\nWithout the United states that empire is a boost their claims the United states is the empire of the world\nGeorge Washington had

countries that have had the problem so they've seen all of that\nThey've seen all of it right so it it's very imperative Florida is a very important election coming up in two weeks' time because we have either the communist\nMayor of Tallahassee are you with me was it all wrong decided so people are going to\nAnd I apparently I haven't really I don't know much about this mayor but apparently he

even heard that there was one because all we get is the political a drama played out on television with the politicians grandstanding and trucking around like a bunch of ... percent\nOr just take a few minutes look at the cameras are talking about what what a constitutional confirmation actually\nYou know what we what most Americans don't realize is that there's a specific qualification for our constitutional a Supreme Court justices and the draft of the constitution actually late that out in writing\nFirst and foremost I if there was one thing that I could get people of America to set aside and to begin to understand is the fact that Supreme Court justices do not have a lifetime appointment\nThere's absolutely nothing in the constitution about a lifetime appointment you'll never hear those or see those words in the constitution so the term of appointment for a Supreme Court justice is called good behavior\nAnd so what we have to do at a confirmation hearing is to determine the good behavior of a Supreme Court justice now that's not about what he did in high school that's er that's not about what how he lived his life uh before adulthood\nNow morality matters a civility matters but when we're charging a justice on their good behavior what we also need to do is judge their dedication\nTo the constitution their knowledge of the constitution and their understanding of the Constitution's proper application what we saw with Kavanaugh\nWas such a coup roast deviation from how we're actually supposed to be judging justices\nThen it's really hard to understand where do we get\nSo we all pretty much understand at this point that what we saw what not proper but if\nFor example of course they all were on the Senate Judiciary committee Judiciary Committee asking Kavanaugh question\nI Would be asking kinds of questions like do you believe that the Supreme Court is the ultimate arbiter of the power of the federal government do you believe that precedent is above the constitution do you believe\nOr how would you describe the proper application and a interpretation of the supremacy clause what is the power of the states when it comes to federal power what is the limits of federal power and can Congress right any law that they want to write\nIf they can get a majority vote\nAnd all of these questions are all based on a reality that we have today we have Congress men in Congress who actually believe that there is no limit to their power to write law other than what they can muster through with a\nA majority vote and that we have the Supreme Court justices following lock that behind them simply authorizing all of this unconstitutional authority and not even goes to the realm of our most conservative justices us ...\nAnd every time they come for

education system ... the American people I have a hard time formulating the right kinds of questions\nThat she and ended up ... I Know but but they're formulating that question I Believe because that's the kind of question that people want to hear\nThe media the mainstream media is the corporate media is wouldn't be putting forward these questions if the people didn't want them because the only reason they do this is because of market share they're not they're not interested in news\nThey're not treated in some markets that writing journal Tom low yeah I mean a big deal that cable listing shipped twenty five networks they were ranked number toward default off to the hallmark channel and rub before science fiction channel yeah\nOh you know it was a drone joined us I I Do like side by [laughter] blockbuster to rent the old ... right right right so um well they are fiction that is for sure yeah sure anyway let's\nTalk about ah what what drew Christians do and what a patriot through concerning the upcoming election that usually what do you see the the the problems that we were over she ... ... what would you take some time to talk to this from a constitutional standpoint\nYeah well uh Samuel Adams a gave this warning he said\nNo people will painfully surrender their liberties or be easily subdued when knowledge is diffused and virtue is preserved he said but on the contrary when the people become universally ignorant and boxed in their manners that people will think underneath their own weight without the eight of foreign invaders\nSo praying is good just cycling is good and do it but none of that is good if we don't but that's the right knowledge\nSo knowledge without spiritual power is worthless but spiritual power without knowledge is justice worth of work\nSo we have to be about learning we got to be understanding and unfortunately we're at a day right that the you know when you set aside your text books and you've got to pick up the truth and the truth exist in the historical writings of the founders when they drafted the constitution\nThe truth exists with the people who stick to original source materials\nSo for example when we right when we teach we have a radio show that goes Monday through Thursday and Saturday when we talk about these current events from a a constitutional perspective we deal with them from historical truce from proper application and not from what the textbooks tell us so we get back to core principle\nSure what I Want to ask you what I mean you are you both you and your husband middle treat them and probably shouldn't say this but you're rushing linguists\nYes or no you're right and the Russians to do because\nBetter to people and I'm ... and the lord what took to end the lines of the constitution penny presented at one time you actually work for very ... company\nWell I always tell people and if you if you go to my website create than hall dot com you see my bio and you're in it and I'm very\nUpfront about the fact that I'm not I wasn't always a Christian I wasn't always a constitutional it um I I went through a sort of scientific Haitian process that that brought me to the truth but I think that's how\nReal disciples ship of the troops should should happen is what our founders called the free marketplace of ideas it is actually putting a ...\nThe marketplace of ideas it is actually putting uh the the the lives and the truth side by side and discerning what Israel in what is not that's my freedom of speech is so important\nBecause you have to suffer the words of schools in order to discern but the difference between foolishness and truth so uh I was a hardcore socialist I Want to work I was a hard time as\nWell I Would seep in the education system I went through college you know I was\nNot above ... [laughter]\nI was an atheist I was worse than an atheist after I was a conflicted atheist I not only didn't believe God but I hated God which you know that's not quite possible but I was also persecute or of Christians in while he'll God literally brought me through my sort of Damascus moments where\nI became physically and aired could not do for myself anymore\nUntil I had to actually cry out to God they literally said if you are who they say you are\nThen show me how real you are because I Can't do this anymore\nAnd show them the more touchy to Jesus Christ is your lord and savior yes sure know how does it take you from being their social Chanel reading or is it costs to to slush you know well\nYou know when you're I get up into the truth the way God works uh he doesn't filter out certain troop so if you're if you're opening you're asking for wisdom don't be surprised when God shows you things that maybe you don't want to see\nSo even though I was a hardcore socialist\nI was raised in a staunchly Democrat home where the only thing or evil in statements dealt with a Democrat or Republican [laughter] we were hardworking people so my father and still me with a work ethic so I put myself through college I got a degree in biochemistry\n... metro socialist did\nYeah yeah so I got a degree in biochemistry I graduated from college I was all hyped up I'm ready to go make my way\nAnd then I started questioning that sort of ideology that I've been raised with that taxes equals staring at because I'm looking at my paycheck and I'm thinking All right I sacrifice for four years I Lived on tuna fish insulting crackers I had three job student loan\nAlert them all the birds but\nWhen you eat it for months old [laughter]\nAnd so I'm looking at my paycheck and I'm thinking All right now I've got to pay back student loans I gotta I got my own bills to pay for all this money is being pulled out and\nNow I Believe that um I Believe that charity ought to take care of those who cannot take care of themselves the widows the orphans and that sort of thing or not a government forced charity which we should call legalized splendor but a charity the individual\nBut I started noticing that this thought that have been planted in my head that we have to take care of people\nAnd I started noticing that the same people that were not working when I started college we're still not working for years later not because they could at me because they chose not to or they made bad choices that ... that kept them from from helping them\nAnd so I started thinking you know fairness I mean if you work hard\nThen you get the benefits of of your work\nAnd so it started I started questioning the whole he said the foundation of my ideology yeah and and that started\nThe winners from what I Want to hear the phone rang where when it's on all through the breakfast is a major I'm actually finally offerings of of course Russia and I didn't even know [laughter]\nWhile a
