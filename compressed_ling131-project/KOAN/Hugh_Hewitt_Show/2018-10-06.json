Tom watching listening are strange that's inside so keep going but by the product well not quite Lewis a house to ground zero on my radio networks are ten to ... what do you have to in the morning central uh Clyde\n... I Want to go to calls next segment but just other big points you want to make about what's happening the decision humanity has to make the things we're doing what you see coming in the future\nWell the biggest issues mankind has to make is whether or not they want to be ruled by algorithms machines reason why I think uh people are becoming more irritable and aggravated is because they don't realize that they're being controlled by the invisible algorithms computers\nAlso as he got a show it's lowering IQ it's destroying relationships and it it's making us depressed and it's designed to\nYeah I mean you you know the computer's not only reading your mind is making choices for you know and as as as much as it advances you realize that it it looks ... machines\nWhen when they get enough intelligence to realize just how much of a threat we are they know that we can turn them off and so just unleashing of the way they do and not having control of them is something to you on must told us about I mean how it got to the way the computer now than it has a heartbeat for crying out loud\nAnd a dirty Roosevelt you work with getting her togethers that well guess what we have guys we have a computer\nIs literally capable of opening up a ordille and bringing through what would be considered the same creatures and each below crap talked about and I'm thinking oh are you kidding me I mean he said that during a Ted Talk\nAnd I was going to be at the ability to rip open in China is facing cell and bring through it demons or whatever they want to bring it through to try and get it you performed the way they want us to do and its way to backfire eventually one day we're going to\nIt'd be performed the way they want it to you and it's going to backfire eventually one day we're

they're getting a divine a assistance divine influences Irvine oh what's the term when you get up you're basically the additive some art or\nLiterature or the inspiration what what type of psycho say we're looking for an additional demons to take over and take up of the machines on ... and that shows they're totally projecting a psychotic view\nWell it's\nBecause they want to have the power over what is known as a synergy but soon ark has always been been buying rule from the shadows they get\nTheir hand and a man is taking that mantle some of the elite of taking that mantle but of course now they no longer want the mantle given to themselves they want to put me on her back into unknowns God something that was talked about in the Bible is with the anti Christ would do in the future\nAnd they really they get power out of planetary suicide\nPretty much I mean they they they have no\nUh they have no consideration for human guy they believe that\nThere are calling elections made sure on some other planet or some other dimension and so therefore they're willing to take as a whip them uh and we have no choice and we do have a choice we just have to be aware now how it begins if you want to know what the future holds electronically we need to revisit ... book\nAbout a detective trying to ... and I have a book out called trans humans ... and the truth about the singularity that's out right now and Amazon and I started writing and twenty sixteen and I said enjoy sixteen\nI said the biggest unfortunate event is is that our candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump or not talking about the innovations that can just dumping kills one day and we're already an expert actually moving quicker through\nAnd he got in a mosque warns about it and settling his company's destroyed he's attacked because she's one of the billionaire as it goes the meeting where they met all that\nI mean it's crazy well they said you know don't take away our ability to play God if you get in our way will kill you they they said that before they said things like well we're playing God get over it we want to play\nGod because we have the power ability of knowledge to play God and that of course is elusive very an idea you lose that very night is a God doesn't exist so therefore I'm going to be God\nAnd he's a ... like currents while they had a Fisher project for Google said he said I don't believe in God yet and he said yeah we may not destroying you'll be like a Roach we may step on you\nYou don't need to destroy God to get rid of God you just need to ignore it got to get rid of God that's one of the things that just gambles that he said you know why nobody workers used anymore it was because we ignored zoos but yet it yet again you've got people like my Krohn\nOther French President when Donald Trump spoke out against a global as you said I'm willing to take over the reins of power the UN and before before he was elected in in France he said I Want to rule threats like Jupiter which of course the equivalent of suicide which has been gone above our God so\nThis guy says you know this is the great the Roman counterpart Sam ... is Jupiter he said I Am ... these people are crazy\nAnd you look in the Bible who ... on it the state your receipt and it's been seeking a seat of Jupiter which was actually rebuilding in Berlin and Hitler spoke with a very\nUh

about the Kavanaugh hearings and the\nCircus around this entire process so Larry welcome back to the ... show\nYou might be the\nRight to have you here today or Larry look are so many things have been happening in this process uh to me one of the most amazing spectacle than we've seen Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell have suddenly become Republican\nAnd conservative Republican what things stand out to you from from what you've observed so far\nI'm very impressed with Lindsey Graham obviously I differ with him and he was\nThe winner John McCain does not least every work is worth fighting but on the other hand he took a strong stand mired what he did questionable each will have to work on risky screening the right things like a trial where and he did a great service of the nation by companies\nAnd even though I had reservations as long as you look for men Bayliss\nReally too late I have another nominee like please it now appears to be a medically speak\nMatters Susan Collins from Maine isn't worth it and that pretty much box\nOkay tell me why didn't the Republican even agree and the first place to interview myth bloody forward when she had no corroborating witnesses she could not even given time or a date or location for this allegation isn't there an evidence or any threshold you have to meet before they would agree to put on this this ah extra here\nOr there should be you know the silver lining the old sat there and finding and is that the radical elements of the need to move it to its credit radical elements of lack\nOf sexual vision that the Beijing racial debate be credited as the end of the nation moving going out of control running while they\nWere all men because we have roller we exactly delegation we don't do anything about it was written the beep off we don't push back and it just got worse finally it back to when the ...\nThere's been pushback it's about time because while there are of allocate ... army ... a space and others\nFrankly in my opinion not entered trumped up\nYou know people that are just walk all the lights didn't turn out the way they want to or winter Fifteen minutes of fame with creepy worms or ... or something to that effect so that's the way I think right now it's even went for the way it was because men basically have been rolling over\nThese false allegations that dignify\nNeeded appropriate way and I even have a ... law professor person is\nSaying that it's been a Muslim or when the Supreme Court or there wouldn't have been the reaction of federally leftist groups claiming that there was anti Muslim racism and what we do\nIn this country and they were in which you know ugly to shake it up as a sigh\nOf these radical feminists who think they troll everything they say they're radical you\nWell what I'm what I'm also taking away from this is your\nRoommate or Ginsberg who is not looking too good or she cannot even lift her head it seems like she mumbled\nIf she retires ah passes away suddenly or is deemed uh incapacitated if there's only a prelude for what the left will do if Trump prior to replace her seat with a conservative woman for example a will allow me to even be afraid\nTo ah to accept the nomination knowing that they will come under all kinds of vicious attacks what do you say about that\nMay be on the other hand so\nEverything's been dumbed down you know cause what Clinton went through with each and still dunk the ball he's like oh ... yeah\nBut if you're gonna be any kind of a public official if you're going to be claiming if you're going to be old Gilbert you're going to
