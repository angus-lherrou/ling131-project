actual operatives that are like the ones that are saying we have to do something\nAnd I think this is going to turn out to be you know the anti for cat ladies said they were black like little ninjas when they're not wearing their pain cats are but the fact that these are going to prove I think to be non lethal coax bombs strictly made to generate a a you know meet a narrative in the media\nAre I think that the fact that they were they were disseminated widely over a geographical area but in a short timeframe yet without post marks on the stamps this today's it's got to be easy for the FBI to crack\nNow we paying on the FBI all the time you know right so but mainly it's FBI Headquarters out in this field officers believe it or not there are really great fantastic FBI agents there patriots like anybody in the military or anywhere else\nThat and this is what they do for a living they crack nuts like this\nAnd when people think they can walk into CNN headquarters for example or up to George Soros is a house and not be filled they're crazy so I think they had somebody put on goofy sunglasses and a big hat walk into CNN CNN to drop this on a on a desk in the morning a commuter cross\nAnd try to just filtered back out of the building but when they analyze a all the hours at CNN headquarters they're going to find the suspicious person near the packets and they're going to go out in the street and see the same person probably taking off their hat and sunglasses and then getting into a river down the block around the corner\nSure and that's what you actually boiled down earlier but the party's shut off there was also really gain\nThat that that just affects the bombs really aren't real they all look the same a centralized person then it's delivered out I mean this this is just smells of desperation did you see the letter today Donald Trump announced shows are going to get us attacked and we're not calling for that so clear that message goes out make the media the victim\nAnd and all they needed was was folks bombs something that looked plausible\nIf this was a real bomb campaign\nSome of the water going off I mean there's no question about it or at least they'd be saying these were viable I don't think these are viable bombs that all these are just made for the media and and I think that the fact that it was a distributed widely means more than one person probably a small cell or using vehicles and\nVehicles now are filmed on highways and everywhere\nBut let's see I mean let's expand on that\nYou had a guy\nBomb and people in Austin who was real and and people were getting blown up who weren't even though you know the main target real bombs go off easy you got a whole bunch of bomb sent off none of them have their target none of them detonated by accident that lands why you think their hopes bombs 'cause I Know you know as as as as a bomb expert in his mind\nThat lands while you think their hopes bombs 'cause I Know you know as as as as a bomb ex burden as much as did the study that what is it you see all these little bitty bombs are supposedly bombs or that make you think they're they're they're an animate or or dummy\n\nWell the fact that they were they were made\nTo look like they came from the from the post office as far as the Wasserman Schultz return to that um that\nMail I get it you're saying that uh shows and credible and that shows the incredible amateur and shove it and yeah\nWell how much what level ... to it at an amateur thinking you've got to do second third level thinking\nYou have to think like an amateur how do you get somebody at CNN to think that something the woods yet have a known DNC return address oh so some literature from Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nBoy but it sure feels like a little hard rock in the middle I hear you know it's it's not exactly like a a of a secret papers so the thing is I think the entire intact and design of this bomb is to do exactly what it did the explosion happens in the media\nAs a new narrative to change the subject from from or the Democrats encouraging an invasion which favors the Republicans\nTwo winners are on the bottom campaign which they think will fate will change the narrative in favor of the Democrats but when the FBI and ATF\nAnd as much as I was paying on these guys you know the guys that are at the field offices that have to ... up with all the ... and\nAnd now I'm here to talk about ... different groups I understand that will clearly the modem or their level they want to crack taste\nWell sure but but at the next level they'd been pre programming the terror attacks are coming against the left to blame Trump it it's so obvious the timing is what I'm saying I mean no one's calling for violence against liberals and I know of\nAnd and meanwhile they just keep saying we are and now this appears Thirteen Days out Charles is the first target because you know they know he's their main benefactor I agree he probably in ... and Alex is probably don't even know you know al ... says in documents you know calling for violence in funding it\nUh but but but but again this is kind of the the worker bees taking care of the of the mommy be Alexander Soros\nJust based on the pheromones not an email that's going to ever prove culpability here but the the FBI guys\nAt the field office level everything is done to protect everyone's reputation\nIs done with messages that are official in time stamped whereas the deep state to run out of FBI Headquarters was done by the quote unquote small group half dozen guys state half dozen guys at the OJ half dozen guys and FBI when when this case\nWhich has elements in multiple state is being cracked there's a taskforce assembled for this hoax bomb plot and now you've got field offices in in three or four states everything that they send to one another is the time stamp they can't\nDo this up or ... or take it over\nHere serious correct there's a lot of validity because the anti finds the foot soldiers the Democratic party and that if you're right they're going to get busted very very quickly\nThey're going to get busted because as much as some deep state operatives inside of the ... the top floors of the FBI would like to pin this on the right when it's not going to be possible number one these these um FBI or\nAssistance special agents in charge and so forth [noise] putting a type of a crack it tastes like this on their belt launches their career\nWhile you're there on the bottom of this I promise three minutes from one writer calls background is

you know the history you know who the players are you see the pre programming and now it's it's happening as an exact script and I agree with you though\nThis is extreme desperation Mike you're a smart cookie what do you think and one of the former ah challenges folks that I Know you work closely with uh what are they thinking right now what are they saying\nMy my greatest concern right now this caravan that's headed for the U.S border I've I've wondered from day one what's the point of this caravan or the Democrats so stupid that they think\nThat having hordes of people are at the gates you know at the border of America would somehow help them win elections because I think the American people reject that the American people want to protect their border so it it it occurred to me this morning\nThat their plan maybe and again I pray for these people I pray for their safety I don't want to see any kind of violence happen\nAgain when you tell me two days right now and you said you're going to pull a false flag on the camera man and and kill a bunch of them and blame and blame hush\nThat's that's that's exactly right it's just it's just reinforce this morning but I I think that if they bomb if the global is the same people who are sending bombs on CNN if they bombed the caravan or if they shoot up the care of and then and they have CNN cameras there just like they had to CNN camera in that elevator with Jeff Flake\nOr they will have the cameras there they'll have the blood remember every false flag\nThat to to sway the political\nBelonged to the American was ...\nThey need they need blood on camera I mean let's be honest that's what they look for that is what they plan and this is how they could pull it off and it saddens me so much even have to bring up that this this could be a possibility you know Alex I mean the whole reason why you want to warn people\nIt it's not to get people afraid but rather to prevent these kinds of attacks\nAnd we do want to get I'm afraid I'm One of the global is pull this off that's the big fear when not kind of scary with Daesh ladies and gentlemen they funded the Arab Spring they funded everything\nThese global is or cold blooded they've been losing every level and they're desperate and how obvious doesn't have to get when it's coming out cirrhosis funding to carry managing the news it's coming out of ... and then and then now he gets mailed a bomb and Sean is blaming Trump\nThat can be directing the caravan into a kill zone and the kill zone could be it could be a they're being shot from helicopters in a nighttime helicopter raid\nOr that you can't get any nobody has any video footage so they just blame it on America\nOr it could be a global list the plant a bomb inside the care of and who knows what it could be but I think they're paying these people leading them into a trap so they can steal the mid term election they they don't care how many people they killed this is the sad thing is global is they they so desperately seek power they will commit violence they will commit terrorism\nIt will blame innocent people they will murder innocent people we've seen this throughout throughout American history how desperate they are for power they'll do anything\nAnd so we must spread the the alarm because the the bigger pushback that we have the more people stand up and say we know this was a false flag\nThan the greater the safety of all those people will be because maybe the global is will back off back off if they think it won't work so our voices right now can help save lives against these false like terrorists think about that\nNo I agree in fact when I update and and take videos from his live feed and posted infowars dot com going to put that clip what you just shut up fine we can stop it but look when the show started this morning about ten minutes and I said\nThe Clintons ... ... ... ... ... it does the hardy cherish the Clintons a than it does the Obama ah then it goes to the former attorney general then\nIt goes uh Debbie Wasserman Schultz then it goes on down Chris Cuomo dot your supposedly send a bomb and show all\nThe little darling who's been under attack Cuomo saying America was never that great America isn't right it's not going to be great\nAll this anti American crap showing their global showing their non Americans they hate Americans all of the people that are on the ropes are getting the the bombs in the mail so they can be the victims and what a ... and now runs his empire\nSay he says\nYou're rhetoric Trump hurt me stop your speech is bad you're hurting me when he finds anti for that little monster\nWell that the Democrats are of course experts and victimhood this is what they teach young students in college today how to be a victim rather than how to be a someone who contribute to society or how how to think like a victim instead of thinking like a winner\nAnd this is why they hate Trump so much because Trump as a winter and his policies are winning policies and he's helping America when again the Democrats want to tear down America they want to destroy the economy they want to destroy the free market system\nThey want to release prisoners and shut down the prisons are destroyed any border protection and just literally invaded the country you know all this but the thing is\nThey are willing to bomb and murder and mayhem and people in order to accomplish their political goals is the very definition of domestic terrorism\nAnd we see it clearly we've seen it for months I mean maybe more than a year we've seen it but I think more and more of the American people see it as well and I think that right now this early voting surge that we are seeing across America as being reported everywhere\nThe early voting surge I think is more of a red wave surge\nOh by the way they've got major studies out I haven't gotten to yet we'll talk about that saying it is a massively Republican the biggest Republican turnout
