event but I looked at the polls there six people running she is in the middle of the pack\nUh the others are against your basic freedoms I guess just water systems force feeding her but I'm seeing this Internet censorship of libertarians and conservatives everybody now really segue into newspapers into my oral events are into everything where in Canada especially\nThey're trying to arrest people for their political speech now show a real iron curtain descending across the world but I Love what face did she ended up stealing the show in more ways than one she'll say thanks for joining

combined and yet these folks these opinion makers AND gate gate keepers rather of the status quo are inviting everyone onto the stage except for me why because my message to set\nA windmills it's no

about a left\nThat they destroyed everything they touch because every blue sitting in the world every blue country socialist country if you call it blew used to be called red is a hell hole they take

to all the things that I've made the west rate which are really foundational on\nFrankly Christian ten and things like personal responsibility equality of opportunity and freedom\nAnd and so I think

encouraged dental associates\nTwo seven six seven three six six\nYou're listening to be Alex Jones show\n\nFrom the ... of the information to Alex Jones [noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n... gesture Fox News former contributor got fired\nFor law read some of the closure but here's the issue it's all selective libertarians nationalist conservative we can't say anything about the left major anti immigrants with hundreds of thousands of followers and say don't just kill Ted Cruz or\nA vice president pinch led by the New York city professor leading rich and they said we need to kill the staff you know we need to go is what the Twitter accounts from ... hill the staff for serving Ted Cruz\nAnd it's happening all over the country or where there was a case of the news there was a a a gay owner of the most popular restaurant or in Houston\nAnd the governor was down there and they took a picture and put it on Twitter a famous people and then Facebook to the better they protested show bad the owners got rid of all their social media and may just close the restaurant now the restaurant and they closed\nThis is bizarre bullying and it's getting crazy and crash or want to ask cabbage action for you in the cabinet or what do you think Pete\nTrump arrangements syndrome will look like in cash because it's getting crazier and Wilder and their wish to persecute people and ... people showing torturing hey how babble again and be how big of a backlash me\nI think um you're going to see somebody get killed\nAnd eventually the left is going to finally wake up and start seeing just how crazy they all look it's already started in academia you got professors that said we have raised a bunch of federal animals here and we can handle it so you have groups like um\nOh jeeze I Can't recall the name now but there are there's a group of professors that formed and said we've gone too far you know we let this political correctness this a snowflake generation take it to a level that's untenable until they're chasing about remember the professor that they wanted to have only blacks on campus they end up at evergreen college\nAnd his wife professor didn't get the word so he's on campus they chased him off to college and he never went back so that's the type of thing you're saying and look we're talking about name calling look there was nobody on the planet that gets called worse names in a black conservative I could give you fifty without even break in a sweat\nAnd I'll clean one up for you I get called coup button negro in a different way a step in such an Uncle Tom cool to the man opera Thomas Rush Limbaugh want to be all kinds of things and and and they get worse than that\nI mean we've all seen the ice footage and nobody like thirty officers in two or three I'm going to be black and white people are screaming and weren't Adam and an electron that's okay as long as they're worked for the government that is if you work for the government now you deserve to be called that if you're anybody\nLet me tell you it's okay it's funny I was talking about this the other day Alex and it's okay to call for a white person to call a black man the N. word as long as you you're renting at a conservative blacks allow it and white left this will allow it to be in the tolerance of that side of the aisle is ridiculous and that's why when people ask me what do you do I tell you I Will get in your grill\nI Will fight you back in uh New York minute I'm trained to fight for that reason and it's a it's a sad state of affairs that I've had the train for boys\n... there were three of whom are men now to fight just to stand up for what they believe in but this is going to take more beatings and finally killings I think we're on with us being the victims and then finally we start fighting back and then they did it starts happening to them and I think once that occurrence when we start whipping\nWe start fighting back and then they did it start happening to them and I think once that occurs when we start with open that but then you're going to see guys going okay you better leave them alone\nI was about to say they ban Proud Boys off Twitter calling them Nazis one or the opposite because they go out\nAnd tend to want when these anti for mass had white guys morals clubs but with extend them all the time to try to tell them they fight back and knock 'em out in the left calls that bullying if I Try to hit you in the head with a device that could kill you and then I take you out you're a bully so they got their Twitter accounts banned for that video writer\nUnbelievable well let me tell you I'm going to be kicked off Twitter because if I'm ever in one of those situations you don't watch me go to jail but I Will it take it out about ten or Fifteen of those are\n'cause that's the thing is that they don't want you to fight they that's what they want they want to beat us down verbally and then they want to beat us now physically and alec let's face it over the past few decades man will we exist if the Republican Party at the conservative movement was doing what it's supposed to know I mean\nWe look man I don't know what you like to do I got better things to do\nI I got a lot of I Love to go out hike I Want to go fishing I don't want to be doing this all the time I I don't want to go out to a restaurant with my family to go walk over and go after not seeing not my drink over in my face right\nAnd and so I look at why are we doing this we ... it takes some guts to do to get up in the morning go face these people face to face and and I'm not doing it for myself\nI could you either we could go into obscurity never be bothered again for the most part and they would be happy they got rid of it but we do it because this this country means something and the fact that we have children grandchildren and and I see what's going on in the world and and\nI Am I Know it's not to say it's kind of get a lot worse that's the thing is that they say they want to imprison conservative they said they want to break up families I mean they're really ...\nI think about it Alex they want to break up families because we don't want to bring illegals into our country they want to break as they want to put us in jail because we use the wrong pronoun and California I mean when you asked me how ridiculous going to get I Will tell you wherever we are right now wait a day it'll get even more ridiculous\nWhile I was talking about that when they raise this to you and I might even read this on air San Francisco chronicle it talks about people\nCutting themselves and cramping on themselves with the official parades they bring children to and how foreigners to see the naked people why or San Francisco permanent human feces there's the guardian\nAmericans flee blue states in the hundreds of thousands outta high taxes leaving fewer and paying the Democrats tab\nIt's red state and in Folsom Street fairs presidents consent I meant leather B.D a sham and it says they will teach a consent and stop the Republican rapist\nBy cutting themselves and cramping on each other and I'm only going to read all the stuff that says here but I mean you it's like these this is what happened when we got rid of the limited to silence\nWell think about it in New York you have people like the Blasio who now says it's no they don't even outlaw people deprecating and kissing in public I mean you can just do it right that used to be they Africa what they call it but they had it was a nuisance thing and I'm like I said\nYeah so now it's no big deal so they have people running around it would make it pay which you know look I'm gonna do it I've seen some of these girls are hot but would you want your kids to see\nThe whole exactly that's the thing is going to do it the private place will be running around the street\nRight I mean a town square you know and the busiest place in New York so this is what we're dealing with they they want to tell us that uh yeah I look at teaching kids how to put condoms on and all these other things and then they get mad and\nOh yeah what about the world Boy Scout conference and they handed out a hundred thousand condoms or even six year old ... what the hell was that you send your son to a boy scout convention and they're going to give them condoms\nRight well it's no longer the boy scouts anymore it can be any scout so look there is no limit and I am telling folks forget about the the Muslims forget about the illegals coming over the the worst part of what's going on in this country right now is the left us and the ... century made a shut up they don't\nWe don't know I think the leftist aren't there the number one threat\nThey are the threat\nYeah they are the threat to the people that have been training for a decade how to shut our mouths grin and bear it take what they want to put pushed it so it's whatever that agenda is and we gladly capitulate well you know what is time we stand up\nYeah 'cause now they're got all the big companies organizes cents for every body and they used me as the first domino now it's everybody else will come back then again in a cabin off and ask our gash how does how does he think we win this because I have children he's got children\nDo we deal with this I think the answer is Rona backed by\nThe United states of empire is a vote their claims the United states is the empire of the world\nGeorge Washington had warned us against foreign wars the United states of empire shoes that world wars one and two left one broken\nIts former colonies are us

and those are the only two cents per gallon original most trusted name in gravity water filtration\n... innocent but again we allow it because\nWe are fighting back and and I look at how many people do you know Alex honest to God who talk the talk but don't walk the walk these are people that say yeah man I'm In the fight and then you say okay here's what the fight required it requires you to donate it requires you to ...\nYou know I Know a bunch of talk show hosts it back to come on the show and as soon as I got banned everywhere they thought oh I Can't come on your show American man which which it does it hurt I don't need them for the show that they're cowards you're looking at is what hurts me\nLet me say something about that you're the first a TV broadcast that I've done\nAnd I got asked by a lot of people to come on I didn't know media after that 'cause they were all like Kevin come on and tell your story to bash box but it was funny I said the first show I Want to do and it turned out that the your producer contacted me I said I Want to do our job\nBecause I couldn't do that show before I Want people to understand that I'm not afraid to go on and have people go oh there's Kevin on Alex Jones bring it\nYou know look my stories my story it'll be the same where wherever I go but I wanted to make it your show for this reason\nAnd again they build strong in about me that aren't true until about not come on the show was like the little from it about you but even though I was Charlie Manson you're allowed to go on what shows you want to even threaten people don't interview Jones or will ban you 'cause he's so bad well wait I\nI mean I tell a Khamenei was interviewed about ... minutes what is this new thing where you better not talk to somebody because they want to build a strong man and lie about what I shed and not have you here the ... and that's why I hate being censored\nIs not that I'm On almost platforms that now that I'm not on those platforms they can tell the most outrageous oh sure I usually live it and I can't respond\nBut here's the good news and and I think from my perspective and pause possibly for years as well\nPeople know who I Am

about I guess what a wonderful the government is and how often the NSA are and how hard they're working for our safety and how they never invade anyone's private conversation oh no they show is on their computers how they never go near anything private\nAnd sixty minutes had no other angle whatsoever it was just an essay is awesome and that was clearly the government saying look we'll give you an unfettered\nOr access to our stuff also I suspect some other benefit like financial or maybe tax breaks or maybe we won't we won't include you in this you know media parameter who knows what the

every blue city in the world every blue country socialist country we call it blew used to be called red is hell home they take beautiful good places in one of the decade create abject nightmares what is it about these people\nWell I think right at the core is the fact that they are motivated frankly by the forces of evil but quite a side of that in order to move forward\nWith their socialist has really what it is at the end of the day agenda they have to create crises that whenever expansive government can create a offer me solutions\nSo what that has led to is a complete attack on the things

engaging their agenda and achieving it because the stakes couldn't be higher right now for instance in my jurisdiction in Toronto has become a sanctuary city to our self\nProfessed feminist five
