coverage by the latest infowars dot com or slide show sort of already on the mistakes to cover our lives\nElection coverage breaking news coverage it goes right through the election of for about a week after we're going to launch a new show seven to ten [noise]\nRock and former Navy SEAL ordnance expert that selling author tried to shut down for the second one but it more than ...\nWe've got a press conference from the FBI\nSupposedly come up about ten minutes we'll see what the ad the Sanders anything new there\nCover some of that we're taking calls from former ordinance expert or current orders experts people that worked for the military the police they've all to make it really really great point and an innocent aren't buying what's happening but I'll say that she's\nWritten a bunch of calls saying hey we live in Florida and you can't have thick tent on vans or anything which I Know Florida has even stronger laws in Texas because I I've been driving through four four and a you know folks have had problems from Texas there with darker Tam\nThis guy had all the windows except the windshield cupboard in perfect wraps\nThat that that that that that exactly into it except for the two front windows aside windows in the windshield and uh again some of these are perfect wraps up this whole thing just looks ridiculous so you get your car vandalized\nAny of this uh it's just the whole thing look synthetic man I Want to go to vox callers and get your take on what they have to say but\nWe're eleven days out we knew this was kind of the media hyping that we were going to cause violence against them they're number one story for six months will show obvious there were pre programming and I'm really concerned that they're just beta testing with this and that we buy this an additional successful they are going to pull a real false flag not one of the fact bombs\nYeah there's there's no way this is I'm having the intended effect my wife I already voted by mail my wife voted today and it's the same story they're talking about a\nLocal radio she had to wait more than an hour where normally you know you walk in for a midterm election you rented out in a minute\nAnd people are saying they haven't seen anything like this in Thirty years including twenty sixteen presidential election\nAnd it's all people that are pissed off that are Republicans so I think that this is a you know this is so obvious to you know those wraps and the windows the guy didn't make that at home you had to go to a printer that has a big you know large format machine\nYou might have done the work on his computer but I'm a print or had to create those and the FBI I'm sure knows who who are printed them in when if they were created you know in the last two weeks\nIt's going to look pretty obvious that it was part of the entire hoax pipe bomb scheme\nNot not something you know organic that the guys were putting on your ... year we've all seen these campers and vans covered with stickers\nThere one on top of the other they're faded they're appealing because they go on as the guys get struck by new bumper sticker stick on top this is a this is deliberate this was professionally printed\nBut oh it is but let's expand on that why would any Trump supporter conservatives libertarians fresh and we're not into violence offensively that's not in the you know other than the fake Oklahoma City which again was holder and the rest of them we know why on earth\nWould you would were winning shin to Hillary and bill and Obama and holder and sorrows and make them victims is the worst thing you could do\nIt it's all it's a false flag including the van I think that he intended to be caught part of the reason for his is fake bombs not even having any gunpowder for example is that in court in trial he can claim he never had any intention or capability of harming anybody that it was justice\n... and all he gets to six months in ...\nIt's harming anybody that it was just a ...\nAnd all he gets to six months in a lunatic asylum aided Broward County or where they had this whole thing if you're caught a minority given all these crimes and they let you go absolutely and that's the missing link the sheriff Israel of our county is in command\nRight but I'm sure that uh you know they're going to they'll they'll know who is in and out in terms of lawyers and if it's you know in an ACL you a lawyer or the you know the firm that represented a oh the Kavanaugh accusers\nWill do the fixes and there but but I think that the guy's going to come out to the arraignment and he's going to be out and you know you know a God Bless Trump I Love Trump Trump forever yeah it's all part of it for the next ... days but I think it's going to have the reverse effect the vantage so obviously a bogus part of\nA well I say there's nobody I Know buys that did this whole thing is real and now this is this morning he got a box in New York only on that racket Alex Jones or an aerospace engineer on the bombings what do you think about not just the the fake bombing and the fact bombs but now dish\nWell are they all wanted to point out about the the state bombs being a\nPolitical event orchestrated from Mexico political fact is that it took him up for three days to to send it to believe declared these things I mean a punch first glance Alex any competent intelligence agent or a or\nA bomb experts which said nope no way I mean they they really do think that the dollar store elite the device with a one point five ... watch battery doesn't have the kind of a outputs or even a triggers or date floodgates him to do it\nSo the fact that I I have a difficult time accepting that it took them three days a to tell us this I mean I certainly hope not always ... me and they just got a really dumb or or they deliberately how this uh information from maximum political fact which the ladder I think it's definitely the case\nI forgive the Don lemons and the ... puts his times to to milk it which is what they've been doing these last three days a ... I'm sure it's a cheesy October surprise and if this is the best they got I mean a ... pretty bad actually\nNo I agree it's a really cheesy October surprise and that's why I'm really concerned that this is a distraction from something bigger Matt like you shed and I want to get boxers take first an attack on that care of and that just like\nJames Woods and you and I predicted they wouldn't be on what they got trucks bringing them up right on time a few days before and claim some militia right winger shoots these phones what do you think vouched\nWell I'll tell you what I I Do think that um that obviously it's stage that one too and uh it's just so ... gene sharp technique of sort of roping your target\nBeing trucked into an untenable media position by having like pregnant women and children up front and then what the the the guards have to sort of like either physically restrain them or shoot them or something with a rubber bullets or something so this is a way to sort of\nLike an ... an attempt not it's not going to be a successful on but sort of rope Trump and and this is a wind ski ...\nAnd that's why they shed agree on Lenski and and you cannot borders no borders no wall know usa at all and the good news is Lou Dobbs James Woods it's not just out shows now\nIt's Rush Limbaugh all saying this is a false flag this is a stunt it's fake everyone agrees I think that's the real moment we've crossed year botch isn't it now and I like to say I'm becoming an obsolete in a way\nAnd that's why they should all the news in the Republican Party has now been Alex Jones or size well no you just met reality it's not me people now have in common sense it's safer to say it now box right points thank you met comments on that\nYeah the the the mainstream media is just catching up to where we've been for years um you know that there is there's no doubt that they're milking the fake fake pseudo bombs they're still carrying these things out in that you know containment truck\nBlocking off New York city traffic like it's a you know plutonium device they evacuated the CNN building like it was you know a truck bomb the thing what if it even if it was full of gunpowder it wouldn't blow up a broom closet you know not an\n... year hand it might of ... had a few your fingers get scolded I mean it's just\nPure crap to to evacuate buildings over it and then to have you know the helicopter views of you know six blocks of New York or you know cordoned off with like prime taping cop cars\nAnd called on calling out the national guard and breath mostly it's so obvious breathless and and\nThe the mayor of you know what I'm saying these are real these are dangerous leaders carry real they're real you protest too much buddy\nHi I'm Dan ...

broadcast in\nOne week you know I mean come on really the fake bombs the whole a movement I'm On the midterms this is probably the most important mid term I'm In the in the last fifty years I mean if you think about what's happening right now\nUh in terms of mainstream media and what's what's been happening in shutting down the voice of of conservatives are throughout the country in fact as as really a global this attack on the idea that nationalism matters and\nAnd I think it does [laughter] you know [laughter] I'm Glad to hear somebody or in the oval office standing up for the first time in a very long time with the suggestion that are having your national interest as a priority\nIs or what the executive is supposed to be about it it's not about global as I'm sure it's about sharing information cooperating where'd you shared values and common interests\nBut it's not that I'm the way it's been running and certainly a America was never intended\nTo be the policemen of the world in fact I Would say way way on the opposite side I'm On the agenda when you think about a globalism you know here uh in in my part of the United states in Alaska\nOr you know this is a major issue think about where Alaska\nSits today we're at the top of the world recover the northern hemisphere so easily in terms of our a strategic position UPS FedEx based or international hubs here because it's about equal distance going across\nThe globe into the entire northern hemisphere of the planet when you look at a strategic bases\nIn Alaska there's another reason Alaska and critically important uh to the defense of all of the northern hemisphere when you think of Europe\nWe don't need to be based in Europe anymore uh when you think about um where America can reach the world I mean in terms of our strategic bases we have ... on the far side of the Pacific is just access to Asia\nWay of Hawaii in the middle Pacific gives us access to everything within the Pacific region if you look on the screen right now are some of the major military bases in Alaska and these don't include a number of stations listening post another post a scattered around the state of when you think about\nUm you're teaching a positioning I'm In the world the United states has the Virgin Islands in the\nIn the Atlantic it takes us out quite a ways when we look at Puerto Rico a Florida these places that get us into the southern hemisphere\nWe can be virtually anywhere within ten or twelve hours\n... aside from the police we have stationed around the world a re think of all of this is what's underway right now and and and because of all this bomb discussion\nThere also is a major issues being missed that I Want to cover up in this in this segment have nothing to do with terrorism have nothing to do with bombing but as everything to do with things that actually affect us\nEvery single day but I Want to get back in uh\nThe midterms as we look at what's what's shaping up as as the most important election of a of our history and I would not trust these old send me remember when Trump\nOr was winning and the polls were saying he's twelve points behind these ten points by what is that had\nThe polls are not accurate anymore and the reason they're not accurate is too many people are not participating or not feeding or the polling system they just hang up\nPeople are burned out and being called all the time early polling um is is probably dominant Lee I'm Republican I think this is a a telltale sign of what's happening the effort to the left is back firing the desperation to the left are showing itself and the fact of the matter is\nWe need to maintain the majorities are that are in the Congress right now if we're going to see anything happen we saw eight years of gridlock under Obama virtually nothing happened after the first couple of years and then it was a fight for the next six\nWe've made it through the first two years of the Trump Administration successfully we've got the lowest unemployment and fifty years we had the highest stock market and and I want to talk a little bit about the market as we would go through the segments today but the main thing to remember here is interest rates\nWe would go through the segments today but the main thing to remember here is interest rates are rising because of the Federal Reserve which is not a federal agency has all these listeners though but the fact is\nThe fed is manipulating the economy and suggesting that there's going to be four to five more rate hikes over the next Fifteen Eighteen months what's that going to do to the economy it's going to stop it in its tracks\nThink about what happens to the national debt has eight increment up these interest rates and a bigger and bigger portion of the debt\nThat the Democrats ran up over the last eight years doubling maybe even tripling of the national obligations going forward to increase the interest on this now is gonna just crush the dry that's happening right now to build this caught\nWe can't let the Federal Reserve continue to manipulate under the fear of inflation there there isn't really an inflation going up it's so counter\nOr to logic and were inflation is happening as the wages a little bit\nAnd long long overdue the average wages against inflation even the small inflation we've had been deteriorating over the last Fifteen Years it used to be one person in a household to support the entire household now to people in the household are barely making it working fulltime\nThe situation has changed there's a lot of money had been made corporate leader in the last couple of years because of the reforms of the Trump Administration and now we're starting to see those moved down towards the workforce towards working people which actually the Republicans are representing better than the Democrats these days\nI mean think about it at least\nWe're looking at in Hansing opportunities for people that are already in the country and
