they're just enjoying being part of the power structure we have to be the people that move the ball down the field and does the president's on fire and that's why he's under attack and you know here's the thing\n\nI've got all these news articles and all these things I should be covered over there right now but\nFor me it it it it it it really just goes back to\nHow screwed up it is that we have people actively that want to get rid of our nation get rid of our borders get rid of our country and who literally hate our success\nAnd who are just really bad people and it should be much easier to

others vote the names of dead people and all the arrest that are happening and then ... just on CNN saying there is no voter fraud it does not exist when we have all the hidden camera videos of his group\nAnd other people's groups engaged in all sorts of horrible activity and all of a Democrat groups saying we buy send people to vote ten times of peace we bring in homeless people standing illegal aliens and it's had Democrats in New Jersey and New York and in Illinois all come in and cry and none\nThem got their bad actors and president and that's why all of this comedy show\nThat

me\nGiving me hugs you name it men and women old young\nAnd it boosted my heart to know that we did launch\nThe restoration of America but now we're under a massive attack and and I don't announce how important we are and how important are works man they will destroy harsh and then we won't be there to fight in the future\nI Want nothing better to bring balance back to back the level of stop and destabilize the country will still have problems but to not be in this war and I would retire right now man I've been doing this twenty three years and I'm sure obsessed with it that you are either totally committed\nOr you are you're either totally committed or you are out of the game and I eat drink sleep\nThe stuff I got home at midnight last night from Houston we drove down there and wrote

adjust it was all super vivid ship or a judge and I'd\nJust as I say I can't it's just everything and so we get censored\nAnd band on Eighteenth sub accounts on Twitter yesterday and all the lives in a simple out there in the media doesn't make me think oh I'm being defeated are being attacked it makes me think my God when does America wake up when does Congress do something you know we talked yesterday off record to the head of the Trump campaign\nAnd\nIf you can't say something nice Joe ... anything at all for grandma always said\n\nBut we can't sit there and get pissed off about their big people around the president there just enjoying being part of the power structure we have to be the people that move the ball down the field and does the president's on fire and that's why he's under attack and and you know here's the thing\n\nI've got all these news articles and all these things I should be covered on air right now but for me it it it it it it really just goes back to how screwed up it is that we have\nPeople actively that want to get rid of our nation get rid of our borders get rid of our country and who literally hate our success\nAnd who are just really bad people and it should be much easier to say I don't want to be communist China or Soviet Russia or a socialist finished oil or I don't want to have America One big\nAnti free speech authoritarian control freak out a file Berkeley I'm In the left really are a bunch of damons\nAnd at the end of the day more and more I don't even think that things are a political solution it really is a spiritual solution and we really are just dealing with a bunch of\nDamon possessed garbage who we have been so nice to and put up with and appeased and peas in a piece that now they say we can't say nationalist we can't say mother and father capitalism is bad yeah people are gone\nAnd\nI don't care what you say about me I don't care what you do to me anymore\nI Will not bound to you\nAnd when I have that spirit I feel closer to God the idea of them went to the idea of giving in to them is orchard for me and I'm just frustrated up here wondering why do I do how do I take action\n\nI mean we should all the proof of Democrats having illegal aliens and others vote the names of dead people and all the arrest that are happening in the Van Jones is on CNN saying there is no voter fraud it does not exist when we have all the hidden camera videos of his group\nAnd other people's groups engage in all sorts of horrible activity and all the Democrat ribs saying we send people to vote ten times of peace we bring in homeless people standing illegal aliens and it's the had Democrats in New Jersey and New York and in Illinois all come in and cried said none\nThem got their bad actors that prize that and that's why all of this comedy show damn arrogant\nBecause they had been getting away with things forever so I'm going to control myself because I Want it up at the phones up at a special guest NASCAR but I wanted to have you respond to what's happening everything that's going on it's just\n\nIt's just no decision that there's not even ... why would anyone be with these people why would anyone want to be associated with it why would anyone you go to a Democrat events I don't feel powerful that they look like mental patients\nLike I said but if I was a director making a movie about a mental institution all I happen to was not pay some casting company millions of dollars for casting it costs a million dollars I Would go down to a Democrat Party of at and every one out of the most crazier than people you ever saw in the state hospital\nI mean there is a crazy people\n\nSee I'm not covering news because there's too much it's not there's not enough and this is all just insane everything I've got here it's just it's all infowars dot com it's all on those wars dot com and I haven't even gotten into Trump finally got caught using the N. word\nWe're gonna play video we come back the next segment is very very sad moment now though you had to your heart jumping your throat there yeah oh it's got 'em using the N. word folks and uh I'm going to say that I support president using the word\n\nAbout the media will lead at that and put that out separately does matter they're the ones that are deceptive when you come back you'll see why didn't work\n\nBecause again it's not about being emotional it's not about being mindless it's about executed and I have to be the same way\nI haven't gotten into Obama as like a thousand people in this crowd out I'd rather have the video will get to that and then I'll get to the Chinese military working with the candidate but anti submarine devices right off our waters I mean it's just it's all unbelievable\nBut I'll tell you this I really am most frustrated that we're all going to have to go through the pain that's coming when it could have been so easy to avoid all this but I think really my frustration is it's clear the world has cancer it's called the left\nAnd they're not going to go away without a fight and they take our morality of our time this is with us and\nThe frustration is crushing them has no victory in it because
