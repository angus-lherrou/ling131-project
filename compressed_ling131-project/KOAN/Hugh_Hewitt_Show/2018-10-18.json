Matt\nWhat keeps you asleep at night were twenty deja out we are winning the national candidates are either winning in primaries are winning from Brazil to Europe or Merkel or they've had like what Fifteen elections and she's also every one she's about to be out\nAgain folks are parliamentary so it takes a lot longer which was dominant party everything they're doing turning to clap but I don't want to be that guy that he's like Hillary and gets to competent I Want to be now right when we're getting a big you're right like a huge fish are getting about\nOne time we got this big tournament rental self like five thousand dollars out in the Gulf of Mexico Iraq we did get it in a salad and made our money back and everything from the big trip whole trip was paid for with it you know the hotel everything rather fishing for five days but it's like you don't want to count official attend about and gas\nAnd into the ice show what are you worried about as big as fish of American Restoration is right above what do we do how do we lose that oh\nWell you have to factor in probably a five percent margin for feeding by the other side so you you can't say we're going to win by one percent\nIf you if you if you think you're going to get it over the line with one percent it's not going to work they'll do a recount they'll find suitcases floating in the bay full of of ah on counted ballot so you know you've got to actually just a heads dumped them scanned\nThey showed exactly and they showed their crazed they'll do anything\nYeah and their trucks out of work they rolled out one October surprise after another and they've all blown up in their faces like trick cigars\nKavanaugh was was a a a you know\nTricks regard blew up a war in with the Indian thing blew up a beta or he thinks he can control the narrative\nAnd ... and it doesn't work anymore this is one of the beauties of Trump is that he's shown how to how to counter attack and counter punch these guys to just be wimps like Romney I mean even Lindsey Graham has turned from a wimp into a warrior\nYou know this is because of Trump's leadership in showing yeah OK sometimes literal\nMinded Twain cause the Patriot and scares in the beginning\n\nRight and so and so now your current credit cards is interactive in an infectious excuse me but my fear is that the Democrat seeing their power slipping away their Supreme Court poet bureau is no longer under their control um if they are looking at a last election\nEven on the in the lead up to the election they might do something to disrupt it like a false flag attack 'em or afterwards they'll come up with all kinds of ways\nOf not as an adolescent man it's a question of you know if if they think they can pull it off but they know they're being watched his father badly coordinated now ... even if they think they get away with it they're going to put\n\nThese guys that are willing to go without a on the street in Portland and New York and other places when they see that there are no longer just ruling the street that the Proud Boys show up and and you know stop them down they're going to take it to the next level they're not going to go back home\nNow I got like ... you know geysers skinny joins throwing bottles and probably five ... stopping the ground the police charge them they come to their event to wait for them they get their ass kicked in the police charge them\n\nRight but the the the on the four types are going to go weather underground and they're just like the SDF when that wasn't working ... they're gonna\nBomb the Proud Boys they're not going to sign of what\n\nThey're gonna bomb out of their ticket to the next well\nRight and they'll probably use rifles to blame on the right that'll be the easiest trip to use\nBut a lot of the\nLiterally the NYPD is going to charge the Proud Boys when they admit that came to the place they were speaking they attack them first show now you can kind of saying let's ask your to blame\n\nHave to figure this is always going to happen I saw a video coming out of England where I'm at a rally or the police or you know what are the bearded the police in some kind of like auxiliary uniform or look like you know al ... and people are\nLike all your uniform or look like you know al ... and people were questioning him are you in Islam is so don't ever figure that the police are going to be on the side of freedom the police are on the side of the bureaucracy the elites and are getting their pension and their paycheck so yeah don't look for help\nFrom the ... if it if any help comes from the place that will be off duty or with either a tip a tip or given to um our side but you had a demonstration consider their police supportive and people because of the mail order them stand down\n... we ... we had the documents and it sounds like I'm interrupting disguised breaking up and still pretty good but it's got to Kim in Arkansas you're on the air and about violence in Alaska lead perfect topic\nI yes I just wanted to make a couple of comments on 'em\nAnd designed to the lab and the butter fraud that you're speaking about I'm ...

help lead the effort to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court I was proud to help lead the effort to confirm justice Brett Kavanaugh to the court\nCongressman O'Rourke would have voted against both of them and he wants to see like Hillary Clinton promised to appoint left wing judicial activists to impose their own policy preferences from the bench I I don't think that's what the people of Texas what we want senator judges and justices who will follow the constitution and follow the law\nAnd this is what you can expect over the course of this debate a Senator Cruz is not going to be honest with you\nI mean even ... admits she talks like Obama which is totally fake talk as many as Obama an age now he doesn't sound like that\nFor for for almost forty centers will do ... do you what

looks like a big fat pedophile to me I mean most Democrats are anyway that level so who knows I say guilt by association I probably not about to fall like let's just she just looks like on let's go back to her\nName's saw because it's for congressman O'Rourke\nNot only opposes the wall\nBut he has said we had too many fences and walls already on the border he wants to tear down the ones we have an outlet he brought up El Paso\nEl Paso is right across from war as one of the most dangerous cities in the world three thousand murders last year there was a wall there\nWall is one of the tools you use to protect us all\nYou've heard from Senator Cruz is what we should be afraid of 'em it's a campaign based on fear it's it's the same person who is shut down the government or the United states of America for sixteen days perhaps because they thought too many people had too much health care as\nLong as the editor of Obamacare ripped everybody often triple prices the Democrat shut down the
