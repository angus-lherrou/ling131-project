for violence\nI mean you know the the the left wing media is making claims up to incite violence and justify it and then you see a slew of headlines in the last forty eight hours saying Republicans\nAre fear mongering before the terms Rhode Island are trying to make their voter base afraid before the midterms literally\nFolks dozens of headlines I'm just telling us to the group I just remember seeing this when I was doing my new research last night dozens of these headlines in fact guys gators pull up the search engine results so so that we can see\nAll the different outlets that were running with that headline and that's how you know it's a propaganda campaign right out of the Democrat Party\nAnd it usually originates the headline at least in the Washington Post or in the New York times but yeah there it is I mean how many stories would you say there are there are guys\nLike at least ten I Would say at the top and that's just a basic Google Search\nThere or at least ten that I saw\nThere is the Washington Post an angry mob Republicans work to recast Democrat protestors out of control anarchy so I Love that exception to the left so so what what I mean seriously\nDo you realize the insanity of this new cruisers going through all these headlines did you but seriously do you realize the next level insanity of this right now the ... this this deception\nSo the Democrats are literally calling for violence calling for civil war justifying it\nDoing it\nActually engaging in all of this\nPromoting it and then how does the other side of their mouth they say Republicans were fear mongering saying that left as you're getting violent\nWhat is wrong with so I mean it's like so\nHere they are engaging in violence trying to sort of civil war and then and then wanting a Republican saying why are you saying we're getting violent why are you telling your voters were an angry mob when it's like you're angry mob\nIt's really the pot calling the kettle black\n\nThey have such hubris in their control over the media\nThat they can in the same day\nIn the exact same moment even punch you right in the nose and they say why are you blaming me for

everyone caught it everybody thought\nWell this guy's been honoring he's telling people I'm violent you're punched me in the nose oh my God you know every I mean\nThis is next level deception this is unbelievable and they all around with the headline so here they are calling for violence saying you're justified and your violence get out of control\nAnd then all the Democrats come out and say the Republicans are fair Margaret ah yeah you're trying to kill us\n\nIs just so next level I I Can't even\nIn fact you know what let's go to Brazil where they literally tried to kill\nBalls the neuro as

another call dean in Virginia go ahead dean\nThanks so and that's the great thing about being on hold label to expand on your point that you brought up my one of my first point questions is President Trump issued an executive order that in order to vote you need a photo ID\n\nYou know that's interesting I don't know I think\nThat technically that's already the case though I don't know if you have to present it at the at the polling station but technically you do have to have a photo ID to vote I mean at some point you have to get the photo ID to to eventually vote you know what I'm saying but I guess presenting it at the polling station is a a different story\nAnd enforcing it they won't even let him ask on the U.S census if you're an American citizen\n\nYou got the census coming for twenty twenty he proposed putting the question are you a US citizen and you know what they said no you can't do that\n\nOr you go more than that I got another point for you is at the hearings meme heard all those paid agitator screaming yelling\nYeah it sounded like demonic screened from ...\nFrom a local a radio guy that those were homeless people bused from Union Station atop said that to them when he asked were all homeless labels I see him coming in oh I see all over the place like mental out of town while they were bussed over to the hearings\nNumber one number two isn't it true that in order to get into these hearings you have to have a ticket\nOh I'm so glad you said that the ... I don't know a hundred and ten percent they were all invited in by the Democrats ... percent\nTo get a ticket one of the demon rat aids asked to give it to them yeah\nThey'll never admit that they'll never admit that it's a hundred percent true they were all invited in by the Democratic party and this was something you have to plan weeks in advance you can't just invite someone in that day parade been planning this\nNow here's the other point once they're there are being brought out because they're disruptive and they can't trust them with the plastic ties however they are still shooting off their weapon they're still shooting off the mouse why don't they do want the app and the first thing they do is duct tape the mouse\nWell [laughter] you know that's probably not good optics um I\nI Would say the for real though I mean I don't know if you're serious about that but I think a real solution about\nIt because they're so I think there's still screaming and yelling what's the point of arresting them\nWell they're they're really not even being arrested there being executed out and they're ...\nOr and or\nExcuse me there being let out and they're being ... though [laughter]\nSo do you mind if we rushed through your mind and so they just really need to do it what you are seriously ill folks coming up that given the called the big report from Alex Jones after this break you're

that's why they're trying to shut down all the independent national media ahead of time to clear the way for her to take Trump's legs out from under a standby for this bombshell intel\nLadies and

looking at running for president\nIn twenty twenty well I've got it from a high level forces\nBut also forces very very close to Hillary Rodham Clinton and I'm gonna stop right there that indeed she is planning to run and that she's already set up in private are exploratory committee they're already letting other Democrats\nKnow that she's going to me the nominee so that means even somebody like Bernie Sanders when's the delegates and they'll just have the superdelegates a veto that and hand the\nPower a frogs only to her so it's a repeat of what happened in the primaries two thousand sixteen

Roger Stone taking the baton from my colleague over and Troyer\nAnd you're on the Alex Jones show\nIn the forty years in which I had been involved in American politics I have never seen anyone quite so tone deaf\nAs Hillary Clinton she entered the twenty sixteen a campaign as a heavy favorite uh she out raised and outmaneuvered her opponent Senator Bernie Sanders\nWe now know thanks to the WikiLeaks disclosures that she had to cheat Senator Sanders in order to win the Democratic nomination\nThat's an extraordinary piece of information and do the fact that Senator Sanders wasn't even a registered Democrat when his campaign began a then she uh over compensated uh and was enormously over confident in what she thought would be easy election against Donald Trump\nShe uh was dropped in at least three debates and then still counting on victory she made a misstep or denouncing the president's supporters as a deplorable Z and enormous self inflicted wound\nBut now in probably she just doesn't know when to get off the stage\nYou see in the Nineteen eighties when we had a monolithic media three networks to pledging a cable news networks it was much easier to stifle the real news women like Juanita Broderick could be muzzled and their story would never be widely told\nBy twenty sixteen we had a robust vibrant alternative media which infowars was the flagship\nAnd therefore the truth about Hillary Clinton's abuse of Bill Clinton's sexual assault victims became common knowledge my book the Clintons war on women which is available right now at the end for wars dot com store\nIs uh is the definitive opposition research dump on the criminal career of bill and Hillary Clinton\nAnd they're greedy little daughter I should say her greedy little daughter Chelsea then even my mind was blown by this interview by Hillary that was a hit the waves this morning what's wrong with that\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house and or the Senate that's when civility can start again but until then the only thing that the Republicans seemed to\nRecognize and respect strength\n[noise] well there you have it it is a license for violence it's at a declaration of war it's one of the most irresponsible things I've ever seen anyone in politics

[noise]\n\nYou're listening to the Alex June show ...\nWith\n[noise] my problem is when\nYou're all listening to Roger Stone\nOn informed [noise]\nThank you Mr President I'm Roger Stone back in the saddle with the Alex Jones show some of you may remember that a an Obama backed group called the project for democracy sued me and others\nIn Washington DC claiming stopped me if you've heard this\nThe Russians hacked the DNC gave the allegedly hacked emails to where the leaks ... gave them to Julian Assange Julie massage gave them to Roger Stone and Roger Stone gave them to Donald Trump or the Trump campaign\nFiction a fairy tale\nAcclaim for which there is no evidence whatsoever not in the hands of Robert Mueller not in the hands of the lawyers for the day and said when pressed in that lawsuit for evidence\nThey turned over fake news clippings from the Huffington Post and other fake news outlets as if that suffice as evidence\nOf that law suit was dismissed\nNow project democracy has refiled that suit on behalf of three D. and see employees in Richmond, Virginia a different venue and the Atlantic has now reported\nThat the Trump campaign has responded in those legal proceedings by saying that exploiting hacked emails is free speech what they don't tell you is the project democracy\nDropped Roger Stone from that lawsuit that I Am not a defendant in the new suit and a V. exploiting a published material that's already on line certainly within the public domain\nHere is my production the three employees of the DNC will lose again\nNow in under a legal matters the Democratic National Committee is proceeding with their lawsuit this one filed in New York City\nAgainst me against the Trump campaign against the Republican National committee against the Russian state\nAgainst Jared Kushner the president's son in law against Donald Trump junior the president's son against the Republican National committee against the G argue against Vladimir ...\nAgainst a Julian Assange against ...\nI don't know I think they threw Bozo the clown in there as well this is another baseless lawsuit but strangely enough of those defendants only the lawyers that represent made\nThe same incredibly effective lawyers who won dismissal of the project democracy sue grant Smith and Rob boost shell\nThe brains to ask for discovery and inspection of the DNC computer servers this of course\nWill lead to a answering the sixty four million dollar question about whether the DNC was ever hacked by the Russians or anyone else\nAlthough Chris Cuomo seem rather incredulous when I said this on his show the forensic evidence\nPublished in the New Republic a tends to indicate the exact opposite in fact there was more forensic evidence that would indicate that the Pearl owing material from the DNC was downloaded to some type of portable drive\nAnd spirited out the back door by the name were not allowed to say Seth Rich\nA man whose murder continues to be unsolved\nFor those who say oh he was murdered in the course of the routine robbery explained why his money his wallet and his jewelry we're all intact\nNo this was a political assassination by parties on known you see they don't want an inspection of those servers because it will finally reveal whether they were hacked or not in fact\nAh don't be shocked to learn when we get to this turn in the legal proceedings\nThat the servers no longer exist that they've been bleached kind of like\nAnd unofficial appointed by an elected official Rod Rosenstein\nNo one has ever addressed the fact that the president and Mr Rosen's dean are both materially involved in the very matter that Mr Mahler is investigating and therefore they have both have an inherent conflict\nThis was not raised in by Mr Miller's lawyers nor was it raised by the Concorde or lawyers the attorneys representing the Russian company that has also filed an amicus challenge\nThe Russian company that has also filed amicus challenging Mr mothers authority but I Believe it will ultimately be raised\nUh the real question of course is why is Muller himself responding to the challenge by Miller in the courts why isn't the Justice Department responding that in fact since the question is over Mr mothers authority why isn't he put in a box\nAnd the Justice Department solicitor general responding to this legal action no folks this is a fraud upon the people the investigation is what the president says it is it ...\nOr ... normally speaking a special counsel was appointed when a crime has been identified and for some reason the department of justice has a conflict of interest in the prosecution of that identified crime\nBut in the case of the Russian collusion delusion no crime has been identified two years in Seventeen million dollars in special counsel Robert Mueller has a dental fide low level ham handed ineffective Russian meddling in our election\nNothing on the scale of our meddling in the recent Israeli election or the massive tax dollars spent for the election of Boris Yeltsin in the former USSR\nSo uh this entire saga is to be continued watch that lawsuit closely\nExpected defeat at the

looks like it it just made landfall in Panama City and it is moving south east or choose me north east right now\nAnd you know\nIt's just like everything else on the news they cover hurricane fake news and I'm not saying a hurricane is fake news obviously the hurricane is is a serious issue here the flooding is already a been devastating in Florida but\nYou know there was no buildup to this really it just kind of like came out of nowhere so it's not even as big of a story so like the the last hurricane already forgotten the name of it huge buildup weeks to build up days of build up\nAnd then it kind of came and you know it happened but it yeah okay we had like a week and have a buildup and have you know it was okay but not the worst thing\nAnd then hurricane Michael no build up a you know nobody really talks about it and it's actually like a really bad one and it's going to flood almost the entire northern panhandle and and it's like well okay maybe gets a little news coverage so it's just it's just like everything else and television news\nAll scripted it's all fake it's all for ratings and um you know it's just\nWhatever but interestingly enough\nSome people are starting to understand how fake news is on a much larger scale study economic boom largest\nNews is on a much larger scale\nStudy economic boom largely ignored as TV's Trump coverage in Ninety two percent negative so it was Ninety One Ninety One we need to go up to Ninety two so you never hear about the record economic numbers the record jobs growth\nEverything else the record low unemployment and the Gallup as a bull only twenty percent of people have a great deal slash quite a lot of prominent in t._v. news even less in Congress\nIs evoked and that's why everything they say\nOh you know the blue where it was inevitable blah blah blah blah blah blah blah but\nPeople aren't buying people are not buying it anymore\nAnd so they know all the negative coverage is fake so so you notice though I mean the numbers pretty much correlate meanwhile gay frogs is actually a real story and now apparently there's like a whole swamp I'm I'm\nIn San Francisco\nBut they make fun of Alex Jones reporting on that fact meanwhile they ignore all the real news is going on in this country but you know what\nOne thing I've learned here covering the most recent Trump rallies that Trump rallies don't make TV
