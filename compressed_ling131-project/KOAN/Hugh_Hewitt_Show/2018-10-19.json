going on in the news and I guess the\nPerfect place to START I guess it's the talk about this political violence I Know my my father has a number of things he wants to get into we have seen even since the last time I was on here two weeks ago and huge increase in political violence you have representatives being attacked sucker punch there are signs of being destroyed\nYou have the rhetoric on Twitter on Facebook on YouTube are being ratcheted up by politicians by these unhinged liberals and you see conservatives are the ones that are being censored the Facebook purge just a few days ago deleted\nHundreds almost six hundred pages are totally views totaling millions in the tens of millions\nSome of the pages had three to four million each alone and it's just so crazy Louis Farrakhan yesterday\nSaid something that was a completely racist and anti Semitic and I said this about a year ago that this is the Achilles' heel of the left ideology\nIs their hatred for the Jewish people and they're not going to be able to reconcile that message with ... with with the rhetoric\nAnd uh act like everything is okay like they've been able to do with their hypocrisy in double standards covering it all up pretending like it never happens and and it's a status quo we've got Louis Farrakhan yesterday I'm like in the Jewish people to termites\nSomebody reporter and HIS Video on Twitter it was responded back by Twitter to say that did not violate our terms of service\nYesterday I saw the same thing on Facebook there was a comment kill all white people somebody reported that comment on Facebook to the moderators\nAnd Facebook issued response thank you for alerting us to this post unfortunately it does not violate our terms of service absolutely insane and now we see\nIn the songs back money and and operatives are attacking people the money is going to protesters and to ah continue to create this chaos that we see now yesterday Facebook said they're going to be cracking down on this information they're going to be cracking down on\nWhat they deem misinformation and this is the thing about what they deemed misinformation is it's um\nIt's it's up to them it it there's no set definition or guideline like hate speech we see that the definition of hate speech is what Mark Zuckerberg couldn't even describe it in front of Congress and the same thing goes here what's misinformation what's true and what's false\nWell it depends on who you listen to we know that the left uses these fact checkers the snopes or the policy back\nAnd they skew everything that they do to make their agenda and their narrative appear as though it's right and the conservatives are wrong\nThis is a full scale war and uh [noise] Alex Jones had the uh the foresight to name this operation infowars decades decades before this actually turned into an informational work and what do we see today it's not\nMonopoly of information that is the control of certain messages that are being kept

Thursday\nOctober Eighteen twenty Eighteen unbelievable how fast this month has just been buying by a before the break we were talking about a number of issues from the caravan the censorship the political violence the increase the rhetoric of of hatred the communist infiltration this at its core is a spiritual\nProblem that we have in our country and it is manifesting in the physical when you see these people who are spouting this communist ideology\nAnd they are uh as I said earlier about Twenty years ago you know you you could never get away with that you would be a labeled an enemy of the country but today you are somehow a yeah I guess\nI'm championing some new great idea for the people it's absolutely unbelievable how far we've come in just a short amount of time and if we have as much change as we've had in the last Twenty years for the next twenty or I don't think America will be recognizable by that time\nAnd when we're talking about mid term elections being so important to keep Republicans in power that if we don't we could be facing the impeachment of not only Brett Kavanaugh\nAttempt peach when that President Trump\nThe at everything that he has done attempted to be undone taking their their problems away or in raising the taxes on and on and on and moving to a social justice warrior pot or with the communist ideology but censorship still is the\nUm the I guess the topic of the day and the political violence I mean we see conservatives are being attacked\nAnd then when they go to try to talk about their ideas they are censored and it is okay the media even a ... encourages the violence which is something that we've never seen before in this country and this is not going to end well not at all\nYou know I can jump in there Joe is I just want to apologize to to the Republican in force\nAs well before you got here I didn't I didn't even bother with this because of these just gives stuff you're doing but uh they just let people know into to just to let everyone there and you know to\nThe reasons it's warming ears all of the equipment is is running its humming it's just going at full speed we're attempting to push a band with um just to just to explain to people and and I don't want to attribute a you know ... mechanical malfunctions to attacks but\nWe went through all of this stuff's to uh to make sure equipment was operating for this particular segment bottom line or we can't push anything and I can't even send the images\nFrom the ... and you had done that we had done last week to uh uh you know to to enforce it and it the ah the from the sky plea changes aside and and you know we know we're doing early star take those\nUm the reason I brought that up is because in addition to the censorship or segue from ... says up into directors tax on our platforms this is what we're seeing and this is what we're fighting against us little we've got to [noise]\nYou know um we people I don't think a lot of people really understand how critical of the time this is\nA torn Nineteen days before the midterm elections stroke Nineteen days about three weeks a less than three weeks and then in the numbers of of conservative accounts being hacked like these are being a a chocolate social networking levels [noise] the um a Facebook accounts being removed can delete it\n... it is the ... and that leads to self censorship which leads to a critical mass I Believe with with the with conservatives so that in addition to what we see the left gearing up and and you know if you don't mind I I really would like to address your go see the findings\nWith respect what you saw not D.C but in our own hometown in applied to the you know the care around because you've you've got the you've got the documentation\nAll right we were we had a President Trump pure or a week ago yesterday on the tenth of a\nOctober for a rally you're in Erie, Pennsylvania and\nWe attended the rally and we we went early we documented in the crowd size we documented the protesters as we found earlier in the day there was a listing for one hundred dollars being offered to those who would stand in line at the Trump rally well when you went through in called the number it wasn't just to stand in line it was to protest\nNow here is a relatively small town a hundred hundred and ten thousand people you don't get much protesters here I mean if there were riots in New York and Chicago I wouldn't expect anything to change here very mild and low key kind of town but I at this rally you had\nVery mild and low key kind of town\nBut at at this rally you had thousands and thousands of people who are attending they were lining up since for him\nAnd uh I'd say probably ten to twenty thousand people were there now you had protesters I tell you about ten weren't organic\nAnd you had maybe two to three hundred that weren't now uh we had the documentation of this I guess I didn't captured on audio but we do get verbal confirmation that the protesters were paid a they even admitted it saying yes we were all paid in one protester in particular said but I Would still be here without the payment because of my hatred for Donald Trump\nExcuse me ... river was there also and she interviewed some of the protesters who were there and it's interesting to see that video\nBecause these people are just you know I don't even think they are especially the paid protesters at some of them\nThey they they uh you know did it for the money maybe they don't really have a a a a dog in the fight they don't care either way and it is interesting to see them with the un PC means that we're talking about with politicians abroad and in the video on that yesterday\nIt really uh it is true is really\nA identifies what these people are like this collective hive say panic mind that they follow 'em and it is unbelievable that these people\nHave no no no care in the world they just want their money and they want the and in the left wants the optics to make it look like there's this big backlash against President Trump but none of it's organic from the Kavanaugh protest to some of the even the people in the ... to the protesters at these rallies all is paid for\nMine is a few people\nThen you're ... you're exactly right in that um [noise] in the ... the number of protesters by the way the turnout even with the payments\nWas dismal I I think you kind of the weekend to collectively maybe a under a hundred versus\nA I Would estimate tend to eleven thousand\nEven though the venue what holds a thousand maybe a two hundred that dogs yeah All right so okay um ten thousand was the standing room and\nA U.S ... thousands out side watching the screens as you mentioned um you had a very limited um will and of course nearly as you as you mentioned Miller Weaver showed this but very limited in terms of turnout so\nApply that to the midterms I don't think we're going to see this blue wave now that that doesn't mean that we ... we we can stay home or we could afford not to keep pushing on this\nBut the other thing I I think it's very interesting it's amazing to how we see the um uh uh the uh the the people jumping on the is the weaponization again of the social media the networks\nAnd how the the um the left is is weaponization everything at their disposal in order to keep us down in the take Donald Trump out and as you mentioned to impeach cabinet which is one of their stated objective after\nYou know ... you saw that you talk to people about that uh so the bottom line here as we are at war and and it's it's it's this is not going to end well it's you know\nIf they win if if if they win seats\nAnd they regained power they're going to go into their intent is to destroy America if they lose and we when they they don't if they don't regain power their intent is to destroy America it's very simple it's going to destroy America otherwise\nYeah they are and they have no idea of their own they have nothing in terms of solutions in terms of ideas to better or the economy better the job is to continue what President Trump has started in in moving us in the right direction\nThey want to you know put us back in a certain kind of specific or if it put us back in the Paris climate accord I mean if they had their way did you see that many people saw the UN's report where they gave us another morning twelve
