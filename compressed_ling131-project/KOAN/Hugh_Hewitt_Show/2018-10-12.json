area but\nThe flood waters are rising there so [noise] hopefully I'm you know the damage and everything is not to catastrophic but wanted to give a shout out to them you know there's one thing we know about the left in America\nAll of their buzz phrases our lives and it's amazing because you can point this out with irrefutable fact\nAnd that's what makes them so angry that's why they get so mad because you have the facts that totally destroyed their reality and instead of doing the open minded thing the tolerance thing the right thing which is taking a step back and realizing you're wrong about something you know they doubled down and get violent\nWhat am I talking about\nBelieve women women must be hurt how many times we hear that during the Kavanaugh hearings how big of a why is that did they listen to the women that stood up for a judge Kavanaugh that were friends with him in high school and throughout his life\nNew did they listen to the women that accused with evidence for operating facts Keith Ellison\nKnew\nHow about the treatment that Kansas Owens and Ann Coulter get when they want to go speak at a campus and they get threatened and and violence breaks out\nSo it was a women must be heard right now that's a lie about black lives matter sure\nBlack lives matter that is until a black person thinks differently just look it will Johnson just look at Kanye West\nOh yeah black lives matter pay I kind of like Trump wow you Uncle Tom\n...\nAnother ally of the\nLeft but you know I was thinking about this last night and I'm ... then the next segment I'm going to play all these clips folks that just [noise] I mean you already know it but it's like we have to put it out there into the ether so that\nIt it sinks in that\nThe Democrat Party is trying to START I mean you can call whatever civil war mob rule whatever an arcade violence chaos it the destruction it's all being caused by the Democrats they know exactly what they're doing but here's the key\n[laughter] because\nI tend to look\nAt things from a psychological perspective I just can't help it and last night\nI almost [laughter] I basically had\nI don't want to I don't want to say vision I didn't have a vision but the psychology of the left became clear to me in my head innovation\n\nBasically the psychology of the left imagine if you will a room full of cardboard boxes and every cardboard box or you're in a left his mind every cardboard box represents\nA an individual\nLet's say you're a gay person well the left puts you in a box you see\nThis is the left this box for gay people\nAnd everything that they believe about gay people exist in that box and every gay person must exist in that box okay let's move on a black man let's say All right they got a black man in a box the black man must think this way they must have Trump they must have missed they must feel\nIn a box the black man must think this way they must have Trump they must have missed they must feel this yeah that's a great picture that is left his mind right there is a room\nFull of boxes\nA room full of taped up cardboard boxes now what does this mean this means that are ... they're close minded which means they have no room for growth they have no room for expansion and their entire mental makeup is one hundred percent based off of\nIdentity\nWhich they then put into a box and stack up neatly in their mind\nSo okay white male they go into the white mailbox oh racist you know big it all the other thing that is unless they come out is a good liberal and then all of a sudden the whole box thing kind of just just fades away and it's just oh except in you know are\nGuilty until proven Democrat to the left his mind is just\nBoxes stacked on top of one another of every identity and race in person and whatever\nAnd it's just there and it's permanent and it static and the boxes can never ... you know go into one another because they've created lines\nSo you can't more ideas people can never come together because they have 'em all in these boxes and that's the only way that they think people can coexist is if everyone is in their nice little box\nAnd then they can stack 'em up and have everybody and their nice box and then virtues signal and social justice warrior the entire thing\nSo just imagine that\nThat is a leftist brain that is left this psychology every person is put into a box and if you don't fit in that box they freak out\nIt's honestly like a next level of OCD it probably is some\nNext higher levels social level of OCD they have like a social OCD wherever you want to have to exist in their little boxes and they have to put these little boxes and perfect order\nAnd if anybody steps outside of the box if anybody post on the box to look at what might be on the other side they totally panic and their entire psychology breaks down into madness and hysteria that's what we're seeing folks\nBecause their psychology of everyone being in a box is not reality and so now they're seeing this all black people think differently why people are not racist like all of this crap and they don't know what to do because in their mind every once in a box and backed away Perfectly Imperfect order like an OCD persons desk\nIt's like imagine walking up to an OCD persons desk and you know pushing the stable or the other side and then they get back and they're like oh we got out in my state would get on the right side of I'd asked what was going on and then they have like a panic and a breakdown\nEverybody knows people like this it's a mental thing it's a psychological thing the women diagnosed with these things people know that they're OCD that's the left his mind and so as soon as you go into the left his mind\nAnd you may be moving boxes around or or a black man steps out of the box that they put them in its total panic total outrage total hysteria and that's where we're at right now because the average leftist has put everything in a box arranged it perfectly in their mind\nAnd that's what makes them comfortable because that no oh I understand everything I Know everything I've got everything in the box perfectly organized labeled everyone have identified everybody I get it\nIf they authoritarian in its nature but it's a psychological OCD on a social level in his practice and so this is why they're going into complete panic right now they're OCD\nTheir social OCD people have put everyone in a box put a label on everyone except the problem is you can't do that that's not all the world works peoples' minds change people have all kinds of different varying ideas but that's why the left as\nPanicked because then their OCD mind everything has to be in the little box where they put it so when Kanye West that's out of the box and put holes in other boxer saying hey look through the box they go into total hysteria and total madness that's where we're at\nSears at\nThe sound of a house being trashed one of the gang of

those\nLinks so having said that let's\nGet to a news blitz let's just go right into this violence again because I mean it's ... it's redundant but it needs to sink in because of how real this issue is\nThis is the story be covered last segment man planned to blow self up with two hundred pound bomb in D.C on election day\nBulger's watching as a story and infowars dot com\nDomestic terrorists was angry about the country's direction yeah they hate America they don't like America being successful again and because they choose not to be a part of it they're left out\nAnd left feeling left out and then acting enraged and hate filled about it\nThat's the saddest thing these people are leaving themselves out from making America great again they can be part of it\nThey choose not to be you love yourself out it's like that bitter child that they throw some temper tantrum and then decides not to go to the group on the field trip or to the group to the ball game or the amusement park because they have some little tip that they got upset about and then they're just mad and they they hold it against everyone else even though as their own fault\nAbout Eric Holder boy this guy's a class act and he\nSays when they go low we kick them\n...\nAnd says that this is what the new Democrat Party is all about now he's right he's he is right the Democratic party is all about domestic terror now and Eric Holder's just letting you know\nThe ... story it everywhere dot com and Trump responded saying it's a disgrace even I mean even Michelle Obama I mean my gosh you got to give people credit where credit's due even Michelle Obama is rejecting holders message saying it's not good for the youth\nSo that's interesting maybe Michelle Obama though isn't a in the criminal enterprise like Eric Holder is you know maybe she was able to keep her hands clean them of all the dirty ... going on and the Obama administration so she doesn't have to be an outright liar But Eric holder says when they go low just kick him\nAnd that's where the Democratic party is all about that's right ... ... a hundred and ... percent right the Democratic party is all about domestic tear one hundred and ten percent under the Democrat Party I mean\nThis is a serious one what is it more what is a bigger threat to America our homeland right now radical Islamic there or Democrat domestic\nThere that is a fair question that is a real question and I think it's probably Democrat domestic terror\nThe real question and I think it's probably Democrat domestic terror\nNow\nObviously there's a lot of secret until about the radical Islamic terror cells that exist in this country that are just waiting to be activated\nLike the one that got caught in New Mexico that nobody reported on where they killed a kid and they were trying to shoot at school yeah so I mean\nBut these people are foaming at the mouth and their leaders are telling them to go out and commit acts of violence so I mean here's this is a serious question what is a greater threat to our homeland radical Islamic terror or a Democrat domestic terror I think right now it's probably Democrat domestic there\nBut\nLeave it to the left wing media in this country to say that they're not an angry mob now we played that clip over and over so I'm not going to play it again but that's what they're doing\nMeanwhile\nUs chargers Chinese spy

comments that crush the ratings the ratings were already gonna be down anyway Taylor Swift didn't help but isn't it convenient\nAnd I'm not going to call out some other artists fear that did this too but I'm telling you this is a pattern once these artist finish their North American leg of their tours\nAs soon as they play their last North American show they all have come out and made a negative Trump comment or or or negative conservative comment and it's usually pretty guarded it's usually not very extreme and you can tell it's probably a tongue in cheek and they maybe don't even mean it\nBut they figure oh I'm going to say this as I'm leaving North America and I'll give some pub I'll get some headline and maybe I'll drop some energy before I leave America but so just understand that the ratings for the AM age would have tanked any way whether the table to have made those comments or not\nBut she only made those comments to to ... she thought get some sort of a windfall to

Benson across\nDown mon\n\nYou're listening to the Alex June show [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\nYou know speaking about about ... meeting in the White House today and about racial unity and racial healing for America I've got a very powerful message here for you\nYou know uh it's about it it's not about the\nColor of our skin it's about you know as Martin Luther king junior said the content of her character but we're partly it's about individual liberty and respecting the right of every divine conscious human being which includes you know people that every skin color or national origin the right of every individual\nTo pursue life liberty and happiness\nAnd as far as I'm concerned anybody who is pro liberty anybody who supports that pursuit of life liberty unhappiness\nOr is on team humanity and team humanity is what we represent as conservatives are Trump supporters of libertarian team humanity\nDemocrats are anti life they want to destroy even unborn babies they want to destroy nations they want to destroy economies and sweep in communism which is all about human suffering in totalitarian ism\nAnd obviously we must reject that but here's something that you may not have thought about\nYou know all of us if you go back far enough in our ancestry but you know that all of our ancestors are actually from Africa or it at one time in human history there are only about you know according to to science are only about four thousand humans alive\nAnd they were Africans and they they all have dark skin because you know dark skin is a natural sunscreen\nOr against the intense sunlight radiation when you live in Africa or live near the equator you have to have that some protection so actually dark skinned pigmentation is a natural defensive shield against ultraviolet radiation at the sun\nBut over time as humans prospered and then there was migration where humans spread out from Africa\nAnd some groups of humans went to for example the present day northern Europe and their sunlight was a lot less intense\nAnd so their skin over time over many many generations of just survival became more fair skinned to allow more sunlight to come in so they can have more vitamin D because vitamin D is absolutely crucial for preventing cancer boost the immune function and so on\nIf you have dark skin but you live in let's say London\nYou are not going to get enough vitamin D to protect your health\nAnd so Europeans became more fair skinned and that was the skin color differentiation and you know similar things happened in ... in China\nAnd modern day Russia and so on wherever people live closer to the equator the skin became darker and wherever groups moved away from the equator their skin became lighter this was all about a natural response to a sunlight and and vitamin D and take\nNow what this means though from a racial healing point of view is that all of us that count ourselves as Americans by the way of white skin or brown skinned black skin whether\nYou know it doesn't matter we're all humans are really brothers and sisters we're all related we all of our ancestors came from Africa and that's that's really backed up by you know a archaeology and anthropology mainstream science so\nIsn't it interesting that right now as humanity is coming together to save ourselves from tyranny and to save ourselves from authoritarianism\nThat we realize we are all unified by our common history and yet the Democrat Party wants to divide us and turn it into enemies against each other like brother fighting brother and sister fighting sister that's what the Democrats are trying to do they want to split us apart\nAnd weaponize us based on\nSkin deep differences just things that you see visually which means nothing about a person's character\nKanye proved that today he proved that human character\nIs much more than anything that can be called skin deep\nSea prove that he could out think and and have more compassion and have more presence of mind and more spiritual\nA divinity than all of those CNN commentators that are attacking him calling him you know the token negro and all the mean all the racist evil things that CNN is now saying against Kanye that he has outlast the debt\nBecause he has a bigger picture a bigger vision of what we all are all divine beings we all have a common ancestry\nWe're all frankly genetic brothers or sisters and we all desire and one thing and that is to be free\nWe all desire freedom and I urge you today to to let that be this unifying call for all of us who desire freedom\nTo say we welcome pro liberty people whether they are black skinned or or or fair skinned or you know anything ... whether they're gay or straight even like Brandon struck a of the walk away movement you know openly gay but openly pro liberty\nAnd he is leading people away from the destructive tendencies of the Democratic party at total destruction of human civilization which is what Democrats seem to stand for today\nAnd this is where we need to understand this this is not simply about you know black and white is not about Republican versus a Democrats\nThis is about do you want human civilization to survive versus do you want our world utterly destroyed by the division and the destructive narrative\nOf evil Democrats sinister Democrats who are liars and cheaters and they commit mass of election fraud and and some of them literally kill off people who have evidence against them I mean there are a body bags stressed out a mile long behind some of the Democrat leaders that they're so evil\nWe cannot allow them to have power\nBehind somebody Democrat leaders that they're so evil we cannot allow them to have power\nAnd so this was really a spiritual this is a spiritual a mid term\nIs much more than GOP versus a DNC this was about do you support life liberty\nThe vicinity of the human being of human consciousness of your purpose of life here on this planet if you support that then you support the feeding the Democrats who are all about death and destruction and deception\nThink about it they don't even want black babies to be born alive they set up the abortion centers\nIn black neighborhoods because they know that's where they can kill the most black babies a committee that the genocide the actual eugenics that the founder of Planned Parenthood talked about and promoted that she wanted black people to be wiped out to be exterminated that's the message of the Democrats\nAnd but it takes people waking up many people who voted Democrat all their lives are waking up now and they're fleeing the Democrat Party I'm even hearing apologies from people people who thought\nWhen when I went pro Trump back in twenty sixteen and I predicted the Trump victory ahead of time and we were one hundred percent pro Trump\nSome people really attacked me over that some of my own readers on my own audience many of them have come back now and apologize and rejoined my website natural news and rejoined our efforts now you know what they say to me they say Mike I now realize\nThat the Democrats have today are no longer the Democrats that we grew up with\nCannot be associated with the with the Democrats they don't represent what we represent they are not us I hear this over and over again they are not us\nBecause they see the lunacy they see the violence they see the arrangement they see the bigotry and racism of Democrats today and and the way they're treating conduct today that's racism the way they're attacking him and using racial slurs against ... it's unreal\nAnd of course they're racist against white people and now with Senator Susan Collins voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh they're not racist against white women that the left wing media is attacking white women and saying well now why women are the problem well I remember last year I I thought the\nProblem was white men will now is white women you see how they're just committing racial division destruction of culture destruction of civilization do not allow them to succeed defeat Democrats at every election from here forward\nStay with me here on the house John show McAdams much

wanted to give a shout out to them you know there's one thing we know about the left in America\nAll of their buzz phrases our lives\nAnd it's amazing 'cause you can point this out with irrefutable fact\nAnd that's what makes them so angry that's why they get so mad because you have the facts that totally destroyed their reality and instead of doing the open minded thing the tolerance thing the right thing which is taking a step back and realizing wrong about something you know they doubled down and get violent\nWhat am I talking about\nBelieve women women must be heard how many times we hear that during the Capitol hearing\nHow big of a why\nIs that did they listen to the women that stood up for a judge Kavanaugh that were friends with him in high school and throughout his life\nNew

Tom\n...\nAnother ally of the left but you know I was thinking about this last night and I'm ... then the next segment I'm going to play all these clips folks that just\n[noise] I mean you already know it but it's like we have to put it out there into the ether so that\nIt it sinks in that\nThe Democrat Party is trying to START I mean you can call whatever civil war mob rule whatever anarchy violence chaos it to the destruction it's all being caused by the Democrats they know exactly what they're doing but here's the key\n[noise] because I tend to\nLook at things from a psychological perspective I just can't help it and last\nNight I almost [laughter] I basically had\nI don't want to I don't want to say vision I didn't have a vision but the psychology of the left became clear to me in my head in a vision\n\nBasically the psychology of the left imagine if you will a room full of cardboard boxes and every cardboard box or you're in a left his mind every cardboard box represents\nA an individual so\nLet's say your a gay person well the left to put you in a box you see\nThis is the left this box for gay people\nAnd everything that they believe about gay people exist in that box and every gay person must exist in that box okay let's move on a black man let's say All right they got a black man in a box the black man must think this way they must pay Trump's they must have missed they must feel this\nYeah that's a great picture that\nIs left his mind\nRight there it is a room full of boxes\nA room full of taped up cardboard boxes now what does this mean this means that are called they're close minded which means they have no room for growth they have no room for expansion and their entire mental makeup is one hundred percent based off of\nIdentity which they then put into a box and stack up neatly in their mind\nSo okay white male they go into the white mailbox oh racist you know big it all the other thing that is unless they come out as a good liberal and then all of a sudden the whole box thing kind of just just fades away and it's just oh except in you know are guilty until proven Democrat\nSo the leftist mind is just boxes\nStacked on top of one another of every identity and race in person and whatever\nAnd it's just there and it's permanent and it static and the boxes can never ...\nYou know go into one another because they've created lines\nSo you can't more ideas people can never come together because they have 'em all in these boxes and that's the only way that they think people can coexist is if everyone is in their nice little box\nAnd then they can stack 'em up and have everybody in their nice box and then virtue signal and social justice warrior the entire thing\nSo just imagine that\nThat is a leftist brain that is a left this psychology every person is put into a box and if you don't fit in that box they freak out it's honestly like a next level of OCD it probably is some\nNext higher levels social level of OCD they have like a social OCD where everyone has to exist in their little boxes and they have to put these little boxes in perfect order\nAnd if anybody steps outside of the box if anybody pokes a hole in the box to look at what might be on the other side they totally panic and their entire psychology breaks down into madness and hysteria that's what we're seeing folks\nBecause their psychology of everyone being in a box is not reality and so now they're seeing this all black people think differently why people are not racist like all of this crap and they don't know what to do because in their mind every once in a box and stacked away Perfectly Imperfect order like an OCD persons desk\nIt's like imagine walking up to an obesity persons desk and you know pushing the stable or the other side and then they get back and they're like oh we got caught him I said we're going to the right side of I'd asked what was going on and then they have like a panic in a breakdown everybody knows people like this it's a mental thing it's a psychological thing the women diagnosed with\nThese things people know that they're OCD that's the left his mind and so as soon as you go into the left his mind\nAnd you may be moving boxes around or or a black man steps out of the box that they put 'em in its total panic total outrage total hysteria and that's where we're at right now because the average leftist has put everything in a box arranged it perfectly in their mind\nAnd that's what makes them comfortable because that no oh I understand everything I Know everything I've got everything in the box perfectly organized and labeled everyone have identified everybody I get it\n\nIf they authoritarian in its nature but it's a psychological\nOCD on a social level\nIn its practice and so this is why they're going into complete panic right now\nThey're OCD their social OCD people have put everyone in a box with a label on everyone except the problem is you can't do that that's not how the world works peoples' minds change people have all kinds of different varying ideas\nBut that's why the left is panic because then their OCD mind everything has to be in the little box where they put it so when Kanye West steps out of the box and bookstores and other boxer saying hey look through the box they go into total hysteria and total madness that wherever at\nSears
