the fact that we're barely winning right now\nShows the ad in the west projects you Joan\nSuperiority and culture on everything else\nAnd then we sit here and then meanwhile it's not superior that's why people all want to come here and I'm up anybody down but those culture never ignited the way we did\nYou get a debates about well your CAVE People I don't care I Love every body I Want freedom they're great people in every culture every region the point as the global story at war with the west because it's where the Christians shed we're not going to have slavery it's where women got the right to vote so the authoritarian can't beat that so they flip it and create all these twisted rights\nIt's in their own admissions they're totally waking so vox\nOnly as positive measure but first long term prognosis of why you're saying with the weakness of humanity and and the ... the simple nature I guess the end of the day a let's look at the bad prognosis versions of good and then in the short term\nYour proponent of red wave I I Believe in in the election fraud is is just over the top of the seawall so let's let's look at the bad long term the good short term box day\nThe bad long term is that I Would expect the usa to break apart as a political entity in the twenty thirty three term for it and that's based on\nAnd he thirty three timeframe and that's based on\nThe economic situation it's based on the average lifespan of currencies and everything that I've seen that this is the protection I made about fourteen years ago and everything that I've seen indicates that it's on track\nOr the global scene of land that we let's not unless you're saying we want freedom and we're dealing with authoritarian outside forces you've we crack down and we have to figure out the the the way to do that culturally to create a new level playing field it'd be cracked down on the tyranny and the outside forces we could probably get around that yeah\nThere is a good chance but the problem is is that even as great and as insightful a leader as Donald Trump is not really looking at\nThe the real issues as far as I understand um you\nKnow in in Europe there are leaders who are looking directly at the demographic issues who are looking at\nAre doing what they call report patients which is a returning a lot of the uh uh a lot of the refugees and migrants in economic migrants I ... and even citizens\nTo their former countries um that's a whole debate that doesn't even exist in the United states and I don't know that they can exist in the United states because of our\nA historical\nFriendly attitude towards immigration and the fact that there's no strong nativist nationalist party in the state\n... and let's be clear is that some of the UN or weapon I was going to third world that that is doomed to fail aim to be using Russia though with the collapse and population all the problems\nThe model can they be successful realizing that this was an experiment is a plan can that Russian model there'd be successful and could it be duplicated\nWell yes the Russian model it first of all the Russian nation is not dying or the Russian\nThem at the end of the global if they want it to\nOh yeah the global wanted to but under ... the the life's average lifespan and Russia has increased dramatically and a ... in a strong pro Christian pro nationalist a government\nCan significantly change things you know a lot of people when they talk about a nation dying it's really ridiculous because if you look at how many people there are\nThere's far more people in in every country than there's ever been Britain ruled that you know Britain established the empire which the sun never sat with far fewer white British people than they have today\nBecause they had will so it's right because they had will and that cultural confidence and because they had hope and they have to say and\nWe need to see a revival of muscular Christianity we need to see a revival of national pride because we don't we will be conquered that's the way the world works\nPrecisely\nBut you see the ignition of populism and Christianity happening again and the and a pedophile control Catholic Church in trouble I mean I'm sitting on a really good science ...\n[noise] well there are good sized ... but the problem is what what a lot of people don't seem to understand is that winning is going to involve conflict\nAnd we've gone a long long time in the United states without having to deal with the war directly on our doorstep\nAnd and and I said let's if men aren't even willing to have politically correct people attack them or to be banned or to have gone up your bank account you'll never stand up on the rubber meets the road so what's your message the man about how we wage war against globalism now\nI think the most important thing is to not be afraid\nYou know\nMy grandfather volunteered for the U.S Marines the day after Pearl Harbor and one thing he told me was that um when you're on a beach and there's a bunch of people\nShooting at you and everybody looks at you to see what to do just do something you said it doesn't even matter what pick something do it and the next thing you know thirty man we'll be right there behind you\nExactly take action\nAnd and it doesn't necessarily ...\nOr action is the idea that you know sitting around playing ... armchair strategist is somehow going to change the world is ridiculous what changes the world it's people acting people doing things and and\nNow I totally agree to get your mind doesn't know what to do your subconscious dies and once you go into action you're going to find that some of the most corrective action you'll ever have is when you're not even thinking\nWell not only that but you know if something works then you reinforced success if something doesn't work than you do something else it's not rocket science um but but unfortunately we're\nSo used to abstract thing things and trying to plan things and trying to\nFigure out all the possible alternatives which is not possible that we tend to paralyze ourselves in our time I read get out of a town of tonic state\nMove move that's the
