Business Week and the big news\nNow why is that in Port\nTim Cook had already moved to China five years ago the CEO\n\nTim Cook seven months ago officially became state run to get total tax exemption yeah Trump's bad Lauren Fifteen and been in the U.S trying to go to zero to counter that\nWhen they went to zero he said he was quoted in oil sank when you're in China and your partner the government

down of America it's a corporate takeover this is a prison Trump is trying to stop this but Tim Cook goes on in life to his face\nWe've got solutions as well when I started going out for Tim Cook that's when I got the platform and he bragged that he let it\n\nBut that's why he's now denying oh I didn't work with any other companies you know he bragged about an apple and Saturday one hour every

worked with other companies and that's what the legal that Sherman anti trust that's a combine that say cartel\nThat is a hundred percent of the legal but see I thought oh we've read about shows for years and the press will ban him no one will defend him and then the pressure that sets\nThe great so you could give your extra tickets and other vets like me I don't forget them\nCool client buddy

three months ago Google told the Pentagon were not going to work with you on a a or anything else we think America's bad that's right\nOh the virtues signaling San Francisco elite shyness then again it's still five times what Hitler did they're good and I told you that I was told by forces inside Google\nThat Facebook was going to work with them on the AI and deploy a Chinese social score you actually look it up or ... a year ago with them and talked about it and I was a poll up Tim Cook with a communist Chinese leaders\nAnd now there's just broke Google and Facebook joined forces on a a high tech giant do it on social media giant Facebook reportedly teaming up pursues agency to develop a new artificial intelligence technology in China\nOf course but don't worry Trump's family did standard a asset protection of the state planning that everybody else does it's wealthy so that's the big news was five hundred million dollars when his dad died that was given to the children some included prompts so\nThat's that's dirty and bad so my God it's terrible it was a slave factories there's no helping around a political there's there's there's no censorship search engines there's no banning people's speech in America\nBut it doesn't matter so Apple's CEO Tim Cook praises China censorship of the Internet and says he wants to do it here and then goes on vice\nAnd among other things says oh I don't want power I don't have any power I I'm just a little trendy they're camouflaging themselves apples all about comments on the Internet all about corporate power all about control and it goes on Tim Cook to say oh he was sure writing\nLike a person in a museum not caught a rising\nBurning out our First Amendment but curator rating when we just disappear where he helped political dissidents be arrested or you know as the worst slave factories in China on record\nThey contract out the lowest wages the social control force drug you know the employees forced abortion suicide ... things you can't even imagine in a science fiction this dystopian novel\nBut it's all done but it's Tim Cook in the liberal media loves them and he wears little skin tight shirts and talks about Steve

winner Rick I'm evidently we're in the next segment but they're on record there on record censoring they're on record spying they're all on record the tech giants lying about it look back in hindsight\n\nI think there's enough there that we had to cure rate you know Hitler saw himself as a curator he wanted motherland to be this big museum shitty with these big massive structures and then they called Albert Spear hit his head of domestic operations uh the the correct and and the master architect\nAnd so when you hear of like oh we're sure writing we're ordering your life because we know best wow\nOh but there's enough they're like slave factories in China like eight in China in spinal political dissidents like big tax exempt oh my God Trump avoiding taxes with his father legally
