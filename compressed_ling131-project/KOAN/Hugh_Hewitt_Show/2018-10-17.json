PC name as a explodes in popularity because it's freaking out of the left I'm looking at an article from back in June\n... called new scientific study proves that last call me now is not just the cliche like they may take themselves\nThis was a study undertake at University College London we found that the most the most effective means largely originated in two places wall\nThe Donald so bread it which is obviously a forum devoted to boosting president Donald Trump many credits adopt full room with helping him sterile online support joined make twenty sixteen presidential election and fortunes politically incorrect Paul for\nThose two forums all the most effective I normally creating means spreading them throughout the rest of the Internet the research study multiple one hundred million images from online community this was a vast study\nAnd found that Paul ... at the highest volume of means while the Donald was the ... the gang main spread outside of its community the researchers concluded that the algorithm they developed\nTo identify the most effectively spread means could be used to social media platform strike to automatically detect hateful content so the foundation of this study\nWas based on how do we find these means because they're incredibly popular and there's no way to refute them although then with more means but you see the last caught me because they're so permanently petrified of offending somebody that's out permanently\nTrapped in stasis a walking on eggshells constantly every single day\nThey cannot tolerate like kind of allow edgy bent or edgy humor I mean that ... like ... their own events because it might trigger people so are they going to engage in satirical means that might be offensive no they're not\nThey're going to call people Nazis white supremacists and Russian bobsled day that's fine but when it comes to actual comedy they've ruined it so in the battleground that means that completely failing which is why that trying to ban them\nSo they study proved that the Donald and poll with the most effective forums for getting out means in this study was based around the prospect of banning them completely they want to develop an algorithm to do that now because everyone was freaking out\nA few weeks ago that they you planning to ban means they got that through the first stage of it though it's probably going to come into effect whether for social media outlets have these automatic ... load filters which can so I mean for copyright violation this University College London study was based around\nFiltering out the means but hateful content and we've seen Facebook post that before to the point where now Facebook is saying\nWe've now basically almost the fact of the technology not just a flag up tax don't post it might be offensive might hate speech because as as we blend basically anything you'd hate speech at this point in full satirical videos will hate speech that is the um\nIt info little satirical videos will hate speech size the phony justification that they used to ban Alex Jones on Facebook\nSo we'd goal is happening we'd go wrong freaking out about it you you finding names\nAnd yeah Twitter is all ready to engage with the un PC mean because it perfect plays into this whole hashtags walk away you movement remember Facebook suspended the sound of the organizer of the will to a movement for a few days until there was massive backlash against that\nNow this is from an article by Evan James took him out the un PC me which again is all about how these automated AI or tell them it's almost just say the same thing they have the same stalk responses to everything you know Donald Trump is orange Donald Trump is bad rape is bad\nAnd people respond to it with the same old sold them all all told I told them profile picks avatar so you're right that\nThey see the editorial team from the Huffington Post so diverse city it was actually funny Maine which I tweeted yesterday why they compared the so called white nationalist sub the Proud Boys and museum in on the image it was two Asian guys in a black guy\n[laughter] quite\nQuite a ways more diverse than the Huffington Post editorial team right that this is while Evan James ... out of a I think it was ... by magazine\nHe said the un PC name as a response to something real something that snarky liberals
