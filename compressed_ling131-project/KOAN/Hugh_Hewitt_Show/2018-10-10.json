thought I was at an extra system in an insane asylum perhaps you were watching on TV and heard the disruptions though you certainly didn't see them\nThe at two needed audio probably didn't catch the

a mental hospital\nThey echoed off the halls and ceilings outside the gallery in decreasing Batista dishing aptitude [noise]\nThen the role was called [noise]\nAnd it sounded like the gates of hell opened up\nNearly a dozen woman interrupted in unison shouting howling screaming and an unrecognizable venomous whale they wouldn't stop there was a fury a rage uh hate\nA poison and the noise\nIt wasn't pros it wasn't strong\nIt was a warming frail swirling nor\nI leaned over to someone and whispered pay attention that's what the left to sounds like\nNothing they were yelling and howling could

got a ton of news that we're going to get to before the end of the broadcast to we're going to be taking your calls all the way up to the conclusion of the hour shown show today at three o'clock central\nWhat do you make of President Trump after his meeting with Rosen scene which was the biggest story two weeks ago then the Kavanaugh circus happen and the road is the meaning came and went and anybody\n... nobody barely blink an eye but then Trump said after meeting with rows and saying it's clear to me now that the Democratic leader with Russia of course we all knew that already that was already news Trump it already said that but what happened in the meeting with Rosen's dean did Trump flipped Rosenstein\nRosenstein and Mueller always working with Trump as you are now and has said if that's true was it so deceptive that they had to pretend to go after Manafort and Flynn ... it's really just all crazy what do you think happens next\nBecause here's the craziest part about this whatever happens to the deep state here whose names we now know\n\nWhat happens to the mentally deranged protesters if this goes down\nObviously it would be the greatest thing for the world to see the likes of Hillary Clinton put in jail\nAnd the members of the Obama administration's crimes exposed and perhaps them put in jail what the world needs is what this country needs but then what happens to these mentally insane people they're only going to get more delusional how do we bring them back to reality how do we settle these\nLunatics that are just getting more violent and more riled up by the

deep state in the west that also works with\nDeep state or is over in the UN and all that you know whatever goes on over there too\nBut if it all comes down if it all is exposed if there is justice in this country what do the shrieking zombie demonic hordes do next because reality and facts don't influenced these people's lives\nSo\nThat's the challenge behind the challenge that we're probably all

who runs\nThe inner cities of Chicago the inner city of St Louis the inner city the Baltimore the inner cities of LA San Francisco who runs the inner city for ... years the Democrats\nWhat has happened to all these Democrat Ron cities in the last ... years poverty increase homeless there's increased disease it increased just everything\nAnd then people like Angela Rye are going to sit here and virtue signal for the Democrats like they're the party that deserves the vote of black people in inner cities listened to this propaganda from one of the worst in media Angela ride on CNN is Donald\nTrump making America great again\nSo I take it with a quiet and frankly credit because her me for my community in this country and frankly I struggled to be great for some time apart right here and just\nLet's just clarify her community you know she's virtue saying linked to to black people out there you're a millionaire you don't live in these communities your fraud\nBut you weren't you signal for your people as if you know the struggle because your millionaire lifestyle give me a break you been enriched since the Trump presidency and you're going to sit here and virtually single for your community is not your community let's go back to the ...\nStaying in most in a chair for many of that because I'm trying to hearken back to win that again was right on during the election and Donald Trump I'm a supporter or ask when America was at its greatest and his supporters more often\nNot we fly with sometime around ... ... well the ... and for people like me and at that one of four integration existed in this country\nRight that was the era of Jim Crow laws segregation that resulted in economic impact the next day we struggled to climb out at and so I was in ... in it All right I mean at all so unfair I don't believe in that prime is at the American dream but I don't see it happening right now and I had the happened before\nSo let's just be clear about this now either Angela ... is a total moron or she's a member of the mocking bird CIA press putting out propaganda to racially incite violence in this country\nFirst of all shut me any interviews or clips of Trump supporters and you know about the Nineteen fifties one American was ... well what is even talking about you just pointed that out of her rear end\nBut but but that's beyond the point this\nIs this is the propaganda at work if America was never great no country was that ... there was never any greatness on earth if America was never gray\nThere was never any great and it's on earth if America was never great\nName another country\nSeriously and of course they can't name another country where former slave and an entire slave population in a country within fifty years ... can be totally independent had its own economies it's its own everything and and even coming from the market in many instances have them\nTop people if some of the biggest industries in this country and she was going to sit\nHere and Virgin Galactic like oh America was never great for black people okay well where was it that\nWhereas at great for black people is a great in Africa written with disease and cry and slavery so this is this one thing they knew where they they they\nGive you this total misnomer about make America great again and they say well America was never great so these people are obviously just bird you certainly for white people\nNow she should she probably knows better she's a propaganda artist what is the truth folks\nShe knows when we say make America great again it has nothing to do with skin color\nIt has nothing to do with a period of time it has to do with economic prosperity it has to do with financial independence with low taxes it has to do with not taking a knee to the politically correct culture it has to do with not having an entire group\nOf people that hate this country that's what we mean when we say make America great again but either your mind is so filled with propaganda and disease and sickness and mental illness and obsession over identity politics that you can't even\nUnderstand that all you can think about is your race based identity politics so it doesn't matter what you hear\nYou always turn it into something racial here's a story out and come era wears make Africa home again after saints win okay go ahead and make Africa your home again are you going to make millions of dollars playing football\nNo no you're not are you you're not even going to make a dime but you don't that's fine\nAnd I don't even care if he has a right to say whatever he wants he the only one that will even say it\n\nBut it's here here's my problem with Andrew arrived folks\nShe wants to sit here and act like she's all about black people and and she's vertically for black people she's actually the enemy of black people because she is the one keeping black people down she is the one keeping black people in chains intellectually and psychologically and she knows what she's doing\nWhen she says these white people just say make America great again because they want black people to be down in this country ah\nSorry during the state of the union when President Trump said black unemployment was at its lowest was it the Democrats that that student applauded that no that was a Republican the Democrats sat and pout it\nWas it Obama got\nRecord low unemployment for black people no actually it was Obama that at a near record\nHighs so yeah we say make America great again because we want economic prosperity for all Americans\n\nAnd it really makes me sick it really makes me sick\nThat the Democrat Party still has some black people in this country so brainwashed but they really think that they have to vote Democrat the Democrats have run inner cities which has the highest population density for black people for fifty years what have they done\nIt's amazing how you have people like angel or are they keep complaining about how it's not fair for black people in this country well you've been electing Democrats for fifty years so what have they done for you nothing they keep you mentally enslaved they\nKeep you financially enslaved by having you on welfare they keep you independent by telling you to break up with your husband so they can give you a page that that's all Democrats Democrats want black people down Democrats want black people enslaved mentally and then they use their CIA mocking bird press like Angela right\nTo say when they say make America great again they just mean they weren't black people down in this country you are a filthy disgusting liar\nAnd it's sick that you claim to represent black people you would lie to them and keep them intellectually and slave that is said to me that is said to me Angela rice you are a poison through the black population\nYou are a chance or to the black population in the media in this country you are Angela ride\nHealth care reform is confusing but

an absolutely huge story them go to another bombshell about to drop\nAnd they delayed it a little bit because of the um Nikki Haley information and some of the big stories are coming out they don't want it to be overshadowed but it basically has to do with Google being coal at mixing the gaming their own algorithms that gaming their own\nYouTube but censorship tools which goes James O'Keefe

Trump after his meeting with roses and which was the biggest story two weeks ago then the Kavanaugh circus happened and the road is the meeting came and went and anybody ... nobody barely blink an eye\nBut then Trump said after meeting with rows and saying it's clear to me now that the Democrats glued with Russia of course we all knew that already that was already news prompted already said that but what happened in the meeting with relatives dean did Trump flip Rosen's dean\nWere Rosen scene and Mueller always working with Trump as you are now and has said if that's true was it so

deep state here whose names we now know\n\nWhat happens to the mentally deranged protesters if this goes down\nObviously it would be the greatest thing for the world to see the likes of Hillary Clinton put in jail\nAnd the members of the Obama administration's crimes exposed and perhaps them put in jail throughout the world needs is what this country needs but then what happens to these mentally insane people they're only going to get more delusional how do we bring them back to reality how do we settle\nThese unhinged lunatics that are just getting more violent and more riled up by
