person to call a black man the N. word\nAs long as you you're renting at a conservative blacks allow it and white left this will allow it the in the tolerance of that side of the aisle is ridiculous and that's why when people ask me what do you do I tell you I Will get in your grill\nI Will fight you back in New York minute I'm trained to fight for that reason and it's a it's a sad state of

I'm ever in one of those situations you don't watch me go to jail but I Will uh taken out about ten or Fifteen of those books\nBecause that's the thing is they don't want you to fight they that's what they want they want to beat us down verbally and then they want to beat us now physically and Alex let's face it over the past few decades man ... we exist if the Republican Party at the conservative movement was doing what it's supposed to know what I mean we look man I don't know what you like to do I got better things to do\nI I got a lot of I Love to go out hike I wanted to go fishing I don't want to make us all the time I I don't want to go out to a restaurant with my family to walk over and go after you not seeing knocked my drink over on my face\nRight and it's so I look at why are we doing this we ... it takes some guts to do to get up in the morning go face these people face to face and and I'm not doing it for myself\nI could get it you either we could go into obscurity never be bothered again for the most part and they would be happy they got rid of us but we do it because this this country means something in the fact that we have children grandchildren and and I see what's going on in the world and and\nI Am I Know it's a lot to say it's going to get a lot worse that's the thing is that they say they want to imprison conservative they say they want to break up families I mean they're really villainous\nThink about it Alex they want to break up families because we don't want to bring illegals into our country they want to break us they want to put us in jail because we use the wrong pronoun and California I mean when you asked me how ridiculous it get I Will tell you wherever we are right now wait a day it'll get even more ridiculous\nWhile I was talking about that may raise this to you and am I going to even read this on air San Francisco chronicle it talks about people cutting them shows and cropping on themselves with the official parades they bring

leaving fewer and opinions of Democrats tab\nThat's red state and in Folsom Street fairs stresses consent I meant leather B.D a sham and it says\nThey will teach us consent and stop the Republican rapist by cutting themselves and cramping on each other and I'm not even going to read all this stuff it says here but I mean you it's like these this is what happened when we got rid of the second silence\nAnd think about it in New York you have people like the Blasio who now says it's no they don't even outlaw people deprecating and kissing in public\nI mean you can just do it right that used to be they I forget what they call it but they had it was a nuisance thing and I'm like yeah so now it's no big deal so they have people running around it wouldn't make it pay which you know look I'm gonna do it I've seen some of these girls are hot but would you want your kids to see\nThe whole exactly that's the thing is go do it in the private play somebody running around the street\nRight I mean a town square you know and then the busiest place in New York so this is what we're dealing with they they want to tell us that uh yeah I look at teaching the little kids how to put condoms on all these other things and then they get mad and\nOh yeah what about the world Boy Scout conference and they handed out a hundred thousand condoms or even six year old what the hell is that you send your son to a boy scout convention and they're going to forgive them condoms\nRight well it's no longer the boy scouts anymore it can be any scout so look there is no limit and I and I'm telling folks forget about the the Muslims forget about the illegals coming over the the worst part of what's going on in this country right now is the left is and the leftists have have essentially made us shut up they don't\nWe don't know what you're saying the leftist aren't there the number one threat\nThey are the threat\nYeah they're the threat these are the people that have been training for decades how
