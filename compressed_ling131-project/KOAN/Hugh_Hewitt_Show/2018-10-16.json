the one and he's the one that gave away a part of Ukraine where Russia now has\nHim personally plan I mean I think I'm a very tough for him personally I had a meeting with him the two of us yeah there

I think China metal too fun I don't want to know something I said why don't you tell me ... mental because I think China metal also\nAnd I think frankly China are probably going to we're diverting the whole Russian and doing airline saying Russia but I'm also saying China\nNow\nChina has a billion three hundred and fifty something million people they put spy chips and all the apple and other platforms they're openly bought Hollywood and our debt they're trying to overthrow our country they censor everything\nGoogle and others are helping them censored and then President Trump talks about it and he's the writer Russia is a red herring Russia once been alliance with us they would take the alliance than we would control Central Asia all the way out to East Asia\nThat borders with North Korea South Korea we would control in the Eastern Europe it's the perfect alliance the global is don't want that they want the stabilization\nGoogle CEO tell senators\nThat's censored Chinese search

Bloomberg\nThe earth minerals the ports the upper structure and our elite have allowed them to do it on purpose which is called treason the Big Mac how China used a tiny chip infiltrate U.S companies the U.S government in your home\nBut the other chips they put Chinese appliances all coordinating tracking you stealing the data\nAnd beg U.S companies use China as the fence so they can move there because Chinese companies and get away with the illegal activity Europe band spying on you us fans that you just moved to China Sea it's the base of operations of all this criminal activity now\nAnd that's why what Trump is saying is so central and south important he's pointing out the elephant in the room and not the red herring of Russia now let's go to the next clip prop I never knew how dishonest the media was he tells Leslie stall I'm president and you're not\nThe other thing I really learned\nIs I never knew how dishonest the media was I I I really made it I'm not saying that as a sound bite I now I knew how to change the subject to get well no but even the way you ask me questions about separation yeah\nWhen I say Obama did it you don't want to talk to them when I was like

China metal too and I have met some why ... why don't you tell me ... metal because I think China metal do show\nAnd I think frankly China are probably going to we're diverting the whole Russians and doing headline saying Russia but I'm also saying China\nAnd noticed what he said there\nIt's Obama that allowed all this happened and it just gets crazier from that point on with Leslie stall I even knowing what she's a betting or what she's discussion I mean Trump probably had like five hundred people killed last week and they're sitting there asking the question about it just tell anybody I mean it's like three year old talking to a doctor but jak\nIt's absurd because they're pleasantly stole it any way of foreign she would have known that February ... thousand eight seeing a Trump ordered matters to order the beef and beaches and the Apache helicopters to destroy a more the group\nA morgue and cooperation that lack of cooperation that was working for the G are you in Syria so we still do the laundry\nRussians who attacked us special forces that\nThey don't want to talk about that that's not the issue in the greater issue for Trump and it's going to be harder for people to understand is\nI Know who are my enemies so and I can handle that a real problem I had as Trump is my friends and I'm not convinced that NATO is a good for us and that's where the difference with Mattis but I agree with Trump I'm\nNot sure I Want to help out Japan will get matched that we have a competing ships gunships navy ships in order for them to get oil in the middle east and then turns around and literally takes advantage of that\nIn our cars and our science and everything else so he's saying I can handle my enemy is my friends that I'm really mistrust all up and that's the key to

the rest of the hour and a I'd like a first give a shout out to Dr pay you know it's a it's a tough act to follow because the man is just a knowledge of uses these affairs is encyclopedic and they're just I just learned by listening to him I never want to see him go off even where I'm coming on\nBut um it reminds me when he was\nThey were talking of Alex and and Dr a doctor ... we're talking about\nThe Leslie stall interviewing what um what basic first level thinking she uh was showing there on the sixty minutes interview\nBecoming preoccupied with it the show the apparent murder and I'm going to get to that and just a minute but you can you can really see and and Dr ... brings us out so so vividly that\nOur president is operating at like a master read the chef wobble and Leslie stall right now when I'm picturing her what I'm picturing is that I'm ... and PC means face over\nThe non ... character role model that from a from a video games\nShe just doesn't get it she's obviously being fed information\nThat she doesn't understand anything about she's fixated on things like you know one one dead or ... you know Saudi reporter and whether we're going to overturn the world order on that\nWhen I'm sure if you ask her about that Wagoner group the four hundred Russians that matter annihilated in Syria she would probably just staring blankly\nSo whereas the the average liberal and the average liberal reporter is operating on a farm level thinking basis Trump is acting on so many levels at the same time that they basically can't comprehend it\nYet I think the American the average American voter understands Trump is finally operating\nOn on the best interests of the United states of America you know Trump often said and says that our trade deals were stupid\nAnd that's true but I think he's avoiding saying something even harsher which is that the Americans making these trade deals\nWere sellout they're lining their own pocket but expediting the the the transfer of our technology and our factories to places like China they don't give a damn about whether or not we make our own military gear in this country or if we could\nGet a surge up a a military a build up in a war time they don't care as long as they made their money\nSelling selling out our trade or treat 'em\nOr technology or our intellectual property and even our factories just sipping on my off offshore as long as they can profit in the transfer and that's what Trump is turning around I loved with doctors Dr piece about about um the you're\nNot worrying so much about the enemies we can take care of China and Russia itself plans are back stabbing out alive that's harder and literally stall she's back on that first level thinker um end piece seemed mean face saying but but aren't you being a harsh\nOh isn't that being rough on our allies I mean she just doesn't get it no wonder we constantly lose in this global poker game we finally got a hard nosed winner in charge\nAnd the liberals it just for lose their mind\nThey can only see it the first level oh he's saying nice things to our allies\nYeah but he's getting results he wants NATO for example to pay its fair share what's wrong with that and you're not going to get there by you know speaking softly to them worshipping them plane loads of money that's just not going to happen now\nThe big news today is obviously a ... thing and I've been giving it a lot of thought I've been reading every evening I could get my um my hands on the Internet that is and I found a really good um algebra zero piece that that keeps\nReload and if you um if you refresh it every half hour or so it will actually have the newer stuff at the top\nAnd you know it's it's extremely informative because this is really an important story and maybe not for the reasons that people think you know my first impression of the ... is\nIt's got to be the world's worst wet up you know I mean imagine sending a team of Fifteen assassins to one of your own consulate than killing an enemy of the state inside the consulate this absolutely trashes the Saudi reputation worldwide\nAbsolutely trashes the Saudi reputation worldwide who that's not a students for the government will ever willingly walk into a Saudi diplomatic mission I mean if it could be killed by so it it brings up the thought who benefit it why would you do this\nEven the salaries can't be that stupid especially during Solomon now if you just wanted to to kill the guy the last thing you would do is lower him into a conflict where he's filled going in but not out presumably not filled going out however\nIf you kill him even though we're in a ah for example a a an arranged traffic accident where he's run down crossing the street or or something like that you're poison in his seat at the hotel\nUh it it might look better than you know murdering and inside your own consulate hold on the other hand then you don't get a chance to interrogate him now who would want to interrogate him some of the best information that actually and there is a good article and zero Hedges a warning about this\nSome of the people that may have wanted to interrogate ... before killing him should be Saudis that had advance knowledge of nine eleven\nNow this is why you don't want to just run them over on the street and this temple\nYou want to know what he does and you also want to know may be who he shared the information with so you can go after them also\nIn terms of damage control if during torture slashed interrogation he can demonstrate to you that it doesn't matter he's got a a a failsafe sweater dead men switch so that if he doesn't come out the information will be released will that's worthwhile information in itself\nBut if the if the Saudis entail bosses that had to send for that one is information\nOr if they could be implicated in pre knowledge of nine eleven\nYou know they might be willing to do it now when you say a Saudi into boss that doesn't necessarily mean an ally of the king look at our own CIA were bred and was working for the deep state against president elect Trump and then he against uh against you know President Trump in fact\nYou can have the same situation and Saudi Arabia\nThe country is in turmoil even though there is a new king there are it's virtually an underground civil war taking place where you're much of a royal family arrested or exiled and many of the people in place their loyalty might be divided or they might secretly working against the king\nSo if you have a a a traitor into boss who's\nWho's on the surface still working within the Saudi Government he would be able to possibly order this Fifteen man his team to the consulate\nWithout the exact knowledge of the higher levels of the Saudi Government that they were going to kill to show the\nThen it's a win win if they interrogate him the report the report gets back to the uh the you know the a traitor is into boss\nIndicating whether or not near the fact that he had pre knowledge of nine eleven will be reported or not\nAnd if this damages king Solomon then it's a two for so you so you possibly help the enemies of the king because this is just ruin us to sue Saudi Arabia's reputation payers flying over there right now to read them the riot act so this this is a real uh wipers left\nInside of Saudi Arabia and by no means can you assume that if this had happened it was ordered by the king [noise]\nIt can definitely be um a rogue operation in a sense the way that Trump\nAnd articulate put it this morning [noise]\nAnd we'll be back in a little bit um [noise]\nLet's start told so if there are calls will be taken um [noise]\nI\nHated my neck back and shoulders has really gotten worse relief for body pain is here\n... was the last thing I Want us to

ever to do that show let me ask you that that level in everybody agrees is to set up and kill the peace deal but ... ...\nWell it you know everybody raises to shut up and kill the peace deal but what is that the only motive or is it what can show gee under what he knew\nYeah I think it's what he knew because\nIn terms of doing a natural on the street with a venue role on the up and a carpet that kind of you know the bill old standbys um\n... is going to be very hard person to capture that way this is like trying to capture they you know the granddaddy jak rabbit that people have been hunting

he where he is he really thinks that this is clearly has gotten the high level assurances that he's good to go for the divorce papers you can't get married without them I think it's for sprint walk into any Saudi embassy or consulate\nBut it shows that wherever the hit was very desperate to get what he had inside of his brain no matter what it took even to kill him and cause a huge flap like this\nBecause it tells me that if ... he's planted the information on you know and it has some kind of a failsafe that situation where you know it's going to be disseminated after his death than a this could blow nine eleven wide open because a lot of people seem to believe that these high level into people\nAh they knew about nine eleven gearing up you know maybe not the exact Oregon but they knew all about the Allen the teams in the usa here and\nWe know that celebrities Trump's got over him to make Saudi Arabia ... we'll be right back to the final several Matt right when the war on fires
