Democrats we need to move aggressively but first let's examine why this is happening\nAt the last few days have been a revealing between Bob Woodward's book\nThe anonymous op ed and Obama's speech event that it is that the deep state is preparing for the same exact type of the doubt\nThat they used to remove president John F. Kennedy in his case their game plan was somewhat more violent you see much like President Kennedy\nTrump or is for peace he wants to lessen tensions with North Korea he wants to lessen tensions with the Russians after the\nOf pigs fiasco when president John Kennedy refused to mount an all out assault against Cuba\nAnd after the Cuban missile crisis in which JFK signaled that he wanted talks with Russia to lessen national prospects for a nuclear Holocaust well it was too much for the deep state and they took him down\nPrior to the more recent signals the Washington Post\nAnonymous op ed the Bob Woodward book\nAnd Obama's incredible speech in which he grabbed credit for a surging economy that he predicted would never surge again the evidence was somewhat thinner but still more troubling\nFirst of all you had a series of anonymous leaks out of Obama's intelligence services regarding a the alleged collusion with the Russians\nOne of these was even admitted to under oath by FBI Director\nComey then you had a series of anti Trump political messages that were found in the tax changes between Peter stroke and other FBI agents regarding the fact that they could find no real evidence of Russia collusion\nThere was at least that page said no there there are and then the Democratic party produced\nAre and then the Democratic party produced a dot CA nodded ... created by law enforcement or legitimate intelligence agencies but a partition document that was then used\nAs a legal rationale for the surveillance of the Republican candidate for president\nA an abuse of power that makes Watergate looked like small potatoes and then lastly very similar to Watergate a former CIA and FBI operative\nUh approached a members of the Trump campaign in an effort to plant so evidence of Russian collusion\nThese are the seeds of should they should know these are the underlying uh\nAspects of the game and play\nTo remove our president now there are two things that the deep state requires before they can make their move on Donald Trump\nFirst and foremost is the complete silencing of info wars dot com\nThey want Alex Jones shot up and as quickly as possible because they know that millions of Americans to an end to him for wars through whatever a cop or what ever a platform they choose\nTo get the truth the raw I like to call it stone cold truth about what's happening in Washington and what the global as are really up to then as I said here many times they would like to lock me up\nHaving come up with empty handed of any evidence of Russian collusion or would you leave collaboration or any involvement regarding the acquisition or publication of John Podesta emails\nNow Robert Mueller that man for the deep state is trying to to advocate some other offense in order to silence Mitt\nDon't let them do it folks go to the fore is dot com site right now because we need your help as never before\nHim for wars is a beacon of freedom we our freedom commands central dishes where you are here up to the minute reports on exactly what the deep state is up to their efforts to take down our president\nWe will tell you when and how to act with grassroots activism to counter the efforts of the last\nBut we cannot do it without your support\nAnd we cannot do it while we are facing the kind of censorship that they hope to port on us we are a really not crying wolf we are operating under as you get to see some technological or restraints but\nWe do know this shutting down info wars is crucial\nTim Cook is why it is only through the process of discovery\nAnd lawsuits that we're going to be able to prove if the apple CIO CEO lives approve his teeth when he says there is no coordination\nThere's never been any discussions regarding the censorship of Alex Jones he lives and only in a court of law will we approve it\nBy Roger Stone you're on the Alex Jones show and I'll be right back\nHi I'm Dan ...
