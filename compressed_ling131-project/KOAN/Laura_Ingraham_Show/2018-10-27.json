I Know infringe on Japanese I celebrate it and a religious identity that if you have the more of those you have the greater chance for happiness so I'm just explaining where you're coming from\nA very interesting like site or about who who what is my family 'cause family was been raised by a color as another source of identity happiness\nOr another identity source of happiness\nSo that's interesting my look I'm not I have I mean in in a sense I have done a lot of counseling through the radio but obviously you you're a professional with this and I and I\nAre certainly honor that fact I might I'd be curious than\nTo hear your response to my general take on divorce and children it is not the divorce that is most troubling but what happens after the divorce if parents do not sniping one another\nAnd maintain listen we are not married but we remain your father and your mother my experience in life including out of my own children has been that that works but so many times sharply goes\nA long ways okay you know it goes a long long ways yes\nWell vats clinical yeah go on\nWell and and particularly when either one or both of the parents remarry and you're bringing in a one or two more\nYes all that are writing\nAs parental units I think it's extremely important and in my own divorce that was a not the case was not a what we call a a good divorce if there is such a thing and it did have some major impact upon our children\nAre they're saying there are mistakes that I made certainly there were things I was not aware of\nBut uh I think you're absolutely correct on that on that issue it doesn't alleviate everything but it does go a long long ways to help them deal with what is nothing but a I mean almost all the time a bad situation for the kids there are certainly exceptions yet we don't they'll are\nNot in the lab easily listening yeah you're very thoughtful man and I appreciate it and I think we're substantial agreement look life is filled\nWith obstacles to happiness and filled with landmines and that is how we navigate our life that ultimately determines or ability to handle that\nHopefully and with some degree of happiness\nI\nHave a lot of a lot of lot of thoughts on divorce and I should I haven't talked about in quite some time I've talked about a\nMuch more in the past and I will address it again thanks to this call\nBut he and I both agree that the issue is what you do after the divorce more than the divorce I mean many things are factors including what age you you divorced what trial the child's age\nIt's it's\nVery different if the child was too that if the trial was twelve or the child was twenty two\n\nThat's that's it and see there's no comparison in fact\nBut\nBut the the most calamitous results by obscene or when a parent the parent the parent ties is the other parent the legitimate rights as the other most children are attached to both parents\nAnd even if you are right\nCertain you're right the legitimize of the

very close to my college advisor or and we spend a lot of time talking about especially in light of what was happening with the elections and the so called election meddling by Russians um about about one of them are putting them ... ... ...\n... by Russians um about about one of them are putting them what Vladimir Putin wants\n[noise] and it's interesting because she said to me and and this is always stuck with me while I'm a ... does not care does not care who is in charge in America\nWould apply to report and cares about is selling as much chaos as possible and using the very things that we consider our greatest strength and our Democratic Republic to use those against remember what am I putting some martial artist\nOr and so when he wants to do is feed chaos now when this issue happen obviously lots of chatter amongst people about ...\nAbout a a you know who might be behind this what the motivation is who would help so it hurts a lot of folks talking about a someone who might be a progressive because as we know progressive is like to use a a bombs as their tools of of terror that's a fact\nWe don't like guns they like they like bombs [noise] um but the reality is that you know so so that's that's but as we're talking about this someone said to me\n[noise] you know and what about what about the possibility\nWhat about the possibility that this could be\nA a a Russian effort an FSB effort now I had a conversation yesterday with Peter joy ... Russian expert he was actually attacked possibly by a a potent cronies present I I ... anti pollutant stances\nHe he specifically said to me no do you do not believe that this was a Russian effort this would have been sort of beyond the pale but isn't an interesting\nI had it if you're that Chuck Todd was talking about this uh yesterday on ... on on MSNBC\nI have this fear that it could be some Russian operation to and designed to do what's happening now more of this you know I think it ... and so in some ways we shouldn't rule out of me and I think it's a ... a very strange moments and and we have no idea where it comes from\nWe have no idea where it comes from it's absolutely true and remember I said context\nIs everything right when we talk about when we talked about uh the Peter Struck Lisa Page the FBI situation with regards to the Trump campaign contacts with everything that timeline you had to understand the timeline in order to understand what was going on\nThe same thing can apply here and get knocked conspiracy the horizon again I Am just trying to find meaning in what is a very bizarre situation\nVery bizarre situation how how do you have ten bombs or a fake or otherwise go through the postal service without a without a um a post mark on them and without that post mark on them\nHow do you discovered that they came out of Florida now that's very strange to me but but the point is this is interesting so this all up at the episode started happening a couple of days ago last week\nLast week the United states announced is\nThat they are pulling out of the intermediate nuclear intermediate range nuclear forces treated the I N F treaty signed by a a signed by um I'm President Reagan\nIn negotiations were pulling out because the Russians are violating that treaty Vladimir Putin's turns around and says if the United states starts deploying missiles in Europe\nThan the Russians are going to have to retaliate they're going to start targeting those countries\nAnd that's a that's a very direct threat at the same time us backed forces and us equipment is being used to kill Russian or or to kill a Russian soldiers on the ground\nIn Syria the Russians are not happy about this and so to me given what the Russians have been willing to do\nIt is not beyond the pale and it wasn't remember the Russians were literally killing people in Great Britain or trying to kill people in Great Britain I should say\nLiterally trying to kill people in Great Britain we know this\nSo it to me it's not it's not beyond the realm of possibility\nThat they would turn around and send bombs that were not that we're not real bombs fake bombs dummy bombs through the post office to a bunch of democratic targets in order to turn the left and right against each other even further that is what Vladimir Putin wants\nAnd I think it makes a heck of a lot more sense than either a right wing or or left wing or sending fake bombs through the mail\nIn any case when we come back we're going to be joined by Todd would former air force pilot editor in chief ... dot com national security columnist for the Washington Times taking your phone calls eight five

baby soft skin and right now shipping is also free fantastic vessel called them at eight hundred for a zero fifty two there are things that go to Jenny dot com that ... dot com\nIt is possible I mean look they just sprayed nerve gas all over the u._k. yeah feel several people or one person and so it is possible however I think it would be incredibly reckless and literally an act of war targeting you know former political leaders for\nYou know the vice president's et cetera uh of the United states I don't think the Kremlin is that reckless at this point now that's just my point you know I have reporters all over the ... former Soviet Union and I just don't believe that they would do that at this\nPoint in time well let me ask you this because getting getting back to this high enough treaty and you've written about it I agree with you wholeheartedly the time has come for America to pull out of it um but ... has now turned around and said that that if the U.S starts placing intermediate range missiles in\nCentral Europe he's going to target and I don't know what do you mean by targeting maybe you can elicited us on that but what you know that he's going to target these countries I talked to what is it what does that mean\nAnd and how and what does what does it mean that he's going to target and how seriously should the u._s. be taking various threats by putting on the IMF treaty pull out\nWell that's exactly what you would think he would say I mean what else is going to do except threaten you know the U.S in countries where we may\nDeploy intermediate range nuclear missiles just like we did a you know in the eighties under Ronald Reagan with the person to is against the ss twenties et cetera that were deployed throughout the Warsaw Pact against western nations\nAnd so when he means by targeting is is really just putting the coordinates of Warsaw or you know hungry or whatever in the in the uh targeting\nPart time out of that period of\nTime and this is so you're literally he literally means targeting like like when when I'm a Michael Moore went to Russia to try to find the nuclear missiles that were targeted at a at Detroit there's literally he's talking about about changing target coordinates\nOh for sure he he I mean what could I mean my point of that article is that we've seen this all the Ford and this is how we bankrupted the Soviet Union there is no way that Russia\nCan keep up with us economically especially under the Trump economy which in two years maybe pushing seven percent growth there is just absolutely no way they can keep up and he's trying to Boston and then I noticed he went to the United nations and\nTried to drum up support there to force us to not withdraw from the treaty but this is classic Trump negotiations that you know threaten to try to keep them in the treaty to begin with and had them stop violating what they're doing\nMy guess is Todd more he's a former U.S air force pilot a he's a national security columnist for the Washington Times this piece in the Washington Times an arms race with Russia bring it on I think it'll go up on on more as a a Web site certainly will go up on the ... show page\nOn Facebook so go and check that out there explain to us a little bit about what ... dot com is because that's that's fascinating to me\nYeah well I\nKnow I have a long history or in Russia studied it in the air force academy the language I learned about the Soviet Union are flying for the airports I traded emerging market down on Wall street for almost Twenty years\nFocusing on Eastern Europe and other countries and so I Know a lot about the region and I just really realize that the west especially Americans in you know middle America or don't know anything really about what's going on over here so\nI have built a team of reporters and we're growing rapidly the traffic is growing and and we're really just trying to bring news analysis culture opinion as to what's happening here\nWell and the important point and and you and I own a lot of talk more about this because I was I was a Soviet Studies major in college myself and so and I also learn language are you at the very least I Need to brush up on my Russian so I'm always looking for people to talk to us but the hottest show dog\nShe was on a show so I felt my but my my question a lot of sleep people what they don't understand is it is that this is really it's not for food and it's not about\nReestablishing the Soviet Union but it really is about ... the trappings of the Russian Empire and and and\nYou're exactly right and and things like me\nWell thank you but you got ... [laughter] as I was supposed to be able to claim that a little bit explain explained what that means in the modern context of what a modern Russian Empire looks like\nWell I don't know what a modern Russian Empire looks like but I'll tell you what the ultimate looked like it stretched from Poland and people don't notice all the way into San Francisco there's a Fort roost you can go to in San Francisco yeah exist today as a monument\nAnd so bizarre empire was huge Russia before the Soviet Union was one of the most productive successful countries they said do you uh really half the world with their economy and their agriculture and adjust now a hundred years later\nGot back to that point and so that tells you what the Soviet Union that to the end it destroyed them economically destroyed them politically culturally I mean what Russia last with the Soviet um you know the ... revolution is just astounding and I would I Would I don't want to happen here so we had a lot about\nThat but I mean this is this is why this this changing stance visa V. Russia is so important I mean the the idiotic Russian reset that's then secretary of State Hillary Clinton was talking about was completely ineffectual the the the you know it's not just that the Russians only understand strengths it's not quite that\nBut the Russians have to respect your ability to push back and and to know that you're serious about what you're doing I don't I mean that that's what makes what we're doing now so different than what the Obama administration tried to do with my right\nOf course and if you want collusion the Obamas or their their entire administration on down the ones that clear to Russia and still probably are in some ways uh you you look at a uranium so you know those sales you look at a what's going on with the Trump dossier cetera I mean there was\nInterrupted interaction with the Russian security services by the bomb in his administration against a political candidate I mean and so\nIt's just amazing to me that people don't get that still or they don't want to be\nTaught how to folks have folks find out more about what you're up to the good work and doing that I listen I get in touch with me when I Want to talk Russian when you\nUh well I can always go to ... dot com the S.

L. D. in Ninety eight point seven at them and letting ten Michigan pretty cool place thanks a lot for joining us up there\nYeah lugging ten Danny as a historic harbor town located in far western Michigan but it's right on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan so must be a beautiful spot for\nBoating and fishing and water skiing and all that and I read recently Lake Michigan I think I might have known this but I had forgotten that Lake Michigan and the five Great Lakes is the only one located entirely within the United states\nNow is that right is some a lot so much of a lean over to Canada yeah yeah so that's great well especial hello to everybody they're letting ten and a hobo everything's going well if you're taking on some projects for thanks for joining us and also join this is Jeff right now Jeff is joined us from Washington state jet thanks so much for being a part of the show\nHey thanks for letting me on good good what can we what can we help you with well\nWe decided is our house and hum as luck would have it at some point after we made that decision uh the icebreaker started the week on the refrigerator\nAnd we didn't catch it because the water to run out right into the floor and it seemed to just kind of um we noticed box McConnell kind of darkening up and all of a sudden it\nBecame very bleak in like ... almost overnight it it was just some of the ground was really really dark and we we we went on to the house made sure that everything was dry down their Rana fan just to make sure\nAnd I was hoping we were hoping that the the ground would kind of return to its original color and it hasn't done that and so one of my option\nOh right yeah yeah I'll tell you the water you know a lot of times you have that well in the area of your say your bathroom where you step out of the shower maybe few drip shared a few drip there and after a while it really does stain it now Joe has written a fantastic or the best how books I've ever read and Joe I Know you had to address\nThings to do with the everybody wants to know about you know the the grouch staying in a different way that you can go about it um uh what can you share with Jeff on that\nYeah ... well the first thing I was gonna say is lower your sale price but that's not very hell no nothing wrong wrong [laughter]\nLet the next guy wary about snow I'm so let me ask you adjust the the ... joints are they relatively wider they narrow it typically say that because that might make a difference how you could do like three eight okay yeah so the wider than average\nHum and this was just clear water running on to us I'm not sure why would abstain that are dark and that but we regardless I think\nA swimming that everything else is find the the way that you typically clean gr out I mean you could of course by a ... I'm sure they make commercial route cleaners but I'm the way I typically I tell people is to use 'em an oxygen bleach powdered oxygen bleeds bleach some water\nAnd um and then poured onto the floor let it sit for twenty minutes or so than scrub that works really well and you get okay auction bleach goes by names like actually cleaner age\nAnd that works really well and you get okay auction bleach goes by names I actually cleaner a jacks makes when um which is another thing I was actually used that works great and you might not think of it is toilet bowl cleaner if you have a good bad stain grout Lysol makes them comes in a plastic bottle I think it's about\nLike ... and a half or so and has a angle nozzle on it and I guess it's it's angles that can squirt it up under the room and the toilet thing but it makes it really easy to apply just to drought joins\nWithout a beat of this stuff it's it's like a sick liquid onto the ... joins let it sit there for thirty minutes or so and then describe it with a like a rough clause like a piece of a Terry cloth towel or something like that and just by the way with all these techniques just chime in one spot make sure they don't do the whole floor and find out the might not work\nAnd ... and I bet that would work you know okay and yet you have to make sure it's relatively dry the floor of the relatively dry I'm you know which apparently it is and try that and then let us know if either of those work because um I'd be surprised that they didn't\nOkay what about um the companies that use the advertisers like grocery store type stuff or to give any information on those guys\nWell not any particular companies but yeah that would be a last resort if you had to okay that that's why I said how why does joined time if you had to remove even part of the ... of ... in a kitchen that's a lot of ground to remove and refill so I I Would try just cleaning as best you can I mean you should be relatively clean\nAnd Jeff also um the the the use of steam a lot of times with a little ... and some of these different ones there we've had a lot of luck with that as well just using just water so different way to go but hopefully uh hopefully that'll work well for you and even more so we certainly wish you the best of luck in selling the house and moving on to greener pastures\nThank you guys appreciate your time\n... ... ... ... yeah I Know it basically over the last few weeks hey right now it's time for our\nBest new product of the week you know the look of rustic or barn would has become incredibly popular for accent walls and decorative features but not everyone has access to an old barn or fans to salvage materials from not to mention that would may be treated with chemicals or even worse infested with insects that's what makes white\nWash weathered hardwood board such a great fun they created and the impression of reclaimed born would indoors without the hassle of finding Salva gene cleaning all that plus the dimensions are consistent which will make installation a whole lot easier and only three eighths of an inch thick\nThey also create fewer problems with surrounding trim\nThe boards are mailed from domestic popular with variations in color texture and expose solvers\nThey give it a very rustic uh Paris without any treatment chemicals or insects plus they're killed dried for stability and the paint used on them is low video sea so we're talking about whitewashed weathered hard would boards if you're interested in that you can check it out at home depot dot com or I\nDid that is a great product or in fact I I went to Home Depot dot com and if you search for those weathered boards I haven't a video that shows you how to install him to get an idea and some great photographs and they're going to be solved horizontally vertically diagonally is really a great idea\nYeah more and more people are looking for that kind of thing hey let's jump right back on the line and got a lot of people call in Julie's on the line right now Julie welcome to the today's somewhat our radio show how are you\nThank you I'm Grace hood hey what can we help you with\nWell I have a problem in my basement I hadn't tried a lot and we had a little bit of water coming true enemy ...\nOh I'm two walls and we\nHad the white coming to that it's been a few years and now it's yelling and I even have laws coming true ... and ... and another area wide hidden\nWithin try a lot of ... anything it's now the off kind of crumbling\nOr black wild I see uh-huh\nWell I'll tell you the ... a lot of times matter of fact I just ordered some today to use on a retaining wall\nUm and what I found in my head of the house I live in now and in the basement area I'm a plot it and then I had some water that get got kind of close to the outside of the house and pushed in a little bit and it kind of breach the dry lot just a little bit and caused it to be yellow there was never any problem with motor mildew but I'll tell you what I did\nIs I just cleaned it again but just just detergent of actual I used a trust sodium phosphate is the SP acclaimed it really will let it dry ... just one more code on it because it already had the build up the ... there\nAnd those few little areas that were yellow I completely wiped it out probably been about six or seven years still looks great so I think that's really all that's necessary or just something got through they want to make sure nothing's pond in around the perimeter of the house\nYou know to make sure that it saves a way but that's really all I did I just recorded it and it worked great in on any of the other areas\nThat you might have some slight deterioration of of um\nYour basement wall it'll lock that and really nice to you need to coach when you're doing any of those particular areas that have not been previously shield before\nWell I have to screen all of that time new stuff off before I think\nYes it's a good idea to do that but you can use is again a good um stiffer brush and some of the tea SP that's available at any of the home centers and Home Depot and so forth and the pay now and that's really that's one of the best way to clean it\nOkay thank you\nPay our pleasure glad we can to help you with everything there and I'm ... and just let us know if we can help you any other way you have a great weekend I'll tell you what I use it to you know that that is one of those things a lot of times I'll tell people if you're having some trouble there put one code on and watch it any kind of ... pinpoint where some of the areas\nOf you know you might be having problems with and then you can coated again we're just getting started here on today\nSo I'm On a radio fan I'm already having a lot of fun and I hope you are as

circulates through a filter is that a problem if I don't have a a and let's see is that a problem if I don't have a gas well\nYeah you know have a problem with the re circulating when it when did they just going to outlaw that and uh just just go in and and I don't know but anyway the fact the fact that you don't have a gas stove well that's good news but not great news because the fumes from just normal cooking\nInclude some pretty bad compounds that can be pretty dangerous to your health even\nIf they're created on an electric stove wells that elation becomes even more important if the showbiz gas because of the themes given off as the fuel burns the best defense is a range you'd that Vance all the way to the outside not just an addict\nBut if you have to use it to you have to really use it to be effective to make sure the fan is on any time to cook ...\nYou know ten minutes or so afterwards and it's a good idea to run the fan when you're cleaning to make sure those themes given off by any cleaning products also a scape your indoor air we talking about the indoor air quality all the time\nAnd uh this is a great example there and and certainly our friends that brand new tone can provide you a lot more information on cleaning up your air\nInside your house you can go to ... dot com or Newtown dot com to be able to pick up a little information I it just seems to be a bigger problem or the awareness of it is getting more and more um widespread with the consumers understand in that ... inside there can be pretty bad\nRight and that's why October's National Air quality month because you know we're moving indoors we're butting up the house were spending more time indoors and outside and\nYeah we're moving indoors we're butting up the house are spending more time indoors and outside\nAndme or um you know adding more and more insulation putting in better windows cooking all the cracks and that's all great to save energy but meanwhile what about their that's inside\nAll that moisture all the orders from cooking and ex hailing everything else that's you know the air is got to go somewhere so yeah nothing better than a really good vents in in the bathroom\nIn the kitchen and here's the key you have to use them faster I mean if you're not flipping them on not doing any good so uh yeah use them and make sure they invented outside and as David mentioned never met them in the attic he's leaving the house is leaving living space but not leaving the house right\n... hey here's another one from Maggie and listen to this this this town sandwich Massachusetts\nOh I Know sandwich that's out on the Cape ... sandwich Everytime we go out to northeast I Am out on the Cape cod eleven sandwich sent us right next to mash pie it rarely here we have a little ... sandwiches a\nMash peace and weight wow already been well let's see oh and this has nothing to do with sandwiches or turkey or um Swiss cheese or anything it's a hot day anyway recent remove all of our window screens but before storing them away for the winter\nI Would like to wash them first any tips on how to get them good and clean and ready for next spring thanks\nA thanks my husband and I love your show well thank you may hear we appreciate that if we can certainly provide you some great information here first of all if the screens are\nFairly small you can uh just use a about one of the inexpensive\nUm children swimming pools one of the little tiny kitty pool yeah a little kid he pulls little molded thing they're um they put so solution in there and so I'm a little bit\nThen struggled with a kind of assault bristle brush and then a blast off with the you know the spray of your water hose that makes it real easy especially when you're able to stack several of them and be able to get seven or eight of them in there at one time depending on if there would framer aluminum frame\nThat's a great way to soak it out but Joe I recall that uh you you came up with a great idea and and it's an idea that I have used a number of times um this is pretty simple solution to this involving what just for short two by fours\nA yeah oh you're talking about building yeah right is taking the two\nBy fours and then you put in that plastic rain little plastic around it that way you can build the frame\nTo see like if he can't get to keep all big enough for your ... if you have some that are more um vertical more a rectangular or we long gated\nAnd then to be able to build that and then I mean you can use it to before usually too busy ... whatever you want to make as deep as you want the plastic idol was water yeah nickels and dimes chair and then not caution you very much\nBut man oh man does that ever I mean you can ... you know blow them off with a water hose it's not going to make them as clean as as getting down into crevices of that screen and especially if you're a proactive homeowner like Maggie is here than uh than you really can make a big difference by doing that\nYeah they take forever the dry but the best that the trick is to tap 'em you know be careful with them but after you clean 'em and you can ... the best way to find the scrub them clean when they're sitting in the water there so people are it's just with a broom like a long handled boom you don't have to bend over any a sweet the back and forth flip it over sweet back and forth\nBut then tap it when you pull it out tap it to get rid of the acts as well because water has claimed to those screen they take forever to dry but the other simple solution I think I I shared awhile ago Danny as if they're not really dirty\nYou can only have to put them in water does use a household vacuum with um oh yeah that's right yeah and I use the upholstery brush you describe him scrub the frames and the screens obviously have to both sides and not get off most of the dust\nAnd then if you use is that like every two or three years you might only have to soak 'em and water once every four or five years so I'll say a trouble Newman storm\nI have mine up in the attic and I always put them in um big um trash bags or yeah or cardboard boxes 'cause you know there's just a dusty of just leave him say um but somebody does your options either use water don't use what I Would start with just a vacuum if those seem\n... if they come up clean then you know then you get a storm way dry as they are\nYeah that's a great proactive way of taking care of and a lot of areas of the country are doing just like Maggie doing that they know they you know it's getting colder in some areas of the country you know you're not going to be able to open those windows are very much a anymore to allow that fresh air to blow through so\nGo ahead and use it as an opportunity to remove the screens to keep them from being damage\nOr an certainly getting dirtier in that way it's nice and clean and ready to put them back on when spring rolls around and want to remind you of the day is what our hotline one eight hundred non for six\nForty four twenty and certainly want to encourage you to check us out on Facebook Twitter Instagram\nAnd ... and certainly you can download our podcast

you've you've written a book so you you know you're there you know ...\nFor all of this but I'm just a few things to consider first of all you can't lay the towel crooked it has to be level\nAnd so you when you have these situations you're looking for the the the the way that you can do it with least with it being a Middle East obvious that it is an level and of course if you could fix the countertop that's great what's best approach to this you think\nWell I'm seeing is email and he says that ... ten foot long and its slopes five sixty seven inch and you're right you don't want\nSome setting your tiles freshly subway tiles with all all those vertical all those words on the line being way outta level\nBut in my experience you're never going to see five sixty seven inch over ten feet you're just not going to see it I Would say set the pile right on the counter top and just follow it and make your cuts all the cuts that will be because otherwise you're going to be cutting tile and that can be noticeable in that first course\nAnd all the ... tiles that will be out of\nOut of level so to speak will be hidden up underneath the cabinet and he mentioned I just want to back up one thing where a\nTom mentioned setting the drought\nOn setting that the ... on the bottom you don't want to set put grout under that time with their town tile meets a counter top right silicon yeah because those two materials are gonna move separately so\nYou know wherever you have tile meeting something else you know another material um you what you might silicon go but I Would set it right on top of that first course right out you'll never noticed that being at a level over ten feet\nYeah that's probably the best way to go got to have a level evil always notice actual you'll feel like the floors cricket or something you don't want that but maybe it is very Tom ... is getting\nColder all over the country and we're going to talk with everybody Christ Nielsen from the carrier corporation
