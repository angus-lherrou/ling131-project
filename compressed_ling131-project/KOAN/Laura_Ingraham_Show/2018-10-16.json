very very that's why his book is titled why we fight I Divide\nThe good guys between there were three types of good guys those who fight those who helped the fighters and those who don't fight and don't help the fighters they're still good people but they're not they're not in the fight\nSo here's another example of people who were fighting and it's the people at the\nAt the Jaycee and that the Jaycee network that the folks at tax cuts work dot com they're fighters I I Know them very well they're terrific\nIf you go to tax cuts work dot com they'll make it easy for you to do your part coal

group either be a fighter or help the fighters but you got to do something so that brings me back to Sebastian Gorka whose book important\nBook just came out is why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies why did you win was no apologies\n[laughter] that's a ... the last two years with the previous eight is where we had a president\nBarack Obama who actually started his presidency with a global apology to all\nWho said that everything from quote unquote global warming to terrorism is somehow the fault of the United states so that'll change that twelve o'clock Johnny the twenty of last year and we have a president of the good lord who is proud of who we are and what we represent and is telling the world that we all back\nWith a good guys and if you want to be friends you can be your friends and if you threaten us we will deal with you in the requisite way\nAnd gotten a respect for it with all the left portrayal of him as a laughing stock the truth is he is widely respected\nAnd fit that well they have to go together\nYes but when when you have Beijing when you have to um when you have Moscow worrying that's a good thing the left doesn't understand that but that is a very very good thing\nAnd he has also ... this is I I'm not said this to my listeners yet 'cause this is very new in my own mind but he has done something else he has at least for the time being sent the message to the world that ... is not inevitable\nYes he is prepared to challenge thing is that nobody else would be prepared to do in the mainstream conservative movement but I mean just just one moment from from Saturday last Saturday\nWhen he had a cat the Kavanaugh family in in the White House and what did he do he stood up in front of the world\nAnd the clad the innocence of this man\nThat's the moral faulted shoot of Donald Trump\nHe doesn't care whether you agree with him he knows what's right such as recognizing Jerusalem as the title capital the Jewish state moving the embassy think about the fact that it's for twenty three years every American president than promised that every six months this is the absurdity every six months\nThe incumbent president have to sign a waiver to say sorry guys not now I mean this is what the Macintosh through\nWhen he stayed with Brett Kavanaugh I kept thinking\nOh they're even Republicans who would not have\nOh my gosh yes I mean [noise] and the way he handled it was so ... he was careful he was quiet and then when he saw all\nThe way this man had fought for his reputation justly\nAnd the way that good Americans not just you know hard call Reagan all but just the average Americans were incensed what did he do he stood up\nAnd he he highlighted the gaping flaws in full it's testimony at his rally and he forced the media to play that ten seconds to say it\nAgain and again and again I didn't think of it that way oh my gosh yeah because they refuse to cooperate and we want to thank God he falls that's right that's exactly right\nThe this this president I'll tell you another thing that the Kavanaugh hearing reveal to beat although I wasn't surprised this was not a revelation but the confirmation I should say more than anything else\nAnd this will really shocked a lot of people who loads of man I think he has a good heart Donald Trump yes\nI can attest to this is what drives the left and say and they will never believe it whether it's\nInviting the survivors the victims of the Parkland shooting to the west wing to talk to them or or whether it's holding the hand of that\nThat an African American grandmother whose son had been killed there this is who he is that and the shocking thing that I can tell you because I worked for him and I you know I write down the instances in and why we fight us the evidence of this\nHe he is compassionate to you as an American whether you voted for him or not he doesn't care he doesn't see skin color you don't see party affiliation if you're an American you deserve to be safe\nAnd you deserve to prosper and fat my friend it's never going to be internalized by the the hardcore left\nFinally a in why we fight\nBook and again it is up

have a stick or a citizenship check this flight we have one get your driver's license in our state\n... this is a manufactured crisis they did the same thing before the two thousand for a reelection governor Nathan Deal\nThey did the same thing before the presidential election of Donald Trump and they're doing the same thing now we had record turnout Donald Trump was elected in Georgia most but

hurdle for people to do but they can't blame me on their own canvassers can't fill out proper paperwork register someone to vote and that they used our own line system they never had any of this problem\nStart with so she's blaming me for a problem she created a and she's blaming me for following state law and that's why I think Georgia voters are a lot smarter than she gives them credit for they're going to see the smoke screen that's all they're doing this to dry out their base out but it's working in reverse cause the Republican base that conservative base\nAnd hard work and Georgia's
