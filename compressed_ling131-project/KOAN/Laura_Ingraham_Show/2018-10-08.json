Republicans\nHave ... are back or if you will\nStretch John McCain passed away Lindsey Graham which what Carl now Susan Collins is sort of obvious to me and I'm not putting John McCain down by any means I've just noticed there were ... Republican shit firewood ... a backbone\nOh that's very interesting ray you know I I don't know if that's right or not it John McCain actually had a endorsed a cabin up a prior to his death that I think if he had not a guy Neal if you if he'd been you know well and present than voting I I think he would have supported a cabin uh [noise]\nBut um the problem with McCain of course as he was always a big question mark you you never knew when he was gonna go rogue and abandoned his party I thought he was bigger than his party\nOr a ... and that and that can be dangerous so so after after running three or four times on a platform of abolishing Obamacare\nEvil or to keep it and and apparently he did that just out of spiked a because of his anger at a at President Trump\nSo he was a loose cannon uh in a lot of ways and I think over over his time in the Senate he became more and more of a loose cannon\nAnd uh I I think I think the the the person who with respect to his your theory might have the strongest basis is Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham was always the junior maverick er he was always a he was always John McCain's a white man and and um and uh with McCain are gone\nMaybe we'll find that Lindsey Graham ah won't be so prone to I'm asserting is a contrarian impulse as at precisely the worst moments or thanks for that call re if I if if you want to be hurt eight five five forty Laura is the number to call\nYou know I wrote a post on a power line on friday and and it was titled or where do we go from here and it's got a lot of attention and it was a link to an real clear politics and a lot of other places and has been read now by sixty five Seventy thousand people\nAnd and um as we have time here over the over the course of the program I'm going to I'm going to talk a little bit about about that post and about some of the things that I that I said there\nAnd um and in and where I think we're at what I think the landscape looks like a in the wake of a judge Kavanaugh's confirmation\nAnd lewd conduct the the abhorrent conduct that we saw from the Democratic\nParty over the last few months and then I think the the implications are significant that I think that this episode is going to be with us for a long time to come I started this post where do we go from here or by saying this\nBrett Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court tomorrow running to a close one of the most appalling episodes in American political history the Democrats shameful treatment of Robert Bork in Nineteen eighty seven has distorted our politics not just the politics of the Supreme Court\nFor the last Thirty years but the slander the Democratic party directed toward Kavanaugh were if anything even more disgraceful\nAnd I think that's I think that's right I paused there for a moment at the smears they directed against judge Bork were outrageous a Ted Kennedy of course leading the charge there but many Democrats participating\nBut at least they were they were a geared toward his judicial philosophy which they massively distorted than lied about but they but they did at least purport to relate to things you might do as a judge here we have the Democrats are trying to claim that Brett Kavanaugh total Boy Scout\nOr was involved in in gang rapes as a high school student is believable or the smears that the the slander as they they directed against ah against judge Kavanaugh\nSo I continued uh but the slander the Democratic party directed toward Kavanaugh were if anything even more disgraceful\nWe will feel the impact for many years to come and I laid out various areas in which I think I which I think that's true where I think we will be seeing that in fact we're going to go to a break and when we return we'll have\nMore about the Kavanaugh

professors among that list but I have not the slightest adopted a diamond that listed it will overwhelmingly you to the left and that's more comment I think on the state of affairs in the legal academy than it is state of affairs about Brett Kavanaugh's temperament yeah\nI think that's exactly right and I would add that I think the tide turn now Lindsey Graham obviously help too but I think the tide\nTurned in that in that follow up here and when when a cabin on cabinet came out a blazing you know and and strongly denouncing these I think ridiculous or accusations against him I think he needed to do that not to show people he she was sincere and I and I pocket that that's what happened\nI I absolutely agree with you I remember I sat and I I was riveted it with my colleagues watching all of this and\nWhatever you want to say about you know Christine Blasey Ford she was emotional during her testimony and came across as a reasonably compelling\nYou know person you may or may not think that she did but Kavanaugh had done something to her but clearly something had happened to this woman at some point in her life to cause her to be this emotional and I think that of Brett Kavanaugh had come out and said OK I'm here now asked me questions and I'll be happy to answer them\nHe would have been in deep trouble I think the fact that he came out\nExactly as strongly as she did and said you are now trying to destroy a reputation over a lifetime you are also by the way of trying to destroy the judiciary by casting doubt about its credibility in the integrity of people who served as judges and I'm not going to play along with this\nI I think that he he very much helped his his claws and had he come out and been had a flat aspect or he would he would have gone down to defeat in terms of you know his nomination\nWhich talking to Jon Malcolm of the Heritage Foundation jak let's look forward a little bit and talk about some of the things that I'm\nI'm the Democrats frankly are trying to do one one thing that they're doing is they're talking about the authority of the Supreme Court here are being undermined and and they're saying that uh decisions in which judge Kavanaugh participates or maybe don't need to be respected if they're close\nThey're talking about if they take the house which everyone seems to think they will I don't know but that's the prediction ah they'll they'll start impeachment proceedings against against judge Kavanaugh what what what do you make of all this [noise]\nWell I have several things to say I think it is terrible but they are in fact trying to tear down the integrity of the court by making Eighteen or that it's just another political branch of government the Supreme Court hasn't helped self in that regard because it has involved itself\nIn more and more social issues that frankly under the constitution ought to be left to people but you know ... that is what people are trying to do I I think singling out Brett Kavanaugh I you know I understand that people are are doing that but ... before the presidential election you had with Peter ...\nComing out and basically saying how awful she thought Donald Trump was and other than a few people grumbling when she actually came around to deciding cases over the last two terms involving meditation and called policies nobody was filing recusal motion to get her\nA to draw away and nobody expressed the kind of outrage towards her or some outrage but not nearly the level of outrage at your hearing beach west towards Brett Kavanaugh of who all after all only challenge the tactics of the senators on the Democratic side is Sherry\nA committee you know it keeps me is to some degree\nA political process I think that this will certainly let people know that are the stakes are high in terms of who they both or whether they vote in the mid term election I think if the Democrats do take control\nOf the house it is possible they might impeach but kept up and be very clear impeachment is just leveling the charges and it only requires a majority in the house of representatives\nAfter he would be impeached then it would move to the Senate justices said when the house impeach Bill Clinton and then there is a mini trial and it requires a two thirds vote in the Senate before somebody is actually thrown out of office\nAnd there was no way that would ever happen to Brett Kavanaugh so the Democrats might do this they might even filed charges against them if they take control of the house but there is no way that Brett Kavanaugh would be thrown off the bench\nNo that's right when we look at the at the crazed behavior not just of the Democratic senators but as the the Democrats who showed up to him as a mob in Washington DC and invaded senators' offices and then all of the things that they did attack Rand Paul the airport I may go on and on\nBut I asked myself why are they so crazed I mean it's really a kind of strange and I think at least part of the answer has to do with roe versus Wade I I I assume that that that at least part of their thinking is that there was with cameras confirmation there now potentially is a ... vote majority on the court\nTo um undo what what many of us continue to regard as one of the worst blunders in Supreme Court history what do you think about that do you think there's a serious chance of of roe v Wade actually being overturn\nLA step back I I certainly think that there are many on the left who are crazed and they had been craze uh ever since his election night when when you know Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton so\nI think you would get a large amount of this regardless roe versus Wade is certainly a touchstone a lightning rod if you will uh for folks are on the left have been predicting the demise\nOf roe versus Wade with every Republican nominee to the Supreme Court\nOr starting with Sandra Day O'Connor in Nineteen eighty one and that Susan Collins pointed out three people who voted to farm or wrote the opinion that we affirmed the basics of roe versus Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey we're Sandra Day O'Connor David Souter any at the Kennedy all Republican appointees\nI don't know of course what the what the current court or would do would roe versus Wade a chief justice Roberts tends to proceed very very cautiously only one current Supreme Court Justice Clarence

Bush\nTo were nominated by the two term president to follow him Bill Clinton right\nTo were nominated by two term president\nGeorge W. Bush to were nominated by two term president Brock Obama\nAnd now two were nominated had been nominated by Donald John Trump in two years\nIn two years more to come but right now the balance of the court if you look at presidential elections since Ronald Reagan starting with George W. Bush he gets one as a one term president than two term president gets to two term president gets to two term president gets to Donald Trump gets to\nA so ... and he's going to get more he may get to more he could get three more but if one of them as Clarence Thomas then that's not really the same thing um because you'd be replacing a solid rock rib conservative with hopefully another solid rock brick conservative\nBut when the lesson that they believe they've learned is that they weren't vicious and ruthless enough that they that they weren't mean enough that they didn't make it crazy enough they didn't dial it up to a hundred enough if that's the lesson that they've learned and it apparently is\nDone we can expect the city to burn now on friday Michael peers you know when we're wrapping up and preparing to leave on friday\nWe were talking about whether there would be riots in the city over the weekend and we were making a joke you know when the when they elected a new pope at the Vatican\nOr a that they take the ballots the votes the paper ballots and they toss them into a basically a wood burning fireplace\nAnd a and if the vote is no they haven't elected a new vote on black smoke comes out of the out of the chimney at the Vatican\nAnd and if they have elected a new pope than white smoke comes out and everybody out in St Peter's Square knows that that the election\nHas selected a new pope and they stand by for the announcement of who that will be a we were thinking on friday that we may know that Kavanaugh has been voted in when we see Siri a series of columns of black smoke rising from the downtown Washington area\nBecause the left as there and we know they're like burning things and looting and ... and attacking people\nBut again they uh they called off the violent dogs they're brown shirts they're black shirts\nTheir shock troops stormed the beer hall and beat people and mobs you know the antifa people and the and the whole rest of the the the lefty the violent left ... people were called off again we're we're down there on Saturday there were no anti for people at all why\nWell because the high command ordered them to stand down\nBecause they wanted to manage the media image that uh that people saw and I was there had this crazy topless guy Fox woman Elizabeth Warren was speaking when we were there and then Ed Markey the other dim wedded senator from Massachusetts was there speaking and we're having a good time making fun of them\nYes where you were a and a ... and again lots and lots of ... people are and and the total number of people what a hundred thousand two hundred three hundred thousand I'm fifty thousand twenty thousand\nTen five thousand no no more like Fifteen hundred and may be maxed out at two thousand and a lot of those where people like me who were not part of the left wing were really angry demonstration a lot of people were pro American\nAnd uh one of the ... smallest so I Know that they have the ability to call up bigger more violent protests and that the party does but they decided to dial it down because now the fight enters a new stage and make no mistake they're not done\nThey're planning on winning the house next month because you're not going to show up and vote and they're going to win the house and then they're going to impeach cabinet rich won't happen of course and that but they just they're going to spread the hate and a danger of people's lives\nBecause Hillary Clinton lost because she didn't go to Wisconsin and she's ... she's a horrible person\nShe's waking up this morning in a pool of dog vomit at home it's it's a different kind of on it every night for\nThe Washington Post on Saturday with a a ridiculous story about a sort of there after action reviews now the Democrats and the media but I repeat myself the media very upset I think this is probably got the strain the relationship between\nThe Democratic party and their activists a news media people\nBecause first of the media thought that they had won the election for the Democrat Party for Hillary Clinton undefeated Donald John Trump and they were shocked shocked I said to find that\nDonald Trump won they won the electoral college quite handily and other Democrats are very very upset about this\nAnd um and I mentioned on friday that they're not going to try to de legitimize the Supreme Court itself and they've
