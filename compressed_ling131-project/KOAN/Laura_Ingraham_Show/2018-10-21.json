out on the show I'm Glad you're with real is half our triple a plan records our telephone number online at ... dot com let me ask you a question about your investments that's a big subject these days with the recent market volatility so we've had over the past couple of weeks\nWhat is the rate of return your expecting from your portfolio on average per year\nOver the next ten years now I'm not suggesting you should be looking at what you're ready to return ought to be this year or what it is the past quarter or what it did yesterday or you know earlier in the week no I I mean\nWhat rate of return on average long term would you think is a reasonable expectation to receive\nWell here's a guideline for you that might be helpful the Ohio public employees' retirement system\nThis is the state of Ohio which manages money for the retirement of all of the employees who work for the state of Ohio they manage one hundred billion dollars on\nBehalf of tens of thousands probably hundreds of thousands of employees in the state of Ohio they project how much money they're going to earn on their investments were an annual basis and they have just lowered their assumed rate of return\nFrom seven point five percent just seven point two percent per year\nWas your gas was your expectation\nSpent per year so was your gas was your expectation when I ask you the question higher than seven point five I suspect that for a lot of folks the answer would have been yes we routinely come upon people\nWho tell us that they expect to earn eight percent a year ten percent a year twelve percent a year\nAnd I'm here to tell you that the average annual return of yes and the five hundred since Nineteen twenty six according to their butts and it's ten percent a year if you have a one hundred percent stock portfolio and you leave that money invested entirely in stocks for decades you might be able to get\nA ten percent return you might\nJust because that did that in the past doesn't mean that is what you're going to get in the future we'll know pest performances and guaranteed future results we all understand that right but the S. and P. five hundred US stock market has historically the best performing asset class no other investments do as well as us stocks not real estate not gold not bonds\nNot foreign security is not commodities not energy or natural resources nothing anywhere\nPerforms as well not artwork not rare coins not baseball cards nothing anywhere has as good a long term track record as the stock market and that\nIs ten percent a year and I'm willing to bet you don't have a hundred percent of your money in us stocks I'm On a bet you've diversified and you also alone bonds and you also on real estate and you also on bank accounts CDs\nBe forever changed a little moments\nExcitement trying\nTo mention the waiting\nTo see change when you need a\nCommon my Twenty one twenty when you're taking [noise]\nOn them back to the gentleman show I told you to a couple of my clients here elements financial or a little unhappy with me and I want to share with you why\nBecause there's a lot of really important financial planning lessons regarding us that could help you uh\nBack in September I said back in September last month\nIn my newsletter inside personal finance and we publish a among the newsletter sixteen pages it's one lots of awards are very proud of it I I wrote an article\nThat was called a choice to critical to leave to children\nAnd it was about how allowing your child to select the wrong college major can lead to future financial stress what I said in that article is that twenty four percent of recent college graduates who are fully employed so we're talking about recent college graduate have a job\nOne out of four of them are getting financial help from their parents which is astonishing to me parents are helping their kids pay their cell phone bills car insurance car payments\nUh and so my message and the article was you can't allow Eighteen year olds to choose college majors based on their whims I wrote you need to help them choose colleges in majors wisely pursuing degrees that will be marketable when they graduate and allow them to earn a comfortable living and I cited\nA study revealing that ten worst college majors for getting hired and here are six of them\nGeneral social scientists anthropology philosophy liberal arts English and fine arts\nWell that generated emails from two of our clients Judy wrote to me and she said wreck I majored in psychology\nAnd when I retired Eighteen years ago I was making two hundred and fifty thousand dollars and my daughter majored in art history and she ran an engineering firm before she retired\nThen I saw the obituary for Robert ... who is the chairman of the Federal Trade commission majored in English so how about serving your most financially successful clients to see what their undergraduate major was you might be surprised if there were many liberal arts majors\nThat was Judy jak also wrote and he wanted to voice their displeasure with the article to he was annoyed that the article made no mention of the other values of education regarding liberal arts and he felt that my article overvalued monetary gain in the educational pursuit\nWell I really do appreciate Judy's and Jack's comments and hey you may have similar feelings but you know what\nJudy's eighty for her daughter is sixty\nJak Seventy to the world was so totally different when they went to college Judy went to college sixty years ago back then a liberal arts degree was of great value not just individually but also to help securing an excellent career I she proved\nBut that's no longer the case today students spend a hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more\nThat's no longer the case today students spend a hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more plus six years on average to get a degree\nOf thirty students drop out in their freshman year even after they might have spent thirty thousand dollars or forty thousand dollars less than half of students graduate even after six years but they still walk away the student loans an average of thirty grand per student half of Americans today have student loan debt\nToday going to college is a huge financial commitment with enormous implications on the lives of the students so yeah sure I'm willing to bet that if we pull our clients is Judy suggests\nWho went to college Thirty years ago forty fifty sixty years ago yeah a liberal arts majors will in fact be revealed to have had successful careers but that's driving by looking through the rearview mirror\nThe fact that it worked in the Nineteen hundreds doesn't mean that those degrees are properly preparing students for the futures that they're going to have now look I'm a liberal arts graduate myself\nSo I Know the full value without education\nBut when I went to college in the Nineteen eighties I paid sixty eight bucks a month for housing tuition was twenty five hundred bucks a semester\nToday tuition room and board is routinely exceeding fifty thousand dollars and so yeah sociology psychology history poetry they're all very important but we've got to examine these majors for their economic viability due to their cost so yes get that knowledge\nBut we need to do it more cheaply get it on line through self study or other ways and we need to focus instead\nOn what college has unfortunately become a platform for career preparation\nThe U.S economy according to the apartment of labor now has seven million jobs available we only have six million\nUnemployed workers that doesn't make any sense first time this was ever happen according to the Labor Department how was it you've got six million people out of work but seven million jobs available there's only one reason for this\nBut people who are out of work are not trained for the jobs that are available that's the problem\nSo yeah I'm afraid that um the cause might be lost you know the notion of going to school for personal enrichment and development might be lost and I say that with limitation because I shared Judy's concerns and I share jacks concern\nBut as a financial planner my duty is to help our clients get their kids off to a good start in life without jeopardizing the parents owned retirement future\nAnd so I simply can't endorse the decision to let an Eighteen year old decided to major in a career\nAt a private out of State University that will cost two hundred thousand dollars over six years that isn't going to lead\nTo a job opportunity you know I'm Sorry when someone says to me that they're going to major in philosophy and my great you're going to go work for a philosophy company I mean it just it just doesn't seem to make any sense anymore higher ed is not what you and I fondly recall it to be it's a brave new world nowadays\nAnd so I've got no choice but to help our clients and their kids navigate it effectively I'm Sorry that that's the situation but I figure it's better to acknowledge it\nThan to ignore it and if you want any evidence of this just look at the announcement made this week\nBy the c._e._o. of bank of America he says that he has just finished cutting one hundred thousand jobs in less than a decade at the ... and he said quote it was all caused\nBy the ability to apply technology to processes and capabilities unquote\nHe says they're twenty six million of the banks customers that are using the mobile banking that\nTherefore they don't need any human interaction artificial intelligence and robotic process these have allowed the firm to cut out eighty four thousand work hours a year you only work two thousand hours a year they've just cut out eighty four thousand hours a year you do the math\nHe said the bank had too many managers about thirty thousand of them and so he fired a third of them over just the last couple of years is\nIt any wonder then according to Gallup only forty eight percent of the American public has a lot of confidence in higher education\nAnd this is why it's so important that we apply a proper lens and the question of will my child go to college and if so what will be that major and what institution will the child attend to get that degree\nBecause spending two hundred thousand dollars on the degree that doesn't provide the economic reward\nSetting your child up for failure not success think about it because your child's financial future depends on it [noise]\nSo if your child headed to college if you're struggling to figure out

sure how long you've heard about it because it has been around for ten years but a lot of folks are only just recently beginning to hear about it\nUh and the word block chain is beginning to enter the binoculars or an American a linguistics and still a lot of folks are confused about these and why am I mentioning them to you and so prominently here at the top of the hour\nIt's not because there's an investment opportunity or an investment decision that you should be making right now it's because\nThere might be one day and more importantly the fundamental fabric of the financial services sector is likely to be altered in profound ways the cause of this new technology called\nThe block chain and so my goal here is to continue our efforts at providing you with very important financial education\nBecause the more you know the better you're able to make financial decisions that matter to you and I'll explain a little bit about these two things but more importantly starting off with the two massive announcements that were just recently made the first one was from David Swenson\nThis guy is the rock star in the ... world David Swenson is the chief investment officer of yells in Dallas and fund its uh twenty nine billion dollar fund and David Swenson is widely considered one of the world's top money managers\nHis approached institutional investing has been outlined in a number of books he's written a terrific one of his own and he has largely reshaped the way that other endowment funds or manage so this guy is a huge thought leader in the endowment field\nAnd by extension is a leading a way for how a lot of folks ought to be managing their investments\nHe just announced that he is had yells endowment fund invest in two new venture funds dedicated to crypto currency is one of them as a three hundred million dollar crypto fund the other is a new bloc chain fund\nMillion dollar crypto fund the other is a new bloc chain fund so we've got just thinking about this for a minute to subjects you know very little about block chain and bitcoin\nDavid Swenson one of the most important investment managers in the world has just made big investments in both of those areas\nHere's the second announcement and it comes from fidelity\nFidelity is one of the five biggest financial services companies in the entire world fidelity manages more than seven trillion dollars in assets\nHi this is Jonathan Martin adhering to the company sellers if you're going to show your home now may very well be the best time\nTo current interest rates are still very low comparison previous low right now is the time to take advantage of the uncommon phenomenon we will look back at this period as a golden opportunities to buy or sell homeowners planning to self she'd call us had to for for his early to one\nWe will be happy to come out and do a comparative market analysis at your convenience called Jonathan Martin Harrington the company to Fort Fort zero eight to one that's two four four zero eight to one [noise]\nFrom the moment you realized you\nForever changed on the little moments\nExcitement trying\nTo clean [noise]\nTo speedy I think when you need on\nThe other day in my Twenty one Twenty one guy [noise]\n\nWelcome\nBack to the gentleman show we talked often about the need for Americans to prove there were times security clearly retirement accounts for when the plans and other employee overtime if plans are a key element of this Social Security plays\nAn important role as we talk often here on the program and to help us further the conversation I'm happy to welcome to the show Lynn doubly she's senior vice president of global retirement and compensation policies for the American benefits council Lynn thanks so much for joining us on the show today\nA plaid shirt thank you for having me\nSo at president four one K. planes around the country pretty much everything else for three D's for fifty seven ... savings plans for federal employees all these retirement plans in the workplace they they tend to be filled with mutual funds\nThat's pretty much the investment of choice of availability for millions of American workers and it's up to you as the worker to figure out how to invest in the plan\nBut that's where a lot of the attention and focus goes with the real key\nIs when you're in retirement how do you withdraw the money out\nHow do you generate income that's not only going to meet your needs today but income that will last an entire lifetime\nAnd and so it kind of makes sense doesn't it to offer lifetime income opportunities so talk about that Lynn\nWell that's an area that policymakers happy and to get their arms around for a long time the focus had been on accumulating assets\nAnd I think it has the focus has shifted part of that because so many people are close to retirement lifetime income options as a form of distribution as a way of receiving your money\nSuch as a monthly income over the rest of your life has not been a common distribution option that was included in four O. one K. plants\nAnd so I think what is happening now is to figure out how would a house to have that kind of option in their plans\nIn my experience as a financial advisor most of the training that advisors get is on helping clients put money in\nOne of the contribution limits what are the investment options how do you build a portfolio is relatively little training on how do you take the money out and how do you do so in a manner that well not only mean declines needs today but enabled him to sustain that need over the course of the entire lifetime\nAnd even more to a point it's not just about retirement income it's really about overall financial wellbeing and so I Know that the American benefits counsel was really focused on that broader more holistic notion of well being so Lynn share with us with that's all about\nThat is an area of uh extreme importance to plan sponsored many of them have adopted these very broad financial wellbeing programs that covered that can that of\nHow much do you save what our barriers that are keeping you from say an because many people do have barriers to saving such a student loans or\nA lack of emergency fines or just not great management skills not not a lot of budgeting management skills and then they want to help people understand\nA lot of budgeting management skills and then they want to help people understand what the different investment options are how to how to manage your money as your career progressed and and then how to manage your money in retirement including\nNot only how to make your money laugh\nBut you need there there are other things that you need to consider as well things like what will the cost of healthcare be\nA how will I manage a where I live uh how will I manage a you know the allocation of my money\nTo uh investments versus income because even in retirement you're still going to want to be earning some money on the amount of money that is invested so these are all things that you have to think about\nWhat percentage of employers are engaging in these kinds of programs or for their employees\nSo when you talk about the very large companies the fortune one hundred even the fortune five hundred it's growing exponentially so a very large the larger the company the more likely they are to have these programs\nOne of the problems of course is that most of America is employed by small companies small businesses\nYeah that's exactly right so one of the challenges for policymakers is how to help small employers do the same thing\nWhat advice would you give listeners if their employer isn't providing a wellness program for them well\nThe first thing you you want to do is ask them if not the company offers some educational information I'm also I think asking yourself how are you planning to pay for health care and retirement\nAnd the other thing I Would tell people is that you should look at how much Social Security will pay you\nPay attention to Social Security\nI think that a lot of folks are over estimating how much money they're likely to get from Social Security especially higher income Americans because there was a max that Social Security will provide the average check\nAs you know limits about Thirteen hundred dollars a month for Social Security retirees and of course the Social Security system is under threat right now because the trust fund is being depleted\nAnd that's why the American benefits council has joined the funding our future coalition talk about what your aspirations are and why you decided to have the American benefits council joined the coalition\nThe funding our future is in really incredibly important initiative across the country it's it's important for multiple reasons why it raises the profile of the issue to to your listeners into the public so that the public is aware that they need to be thinking about these things\nWhile they're working not thinking about them at the end\nThough if you are close to retirement you should start thinking about them or even in retirement be you know think about them now so part of it is that part of it is also to create a momentum\nSo that we as a country can engage on a ... in a discussion about\nA policy that uh you know as a country wide in a society wide policy of how we can help people in retirement and how we can address the gaps in retirement and work with policymakers to come up with\nVery pragmatic practical solutions that work\nUm for people and for the employers that are providing the plans\nSo I'm really glad you were able to spend the time with us on the program Lynn thank you so much for doing this I really appreciate it oh you're very welcome\nThat's when doubly the senior vice president of global retirement and compensation policy at the American benefits council and a member of the funding our future coalition you can learn more about it at funding\nOur future dock us elements we're here to help you triple the plan wrecked which Tripoli seven five to six to seven forty two you're on the radio shows her boys playing on line at rice don't [noise]\n\n\nThat we won't be as serious about money coming up on the radio show\nYou're thinking about retirement Social Security pension investments will you have enough income to enjoy yourself\nAnd your income last for the rest of your life\nHi I'm Rick Edelman now you can find out if your savings and investments can generate the retirement income you need the income you expect for your entire retirement and you can find out for free without free retirement review\nYes you can get a free retirement review from one of the experience financial planners ... Edelman financial you'll get written projections showing if your savings and investments can produce their retirement income you'll need for as long as you need it\nShe where you stand at no risk or cost\nVisit Edelman financial dot com slash review that Edelman financial dot com slash review or call triple a plane wreck that's triple late planned Rick\nAt UT amazing account it simply says you're going to set the money aside for your daughter and uh the problem with it\nIs number one you're going to pay taxes on that camera manual basis and number two when the child reaches the age of majority you have to turn the money over to the child and instead of using the money for college she might use the money to buy a Corvette\nSo or for that reason especially since you're targeting this for college we button instead recommend a five twenty nine college savings plans which are available and all states all around the country and in this way you are on the account not your daughter your daughters the beneficiary of the account\nBut you control it you determine how the money's invested you decide when the money is withdrawn for college and if you indeed use the money for college\nThan the withdrawals are completely tax rate no taxes at all it's fabulous and that's why the five twenty nine plan is the preferred way to save for college because you can use the money to any college in the country for any college expenses tuition room board books pretty much everything except travel\nOr if you don't use the money for college them withdrawals will be subject to taxes and ten percent penalty but you could always transfer the money to another child if you've ever have another one or two cousins up your daughter you could even leaving the money there for your daughter's children in another Thirty years so\nLots of fabulous flexibility associated with the facts on planes so that's what we recommend is a five twenty nine plan targeted for your daughter but I Want to emphasize one other very important point that might have slipped\nPast us without focus remember I said that in any Fifteen or twenty year time period stocks have never lost money on that basis you can go ahead and put a hundred percent of the money into stocks right now\nRight mhm but\nWhen your daughter is twelve\nShe's no longer going to have necessarily Fifteen Years before she uses the money\nWhich means as she ages we're going to want to ramp down\nThe allocation of stocks because the culture she got to college the last time the money will remain invested and the greater the risk of the stock market crash\nUndoing all of the good effort we've tried for all those years so a one hundred percent stock allocation makes sense now but it doesn't make sense when she's Fifteen\nOr Eighteen that makes sense yes so we want to create something called a glide path picture of the airplane you know with traveling at forty thousand feet but not when it gets near the airport\nAs it approaches the airport it alters that glide path and as it gets closer it gets lower and lower so that by the time it reaches the airport it's really close to the ground same thing with your daughter as she gets closer to using the money\nWe have less and less of the money in stock so that by the time she's sixteen if you're going to use the money at age Eighteen she'll have virtually none of the money in stocks because we're so close to using the cash does that make sense\nThat does is this something that we could do within the five twenty nine\nYes yes you can and there are two ways to do it one is to choose your own asset allocation and you control how much of it as in stocks you put a hundred percent stocks today but as she ages you declined that hundred percent on that Ninety eighty Seventy sixty forty et cetera overtime as she approaches the use of the money or\nBecause that's a nuisance that's a chore that's difficult a lot of parents don't know how to do it\nMany five twenty nine plans off or what are called target date funds where they'll do it for you and the target date fund you choose a fund that is targeted for when you think your daughter will use the money so you would choose for example a twenty year target date fund\nBy choosing a target date fund they will create the glide path\nFor you they will alter the allocation as your daughter ages automatically without you having a fuss of\nUndisturbed\nSo either do it yourself or let them do it for you but either way do that excellent I appreciate it thank you\nIt's my pleasure I'm Glad you called and I'm really excited at your daughter's getting off the such a great start in life and are you guys keep that up and a boy oh boy oh boy will she be able to take care of you for your time\nThat's the black and

good credit in his own name we have a year to try and help them out and I was just wondering what I could do to help him in that process thanks wreck\nWalk regulations to your son the best wishes to his bride the number one thing to do is to go get a loan the easiest is a credit card or in his name only and she used the credit card and to make the payment but here's the weird thing don't make a hundred percent repayment\nEvery month because that means you're not paying any interest on the loan you want to borrow money and show that you are able to repay the money over time so\nFor a couple of months just make the regular minimum payment make sure the payment is made on time no late\nAnd know bounced checks and then after several months repay them full build up credit record demonstrate you have the capability of borrowing money\nSo that you can prove that your honorable and you will repay on time schedule go to a bank and get a personal alone in his name only not cosign with your dad but in his name only get a thousand dollar alone at the bank\nAnd ah for one year and then make the payments every month as scheduled and by doing this go buy a car and so by making the loan

talk to re in North Dakota ray you're on the end of the ... what can we do for you\nHey my question is enough out of their call what I Would like to have access to his website where you can check the F goes out before you purchase the frozen car is is that just say\nWell there's actually quite a few of them are you know one of the more trusted ones over the years was Consumer Reports they have got you know they they\nI get suspicious anymore and everything but they claim to be fairly independent ... and you always got to look to see was funding what in what angle they might lead but they have proven over the years to be quite independent on their tests and they've also archived a lot of their tests that they've done over the years\nThat you could go back to uh they test about everything car and driver motor trend wrote in track\nThey uh they liked to have more of the specialty vehicles first but at some point they do get into a test of of common cars I and I say kind of just the more normal stuff\nAnd those you have to be a little aware of because they might score something higher or lower based on something that they think it's important that has no\nBut ... and they will do long term tests where they put the cars into their fleet and they drive him\nA Consumer Reports does a similar thing there are but as far as a Web site are you thinking where you'd look and see okay this cars at this many problems reported um that sort of a thing I guess what makes sure what am I looking for\nYeah that is correct so it'd be kind of a forum were\n[noise] oh boy that that's it I got to think about that for a second I think a lot of uh you know there's Consumer Reports\nAnd they used to have a a I Believe they had a Consumer Reports reported by actual drivers type thing\nThey did that with a fuel economy sites ... go for a while it said here's what the government sticker or you know manufacture sticker set on the window and here's what drivers actually report and they get you know twenty people that said well I got sixteen miles per gallon average\nOr out of all of them and the manufacturers that have got an Eighteen or got fourteen so sometimes it's better sometimes is\nWhen you when you talk about the well this is always a a slippery slope because if you put in\nUm any company any type of car anything and you say rant and rave about this or whatever might have to be or I mean there's a website dedicated people cramping about stuff right and guess what people do they're they come and crab about stuff that to me it's not an indication of what really happens with that\nThing or that car or that company or you got to be able to dissect that data and look for some common themes up because I'll tell you that people\nThat have vehicles can have a bad experience with any vehicle based on their used or their care right and it really can so I mean it would be hard to make the results be consistent because none of the problems are happening under the same\nThe same circumstances if you know if you have a certain type of engine if they fail quicker under poor maintenance than if you did good maintenance where it would last much longer\nAnd people rarely go out and how how well something works occasionally you'll see something on a on a former website but it's\nIt's rare in this kind of it's very dangerous but I got to say it that based on the\nType of car and the demographic of the consumer that it would end up in the type of comic could be different\nI totally agree yeah the experience factor um you know certain demographics might have more experience with automobiles than others and they could give you a completely different reports that a first time car buyer or depends on the you know a but there's just\nThere's gotta be careful absolutely to answer your question re asked there are thousands of them and that's the tough part [laughter] thanks very much for the call good luck eight six six five nine for for one five
