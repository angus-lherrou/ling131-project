about um the light from the get go and um\nI think what's most eloquent here is the treatment that this guy from from ... he said well this person asked for confidentiality um\nThis could have been investigated by the FBI honoring all requests for confidentiality from the outset if that's what they wanted and um I think everything has to be judged in light of that\nWanted it to me it seemed very obvious or from the very beginning when they were interrupting the hearing and screaming and sending the protesters in and rotating protesters coming into the airing screaming at him that this was going to be a farce and\nSo it didn't really surprise me given the fact that the less believes the Supreme Court just another\nA super legislature and it's not really a court it's more of a social policy making body to the left and for them it's all abortion and and various social issues and Kevin ... even though he's a Bush guy or doesn't matter and he's a fifth vote and so by any means necessary judge\n[noise] well um I suppose we could have an interesting conversation about how it came to be that who are gets appointed came to be so important that is one judge has started um are putting their own gloss on what are actually fairly\nLimited a statement from the constitution that happened a long time ago when when when when when justice Douglas found a right to privacy in what he called him a nation's from a number of surrounding the other amendments\nI'm quite clear that some people on the court for the ... that they could make it up as they went along and so then I guess it very much matters who whose head is popping out for money for black great [noise]\nWell judge there was a a woman or I'd never heard of but she was on MSNBC over the weekend who\nIdentifies herself as a Watergate prosecutor just Jill Jill wind banks I literally have never heard of her but\nAnd then so be it neither now so she she she know\nExpress something that I began ... you're you're beginning to here of course on college camps even her hearing it for years but it's actually entered the mainstream namely the race of Brett Kavanaugh has come into play let's listen\nThere is a white male privilege ravens here\nWhich is I'm entitled to this I did the hard work in high school and college and I deserve this was the end of that is not the case no one is titled to be on the Supreme Court and no one who is behaved in high school and in college at his alleged to do and no one who performed the way who did it on Thursday\nDeserves to be given an judge\nYour reaction to that judge\nUm it's [laughter] it's a parody of itself um this got nothing to do with race I'm like I Can't understand how that gets dragged into it um and the notion that somehow how one\nAppears to be or appeared to be um in high school um determines what one can do in life is I think particularly\nI mean this this is now the new standard apparently but not for liberals conservatives Republicans won't do this to the other side the weird conservative supporting Sotomayor and Kagan you\nYou're not going to have it play the other way but for Democrats your high school I don't know why why high school and I go back to sixth grade I mean why is this high school the limit here but it it it all reflects on your your character and I\nFind it interesting because they're always about you know letting these you know useful indiscretions\nPass and they're all about well everyone should have redemption and but not for this if you're a conservative you can never be redeemed never\nRight or you have to do is is is have somebody claim that just stepped over the line once and that's it [noise]\nSo now they're actually they have some people on the record saying well\nWe saw him at Yale we saw him a ... a drunk and he got belligerent a few times and so he doesn't have the temperament so the new question judges as a former federal judge yourself the idea of temperament because he was fairly aggressive and responding to the questions on Capitol Hill a last\nWeek that he doesn't have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court after having written two hundred decisions on the DC circuit he doesn't the temperament\nThat's that's a great I'm no when proposition um if he gets upset um having been accused of um a sexual assault than he doesn't have the temperament if he doesn't get upset that he's guilty so it's you know it's if you he loses either way\nRight well how do you think this ultimately plays out I mean that ... Democrats are of course are complaining that there's not enough I guess they interviewed that Deborah Ramirez over the weekend a hopped on that fast right or the president said FBI can has free rein that's the phrase he gave free rein a\nWell free rein to do presumably what\nThe Senate requested um the Senate requested um a limited extension of the background check and background checks are\nAre not about you know we're not about criminal not criminal investigations and then I ... ... counter intelligence list to get their background investigations and they interview witnesses lay out what they say and presented to the Senate which ultimately makes the decision to send it to not the president\nYou know the um I don't know if you saw the Jim Comey decided he needed to weigh in on\nOn all of this so are you there yeah he's weighing in on Kavanaugh saying that he's\nSo are you there yeah he's weighing in on Kavanaugh saying that he's\nYeah he's loaded up the the the expectations are by talking about the capabilities of the FBI without discussing water background investigation\nYeah well again if\nIf high school and college drinking is now is now from the free love generation this is this is a this is now what we're going to be judged on I just I don't know who want\nWant these you know these nominations I mean I don't know a lot of people frankly you didn't have something to drink in high school or college a few but not many and we all do stupid stuff and not you judge because you're just a\nOh heaven for fan right yeah no nothing nothing stupid\nNothing stupid at all because you're you're you're UK is all about the rest of us\nKnow um [noise] if there's anybody who um would be willing to have every day of of his you've um penned up on a wall and examined then that person I don't think has led to a life of that would give them any kind of experience worthy of being a judge\nOr the other issue I just wanted to quickly weighing on this um\n[noise] the American bar association a supposedly it was it was of course it was improperly reported early on uh that the a BA had withdrawn its recommendation that a judge Kavanaugh was you know highly qualified to be on the court and turns out it was\nThe president of the of the ADA pick up a pen and and his letterhead a and wrote something he wasn't authorized to write um he's not the committee and um it was simply another reflection of the fact that the ... is is is generally left wing organization has been for years\nNow and he was a big supporter of Hillary Clinton uh and so you know again\nInitial reports all over cable on friday when I was on the panel on Fox in the morning on friday and it was a BA withdraws and again headline readers and written reporters don't do their work the ... oh this is ...

it's\nNot the world was thirty forty years ago company should want to pick the best people in California no you're mandated to have a certain number of women now so going back to my point to defend
