life I Would they would get confused blind liberal and I am no longer but\nI doubt that every ...\nSorry [laughter] when when when you you just answered the gentleman about how long ... how old the earth is yeah my job just drop it okay\nBecause I I think it's pretty simple than if you believe that God created out I'm correct right wedding when they're when Adam was six months old but he looked like a six month old baby\nYeah you think he did\nBut I don't know if God made a six month old baby when he made that um I don't I I don't know what what age Adam was made out of Adam ... is unique so I don't I don't have an answer the Bible doesn't give an answer well how old are you know he made you go on\nHe said he he said he made a man though he didn't make a baby\nOkay fine so he made a man or what one of the day after day ... why why did you drop drop\nWhy did why why did your jaw drop\nCall because I my my assumption is that Adam was made as a man so therefore God can make things that knew that are already old\nBike yes you can call I got to do anything so why did your jaw drop\nAll because I think that if you like he doesn't you know when they called me for me was saying that if the if you look at the the history of how you know genesis genealogy and all that\nThere are no no it's not an issue on the age of the earth is not based on genesis genealogy it's based on believing up to six days of creation were six twenty four hour days Adam isn't created till the end of the six day\nThat's ... ... so you can only believe that the earth is a few thousand years old if you take literally that each of the creation days is twenty four hours but the sun has not created for days how can you have a day without the sun also the word Yom in Hebrew\nWhich is the word for a day is used in so many context for example genesis to five it says this is the creation of the world in the day that God created the heavens near\nSo clearly day doesn't mean one day also got calls light and dark night so God himself uses the term Yom\nIn in a different way than the twenty four hour a day so there's there's just no listen I don't have an argument I said that to the earlier caller I Believe it's billions of years old but if somebody says it's a few thousand years old they they don't bother me\nThey they don't hurt the society for that belief they still give their kids to a polio shots and measles shots theyre not anti science\nSo uh that's that's I I don't it's not an argument is that I feel is critical I Believe I Believe that the first five books or indeed divide and that God is in the rest of the Bible\nBut I don't believe that it is it is a a battle worth fighting over the literal ... of the days of the six days of creation\nAnd uh I title my working on the Bible the rational Bible and I try to be true to the title reason tells me that it's billions of years old\nIt is not one ... less a miracle if God created the universe in six days or in six billion years what what is the difference\nAnd by the way the Bible itself says in ... a day in God's a ... a day in God's eyes just like three thousand is like a thousand years\nOkay thank you my friend I really

confirmation battle when he he saw that Kavanaugh I think was getting a little too he was besieged and the questions and Kevin I was\nThink he was getting real hot okay and\nI think Lindsey Graham decided you know something to heck with this I'm I'm going to take the floor and I'm going to reset this debate about the cabin are confirmation he did that I think it was after the president's press conference\nWith the president came out an hour and a half and he was just fantastic and his support of Kavanaugh\nAnd with whether what what the reporters how we dealt with the reporters he was having a good time but he said yeah I'm not doing this anymore I'm not I'm not playing defense anymore\nAnd the Republicans have got to stop playing defense Trump won by being on the off and he's not in perpetual apology mode because he said he sent a sharp tweet about someone\nHe kept moving forward he didn't look back he's not going to do well over mistakes we all need to do that any look forward to keep moving the ball down the field that's what Trump has taught us as Republicans\nAnd guess what a lot of Republicans are now seeing it he's transforming this political party and it was in a moment too soon I really appreciate your comments Rob we have a great team on the anger mango we're going to take a break Kellyanne Conway up next\n\n\n\nThis is Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new Jenny so sunspot correct her she says she loves that it should go to product every day she has sunspots an age spots I can see a definite difference in her skin since using

rejuvenate and uncalled pours for radiant baby soft skin order now in shipping is also free\nA pressuring her to change her story which is a fancy word is saying asking her to lie\nWell it's also a crime yes I'll for a\nLot of that can be looked at after this who who leaked for his identity will kind of emails were going back and forth why Dianne Feinstein recommended these a democratic activist\nLawyers to Ford why they never told her she can testify in private and keep her ... her face in her name out of the press as much as she could she could just do it in California they go to them that something is Senator Lindsey Graham told me right away he said she can do it by phone we can send somebody out there but no no no they needed a clean slate and the cameras\nOn for them and I guess there next client base so it it's just been awful but America has been watching and I don't the after he's confirmed and hopefully he will be I won't get ahead of the way certain senators are grappling with their vote\nDecided to vote Lara but um if judge Kavanaugh is confirmed as a justice of the United States Supreme court this will not end there they think it won't end because it's still be shouting at men they've never met for things these men have never done to them personally and individually\nBut other folks won't forget how people behaved how they were her raining folks drive drumming them out of restaurants publishing their their kids' names in their personal home addresses\nThat that's not that's not the first amendment that's just crazy that's going to be crazy\nYou know do you think that in part I mean are are you argue this last week uh when the president came out of the press conference which I think was one of his best press conferences last week of incredible and you could have gone for three hours\nOr that he taught a a really needed lesson much needed lesson to Republicans on how to fight\nFor what you believe in a fight for principle fight for a person instead of being back on your heels cowering in an elevator the the the reason Trump got elected as because he wasn't gonna take that any more he wasn't going to just keep getting pummeled and beyond perpetual a perpetual apology tour for either him sell for America and\nHe he's not they called him ... I think the bullies are the people who are swarming individuals' in public or the Senate or restaurants and and screaming at them within a centimeter of their skin but I think Trump's taught the Republicans a lot throughout this whole thing\nIn a large shocked me just last night after I was on your TV show and thanks for having me or that the way everybody describes Donald Trump President Trump is exactly that they're behaving and when I don't see from him he's\nFuming he's throwing things at the TV he's angry he's a bully it's exactly who they've become he's not that way how they're welcome yeah these unbelievable job\nNumbers in and bringing peace across the world and bring it make us prosper it a ... at home if he's sitting there fuming all day they they own the acrimony they own different to produce vicious wave via way they've gone after people um\nAccording to one gender according to one's politics and you're so right he doesn't retreat and back down when he believes in a principal\nOr a principal in this case PAL Brett Kavanaugh and they didn't know each other before this they didn't know each other well at all but the President Saleh judge Kavanaugh somebody who sat\nWho is sitting on the DC circuit second highest court in the land over three hundred dishes judicial opinions that none of these Democrats even try to pick apart I respect them far more Lars they said you know\nWe have a problem with the five following opinions that he wrote and these particular passages we think he went outside the contours of the constitution the law there's no such are no doubt on about about they're talking about a passage from your book you can sit in a post it note versus three hundred judicial opinions the answers to twelve hundred written questions\nOver one million documents you need a Mack truck the hall around all this stuff he's produced and you need a post it\nTo talk about a passage in your book so this just strikes a lot of Americans even apolitical Americans Laura as illogical and beyond commonsense I respect them more if they said we're angry lost the election two years ago and that President Trump is reshaping the federal judiciary was constitutional less than all this nonsense\nWe're gonna later on in the show can have a discussion about\nWhat these currents ominous are doing to poison the relationship between men and women and specifically the ah this idea that if you're if you're an accuser\nYou must be heard and you must be believed in if you're not believe then you're anti woman or you're anti victim or in\nThe justice Thomas's talked about this a lot you know the ... we all have to stop identifying or so as victims of this or victims of that because I they that's not going to help you advance with a person of being able to overcome\nIt doesn't and that every every man as a perpetrator every man has to shoulder the burden of the me too movement every man is a rape is every man is a sexual harassed or by virtue of their gender and then every woman is a victim um even those who many who are that have been victims of\nSexual misconduct or worse don't necessarily consider themselves victims overall and that's being lost in the den here as well I mean if you if you asked\nIf you do one of those are asking everybody who's out there with the masking tape on their mouths and the signs are holding up why are they there what this what is this about\n... ... if you're going to get answers that I really have nothing to do with his confirmation and really nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh that the Democrats used at Ford because they they breed shirt anonymity they revealed her identity to their world they sat on this for six weeks\nAnd then they set her up with attorneys who never even ... even the of telling her what her rights were what she could do and they're using Kavanaugh and his shoulders should not be\nShould not be shouldering the entire me to live in by the way large ding ding ding happy anniversary one year anniversary the me too movement but you know who started it not Brett Kavanaugh Harvey Weinstein yeah ... year ago today it was Harvey winds dean major democratic donor you're not going to find him in a picture of Brett Kavanaugh you're gonna find it in pictures with Hillary Clinton\nAnd a lot of a lot of a powerful now powerful female actresses in Hollywood who look to the other way long after they were just starting out long after they were very powerful and very wealthy but\nLet's remember how who got this all started let's remember he's facing criminal charges he's facing criminal charges and doesn't mean the the women describe and kind of not something thirty six years ... years ago and still uncorroborated\nThis was a a moment yesterday on MSNBC or network that I literally don't even watch anymore\nAnd they are on MSNBC a network that I literally don't even watch anymore because it's so it's not even interesting so predictable but this was Mika Brzezinski are reacting to uh your comment that Dr Ford look she was not treated badly she was treated like a fabric egg let's listen to make a\nWhy can't you be the egg Kellyanne the fabric egg and tell your story because he say women should be heard you talk to both sides of your mouth you say that women should be heard their stories are believable are credible and understanding a compelling well let's hear yours\nThat's very convenient to drop that but I Want to know your story I Want to know what happened you should have justice ... shouldn't hold on I'm not done well I Know you're ... you know K. you can't just throw that out as a political dagger to protect this reprehensible predator of a president\nYour reaction to that\nWho I have no reaction to that ... I think that many people generally has made my point for me that people are judged women are judged by of what their grief or their harm\nOr their recourse or their quote victimhood based on their politics and I think many people are making the point for me but I don't dignify many things out there\nAre because they're they're wholly irrelevant and I will tell you a lot of blowback yesterday a lot of pushback and a lot of low back\nOn and I'll I'll have my say about that at some other time but at the moment I think it's completely irrelevant given how how high the stakes are Laura or to get justice Kavanaugh confirmed and as an associate justice in United States Supreme Court but it won't be bullied and won't be bullied either\nAnd I I won't be bullied um and I I'll have my say I'm not going to say much else right now that that I find it to be on basically are relevant and when I talked about the fabric drag which by the way is trending on social media I Love I Love and forming generations that\nOf a new term that may not know it uh but when I was talking about that I was talking about the process\nIf you look at the entire cut that's me talking about how right well I have a right where it was a\nComedy I write of course I Am so she was\nTalking to I was talking to NBC reporters two of them are shouting at me\nAnd I looked at the one the male reporter\nUh Pete Alexander and I said do you ask her operation you know where she you know how she got there do you now she got home do you have you found anybody and he's you know swallowing hard and then asking that question and Christian Walker was shouting questions and I said she's been treated like average egg meaning the process\nSheet you you could do it privately in California it's her attorneys who didn't allow her that courtesy and that decency you can do it I'm not on camera you can do it\nOn your list and you don't have to explain you weren't as you said you wonder if there are ... by the way and I wasn't\nYesterday I wasn't yesterday but I'm not going to be bullied a particularly by particularly by that person\nNo but the funny thing is killing it and I'm just I I just to this stuff up for people because otherwise I just want to repeat\nIt because then of it was just a very funny day I\nKnow but it's funny you should go to the funny thing is that you got to log in\nYeah that I Know many

it or has it turned out the way you wanted it to have you enjoyed the experience that you're having\nVery much that we have five children are all good we've got a phone by forty okay which which it out or our house by house by uh-huh it was just a shell if anybody's ever seen the building we put in\nCeilings ... floors to track\nDown at all and we are so pleased with that except one okay we live in South [laughter] mhm yeah very warm months out of here we have a\nLittle background here we have a window unit wanting at the Aspen right ceiling fan and all that and the house we like I said this is our bedroom and we have that one day\nOur floors are starting to read [noise] by recall it looks almost like a wave\n[noise] by where it all looks out much like a wave\nHearts lately I see the pictures here now I Know I Know the actors that you're saying witches are always very helpful in a book that that does seem I'm ... now what I'm looking at us see is if it's the same there that there's a where you but it it up to to another piece of plywood right\nYes sir how cable it wisely quarter and which I now my ... but it's why we liked [laughter] quarter and hard or cry and we've got a very good brand earlier and saying\nGet for ... for a week they were and accurately dry never wet like come down and I noticed that picture sweat it seems are perhaps it's happening in other parts around as well\nNow when you put the quarter inch by one day and you put it over another type of material um plywood or some some other type of plywood that was your sub floor and you put this down basically as you're finished for correct\nOkay did you glue it down or just um nail it screw it how did you attach you nailed it\nOkay All right [noise] well I'll tell you it it it's it it appears for some reason that the veneer of that plywood is um is rippling I'm Joe I no water causes that but do you think it could possibly just happen over time\nYeah Sharon that's one of the question as I was gonna ask looking at these photographs couldn't quite tell or these ripples blisters or bubbles that are in the near the top ... near the plywood or do you think they're just in the finish DePaul your thing since because they do look like they're blisters\nThey are not just in the air I understand what you mean that would be much to flaky what now is just ... thank\nYou yeah I Would just be a if it was if it was it the ... blistering if the veneer do would be lemonade or pool free from the core of the plywood it would blister up like I'd like air underneath 'em\nBut these look like ripples almost a light in vertical lines but I wasn't sure if there was just in the ... if it's just in the finished you know that would be an easy repair you could send it you know very lightly and\nLooked like just a scan right looks like just the skin of plywood this lifting up just a little bit and um if that's the case I'm asking you probably still have a little bit of the stain laugh that you had before\nWe do yeah I'm gonna let me try this little monkey\nRanch on Iran uh-huh I understand what you mean by lifting uh-huh I'm not the most tactical partially I learned a lot you know in this house that um when you walk across that Mary and feel like there's an air pocket uh-huh that's probably what kinds\nLate tonight now Sharon but one thing I probably would have recommended back priming the plywood what you meant painting or running and doing some of the underside prevent moisture for coming through that might be part of the problem\nHere in ... in a course of course glue helps a lot to you know in that same thing but as it is right now um I think the best thing for you to do is to be able to re nail in any of these areas that may feel like it has some pockets under it than scraping any of the loose material off\nThen maybe a little bit of Sandy narrow along there and then put you're saying you know re stain it and then you're able to polyurethane it back over just in that one small area and I should be in pretty good shape\nOkay monkey ranch and now\nI Will let you get to the next car keys the air\nFrom the cold air conditioner\nFactory floors\nAre probably not because your air conditioning actually is designed to poll\nThat air all the the humidity out of the house so that should really be helping but when you have window units a lot of times those units cycle on and off\nAnd really don't lower the humidity as much as possible and this would be you know humidity wouldn't generally calls an isolated issue like that that would be more of you know direct water getting on it but air conditioners your friend in this situation and pull that humidity out\nThank you and I have wondered about that that answers that much we can do their\nGood good if we could if

homeowner radio here Danny and yeah\nBut I Hope you're having fun because ... myself to any lip or we're always having fun when we have an opportunity to be with you here on today's home on a radio we've got a lot of great information for you and make sure that we can get in as much information as we can right now we're going to go to Indiana\nAnd check in with Jim who's got a little concerned Jim welcome to the debates on a radio show how you doing oh we're doing we're\nDoing great thanks doing we're doing great to understand you've got the old humidity issue flaring up on you\n[noise] yes uh we just checked it it's a two different parts of the house I'm a sixty one percent and sixty percent that seems high yeah that's why\nWell it is it is a little high it's not as bad as it could be certainly but you you you love to drive it down below fifty percent probably forty percent is considered the what's um ideal but sometimes it's hard to maintain that but um um\nHow about the exhaust fans will get plenty of exhaust fans going on in those bathrooms were using those and is it\nExhaust fans will get plenty of exhaust fans going on in those bathrooms were using those and that is pushing that air all the way to the outside\nI'm actually it's pushing it up to the addict we don't have a we don't have it out through the roof\nOkay well everybody hates to put another hole in the roof found but boy is it important to get it out of their cars that humidity hanging in the attic\nUm if it doesn't have a really good way of moving that air out um it's going to really affect your living area I mean it's not like it's going to drift down through the ceiling but certainly can cause condensation and just contributing the humidity too too that um do you have air conditioning\nYes we have central air and we have a inflation up to its over forty for our\nFederal good good good okay\nUm well to tell you the truth uh it it seems strange but that actually could be contributing to the um increase humidity in the house now\nThat doesn't mean you need to take any installation away that's good but just a lot of times when you have that blanket of insulation again which is the way to go it just may cause more of a need for air to be moved out of the living area\nAnd exhausted so you know using the bathroom fan and I would recommend going ahead and in routing it through in the most direct route you can uh through the roof\nAnd of course if if you're not comfortable getting on the roof don't get on the roof get a roof or to drop by and take care of it for you\nAnd that will ensure that you're getting that you know surge of of humidity in moisture out of the house a same with the um the arrange should in your kitchen and using that shower that exhaust fan when you're showering\nFor at least ten or Fifteen minutes afterwards to really move that hot moist air out same way with the rain should after you finish preparing those gourmet meals leave it on for a little bit longer but the other thing that are really um ... you know affects the indoor humidity more than anything is your air conditioning system\nUm especially if it's too big for your house so any idea how that unit is\nA yes in fact we we did it do we did the furnace and the air conditioner this summer\n... okay [noise] um but but you weren't monitoring the mid ... prior to that a shame no okay okay\n'cause I'm a lot of times um do you know if they did any kind of calculation on the real needs for the air conditioning and heating in your home or did they just replace it with the size unit that was there before\nUm I think they're replaced so just with a size\nOK and here's another kind of a weird technical kind of thing you upgrade your insulation so that means you need really theoretically less air conditioning in Haiti\nSo with the air conditioner not having to work as often\nSeems like that's a really good thing which it is if it's sized dry but what happens is it Will Shortz cycle so it'll come on and then the cost of the insulation you have it will adjust the temperature in your house not your humidity but the temperature in your house and it'll go off\nThen it comes back on goes off so with that not running enough it's not pulling that ... that air circulation is not pulling the humidity out of the year enough\nAnd that could actually be a problem so it may be\n[noise]\nGetting ready for the big vote I'm Rogers stern Fox News ... hours away from what everyone expects to be the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to become the next justice on the Supreme

Baron send your bird for putting us on the air their\nNew Brunswick Denny's located in eastern New Jersey right between Philadelphia and New York city right on that line that goes up through the northeast part of the country and it's a ...

home improvement question\nWell special hello to everybody there in New Brunswick and appreciate you certainly are listening to the show and you can reach out to us anytime one eight hundred non for six forty four twenty and that's a message today someone or dot com slash\nAsked right now I Want to let you know about October bean indoor air quality month is such a big issue these days we worked so hard to seal up our homes really really well\nAnd we're trapping hot moist air and some contaminants inside not a problem but cause you're able to exhaust it properly\nBy or working with us at um today's homeowner here in uh sharing with you a lot of different ways that you can do it but here's another way we're celebrating with the great give away from our friends at Brown all month long brown has given away and invent than ventilation fans\nThese decorative fans are very easy to install super quiet and even have a built in light or you have to do to win after caller hotline make sure you leave your information on how we can talk ... contact you and said this little phrase I Need and invent\nI Need and invent that one eight hundred non for six forty four twenty for your opportunity to win will be doing this all month long and celebration of indoor air quality mutt because we just simply want to make you aware of\nWhat exactly needs to be done and can be done very easily to improve the air quality inside your home\nFor your whole family they Joe we got a lot of them got a lot of emails here let me go go to this one this one came from Michael in North Carolina and\nHave a lot of uh seems a little bit of a problem with Florence Hurricane Florence costs so much flooding out there and you know all our listeners infringe there in North Carolina Virginia Tennessee area\nI Know a lot of it really did have a lot of problems and you're you're dealing with the aftermath of that and we certainly have been thinking about you hear on today's homeowner and hope that we can help you in any way we can we'd been posting a lot of articles on today's homeowner dot com of things that you need to think about as you're returning home we want to do everything we\nPossibly can but Michael writes in Joe says understand the whole concept about around the house with the wheat polls in the brick but it seems to have backfired on us recently\nBy this recent hit with Hurricane Florence the backside of our house was completely saturated and a leak formed in the cricket area behind our fireplace the we polls are located directly above\nThe roof on let me see here\nI think he probably has a whole nother wall that extends up past oh yeah ... you know so that\nIt ... it so it's above the refunding flashing on top of the cricket area if we had not been there the excess ...\nThis line and flashing on top of the cricket area if we had not been there the excess water that leaked into that cricket area would've come into the first level of the home\nFortunately I knew how to cut through the drywall and access that area and put buckets in place to capture the lakes so now we're looking for a solution to avoid the situation in the future how to better seal off this area should another intense rainstorm\nPass through the week polls are there for a reason why it would be your advice on that for Michael\nFirst for people who aren't familiar we're we're using the term cricket here a cricket is simply a flashing that's put up behind a ordinarily a chimney to direct dump water it's coming down the route from just running right into the gym and it's like a little roof shaped piece of metal flashing just to divert water but ...\nYeah the um unfortunately for Michael these we polls are not designed to move an intense amount of water we polls are putting brick homes to allow just condensation some moisture to\nIf it forms inside the wall away to drop out they usually high up on the wall and low on the wall and you know build up of moisture will jump out but when they're not designed to keep back hurricanes so there's really not much you can do some people think oh well this year ... we ... we pulled yeah that's great when there's a hurricane but what happens you know the other ... and\n... there's a higher again right so [noise]\nUm I'm not sure what I could tell them I wouldn't obvious he would never recommend sealing off we polls and I think you just have to um you know realize that these are not designed to prevent water infiltration from a hurricane you know only just normal moisture\nSure and one of the things is the uh the phone back or ride may not solve the entire problem best temporarily but using some of the three quarter inch hum around back or ride that is a phone type\nMaterial that you used to um fill in larger areas that\nNeed to be caught prior to ... but you could put that in\nAnd I'm just kind of packing in there and then after the storm take needle most fliers and pull it out\nThat might restrict some of the water from going in there but yeah I forgot to you know that that that that might help a little bit but that is one of those unusual scenarios and I I Would like to say Joe maybe that's the thing we need to start working on our invention to figure out how to some kind of temporary we poll filler because we get a few calls like that from time to\nLook for the ... poll filler yeah\nYeah I can nice rain it was going to have to work on that one there and then see what kind of jingle we can put along with that one [laughter] [noise]\nOkay let's go to the email secular again with a Mary from Minneapolis says Hi guys we really love your radio show my nine year old mom came to live with this recently\nAnd we have to make a few changes to our homes to accommodate her in the bathroom we installed a few safety grab bars but she still needs some help getting in and out of the TBI have any suggestions thank you so much\nA ... ... very very important yes\nBut I'll tell you those walk in tubs on I'm seeing those sayings advertise everywhere and so many people are realizing the benefits of those that they fit into a traditional five foot um tub space um have you had much experience with those jokes\nYeah I've I've not um install day but I Know that um they are becoming more and more popular in the prices come down a little bit you know as as um more and more homeowners are moving you know becoming multigenerational households but those walk in terms of still relatively expensive costume between two and four grand\nOn but it would solve the problem in this case um you know it's one sure way to solve the problem\nAnd there's ... there's also a lot of a at a medical supply places I ... you know my my brother was a quadriplegic some moving you know people around them and different things there's amazing amount of fall lips\nUm you might even related to something that a kind of an odd comparison but something you would lift an engine out of a car\nIs a little hydraulic type thing that they're made very very small\nAnd uh has a a kind of a ... a kind of a cloth or nylon type of I'm almost ... like a device on it like a ... that's what I was trying to say and so there's a lot of those things that are also available to make that safe and easy to get in and out of the tub but the walk into probably is one of the better ways to go on that\nI also wanted to mention that they do make 'em depending married in mentioned how you know um difficult it is for her mom to get enough but they do make a thing called the tub transfer seat which is a long vents that kind of straddles the edge of the tub so\nWhat a person can do is they sit on the bench they lift one foot over the edge of a job than the other one and they slide over and they're still in the tub and then they can stand up so and they do make safety stainless steel safety grab bars the amount right to the edges of towns that's another option so he um I Would start with that\nAnd then depending on um our mom can handle that then maybe you know you may have to eventually moved to step into\n... when you hear these days about um parents so you know growing old like that and the aging in place scenarios of trying to adapt your home so that people can can change the living in the place that uh they are most comfortable with the we have a lot of information on our website about hum\nAging in place and some of the things you might need to do to make it comfortable and safe for your elderly parents and you're listening today so I'm On a radio when we come back we're going to be talking to Chelsea and checking in with her recent episode say with the ... on a radio [noise]\n\nWhat about a jail coach Jane Anne what should I use for a top ... after standing to get a set finish thanks so much for your time\nWell I tell you Sylvia the easiest thing to do is to use of water base and you know first that it dries really quickly cleans up with soap and water and if you can get a water based gel stain that would be even better because it it doesn't run as much as much thicker\nMaterial to apply so that's what I Would use you can get a a dark walnut comes in dark walnut\nAnd for um a sentence finish what I Would recommend doing we've talked about this and that that that you can get polyurethane in a spray\nTime for a picture frame it would be perfect small project like that yeah right yeah you often have like ... or some detail to work around which make it you know a little more difficult to apply with a ... thing with a brush\nAnd you can get most most probably are things sprays or gloss but if you look you can find one that either either ... or sat and spray on and that's what I Would use you know spray one light oh yeah let's drive really first of all let me back up wouldn't that be sure this stain is very very dry if you have to wait a couple of days\nOr make sure they're staying totally dry and then spray on to like go to the of the of the ... or ... ... and you'll be all set\nAnd if you can do that outside it's always better you know the weather's just because of the smell and I'll tell you to take\n'em you know a job when I have fishing line laying all over 'cause we're ready to fish at any moment and and to take a piece of um of fishing string model filament with a little even even have the hook left on it you take the bait off on it though [laughter] ended\nAnd the fish anger picture frame up somewhere outside makes it a lot easier to paint all sides of\nIt if you need to and it's great for the dry and stay with us here

Florida and visit with Monique ...\n... what a wonderful name and welcome to the today is on the radio show [laughter]\nThinking how nice that gives you\nA good good what can we help you with us here are pondering a little uh architectural change tell us about it\nWell actually at the front porch on on the phone\nAnd currently kind and and how does that I signed up for five years okay and I ... that's fine\nI really kind of line and knocking game and we have on like a dangerous sailing and die down but I prefer to have something more\nMore training sure sure how I was wondering what you would recommend do\nI'd like to take the strains of why I don't need that we have a friend and ally okay I'm In the back and make it let me just Marr Marr Marr Marr like just a nice from parts area what would you recommend and\nThe openness certainly is nice and uh the questionable thing would be is if the four by four in the middle part of it is even needed because most likely when the original house was built um if\nYou did because most likely when the original house was built um it probably wasn't screened in actually most or or that way so if you move the screen door you remove the\nScreen I Would guess you would be able to remove um the the four by four in the middle but now the ... on the corners do you also have four by force\nI call ... style mhm\nBecause ... star and I'm not purchased profits on behalf of Martin and it's almost done that when when just yesterday I I like that and again I don't believe there's four by four corners\nBecause once you can do is you certainly can remove those and replace those with a variety of different columns that question would be you know whether um architecturally it would be good to have square columns or round columns\nUm ... you know with a square column you can really use a four by four and just case around it\nWith one by sixes and then add some decorative molding around it you have a great looking anywhere nice southern looking um column 'em or you can actually wrap they also have some that are aluminum as well as composite that can um\nIn case the four by four as well so that you still have the string but you just you know looking at the the aesthetics of the outside of it\nUm it is something that I'm Home Depot has a lot of selections on those kinds of things that you could take a look at 'em in the store are certainly you know look you know and wanted to get some inspiration on the different types of columns that you have a lot of different um options air but my my hunch would be\nThat a square column would be more appropriate for the style house it is\nOK\nOkay Monique yeah\nI have another suggestion is that kind of cell product specifically for this kind of remodeling they're called the criminal made a couple of different names ... ... split columns ha ha or column covers or columns around\nAnd they're usually um columns in either made out of fiberglass would aluminum PVC I'm dean some polymer stone ones that kind of like\nUm it's manufactured stones that real stone to kind of looks like stone square around but they're made to go round that exist in post and they're they and they also make structural ones but that are single piece that would mean removing whatever post you out there so I I I agree I agree with Danny I think you can remove the center pose\nPut these columns that you can slip right around with their whatever posts are in the corner\nAnd corners remove the screens and then you can just take these split columns and wrap them around and they look
