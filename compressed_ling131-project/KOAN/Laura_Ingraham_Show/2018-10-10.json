before just by the fact that I said said realization you know what I Believe I've come to the conclusion that most people prefer to be taken care of and lose liberty\nThan have liberty\nAnd not be taken care of and have to take care of themselves now I'll be ... up to the extreme that you you can find a doctor you can find the hospital you can find a policeman obviously there's we're talking about within certain bounds\n\nBut that is how that is how people think I Want to be taken care of and if I lose liberty and the process that's OK America was founded on the belief of liberty\nAnd I think most Americans assume for a while I don't know I take that back I think a lot of Americans assume that that was in a chord with the human the universal human desire freedom\nBut it it it is it

be taken care of\n\nEverything in life is a value is is one of the revelations of the second half of my life I did not middle of this as a kid so many things that I just assumed were given my love and marriage go together like a horse and carriage\nThat assumes that love and marriage\nOr she'll somewhat or automatic you you were you horse and carriage are pretty much an automatic the horse without the carriage and nobody goes in the cards in the ... the horses doesn't move so they go together and so do love and marriage but it's not true\nMarriages choice marriages value even of value\nAnd we have not taught these values and the and liberty is a value this is the one that shocked me this I I I figured out the one on marriage but this one really surprise me\nLiberty is not a year ... liberty is a value that's correct\n\nThat is correct some of you may know the greatest a project of my life I've been engaged in now it's thirty year project in the first of all you will be coming out next April commentary on the first five books in the Bible the first one I'm coming out with this book of exodus\nAnd it's fascinating how the Israel lights or liberated from Egypt and then constantly complain oh bring us back to Egypt at least we ate better there or imagined that the better there\nWas a slave mentality the slave mentality is\nHey\nI got taken care of I got three square meals I they they took care of me medically I had no liberty but I was taken care of that is what the slave mentality is that not all slaves were treated decently to save at least it's obvious but if you were decently treated\n\nYou weren't murdered you weren't weren't whipped she did you work\nYou got fed\nLifers ... nice you didn't have to worry about anything no initiative on your part was necessary\nThat's that's not all that bad for the human the human human nature is not\nGeared toward yearning for freedom believe it or not it's not\nYou may think it is but it isn't\nThat's why that book is so powerful\nMaybe it's not such a great idea to leave slavery and it's you know they're all forms of slavery\nAddiction as a form of slavery and we've there I'm not being poetic justice you're you're a slave to whatever it is you're addicted to\n\nBut the the choice before Americans and before Europeans and before others is\nAre you prepared to give up liberty for the sake of being taken care of the answer is almost always yes and the more that you are given the more or less freedom you really want\n\nThis is the great experiment of the United states the great experiment is liberty liberty in God we trust the pluribus unum our what I call American trinity wrote a book on the American ... still the best hope\n\nPeople are not necessarily in sync with us\n\nTake care of people take care of my if you take care of me\nTake care of my children\nThat's why people who home school their children are looked at very often negatively but a lot of other parents the states should teach your children who the hell are you to educate your own children\n\nSo this has been a revelation in my life is the ultimate issues our because this is an ultimate issue do we do we want to preserve liberty number one or take care of people\nBy take care take being taken care of now obviously there's there's gotta be an element of being taken care of we we all understand that but an element is not dominant which is dominant liberty or the other\n\nEven being taken care of to the point where I don't want you to have the liberty to speak because what you say\nMay offend me is another example of liberty being downgraded on behalf of being taken care of I I don't want to hear anything that may hurt me\n\nOkay\nAh let's go to a are too doesn't agree so he gets on first hello

[noise] well\nWhen you gave you gave people orders and they're doing it then you throw in sorrow says money and the thoughts of the race you are doing what what was it James Last was it this was some\nAlgae Beatty event there was the rally foreign eat dinner and October twenty Seventeen\nOkay so this was\nNot even a year and to the administration and Maxine was already setting the table for that flip Wilson\n\nI Am sitting here listening watching at starving thinking about Ali even though I never met him and with this kind of inspiration I Will go and take Trump out tonight [noise]\n\n... ... does that sound like you're taking him out to talk to them one would I Would assume she's talking about Mohammed Ali no it's all it no no no no no what was it was at my home and I don't I don't even follow what that is that\nYou know you did with the inspiration of Ali I'm going to take him out I mean I Can't think of another Ali who took people out right what\nWas it James all I Know all the time it was the Alief forty dinner ... T group not not Mohammed Ali\nSays must be some organization or some person who was wasn't my narrative much more than ... yeah [laughter] courageously fighting discrimination ah well she set the table that's what she does she set the table for all of this by the way they are\nGreat Ingram angle on tap tonight the mob is in full\nOverdrive mode and there ain't no shaking it off\nTaylor Swift just to sort of sending like all the Thirteen year old girls to try to who was still listen to her music to go register to vote there all Thirteen\nThey claim that Seventy one thousand young people registered as a result of her call now how do you quantify that do they walk voting station and say I'm a tailor girl signed me [laughter]\nWell they probably retweeted or something and then they\nThey retweet it or not you know by the way we're also going to get into this issue today on the show that we touched on last night about what is consensual and not consensual on college campuses as far as a\nSexual contact and what's happened with the title mine that Obama rewrote really interesting story at UC Davis a well we'll get into that we don't have time to do it now or the Chuck Grassley is going to be joining us coming up how he won the Kavanaugh battle and what's in store next don't go out\n\n[noise]\n\nThe following is not an actor but a real life story from trinity debt management\nMy story begins with debt and a lot of debt credit card debt and I heard a commercial for trinity I gave them a call\nIf you're in ... and you need help cold trinity a one eight hundred seven mine for over four three summer when\nI first called I was a little embarrassed and kind of a shame and I looked at the numbers and I saw how quickly that astronomical debt that was in my life would go away\nGoody will consolidate your account should the one easy to manage monthly payment reduce your interests and possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands\nOf what I Would tell other people please pick up the phone and call trinity just let them put together a program and see how affordable and easy it is to pay off your debt\nAn example of civility and so for US Senator to say get in their face for congresswoman like her to say get in your face and then what happens is uh the president's press secretaries and Senator Cruz or\nPushed out of restaurants that are surely\nThat is encouraged by what are these congresswoman and senators are saying and it was wrong or I Believe in\nA freedom of association freedom of speech freedom to demonstrate\nBut it ought to be peaceful and you shouldn't do anything that's going to encourage violence because even if or a congresswoman doesn't in Canada violence there's some people that are going to take it one step further than she intended and she needed to back off about ... steps and a and not\nSurely not be in your face if you're going to have a democratic and representative government function properly or I got to be a ... you know a few feet away we got to have a\nA discussion a dialogue I got to have respect for people that disagree with me and she ought to respect for people that disagree with our\nBut in your face is in a way to do\nWell she said a year ago or that she was gonna take Donald Trump out\nAnd what does that mean let me see is that this I'm lesbian or gay algae beauty dinner and she goes in and take him out\nThat she wasn't saying take 'em out for dinner and she was like take 'em out and\nTelling people that are getting harassed and restaurants and it seems like that that message really has terminated the permanent protest a mentality in the Democratic party senator and in my concern is that someone's going to end up getting hurt we already had Steves the least get shot you would have thought that the that the\nDemocrats would have calmed everyone down after that but when you I'm Susan Collins been cornered in an elevator it's one thing when Jeff Flake is cornered an elevator but then you have poor old Susan Collins and people being ... screen data centimeter from their face while they're trying to walk down a hallway I mean what can be done about this\nWell ah obviously for those of us that are in public office and then\nIn public places and we're confronted with that and they're doing it under what they think is First Amendment rights the only thing you can count on his police protection and we have\nBut then you can't have police protection for four five hundred and thirty five members of Congress or every place they are spread throughout the United states even relying upon local police or you can't do that as well so are are are\nI've come to the conclusion and this repetitive of whatever kind of already said to you but are\nA democracy will be a stronger a with respect full political discourse as opposed to what is happening or when you a quote unquote get in their face\nWell what what senator what responsibility does something like a Dianne Feinstein or Cory Booker or Kamala Harris have to to speak against this type of\nHarassment and intimidation this isn't just carrying a sign in and chanting some things is is cornering women in elevators this this is something and we have\nWe have people threatening to kill cabinet are teachers and Minnesota I mean people are taking this all the hard if you if you say someone's like a combination of not seeing a sexual predator enough time\nSome way I could do it all is gonna you know take take matters into his or her own hands got help it so what responsibility does the Democrat leadership have here\nUh I don't think they're going to exercise but they gotta they gotta responsibilities ...\nNo I Would I Would I'm waiting for that ah I'm waiting for that undergrad they there go ahead\nYou know wait a long time I think\nSenator Grassley are the lessons learned from this Kavanaugh saga [noise] uh this many of us thought that\nIn the beginning when we had to put up the hearing and kick it off from the Thursday vote initially kick it off to Monday and then it got delayed because of the Ford allegations\nAny thoughts to solidifying the rules so you\nCan't extend hearings past the close of the original hearing date so these kind of anonymous allegations can't drop and make a difference again\nWell I've read your\nTweets when you took me to tears called me for ... for not calling for a whole but but you can't you can't ... if I call the vote today on we went along we we will tend to tend to rely on and so you gotta have some respect for people that are on the job here are doing it\nAnd so we we waited until we had the votes\nYeah no I corrected myself after that I didn't delete the ... because I set it on but I corrected myself and and you and you and McConnell both\nHindered handled this master fleet in the face of incredibly difficult\nAnd I think ... I'm a highly emotional highly charged atmosphere\nAnd when people say that Dr Ford was disrespected which is a guest on my show said last night she was disrespect and I said oh my gosh Senator Grassley said if you need something repeated or you know if you are you okay do you need anything I mean you couldn't have been more solicit is Dr Ford I\nI Can't imagine how you could have been frankly\nYeah well it reminds me of how I was confronted by Iowans because uh in the Thomas hearings because I was so mean to on the hill and I never asked a single question but I was sitting beside specter that did are questioning and everybody thought I was specter [laughter]\n[noise]\nOh my goodness I'm Senator Grassley a there was another moment that I have to get you to react to um this is Heidi Heitkamp of course Democrat in North Dakota decided divide vote against having a a lot of people have talked\nWhether the court remains legitimate you heard Hillary say that it's a shame that things happen as they happen because the court always was respected and this is what senator high camps then you're obviously\nIt happened because the court always was respected and this is what senator hide camps then\nYou're obviously in the midst of a very tough reelection fight and I know you you feel voting the way you did was the right way do you worry are you concerned that may have cost you your sentences\nAt the end of the day still have to look at yourself in the mirror and think about what your\nFuture holds compromise something like this based on politics and I I Believe the yes vote would have compromised um my true beliefs that um this person's um did not have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court they're still repeating\nThat the temperament issues Senator Grassley\nHe listen this gets back to what he told he got twelve successful years on the DC circuit the second most important\nA court in the land he's been college or even people like Garland\nA said that he had that sort of a approach to judging and that means judicial temperament and not only are you have a personality that is tempered you also leave your personal views out of\nOut of a decision making you look at the law and look at the\nFacts of the case and just to use those two things to go by so consequently a it what what she said Sandra Hi Kim said plus your question brings me to a history of Thomas\nOr is it going to hurt the Supreme Court\nI listen to the same thing twenty eight years ago and then I look at twenty eight years record of Thomas on the court and I've never seen any retribution on his part towards anything that was set against him at that time and he was mad when he said he was going through our high tech a\nHike or something like ...\nYeah so so uh you know after twenty eight years though is the same thing about Thomas not seeing it I think that I got great confidence that Kavanaugh's going to bring\nGreat prestige and knowledge an academic background and more importantly his work on the second highest court ...\nCourt and it's all positive\nNo it's it's ... he's the one in the most qualified people period of time to sit on the court a Senator Grassley the uh the Susan Collins um situation in Maine of course all these leftist billionaires promising a to flood\nOr the her opponent whoever that ends up being a with lots of money you want to raise three million dollars for Susan Collins I Know Mitch McConnell has said the same thing how was that looking\nWell we're just getting started at that but a conservative even though a lot of times they disagree with Susan Collins they got to look at her as a senator of great principal\nAnd we need to respect that and I said three million it's going to take a lot more than three million to elect her but they raised ... million against her so our goal is three million dollars right now and everybody that really ought to respect her and want Kavanaugh on the porch onto a\nGo along that line and I hope a rallying cry\nFor Republicans over the next twenty eight days between now and the election is remember Kavanaugh and this November ... election is a chance for Americans or reject the mob rule that you have seen over the last three weeks\n[noise] oh yeah my family and\nThe CGI\n\nFox News alerts on monster storm hits Florida on the ... the national weather service calls hurricane

execute you and they exclude a lot of people they send the family the bill for the bullets that they used to kill you and your better pay it\nBecause they mean business right but the Washington Post their leader trail today actually blames Donald Trump for the Saudis snatching this guy in the Saudi embassy in Istanbul\nBecause they say that Donald Trump set the tone and now we have this big um I'd encourage them or something and it's just they're they have mental illness I don't know how they got all these people with mental illness into one business [laughter] and\nInto one party but there's a lot of mental illness on the left and it's on parade boy is that on parade\n[noise] yeah so they're blaming they're blaming the Washington Post blaming President Trump for the disappearance of this journalist ...\nBecause they believe that the Saudis grabbed the guy and bad things happened and uh and it must be Donald Trump swamp\nAnd speaking of hurricane Michael which is a horror show racing toward the panhandle of Florida Michael pierce is kind of proud he's got these headlines with hurricane his mom sending them test text messages asking them to not be too destructive and things like that [noise]\nAh but I I assume there'll be blaming Donald Trump for hurricane Michael because they've blamed Donald Trump for past hurricanes so\nThey've got it's amazing how powerful they think politicians are they think that rock Obama can slow the rise of the oceans and that the healing of the planet we'll begin because he was elected the news media believed that they they sold that message for the Democrats and now they're selling the message that Donald Trump is responsible for hurricanes say\nThe Democrats affect the weather in the oceans positively and Republicans affect the weather in the oceans negatively that as a sign of mental illness that is truly a sign of I I'm not a a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist by any stretch of the imagination\nBut that's a sign of mental illness you don't have to be I mean that's you're crazy you're not you're cook your a fringe case\nThat's that's crazy stuff and uh let me also say a lot of this stuff are hearing from the news media and the and the Democrats\nJust a few years ago what is mainstream now just a few years ago would have considered to be would have been considered to be fringe extremism the rhetoric of the left that get in their face the dead or alive or all this stuff they these people are\nThese people are a medicine it's not as though there is no violence that's going with it there's lots of violence that's going on whether Brooke Baldwin is aware of it or not I mean I understand that really they pay millions of dollars a year because of the shape of her knows\nMore than anything and and she maintains a steady regiment of of ah teeth whitening strips\nShe's a very good and those are her qualities as a journalist otherwise\nShe's not the\nBrightest tool in the constellation if you know what I'm Talking about\nAnd Don Lemon he's famous for being a a dumb one too but that said also in the Washington Post today as I digress all over the place and to call this X. men refined the main road\nThe Washington Post has another one today there is a gubernatorial race taking place they the election as in less than a month and the state of Maryland the state of Maryland\nAnd uh there is a Republican governor there uh by the name of Hogan and he is say Larry Hogan are very popular governor especially for a Republican in a very left the state of Maryland\nHe is up over Ben Jealous the former president of the N. double ACP which represents the advancement of colored people\nAnd just don't call them colored people because that's racist people of color is okay but colored people is right out\nSo keep that in my ... Ben Jealous former president of the N. double ACP he's running against Larry Hogan Larry Hogan is up by twenty points\nWell Larry Hogan this campaign got a hold of some video a couple of different videos of Ben Jealous the liberal left wing Democrat\nI'm ... and he said some really stupid things on this on these these videos\nAnd Larry Hogan people made the public because you know you can laugh at the Democrat being an idiot and getting things wrong and sounding like a fool and that's all they're doing a showing video of him right\nSo and and he said stupid things he made gaffes mistakes but there are huge giant ones so the Washington Post is downplaying but here's the headline\nThose veterans Reagan's typed up the story on behalf of the Democratic party\nJealous accuses Hogan of bullying\nBullying because they are published videos of him looking stupid\nQuote a new low and Marilyn politics what showing video of you as a new low and Marilyn ... I I don't think that's true but it's what the Democrats say you know when or when they go low then that then they go lower I think that's I think that's the Democratic party saying is a\nMaryland Democrat and gubernatorial nominee Ben Jealous accused governor Larry Hogan of bullying which is a term that I think should be reserved for grammar school I think it's a grammar school term\nBullying him with the release of a new campaign video that mocks him for several gaps they say gas they call them yes including one where he said he's running for governor of Virginia\nWhich in case you're a Democrat is a different state altogether that's another state altogether and so uh Ben Jealous or again he's a little brighter than Brooke Baldwin I think but not a lot\nWe will be running together [noise] looking for the White House said we'll [noise] jealous\nWas removed from the White House said well [noise] jealous when you make history books on President [noise]\nYou got to be the first black you know they're all in the next one day and you will be looking at it as governor of Virginia\nHe's been jealous for president then they cross it out of Virginia so they made a funny at and it's a funny ad can we post that we can post that on our website so you're going to enjoy it and share it with your friends\nNow they didn't doctor the video like NBC News does they they just showed clips of him making a fool of themselves\nAnd then they've got a funny graphic at the end where it says Ben Jealous for president and they cross out president and then they write a Virginia [laughter] because they're mocking him now this is not allowed because he's a Democrat and now he's being bullied and guess what\nHe's got a victim thing to fall back on he's got a victim thing listen he's a victim he's the victim of all of this\n[noise] jealous set on Tuesday the mistakes were due to the soldier that he has had since she was a child which at times it involves saying a different word that what he had a intended to say\nThese ads are bullying jealous set at a news conference in Baltimore there while I can take it it encourages the bullying of young people and that's not okay he's protecting children and Planned Parenthood he loves to things children and Planned Parenthood\nIt's a new low in Maryland politics let's not lose sight of who the victim is here\nIt says on Monday the ... campaign released a thirty three second video that highlights three gaps in one part of the clip jealous says he's running to remove Hogan from the White House so it doesn't know what office he's running for\nIn another jealous says that if elected he would be the first black president and then in the ad there is a clip of Brock Obama throwing his hands up like you know what am I a chopped a chicken meat over here with us\nAnd in a certain segment recorded at an event on Saturday Ben Jealous tells union members that with their help quote you'll be you're looking at the next governor of Virginia\nSo we don't know I mean if you can't use that against them as a political ad that's the most polite political out I've ever said that's not a new low it's a new high that say this is the old\nWhen they go low we go high and then they burn your car because there is a Trump a bumper sticker on it and uh it's amazing so listen to what he says here a starter is like a speed bump in your brain\nAnd word replacement as a way that you deal with it and and he's right one of my best friends growing up Jerry was I had a a terrible star and he still has that he still has a center a is a nice guy in the room and the greatest guys one of my lifelong best friends with the center and it's true if you have a daughter\nAnd you start to start because you know you're going to start studying over a word like Maryland or something you know it started to say and I'm running for governor ... Virginia\nYou know that because that's how it goes goes to start to set up so you changed your supposed to change the word but not the state you're running for governor of and I'm running for president no no that's not an no that's not it and I don't know how ... plays into how you're going to be the first black president I just don't know I don't know how that works but\nBut that's it uh that's what it said and this is about being a victim that says he's got I have a medical condition that this allows me from dating the state that I'm running for governor of and and um and if I'm thinking where governor sometimes the word president comes out\n\n[noise] this is the Fox\nNews alerts hurricane Michael makes landfall on the ... the strongest storm ever to hit the Florida Panhandle
