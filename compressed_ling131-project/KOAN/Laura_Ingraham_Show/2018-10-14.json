natural disaster in the Florida Panhandle in up into Georgia and the Carolinas again on Carolina's boy they just can't catch a break lately right or with hurricane Michael\nWe'll talk a little bit about that on the program and also boy when it rains it pours because we saw what happened in the stock market starting on Wednesday right the stock market the Dow Jones industrial average fell eight hundred thirty two\nPoints on Wednesday alone on oh my goodness gracious ah a lot of folks wondering what does this mean what do I do should I get out of the market and ...\nAll right let me tell you what's going on here the Dow Jones industrial average dropped eight hundred and thirty one points on Wednesday and five hundred and forty six on Thursday across the media as you'd expect\nWednesday was the third largest point drop ever and Thursday was seven genes worst point drop ever\nIn stock market mystery now I Want to emphasize that for you by point but on a percentage basis neither day neither neither which should have but neither\nWill do not know their day was in the top twenty worst days of all time neither one was in the top twenty on a percentage basis\nWorst days of all time neither one was in the top twenty on a percentage basis in other words Wednesday and Thursday were largely irrelevant and this was kind of proved by friday when the Dow closed up nearly three hundred points\nBut still this saw mix there are a lotta people queasy I mean over the last three days the decline now was about a thousand points still it's not a big deal why not\nWell why does it feel so bad\nWhy do the garner such media attention well you know a thousand point drop in the market eight hundred a loan on Wednesday\nIt's real simple the bigger you get the bigger you fall in other words the Dow Jones industrial average closed on friday at twenty five thousand three hundred thereabouts thousand out of twenty five thousand just isn't that big a deal and that's the emphasis on providing you\nIt's not the points that matter it's the\nPercentage that matters\nBut the points are irrelevant so we have to keep that in mind put that into perspective otherwise you could be motivated to do the wrong thing at the wrong time for the wrong reason and here's the funny part about it here's what I find so hysterical about Wednesday until Wednesday\nEverybody's been complaining that their portfolios haven't made as much money as\nWell as much money as the U.S and the five hundred and you know why you haven't done as well year to date in your portfolio as the S. and P. five hundred\n\nTalking back to the program Rick Edelman here thing for hanging around with us on the show today I told you that you really shouldn't be making any changes in your investment strategy as a result of what's been going on in the stock market this past week\nBut there is something that I think you do want to do and I'm Talking to you gentleman who are listening to the program right now\nYou know it it's really fascinating people are fixated on what's happening in the stock market this past week due to the volatility of the markets what you really need to be paying attention to is what's going on in the bond market according to the Bloomberg Barclays\nMulti first index this is an index of all bombs all around the world they fell in value by about a trillion dollars this past week [noise]\nA trillion dollars why because the fed is raising interest rates as interest rates go up the value of bonds goes down so here's what I find rather ironic and almost comical people who are upset about the stock market saying oh my goodness I'm fearful of losing money in stocks I think I'll run the bonds for safety\nOnly to have their money go down in the bond market because rising rates are causing bond values to fall\nSo here's what you need to do beyond all else gentlemen as you're thinking of how you ought to make changes in your investment portfolio you're ready for that's here it is\nI Want you to talk to your wives and girlfriends and do what ever they tell you to do why\nBecause according to research firm fidelity women consistently earn higher returns than men in their investment portfolios an average of almost half a point per year\nWhy because women trade less often women are more deliberative the more methodical they are more\nConsiderate they evaluate more carefully they aren't equipped to make a snap decision and that translates into not\nJumping out of the market nearly because the market went down one day\nSo men before you do something dumb [noise]\nAnd before you have to pay for it when you explain to your spouse or a partner why you did what you did have that conversation\nHey honey I'm scared I'm thinking of getting out of the market what do you think\nAnd she'll tell you to go do something else for the afternoon okay it's really that simple but uh\nIf you really do want to know what you should be doing or want to be doing well here's just you know you're always looking for the latest and greatest investment opportunity while here it is I think I'm going to say this was targeted at women that is probably ridiculous the success thing I'll I'll narrow it down this was targeted to my wife I'll leave it at that okay\nOn friday a first of its kind ATF\nHas been launched\nNo ATF has ever been launched of this nature before and I got my wife's name all over it it's called the U.S vegan climate ATF [noise]\nJust great I mean give me a break seriously an ATF that is investing in companies according to guidelines consistent with vegan ism\nExcluded or companies is activities quote directly contribute to animal suffering destruction of the natural environment and climate change according to the perspective and includes companies that engage an animal testing animal Dr agricultural products the use of animals for sport or entertainment\nTesting animal derived agricultural products the use of animals for sport or entertainment or animal based research in genetic engineering\nIt says that it will select companies based on their farm mental impact as well companies engaged in the production and we're finding a fossil fuels or even the use of fossil fuels for production or excluded\nSo too are companies that negatively impact the environment throughout high carbon footprint or habitat destruction and so on\nAnd most of the company take steps to mitigate or dresses impacts no tobacco stock to defend stocks in the military stocks no companies that contribute to human rights abuses were charter forced labor no financial firms accounting firms are business service providers would work with excluded companies as well in other words it's not going to invest some anybody anywhere 'cause\nThere's nothing really seriously the vegan each okay look here we we got we got serious when you're investing for your life savings to provide your own retirement security is really serious thing and it isn't for you know [noise]\nI really don't think it can be funny very many financial advisors recommending the vegan ATF\nHere's what I Do want to talk about though\nMentioning financial advisors do you have one I think that maybe perhaps you do and I want to ask you the question\nHow old\nIs your advice or what is your advisors age\nAnd is your advisor working in a solo practice or a very small shop in other words does your advisor work pretty much by himself or herself or part of a larger team\n'cause even at the big box brokerage firms like Maryland and whoever else a UPS and and wells and so on even though they might have tens of thousands of advisors and the from each one of them is often working independently alone they got a cubicle and they're doing their thing and they're Cuban they're paying no regard\nHunting little contact with the folks in the cubes surrounding them\n... nobody but that advisor you're dealing with knows anything about you or anything about your investment strategy or anything about the investments that you have in your portfolio only your advisor knows what you're doing and while you were doing there is no continuity between your advisor and other advisors is that the case with the visor you work with\nAnd that's bad enough if you're working with an advisor\nWho's all by himself or herself with no network no connection no colleague with\nWhom they share effort that's that's bad enough but it gets even worse if your advisor is say sixty years of age and why do I say that age because that's the average age of financial advisors in this country\nAccording to a new industry survey from practical perspectives more than half of the nation's advisors will be gone within ten years according to all the way this industry research the average advisors in their late fifties early sixties in fact there are more financial advisors in this country who are eighty that who are thirty\nThis is an aging industry\nA lot of young folks don't want to get into the investment management business because of its negative reputation and concerns over not being able to make a whole lot of money at it they're going into other businesses like investment banking or law or accounting where they think there's better career opportunities for them there aren't a lot of young folks in this business so the average advisor in this industry is older\nSo I Want to ask you the question is you're focusing on your retirement have you given any thought to your advisers return because according to some industry statistics half of all advisors in this nation will be gone within ten years they will have quit or retired\nIs that possibly your advisor and if so what happens to you and your account\nSeason if you retire you need to continue having your money managed right will not just a retirement but through your entire life\nIf your advisors not going to be around who do you turn to you want to make sure your advisor as part of a team part of an organization that has stability but it's going to be here long term to provide the continuity and consistency of the advice and services you've grown to expect\nFrom your advisor to one of the things we love best about are from here element financial we've got a hundred and sixty advisors in forty three officers nationwide we work collectively as a team so no one client is dependent on any one individual for the advice and services and quality that\nThey're receiving and that's what we would recommend for you as well have a conversation with your advisor about their career expectations and clams and make sure their plan is in your best interest I'm Rick Edelman you're listening to the truth\nAbout money triple a plane wreck on line at rice Stillman dot com click that red button

there's like I said it's largely straight math that doesn't require a too much judgment will\nShow you the spreadsheet analysis and say here's what yet this way and here's what you got that way which number looks better to you and it'll be pretty self evident\nYeah if you sit down and see the growth uh especially be taking it ten years before I ... for the fall out so there's a lot of room for growth of that money yeah those ten years\nYes and so you have to calculate what you would expect is a reasonable rate of return over the next ten years and what kind of investment strategy is ideal in order to achieve that goal or as opposed to the promised pension that the employer is providing so the good news is that fact that the employers promise\nIs a guarantee the employer is saying we will give you this money every month\nFor as long as you live no matter what happens in the market\nBut on the other hand many employers many are both the state as well as private employers are struggling to honor those promises there's a huge pension shortfall in this country has many employer\nPension plans are underfunded and if the employer proves unable to honor its promises\nThen you could be discovering that eerie they're not getting a monthly check or you're getting a lower check then they had originally promised millions of Americans are finding themselves in that situation\nSo you've got to counterbalance the so called safety and guarantee of their check\nVersus their genuine ability to pay that check as promised for the rest of your life\nFor all these reasons Paul I'd recommend that we sit down and go through this over a couple of hours what I'll do is put you on hold and I'll get your phone number are connected with my colleagues in our Troy office\nAnd 'em sit down and go through the numbers with you and go from there\nAll right I really appreciate giving us a call here on the show today thank you wreck\nThat's Paul from Troy if you're facing the pension question you don't have to go it alone do appalled did call a professional financial advisor not your neighbor not your friend nothing in the cubicle next year it was a school is as you you've never done it before but we've done it thousands of times and we can put our benefit of our experience and expertise to your advantage\nJust do it all the callers to triple eight plan wreck 'cause that's triple eight seven five to sixty seven forty two\nYou know I find Paul's um question really fascinating and really timely because limb road just came out with a study showing that fifty two percent of workers you know so we are talking half of all Americans say they don't know\nHow to translate their retirement savings into monthly income it's the very question Paul was asking about his case whether to take a monthly pension or take the money out and turn it into monthly income on his own half of American workers say they don't know how to do that\nI'm not at all surprised that you don't know how to do that because you've never tried to do it before none of us are any good at doing things we've never done before so have you given that any thought at all\nI Know you have given thought to you've given a lot of thought to putting money into your accounts contributing to your retirement plan at work adding to your savings you've been doing that for forty years and you've gotten pretty good at it and that's why you've got as much money as you\nBut very seldom the people turn that upside down or inside out where they say okay I've got this bucket of money I've got these accumulated savings\nHow do I turn that into income\nAnd that's an entirely different question because we have to make sure that we're minimizing our taxes as we do is\nWe need to make sure we're generating enough money to meet our ability to maintain our lifestyle we have to keep pace with the cost of living because inflation makes everything more expensive over time and we want to make sure we don't ever run out of money before we die\nAnd not just our death but that of our spouse as well and ideally\nWe're going to have money left over to leaves a legacy an inheritance for our children and grandchildren that gets pretty complicated and if you don't know how to do it if you've never done it before don't go it alone call us a triple eight plan wreck and let us help you through that it's

scams as a result\nOf these hurricanes Sandra has just introduced an investor alert they're warning folks that you might get an email attacks the phone call you might see something on social media from outfits that are cleaning big investment opportunities resulting from the clean up\nAfter these disasters you know we've seen that the devastation houses torn down buildings destroyed massive flooding requiring intensive repairing rehabilitation\nAnd so you get some scam artist to say hey we just want to contract from the state of Florida and we're going to make billions of dollars and hey invest with us\nAll of this stuff is nonsense the most frequent scams are associated with clean up and rebuilding efforts they often trumpet breakthroughs in science and technology regarding flood related issues such as contamination and it's all just nonsense if you come upon and investment opportunity\nRelated to the hurricanes\nThrow those opportunity offers away\nDon't make any investment decision before talking with a professional we can help you evaluate the legitimacy of it\nWe can help you do research into the principals involved to see if maybe they've got black marks on their

finish last\nSummit goodness apparently they do according to study in the journal of personality and social psychology\nYeah there's apparently a journal called the journalist personality and social psychology they are just done research based on data from three million participants over a twenty five year period and they discovered that nice people\nAre at greater risk of bankruptcy than people who\nAren't nice go figure and the reason\nIsn't necessarily because people are nice it's because most people according to the study don't value money as much as people who are mean\nAgreeable and this was associated with financial hardship lower savings higher debt and higher default rates on loans\nSo being a nice guy means you're probably in an effort to be nice or just because you're nice you tend not to\nCare as much about money and therefore you are at higher risk of money mismanagement according to the study their data included following individuals over twenty five years and they discovered that when they measured agreeable mess in childhood\nIt predicted greater financial hardship later in life\nSo mom and dad looking your five year olds are they nice or are they not nice because if they're nice [noise] ...\nI I don't I don't even know what the vices that we give them so we were\nSupposed to teach our children not to be nice I just I don't think so but maybe maybe maybe what we should be simply doing saying look we know you're a nice person\nThat's fabulous that's wonderful but recognize that that could cause you buy your nature to make decisions that aren't helpful to you when it comes to your money management you might be willing to loan money to a friend\nAnd not care if they pay you back because you're nice don't do that you might\nBe willing to buy a bigger house than you can afford because it's been it's nice for the fun thing to do and later you will discover that you struggled to repay that loan and your default rates will rise so don't do that maybe\nYou'll spend money that you shouldn't be spending on credit cards what have you leading to default on loans or ultimately bankruptcy\nCap maybe counts are kids that being nice is a handicap to effective money management as opposed to telling our kids to you know not not be so nice does anything in this world needs that's more nice people write dish hey\nIt all comes down to financial wellness and here's good news\nFinancial wellness programs in the workplace or on the rise Ninety One percent of employers pretty much all of them say that they are likely to expand their programs

as absenteeism according to this research Twenty one hundred bucks per year per employee\nIs what absenteeism in prison to use them costs your employer and if the employer is spending Twenty one hundred bucks a year per employee on these costs that's Twenty one hundred bucks a year they can't give you and pay and benefits because they have to spend the money elsewhere\nAnd here's the worst part forty one percent say they're stress level related to money has increased over the last twelve months has yours I mean we've got a stock market that's been rising an economy that's been growing

I'm just looking at them with the key and I said\nLet's just get one one good luck shot here I go there like starts up like it does every time and it occurred like a kitten his face drop [laughter] literally I I mean he was\nI going to ask you a couple of questions here to kind of give some foundation or this question here I think I Know why would do the guy in the shop a Honda Civic\nVP addition is you know I I I Know most of these nomenclature what year is this car\nNineteen Ninety nine\nAll right and how many miles on this fine automobile\nOr about one Seventy and I got this thing from my grandfather after he passed away gave it meticulously\nMaintained and I really darn good at it too\nAnd the only real challenge we hear about these inches there was a no one\nI don't know it was a recall or Bolton but I Know they ... for a while that they had problems with the meeting surfaces between the head gasket heads there was a cracked block that would occur and oil leak in and it was that was something that was pretty well known on those but it wasn't it wouldn't lead to what you're having happen\nAnd yeah you know now\nWhat's funny is it's been about five days and it's rod in every single time I've been using the car you know not taking it on the trip\nThis thing is running like it did before and you know there's there's always been a little league on this car I Would say you know maybe five little drops a quarter of a teaspoon tonight you know kind of thing but nothing nothing big\nAnd yeah it's been running so like I said I replace the oil and the whole distributor assembly there and it's been running you know like a top I just\nDon't understand [laughter] oh God I well any\n... Ross let's assume for a second just repair shop was not completely trying to rip them off yeah I just didn't start and when it didn't start like he's been having trouble with maybe it finally got my annual it got full fuel\nTo where it was just washed out and the compression was off so they said hey you're gotta you gotta compression issue is the engine needs to be replaced it's going to cost five thousand bucks well that sounds realistic\nIn that case I Would have said there's no way I'm spending that much money on this older car I'm going to go the Kurdish part dot com and pick up a used that you wanted to keep the car going that'd be a great thing to do that's the way you do it or if you wanted to keep it going but\nNow that it started I'm going to say well\nHey it starts in runs perfect there's no way I had a good person problem and then now I don't I think we've got an electrical thing going on where we are not well obviously we're firing you ... that we've gotten a few in the flooded out and make it ... you know spin like that would do compression pistons\nAssuming somebody was not completely trying to rip them off well that's part of the nation was measurable not I've actually got a new story that you don't want to hear that will make you very angry ... small for some people out there to do that kind of stuff to make it so hard for me to do it right and\nBut ... small for some people out there to do that kind of stuff and they get so hard for me trying to do it right\nAnd I I just I don't know of any personally that I've seen in decades federal else that I just want to read the news story wow okay I Do but I think it's got an electrical thing we're going to find it the next time it doesn't fire we're gonna have to find out do we have sparked\nDo we have fuel I'm almost ... and we're going to find we don't have spark and it's going to have to be diagnosed and even if you replace the whole distributor assembly which is a huge problem on those cars\nAre we went through you remember that one car which then we went through like five three ... three at least at least three distributors before we got a good one new ones brand new that we're supposed to be quality parts so they fail and they have repeat failures often you gotta make sure you got a good quality\nI Would for fun district just because I got curious person may be on this deal has the right to compression test on it now that it's running yeah yeah yeah yeah and just confirmed that this engine is healthy because a hundred and Seventy thousand miles and that's the big engine is not done and\nYou know what right I'm betting that shop that got that look on their face ... if you still you know given the benefit of the doubt they might actually do a free compression test for is just to see because I knew at ... I mean I Would if somebody went like that of the you know I Can't believe I missed that I Want to see why because yeah we're human things I mean we've had vehicles that are in a way that vehicles\nThat are out of recycling facility that will start and they've gotten to Russia service Centre and we found out just the opposite that they had gotten flushed with fuel and it doesn't happen a lot but they'd gotten such people ran through and they just they they just had no compression left and so they were able to\nDrain everything out and let it sit with the plugs out for a little bit and turn it over and and she came back to life\nI can remember when I parked on a on a friday and a Memorial Day weekend and it had no compression the plugs route nice stuck back in and I said we're going to push it outside because it it's going to be junk that's going back to our recycling center where just checking it out it was wrecked a car and uh the tech guy that started up because what was wrong with this new one\nOh one [laughter] and we checked it and if you ran pretty rough this isn't a building on this thing out if we see that as well a long time ago we checked it again with a so key ... that we need to really look at this so\nEd thanks very much for the call good luck eight six six five nine for for one five all let's talk to Jeff Jeff you're on the end of the show what can we do for you\nOr that and the radio in the car\nNo thing with a couple of years ago and uh if you look I didn't know if there's any other additional beside the radio is that makes them think or I mean the ... with my parents are complaining I don't ever ready to go\nTwo thousand and eight Ford super duty I Believe the radio circuit only has the one fuse okay on some of the GM cars they run an accessory fuse that does one part and then they run another fused does another part on some of the gym vehicles but\nIf the rest of doing that thinking look too if you can think of the ... on the Ford is there anything else on the radio circuits well the ... circuit could come into play\nI'm for my first thought is I'm going with the\n[noise] the radio piece of it I'm going with the gym thing where we've got two circuits and the old Ford yes but we're seeing more and more vehicles now that you were correction and they have one\nPower circuit just like your home computer has one power plug now if you don't get it will keep it software in there because it does have a built in power supply backing it up\nA lot of these radios are going to hard drives and different things but yes you can disconnect them for like two years before they'll lose all their memory\nAnd it'll yeah a lot of them just have the one circuit in there but if it's losing memory I have seen some radios that we've had to replace in the last couple of years now in about seven or eight right in there when they switched to the started putting newer design radios in some with\nMore features they're not feature radio or whether it's each the radio or my link with the GM and\nYou know Ford's got sink and things like that and those radios yeah there you turn the key and they're like I if I turn the key for two days I lose all my stations but if I just drive it every day it's fine and and that's and then the radio you have\nGiven it lately debt how ... ... ... ...

[laughter]\n\n\n[noise]\nYeah well the the way that set we use the computer just said that you need to plug it scanned tool in and it'll say um\nIt'll say distributor offset and it's zero degrees on those so it's there's the computer handles everything so you want to zero so what you do as you started up unless they it says plus Thirteen that's enough to turn to check engine light on so what you'll do at that point is you'll move the distributor the direction needed to go back toward zero\nMove it there been tightened down start the vehicle up read the scanner again and if it says plus to shut it back off move the distributor just to hear more tightened it up fired up until the the engine read zero you don't need the disconnect anything you just do that until the offset says\nZero if you have advanced or retarded a little bit they actually called that now instead of a distributor a high voltage switch it's just we age plug it goes to if it's off a little the engine may run really well but it'll burn the distributor capping Roeder up quickly so\nThat's why they want that perfectly at zero so that's how you said you need a of a scandal\nDo I'd be scared of that scandal thing it
