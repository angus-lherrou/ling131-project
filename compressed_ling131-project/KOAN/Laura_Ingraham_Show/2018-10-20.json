so many issues that you raised here was so we'll take that one first\nThey're not only not offended on Christians ... it is not possible in their view to offend Christians there is as you probably know a famous or infamous art work quote unquote with a crucifix in the jar of the urine of the so called artist\nNow uh as I tweeted out last week if you put a uh if if you put a ... in Europe and uh you would be an Islamophobia if you put a tour in Europe you would be an anti Semite if you put a crucifixion urine you're an artist\nAnd and I tweeted that very exact it word for word what I just said for that crowd ... is not only not possible to offend Christians to the best of your ability you showed\nSo uh is that that this is ultimately a war against the Judeo Christian civilization that the west has built I Am convinced that that is the ultimate ... of the left they hate the idea of a Bible based value society\nThey're frightened by it and they hate it now the second issue is the use of the terms God and Jesus Christ it depends on the context so I Would say for example\nIf somebody says God did you see that home run I Do not believe they're violating the commandment against using God's name and paying\nA lot of people do and I don't I explain what I think\nThe commandment really means because I Know the Hebrew very well and the Hebrew vet commandment these do not carry God's name and vain not to do not take God's name in vain and the people but I Believe carry God's name and vein of the people who in the name of God do evil\nBecause that is the only one of the ten commandments that God says he will not forgive\nIf so it cannot be that it is about oh God that I have a hard day at work today or Jesus Christ I just really hurt my finger I I I it's hard to believe that God will forgive murder but he won't forgive that\nSo it has to be really bad since that's what set is said God will not forgive those who violate that amendment ... doing evil in God's name\n\nThat is the that's the worst evil atheist evil is evil religious evil is the most evil the Islamic to or doing evil in in their God's name are doing more harm to God and religion than any

march and drink at all you talking heads\nShould find out who's paying for their parents' ranch ... treat him coming north and you're going to find out Democrats and then publish it and that total change\nMhm you're talking about the caravan which we're going to get into it in a moment Pat Buchanan joining us uh yeah that caravan as moving up and look I'm there is certainly\nA an\nEcosystem let's put it that way there is an ecosystem of support for this caravan individuals who fund the housing the food the legal services for members of this carbon and not only the Caribbean but more\nI I don't know if you saw the story the other day Lutheran refugee services as well as ah the Catholic migration refugees services came out with a statement demanding that we'd be more welcoming to not only these caravans but anyone seeking to come to the United states of course they get\nHundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants every year that had been stymied by the Trump policies you see as his contract that the number of refugees allowed into the country their coffers of empty\nSo they have a material financial interest in this and\nIt's hard to think that these dramatic displays of people\nCrowding the border and that's what's happening now by the way apart from the Caribbean we're seeing a surge of the border and it's not individuals' it's families because they know that their ticket in you have a kid it's a ticket into the country and they can't refuse and I can't separate you\nSo you have a catch and release policy happening where they're coming across the border we're taking their names of releasing them into mainland America\nYour thoughts on that is that concern at all\nWill get into all of that with Pat Buchanan cliff thank you very much for the call out with also share some other uh reports with you hear how the Republicans might be able to hang on to the house it's close but it's a possibility Raymond ... sitting in for Laura Ingraham we're right back stay there\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nBill O'Reilly here my new book and the killing series is killing the ss\nHunt for the worst war criminals on earth it's about Nazi evil and those who enabled\nThe buckles on us Nazi hunters risk their lives to track down mass killers like Adolf Eichmann were protected by ruthless forces there is a reason why the killing books are sold more than twelve million copies so I Hope you check out killing the ss it's well worth your time\nAre you worried your identity could be held hostage you should be because ransomware does exactly that this is Tom Kelly studio of my id care making every American safer from the effect divides he served as a tall order but that's my goal so here's a tip the best things you can do to help protect yourself from ramps and we're just about up your computer often\nWell I think my ... in my view the Democrats have no agenda I mean the economy isn't very good shape extremely good shape unemployment under four percent and but when the economy is good the economy is usually not the issue something else becomes issue\nA and I think that the that the Democrats are really they're pushing this ... thing\nAnd and the the murder of him and this tremendously literate tale of murder and the consulate in Turkey\nI think too you know they're they they have no agenda and they're seizing upon this and tried to attach it to to Trump but this is a what exactly for him and\nHis the Democratic party's great agenda what is their contract with America what are they going to do more than they are going to do since the only house they can get I Believe is the one house of representatives of what is their agenda they don't have one\nThe big issue in this campaign is Trump\nRight no that's all they have I mean this is the he is he is the centerpiece and\nUh now you're seeing some pollster saying by internal polls\nAre the president's approval ratings are are surging and that the Republicans who squeaked out just enough seats to hold onto the majority if that doesn't happen if the Democrats take control of the house even by a slim majority what do you think happens what will the next year look like what's wrong with it\n[laughter] I'm sure did at all [laughter]\nBut now you've variation as far as the eye can see anything\nThat can enact anything they can't you know we revised Obamacare and send it over to Republican Senate\nThen send it down through President Trump at the White House so they can't do anything so they're going to investigate everything they will be looking into his tax returns they've got to be looking into any financial connections with Saudi Arabia that got to get the Boulder report there'll be looking into alleged\nYou know alleged a obstruction of justice and the Russia investigation all of these things and New York\nThe southern district of New York will be investigating and the grand jury here in DC so I think that's all that they've got going for the you know but they don't want to raise the real issue you've wanted if you ask him deeply what you believe it ought to be they would say you know the goal here is impeach Trump and lock him up\nBut you go ahead and announce that is your goal\nAnd you shrink your base your democratic base down to it's hard core which is insufficient to win the house of representatives to the degree that you rally those folks in the Democratic party on that issue\nYou don't get the broad based sort of the ballots and you live over in northern Virginia you know they've got a fighting chance on this congressional district here right if you did something like that it would kill it\n... kind of want to play something you you just mentioned the impeachment the I word impeachment uh last night\n... go to bed all three games a beta Rourke um\nWho is Ted Cruz's challenger in Texas did a town hall meeting and he had this to say [laughter]\nAnd you said in July that you would as a member of the house right now voted to impeach have you changed your mind I haven't according to the constitution that mean that the president has committed the crime the tree than primer bribery or a high crime and misdemeanor which one of those do you think the president has committed\nI wouldn't like in the impeachment to an indictment there there is enough there to proceed with a trial for a full vetting of the facts and to make the best informed decision in the interests of this country and our future\nYour reaction to that that does that help him and helped democratic candidates across the gun it\nStill didn't hear the charge\nYou exactly he dodged it\nDoes that help it doesn't help that are over ... it was in a and veterans got his own problems these nine or ten voyage down with six million in the bank outside mhm but I you know no I don't take it helps him I think\nWhat federal work it seems to me he's running short of heart left or very far left for Texas a course in Harlem for the Democratic party I'm beginning to wonder if he doesn't see himself as Abe Lincoln or lost the Senate race in Eighteen fifty eight and came back to win the presidency and and uh Eighteen shifting\nYeah well aside from heights there's very little commonality there that I think yeah I I don't remember on his name on a skateboard but maybe I missed that chap ah your\nYour final automatically put him in a corner you and put you on the record\nYear do you think the Republicans hold the house and Senate going into these midterms where do you think the populace is right now you know the the the the people out there who are elected term\nI think the I think over all that you would have to say that the Democrats are probably going to get to twenty three votes to take the house I mean that would be a dramatic victory over the Republicans and I think the Republicans are favored by even more to hold on to the Senate\nOr they've got to lose a number of races where they're hit right now to lose the Senate and so I Would say it's going to be a Republican Senate dealing with Supreme Court nomination appellate court nominees and it could be a Democratic House with all these investigations over us but I don't I don't necessarily believe\nThat it's a bad thing to have Nancy Pelosi's crowd and in charge of the house and doing all these things with the American people I don't think you're going to be enthusiastic about it especially if they've got great foreign domestic problems\nMhm you can always great to hear from you thank you for joining us and we will be in touch OK you take it easy Randy\nThank you that and er into old you are listening what is driving you to the polls this November are you is is there an issue it was the one idea\nThat you could not lose and you felt you had to to move on um I keep hearing it was cabinet all others\nAnd to to move on um I keep hearing it was capital others say they're concerned about the border still others say this mob mentality or you know we're going to play

they had been pop pollen up a little bit we want to make sure that you get the answers that you need right now we're going to Nebraska with Ron\nHas a little shower issue Ron welcome to the show and what can we help you with\nLike a little more than just a group out of my shower\nOh I'll tell ya you know um it seems like shower the let's say the shower experience as they'd like to say is getting less of an experience in some situations it is a a new shower old shower has it been a problem all along\nWe built this home sixteen years ago the uh the relive and joined curves people they only allowed three quarter inch flying off into the water to go to an age but they wouldn't do that uh-huh so I have three quarter to the hot water heater but\nFrom the hot water heater to the laboratories and there's a shopper ha ha ha ha but we have forty five percent or so they should be enough pressure I just\nI've taken out of the showerheads thinking that would help but it has\nA lot of times those slurry stricter as what you would never want to recommend that but certainly a lot of people will will um modify 'em the the flow restrict yours but if it's if it's six to eight years old um I Would think that there may be a little debris and there have you back\nOpen I'm clean it out of there wasn't oh there was a little black sentiment and things like that but not much\nI see okay um and uh so ... has the pressure steadily gotten lower I mean as as a\nNo actually it'll increase some decrease we're we're going water tower or what five blocks from my house so we should\nOur\nBlocks from from my house so we should have really good pressure and for some reason or other we just heard several neighbors say the same thing\nHa ha well you ... you know one of the things that uh we we had one of our listeners Rick I'm ... mention too is that they did to solve this problem which I thought it was a unique idea but still a little risky is actually taking a tank\nThey just had a water tank that they were able to purchase it was a thirty gallon tank\nAnd they actually position that\nIn the attic next to their shower and so they did a little bit of rerouting and so that the tank would basically stay full because it was pressurized but when they called upon the shower for water they had that gravity push that really divided now\nThey they taught the course it was all cold water\nSo they you know adult little balance same thing that you know re learning exactly where the ... needed to be in order to get that cold and hot water mix a hundred yes right but I mean that's a little bit of an extreme I'm\nYou know thing to do to do there but it whatever's restricting that may be very hard to find 'em sometimes it can be the shower valve itself which is not an easy thing to\nReplace ... have you ever try is it a single ... to ... to handle okay it's a single ever have you ever take have you ever taken that apart\nBut I have I have not the truth it's one of those that you are a little the restrict or down in the tub so that goes to show right\nRight because you can take that um\nThat single of course you will have to turn the water off to the house since you probably don't have a you know cut off just for the shower but you take that um cover off you take the handle off to cover off\nAnd then you're going to find a little cube in narrow little around whether it's a cube or whether it's a little round a controlled by all been there you normally it would have three different\nUm vow or three different little washers on it in so many times\nYou can have a little debris in there because what what it basically is doing is cold water hot water going into that little mixer and then it ... around and if there's any debris in there at all it's funny to talk about debris and water lines but it's it's in all of our water lines\nAnd yeah and a lot of times that's all it is maybe it's a little calcium deposit maybe it's just a little bit of debris from something that's causing that slight restriction which you would think\nWith forty pounds or pressure it's going to blow it right out of there are so many times it'll get rooted in there pretty well I Believe that's what I Would try on on on this one in and see Ron if you're able to to free up a little bit you might find that you know you might find that deposits in there but\nHere's what you need to do close the during so that does the parts go down the drain\nAs your opening up don't hesitate to take a few pictures with your phone so that you can see exactly how it's coming apart\nAnd then just take it real slow in easy and see if that is in um where it is I'll bet you'll find I'll tell you another thing I found a lot or those washers being dislodged\nJust slightly to where it's cramping it and maybe cutting that water pressure down by fifty percent might be surprised and taking that out replacing those washers putting it back in and you might end up with the kind of water pressure you need that\nShow I'm Wondering if you are right because uh coming out of the ... into the\nWhole list of water yeah yeah when so\nWhen you pick it up when you pick it up the other way then it's restricted also you know you want to make sure you take the showerhead off\nAnd turn the turn it on and just let it go for a while maybe even bumped the vow of a little bit and just let it really really slow I'm that way you know you you you might be dislodge him a little of that without having to do anything and then consider getting a new showerhead um you know because of my\nWife wants to one of those rain ... ... ...\n... yeah you're angry and I know it's it's yeah it's ... those aren't as nice as as you think I see those in hotels quite a bit and it just a quiet or again that shower experience but but some of the new technology with some of the\nPulsating type of a shower heads and some of these other things are pretty interesting how much water they can get out of a shower and really it appears to increase it a good bit but but give that a try Ron I'm sure you'll find that you can definitely step it up a little bit\nBut I'm pretty sure that I hadn't even thought of that I felt like it was all in the shower it no it's not there for the most part but I haven't checked the velvet than it is bloody\nAnd I'm sure we're getting plenty of water through the ... those are\nSo good and I'm sure you solve the problem already\nGood good well I certainly hope so Ron and now we can help you any other way just let us know when a have a great\nWeekend and thanks for listening to stay home on her radio you know those are the kind of things that you face and you you know he's one of those things that every single day\nYou wish you could do something about it you

Do you know I'll tell you what I'm you know I learned recently that over twenty five percent of Americans have some type of allergies\nAnd you know you get into your home and are so many people have really done well to insulate their home and seal up the ... they're home because it does say be a lot of money you know every day of the year winter and summer\nA but it also traps a lot of contaminants in there including the so the best way for you to help out on your allergies just keep the dust at\nDusted made up of things like\nYou know skin cells and pet standards also kind of gross anyway if you think about it I mean dust mites feed on those particles they thrive on linens and blankets so you don't really need to wash those items very often in very hot water replace pillows regularly or cover them where they anti allergic\nCover and uh the the the ... men make sure you're really dust frequently replace the air filter for your heating and cooling system regularly these things cost you almost nothing but a little bit of time if you want to go even further you might consider replacing\nAny carpet in your home with hard surface flooring material boy I'll tell you this is something that um I've seen so popular with the luxury of vinyl\nPlanks that uh we have been stalled and I'll tell you what we have a lot of great videos at today's home under dot com on installing\nThis luxury vinyl plank than uh the word luxury doesn't mean it's expensive is very practical for just about any type of room\nIn your home very do it yourself friendly if you decide to\nPut on the knee pads and get on the floor and insult yourself\nIt is a very easy way of completely change in your room and as we're talking about here it gets rid of a little bit more of the carpet because no matter how much you vacuum\nCarpet harbors more dust that are regularly mop floor so it's a lot of different ways that you can get rid of that dust around your home and don't underestimate the importance of having the proper air filter in changing it on a regular basis a lot of information Whitey known yet today's home under dot com\nAnd this little um it it um indoor air quality chip brought to you Bob Brown new tone or at writing\nOr air quality tip brought to you by her own new tone for at right now let's see if we can get right to the phones Evelyn is in Washington state Evelyn welcome to the today's somewhat a radio show\nThank you for having a good what's going on at your house there in Washington\n[laughter] oh really oh wow it's a lot more than I ever notice any own and I've been in about five or six calls uh-huh\nIt's accumulating the carpet in which I think and\nAll over the surface it's all over throughout the out now it's an unusual larger mouth\nWhile our our our listeners across the country are going to think we stack to these calls up here but I was just\nTalking about ah this very thing well let me ask you about your house um is it up on piers got across space underneath\nWe do have a space it\nIt's um it's actually carved into ill part of it and we do have a space however if we can walk a\nUnderneath that much and\nI actually went under the today went in today\nOkay so so you have a fair amount of space there and I'm now do you have any plastic on the ground\nIs some plastic however I noticed that there is some areas where it's uncovered\nOkay 'cause you know what happens so often I'm is when you have it happens with very dry soil as well as wet soil in that that water can migrate up into your home causing moisture mildew problems but along the same\nType of path you can have a very dusty conditions and what happens is your house some ... let me ask you in a more questions you have central air and heat system\nWe do okay so so you have a return air system in your home that is pulling air into and through a filter\nAnd then it's being filtered hopefully whale and then going through your duck court system to distribute the heat or the cool throughout the entire house\nSo that creates a pressure that that that a suction that's pulling from all areas of your home matter of fact a lot of people are surprised to know that every cubic foot of air in your home passes through that filter\nTwo to three times per hour\nThink about think about that so I have a cubic foot all this space all this air you have is going through that one little bitty innocent filter two or three times an hour now but it's also because of the pressure if that duck or if like your return air\nIs not sealed completely under the house or in the attic or wherever\nIt's pulling whatever it can grab\nInto the duck or and spread it in all throughout your house so that's one of the first line of defense is first of all make sure you have a good quality electric static filter costs you twelve to Fifteen bucks\nSure you're changing that at least two to three or at least every two to three months and and and and and then\nReally need to inspect that um have a air conditioning guy tell them what you're concerned about tell them that I mentioned that you might have some dust this being pulled into the system and can they please make sure that it's sealed properly\nBecause I'll bet that's what's causing that distribution of dust and in that poll liberation of dust\nThroughout the entire area that's usually what makes that happen\nOkay okay I Do have it in a nearly a we'll ask him\nThat I mean I really do think that's probably the case there and I like I say that filter or will make a big difference in trying to cut it down but if there's a branch or a leak somewhere else and what they called the ...\nArea of the air conditioning system that so that filter won't help you at all but a check that out have them check it out thoroughly and I'll bet you'll be able to cut down on your dusting time\nOh okay All right [laughter] and if you're a\nEvelyn thanks so much for being with us here on today's home or if we can help you any other way just let us know\nOkay thank you very much appreciate\nAll right our pleasure wow we're talking about um indoor air quality and then we have an email and we
