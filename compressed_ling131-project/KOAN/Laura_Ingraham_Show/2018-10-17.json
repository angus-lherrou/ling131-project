M. E. Y. E. R.\nThe discovery Institute is one of my favorite places these are a bunch of scientists who have the audacity to believe that there was actually a divine hand\nThey create are involved in the universe which is to me is the single most rational position one can have the notion that intelligence comes from intelligence is not intelligent\nThat was a new one like the I think we need a microphone here in the right you're not a I think\nWe gotta we work by my guest is Dr Steven Meyer and his latest book he is editor of is a collection of essays the is the evolution they scientific philosophy ... philosophical and theological critique\nThe notion that a God is behind evolution is a critique of that so let's go to evolution itself I periodically\nHave you on as far as I'm concerned I could have you on every day and I mean I I adore your wife or your\nWork and you have the requisite scientific background to to answer these issues this that you just reported that the royal society in London would have a conference on and tell me if my summary is is is fair\nIs it tenable to continue to believe in the Darwinian notion of a of a\nCreative power of mutation\nAnd natural selection as soon as the key proposition that that's right under consideration so so what you were led me to wonder stand and I was stuck on evolution much of my life I didn't really care\nI Believe in God is the creator and and the methodology did not interest me but I don't want to believe it or even be if not stick about something that just isn't a pill by scientists so what's the biggest weakness\nThe biggest weakness I think has to do with the problem of the origin of form new innovation of a new fundamentally new forms of life but that requires a prior innovation and that is innovation of information the creation of information since Watson and Crick in Nineteen fifty three\nWe have understood that information in digital form inscribed along the spine of the DNA molecule is essentially running the show at the cellular level and biology if you wanted if you want to build a new form of animal life\nYou've got to have new tissues and cell types but new cell types require new dedicated proteins disservice them and proteins are constructed on the basis of the information for character code that is stored in the DNA molecule so new form requires new information\nAnd the and as we've understood more about the digital nature of the information it really isn't it alphabetical type of graphic or digital in character\nAnd uh and we understand that by reference to say our own experience with computer code\nThe idea that you could randomly start to change very specific arrangements of characters that are designed to construct one thing and turn them into another message that will constructed another completely different thing it's implausible if you take a section of computer code and start randomly changing the zeroes and ones\nYou're not going to produce a new program or operating system you're going to introduce glitches and bugs and you'll ultimately destroy the function of the original sequence that you had\nAnd the genetic sequences similarly vulnerable to that kind of\nA random a mutation will change and yet the neo Darwinian invoke random mutations the ages of innovation the agent of creation when in fact it's either a an Asian of destruction or it can and introduce very minor preserve ... changes that might slightly weaker optimize\nOur eyes when I hear you say this I'm thinking of all the ... pre eminent scientists of the last hundred years\nWho have believed what you now say is not tenable what does that say if you are right why does that say about scientists\nThat science like uh every other form of human endeavor can be subject to groupthink\nOr to ... uh or it can be influenced by prior ideological commitments\nIn particular in the debate about biological origins there is a prior commitment to a materialistic approach to the question it's codified in a principle known as methodological naturalism\nAnd it says it if you're going to be a true scientist you have to limit yourself to strictly materialistic explanation for everything not just how nature ordinarily operates\nWhich would be quite sensible but where in nature itself came from\nAnd that principle Ben precludes the possibility of a ... a precludes consideration of designing intelligence and yet what did we discovered at the foundation of life we've discovered digital code\nA Bill Gates the our local hero in a in in the Seattle area says the DNA is like a software program will be much more complex than anything we've ever device but where does suffer come from it comes from a mind we have all sorts of indications of intelligent um\nActivity at the foundation of life we've got digital code we have a a complex information processing system we have nano technology miniature machines that um are a mind blowing in their integrated complexity we've got circuitry controlling the expression of genetic information\nAnd know persuasive Darwinian explanation has been offered for any of this type of complexity the integrated or organizational complexity at\nThe most likely all some aberration was born and it prosper it because it was better than the previous ... a ...\nA a ... a plausible theory in the nineteenth century was formulated by Darwin before we knew about the complexity of life at the microscopic and molecular level\nOr in the wake of that theory up a a principle of reasoning was codified among scientists namely that we must limit ourselves to materialistic ... explanations of the kind that Darwin a promulgated and then as the evidence from the Nineteen fifties sixties and write to the president has begun to stack up\nEvidence that would in any other realm of experience point to a designing intelligence that the principal of methodological naturalism has prevented many scientists from considering the obvious right Haitian\nOkay I'm totally on board the ... the question that you have taught me to to ask is or even the people who only believe in\nMy friends the bruising battle over Supreme Court nominee

or something from nothing the universe from nothing the universe from nothing\nSo obviously I'm not going to knock anything he said he's not here but I remember if it was a moment when he said well because I said look I don't have I don't have anywhere near scientific knowledge but I I Do think I think clearly and logically\nYou're claiming we get something from nothing and that that is inherently not possible and then he said well it depends on your definition of nothing and that's one of my gave up\nI said a professor nothing means no thing I mean it was I wrong I mean is nothing nothing\nAs a matter of logic you're absolutely right what professor crosses talking about is the theory of cosmology or a cosmological model known as quantum cosmology in which the universe is thought to emerge out of the laws of quantum physics\nRights away I he said that when I asked him where did the last\n... from right and there's some other there's some other things we could ask you about those those laws first of all\nLaws of physics do not produce matter if they describe the interactions between matter so there's lots of good big category mistake okay so the law of momentum exchange describes how billiard ball a knocks into billiard will\nBe if you've got billiard boss doesn't it describes the interaction between preexisting matter\nUm that's one problem another problem is that the this ... pretty heady stuff but it's based on some of the phenomena in quantum physics the physics at the very weird when things are very small\nAnd um it it is basically a probabilistic law\nAnd it's it's ... it's created in the law itself something we're not sure if it's really true or not but it's it's been generated isn't by an analogy to known quantum physical processes where\nUh things ... particles can act like ways in ways can act like particles in the end the probability that particle being in any one place is defined by these this just last quantum mechanics of this equation the Schrodinger equation\nWell they've tried to use that same kind of math to say well ... maybe there's a whole bunch of different ... there's a question that to describe all the different possible universes that could exist okay right\nWe the ... verse okay I guess that in one moment they have another thing to\nThe big bang disturb them got on the straw that's what this is all about to circumvent the implications of that man right because it means there was a beginning and batter wasn't always here right God was always hearing this drives them crazy okay\nSo how do you answer they they now argue there the big banks will go on indefinitely and have gone on indefinitely\nA that's a different cosmological models ... your ... I Know that yet finished let's finish the thing of the ... really interesting okay because what they basically want is they want a mathematical equation to explain where our universe come from\nIf our universe can be shown to be a reasonably probable outcome of what they called the quantum wave a question or the quite ... corn way function\nThen they think they will have explained the universe but one of them are astute proponents of\nQuantum cosmology Alexander ... said well wait a minute math we were saying that math is basically producing the material universe but he says math is something that exist in a mind or we therefore saying that all the material universe there's actually a mind\nAnd that's not a very congenial a conclusion because there's basically a materialistic Lee inspired cosmology the other thing that's really strange is that in order to solve the equation that gives you a universal wave function out of which our universe might be a reasonably probable outcome\nThe the the a theoretical physicist has to impose were called boundary constraints on the degrees of mathematical freedom of this equation which is actually in hurting information into the math to get the outcome they want\nDoing their job in one of them and Jamie ...

United states has to live and work in the United states\nAnd you get released you've got to let you want it and it's a it's an incentive for those individuals to come to the United states we need to cut off their legs as the president has attempted to do it but Congress has stepped up the task and [noise] you know frankly the polls is on them\nYeah I mean Congress can do a few basic things\nFairly quickly if it wanted to\nTo stop the magnet number one mandate e verify every employer must have e verify and it has to be enforced strictly with significant fines that's one thing they can do what are they are a few things could they do that are simple for our listeners to understand\nThey could expand the amount of detention that's available to the administration in order to detain these families so that their cases could be hurt quickly so that the good cases can be separated out circa ... and those folks can be returned to the United states\nThey could also ah you know change the asylum laws so that if you pass through countries where they granted asylum like Guatemala like Mexico\nThat you would be expected to apply for asylum in those countries before you come to the United states and the kid you keep hearing that some of these you know individuals have legitimate claims\nIf they do they should be applying for asylum a lot of well they should be applying for asylum let's hope but there are in addition ah the ah the administration is taking steps to end the floor as a rule where a company daily in a ... has to be released after twenty eight days\nUm Congress can you know step in and they can end the floor as a\nSettlement agreement or if they'd like but again\nThere are free or judges right they're afraid of being called mean spirited that's what they're afraid it doesn't matter if how many instances of hideous you know criminal acts had been committed by illegal aliens even DACA kids which we've also documented on the show doesn't matter\nFor them it doesn't matter it's a it's a it's an emotional manipulation game they want to they want to pull the heartstrings America and put these Republicans back on their heels city okay you want to put babies in cages you want to put babies how many times we hear kids in cages kids in cages we heard that phrase over and over and over again\nIn ... we do separate children from adults very briefly a U.S citizenship or a U.S customs and border protection does that\nIn order to protect the children but then we move them very quickly into the best facilities that we have available coverage can provide more money for that but here's really what it comes down to the trip that these people take to the United states is so horrendous rapes robberies murders\nUnder the Obama administration when they had similar uh programs we saw NPR run articles about this we saw National Geographic of all things\nUh wrote an article about this but you don't actually hear about that anymore all you see a little girl a pink shirt standing next to her mother crying as border patrol agent make sure that her mother doesn't have any cubs fan the child travel through the night without food\nHow in the world any parent can subject their child but this horrendous for United States is beyond ...\nWell when you when you see these\nFour thousand people now just grows and grows and grows this caravan\nPaying for this I think there is no way when you have a per capita income of you know two thousand five hundred dollars in\nHonduras each individual can pay the seven thousand dollars up to ten thousand dollars it costs to get to the United states so someone's footing the bill here who is it do you think\nI I I Wish I knew I Wish I had some idea and quite frankly I expect administration to be looking into that a lot of these people though\nAre you doing this because they believe that the that the amount of money that they have to borrow or get from somebody or that they're given\nA they can pay back once they work in the United states for very brief period of time and unfortunately the economics probably work in their favor it this is another and said that the game went back to verify that people can't work they will come\nAnd if they can't pay back their smugglers are definitely not going to run the risk of being smuggled to the United states\nWe need mandatory verify that the keys the kingdom but until we get to that point we need to change that we need more immigration judges to hear these cases as quickly as possible so that was a good cases can come in but the vast majority of the bad cases are can be returned\nTo eighty percent or eighty eight percent and some I guess some cases by some measures of those who apply for asylum\nFrom Central America are denied yet only five percent of those who are denied actually are ever going to leave the country is that the case is that is that a proximity right\nThat's approximately correct we're talking that you know upwards of nine hundred thousand my God\nWe're in the United states under five orders for mobile they've received their due process or it's not like they're waiting for their their their hearing everything that they had coming than they've had but they remain in the United states we continue to work here again we have no verify there's no way to verify that there are leading in\nIce chips lacks the resources to go out and find ones and twos these are people\nYou you put on top of that the sanctuary laws places like California and localities where you know people under five orders removal\nYou know are apprehended by the police it shows up on the rap sheet that they're under a puddle order removal and yet they get released a in back into society and they're not return to their home countries\nBut everybody needs to work together in order to make the system work with any one part of it breaks down the entire system breaks down and that's what leads to a human tragedy that we see along the border\nMark Krikorian ah your colleagues on a with me last night art and he said that the folks in a Guatemala who are being interviewed by these\nFolks in a Guatemala who are being interviewed by the you know the MSNBC traveling reporter travels with the migrants\nHadn't been coached yet so all he settles luck I Want to work in the United states and they're just no jobs here and\nNever mentioned anything about persecution and mark said well that's because he hasn't gotten to Mexico where all the court coaching really occurs that's where you get do you know the paragraph that you have to say no matter what when when when authorities interview you so the script for everybody man woman and child seems to be\nThe same and I fear for a fair for my family like I'm going to be killed by the gangs which is why sessions wants to remove domestic abuse and gang concern correct from the asylum a consideration\nHe already has done that through a\nHomeland security bill I think it was attached to that bill\nYeah but you know here's the other problem or this is the next year that's going to drop\nAbout Seventy five percent of all people who claim credible fear bound to have credible here even though the asylum numbers or a ... as you mentioned before\nThe problem is that if people allege that they have suffered or fear or something then\nUh they get referred over for torture bench claim back in Nineteen Ninety nine the Reno a Justice Department gave authority over a claims that of the convention against torture to immigration judges even though it might be years before an individual's removed from the United states\nDa chest needs to give that authority back to er at the Justice Department needs to give that authority back to ... chest so that they can make the determination\nWhether someone's going to be tortured white before that person will leave the United states because that's really the critical point\nWell and also uh as as here someone else made the point when someone claims domestic abuse there is no way for us to verify that even if that was a legitimate reason I'm horrible thing\nBut think about the people were going to be bringing into the country from all over the world it's it's well it's domestic abuse I'm afraid of domestic abuse well it hasn't even been investigated in their home country how are people to investigate\nLocal domestic violence concerns from an immigration proceeding in or a review in Texas or Arizona it's just ludicrous\nIt's even worse than that because there's a regulation replace that actually prevents the United states government with best a gated whether or not\nThat claimed took place in the home country nothing that's contained asylum application can be disclosed to anyone outside of that asylum proceed we'll leave very limited exceptions none of which would apply in these cases\nAre in the turned back at the border that's the other thing we have to be able to expedite which means even to non contiguous countries or if you're from Guatemala we need to change the law doing not so we can do immediate border turned backs like we can with Mexicans\nYes and a under a the TV puree the trafficking victims protection that we have actually a handover on accompanied alien minors to ha chess and Asians a department of the United states government really doesn't\nDo this for a for a living\nAnd yet you know Congress back in two thousand and sue decided that age which I should have the responsibility and they don't do it very well its history a show so yeah we need to change the rule for people from contiguous countries Mexico or Canada we don't get that many meetings\nChanged\nOne family CGI on\nThe house they didn't know how many ...

private jet\nTo beg he began to cut ... body up on the table in the study while he was still alive the\nTurkish source says the killing took seven minutes he said\nAs he started this member of the body to ... put on earphones and listen to music he advised other members of the squad to do the same they said when I Do this job I listen to music you shouldn't do that to\nTo beg he was recorded saying the source told me he\nA three minute version of the audio tape has been given to the Turkish newspapers some bar but they have yet to publish it\nA Turkish shores told the New York times that to Begay was equipped with a bone saw\nIs listed as the president of the Saudi fellowship of forensic pathology and a member of the Saudi association of forensic pathology they wants to get his credentials out there in case anybody doubts that he has the ability to do this sort of thing\nIn two thousand fourteen a London based Saudi newspaper interviewed to beg you about a mobile clinic that allows corners to perform autopsies in seven minutes to determine the cause of death of harsh pilgrims\nHarsh pilgrims occasionally they have stampede Zen hundreds or trampled to death so you want to be able to do a quick uh autopsies you know\nThe newspaper reported that the mobile clinic was partly designed by two biggie and could be used in security cases that require pathologist intervention to perform an autopsy or examine a body at the place of the crime\nNow that's a that's more or less it from um in terms of the details from the what they're being told on and and it it sounds credible enough it passes the smell test it it makes sense\nAnd I you know I Believe that uh that sounds reasonable enough now what um\nWhat the United States is supposed to do in response to this is where it begins and and again where it begins to get evidence first let's not put the cart before the camel here\nThe reality is that we don't have a conviction here we don't know with a hundred percent certainty although it looks extremely likely that this Fifteen man team went in there and killed him\nThat looks extremely likely there is no body it appears there's there are reports any way that they used ass it\nOr hold so they called in the wolf they called it hardly guy tell and ah they created the s a bad thing to do away with the ah the parts and there's this story also that the Saudis the team recorded it\nWhich would be pretty gruesome too but perhaps to show to whoever it is that sent them\nTo be satisfied it reminds me of one of the attempts to assassinate Adolf Hitler or one of the unfortunately unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler the the the ... the conspiratorial were rounded up and they were executed as you might expect\nSome were allowed to commit suicide in certain cases but they executed the number of the conspirators\nAnd Adolf Hitler couldn't be present for at least a couple of the executions so they filmed the executions for him so that he could see them later at least a couple where they hang up or Hitler's enemies with piano wire\nAnd a Hitler wanted to watch the films of this so is print psalm on the the uh the culprit here behind the curtain\nQuite possibly and perhaps quite probably that said there's a lot of Palestine trigger around there\nThat said\nThere's a lot of Palestine trigger round there these days you know he turned the rich hotel in Riyadh into a prison and through a bunch of his cousins in to a luxury sweets or that they were not allowed to leave they could get room service uh but uh you know it was it in Saudi Arabia for your print such like prison\nAnd and I'm\nA there are a lot of people are out to get the prince\nThere are a lot of people who are out to get the prince\nAnd Jamal to show you wrote articles that were very critical and it's possible that the prince drunk with his own power decided that this was the best course of action wouldn't surprise me at all\nHow yeah bought it wouldn't surprise me at all if there was some nefarious behind the scenes effort to destroy the prince in Saudi Arabia by whatever means necessary\nSo I just wouldn't go round counting all your chickens and leaping to conclusions as to whether or the crown prince is behind us not to defend the crown prince by any stretch of the imagination and it's just that you don't have all the facts yet and leap to conclusions when it comes to\nWhat is presumably a murder investigation is I'm\nNot when I'm In the habit of doing I'm a fact based life form that's what I Do sects\nAnd NBC MSNBC CNN they're not all

everything aren't they aren't they something to behold\nThey distract themselves and then they accused the president of trying to distract them by setting out a tweet because he's never sends out tweets unless he wants to distract them\nAnd I don't know what they want to be distracted from this time but it turns out they're very easily distracted I got some advice for the news media who keep complaining about the president distracting them\nStop being so easily distracted the matter with the people what are your cats playing with a ball of yarn when Joe Biden walks into the room with a

Press\nAnd he dared compare the Saudi situation to Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing and they did so correctly and accurately and writes like a but that didn't get depressed from having a little bit of a sea fit going into it too easy I think they're in a bit of a to Z\nHowever that said there are a lot of remarkable things going on oh and we have posted I talked I told you about the article

Saudi regime\nAnd and that's standard protocol with these guys because that's the way that they are\nSo the news media's pushing the president over Iraq and say well we know what happened the news media always knows what happened that they know that with Brett Kavanaugh he gave those girls quite loads and Nineteen eighty something and then they stood outside the door waiting in line for gang rape pulling the train on teenage girls\nAre with braces and thick glasses because that's what happened to the news media said that's what happened here it is\nThis is this is it and uh you know so these are not the best people to put in charge of judging whether something passes muster whether the facts have come together and not\nA but they want the president to overreact and uh it looks like the president is actually\nA struck a pretty good balance the news media doesn't approve but\nThey don't approve of the sun coming up in the age of Donald Trump in the White House so I wouldn't worry

media harping on the show\nOh fairly it up and said you're guilty until proven innocent I don't like that we just went through that real justice cabin off and he was innocent all the way as far as I'm concerned so we have to find out what happened that they don't want to find out what happened there already know\nNow that's good news and the only period that we took off from that\nRanking was the years where Iraq Obama was president United States already had a recession to deal with and it was the worst recession since the last big recession in the depression which was\nA you know never go and that was a recovering the FDR recovery which never happened there was no FDR recovery\nSo we've got that going for us now get a load of this from market watch used to belong to CBS I think they sold it\nUs job openings hit a record seven point one million exceeding number of unemployed Americans what's that we have more job openings than we have unemployed people yes that's exactly right\nFurthermore as Jeffrey bart cash at marketwatch writes Americans are quitting their jobs at fastest pace in Seventeen\nYears not you'd say well what does that have to do with any why would people quitting their jobs to be a positive indicator it's a very positive indicator\nYou know why because they're confident that they can go get another job\nIf you're afraid that if you lose your job you can't get another job then you hold on to your job blankets a life raft because you want to keep the electricity on because little Kim is going to need some porridge and the bowl and at Christmas Time he's going to need GI Joe with kung fu grip\nThat's another Eddie Murphy weapons and and [laughter]\nAnd uh so people hold onto their jobs but in a very strong economy people say screw this job take this job and shut up I can go get another job and you know what that means\nThat means employers are going to look more fondly upon their employees are as Democrats call us workers and they're going to say well we can't afford to lose people in this job market we might lose people so we are going to have to be more generous [noise]\nThe number of job openings in the United states rose slightly to our record\nSeven point one for a million in August reflecting strong growth and the economy and the best labor market in decades now this is not the White House putting up this press release Mrs marketwatch not a conservative outlet\nJob openings top seven million in July for the first time ever\nLet me just pause there for a second revised figures show\nAnd they increased again in August President Trump was quick to tell the record level of job openings though he actually cited a lower number so even when he got he got it wrong or you got it wrong because there are more job openings than he said\nThe jobs still waiting to be filled meanwhile easily exceeded the number of people officially classified as unemployed\nThe government previously said six point two three million people unemployed in August job openings topped the number of unemployed for the first time in march based on government records going back to two thousand\nThe gap has now widened to her record nine hundred thousand you're the word record here again and again and again\nThe economy is that in sway go it is booming it is going wild and the news media isn't going to tell you about it because it's good news for Trump and Republicans in their mid term elections coming up\nAnd they want to make sure that the Democrats do as well as the media can make the Democrats do so they're not going to talk about how great the economy is and how everything's booming and how many records are being set all over the place on the economy\nHere's another one oh and ... also given my this is your you remember that the Democrats\nAnd you have the ... thing right now the ...\nWhen they were a bum rushing Obamacare through on a street party line in the middle of the night on a holiday weekend oh what a shame that whole thing was the news media loved it\nThere are very very corrupt Nancy Pelosi was out there saying that Obamacare Obamacare would liberate you from your job you wouldn't have to be tied to your job you could go out and become a poet or a harmonica player on the street corner and realize you're a lifelong dream of\nBeing a nothing nobody a useless not settling on the tax payer teach which is what Democrats love they want more of those because those are all Democrat voters nanny below sea\nWith the ... aren't you know I Am now it's the meals that fast or someone you want to

you're going to have to be job locked or you can play the ... street corner and everyone mullah view of the world will be the path to your a homeless shelter in the store front of an abandoned [noise]\nUh I Know there is now the reality is that President Trump forget about this left wing economic stuff and you get a a it's an entrepreneurial bill because\nOther people are paying for your health care and you're getting at subsidized by people that go to work\nSo you can play the Jews harp on the corner I was like the Jews are what's with that is just so they call it ... and uh and that's what the Democrats were going for with Obamacare apparently that didn't work very well and uh hey what did what did your health insurance go up to 'em\nWhat a disgrace but now a Donald Trump's economic plans have actually created a situation where many many millions and millions of people are not job blocked job blocked\nIt's a you know is that ... that job blocked or [laughter]\nDental damn I don't know what their their job blocked nobody's job blocked a about Obamacare was going to liberate us from being job lock\nAnd now the reality is the Democrats and Obamacare didn't liberate anyone from being job block they're just redistribute wealth and stole from one group of people to give to another group of people like a criminal Robin Hood fakes ah so they can buy votes of stupid people\nWho want free stuff and ah you know it's the opposite of an entrepreneurial bill but that's what they say that you don't do the job on\nNo job locked well millions and millions of Americans thanks to President Trump\nAnd again the timeline is two thousand eight that we were no longer the most competitive and now we are again what changed what we were the most competitive under George W Bush than we had that Wall Street thing and then Obama became president and way we're not in the most competitive and now we are again what do you think that is\nI Can't imagine [noise]\nHere's

inherent to the company to four point zero eight to one that's two four four zero eight to one [noise] from the moment you realized you\nForever changed a little moment\nTrying to wean [noise]\nWhen you need a\nCommon my Twenty one twenty nine [noise]\nWho was the best healthcare system in the world and why lawyers each in policy expert at Stanford has the answer and the newest video from ... university you see the ... dot com where we teach what is his home\nWhat you just heard\nWere on the flip repulsive\nRule is giving a preview videos that come out in about two weeks on immigration and it's terrific\nTucker Carlson is my guest he has written just now what has come out ship fools\nAm it's about how the elites are hurting the United states and and that goes just across the board\n... let me let me give you a headline from today and and I would like you to tell me if if that is related to your thesis okay a ... year it is okay so here it is half of us births\nAre out of wedlock now for ... ... ... over forty percent up from ten percent of Nineteen Seventy does this have anything to do with the elites\nWhat's at the core of it I mean by the way that the disaster not simply on a moral level though I think it is but on a practical one their range of social science that make the indisputable point children particularly boys raised\nIn a single parent homes by their mothers are much more likely to fail in school and to fail in light to develop addictions to wind up in prison they make less than we're likely to be the worst or have adequate lecture themselves I mean there's there's no upside at all and so if you're running the country and you have an actual interest long terms that\nAre very concerned about this and you're going to do whatever you can to make it better Arlene the Republican Party so focused on marginal tax rate they don't feel that sort of the crop and ... they can't get all you know you don't want to sound like Jerry Falwell so don't say anything about it\nAnd on the Democratic side single mothers are the court their base single mothers are much more dependent on government of course they tend to be overwhelmingly Democrat and so the last thing you want to do when the last thing they do do is is suggested single motherhood is\nLess preferable hum than uh raising children two parent biological household so I'm both sides are kind of allied unintentionally in downplaying going this problem meanwhile the country how did you say one other thing\nThere is no single Parenthood in my neighborhood I live in an affluent neighborhood maybe you do to maybe some of your listeners do\nAnd you know that like Nineteen fifty five in our neighborhood nobody can of course there are no single moms on my street of course not because the ruling class understands that marriage is the key to prosperity and happiness\nAnd said they don't practice themselves their children don't practice it to really like divorce rates among rich people are very low the middle of the country it's the former middle class that is in in social disarray and this is a huge problem I'm not seeing anybody I'm saying\nIt is in in social disarray and this is a huge problem I'm not attacking anybody I'm saying if you really cared about the middle class you would be doing whatever you could to make it easier for people to stay married and raise children intact\nSo okay there was a vice president Dan Quayle you may recall and he spoke out about Murphy Brown the TV character who had a child out of wedlock and he was buried by the national media by academia et cetera so I think\nThat Republicans incorrectly but I think Republicans got burned and they realize a we talk about social issues we're doomed\nBut ... but then you wake up one morning you're exactly right that is what happened I was ... feet from that moment until now so I came from what you just said that that includes and they grew but then you wake up one morning and you realize you know tax rates are actually and I'm for lower tax and other taxes but\nThey're relatively easy to change you just need a majority vote in the Congress and the president willing to sign it what's very hard to change the culture and the structure of the family and if that's destroyed you know it takes\nYou know generations to fix it if it can be fixed up your civilization will collapse so Republicans\nKind of missed the actual story which is social issues are the issues you're in the army and you're a civil society grow out of the kind of life you were living that's what they should have been focused on and because they're dumb\nAnd cowardly and they listen to the advice of a couple of overpaid and unwise consultants\nThey didn't do that and I think the smart ones regret it now\nThe smart ones are what are they regret it now oh really know what what leads you to lead you to think that\nProbably ... I mean you look around Washington and you know most conservatives in DC work at nonprofit think tanks\nAnd there are a lot of really great people in nice people who work at the same tax but they've consumed billions of dollars in contributions over the past forty years in America has not become more conservative and the smart ones are asking well where do we go wrong\nAnd it's not that they're not smart or they didn't try hard or they didn't have the best intentions they get it the best intentions but they were focused on the wrong thing\nWhat you should care about is the way people live the family is the very center sleep Adam in matters the court building block of everything and when that collapses there's no hope of doing anything positive so and they ignored that and I think they know that now\nWhere I ... I feel for me asking you this but I it's it's truly meant out of curiosity 'cause I respect you where do you stand on President Trump\n\nI think that\nUm well I mean just as an overview I agree with you know the the majority the strongest Wyoming majority of what Trump said\nUm I think Trump's genius I think you need to understand from crackers with Trump's genius is not in affecting policy change I don't think he\nHas control over the executive branch his portion of government I don't think he understands how it works I don't think he's going to learn I don't think he's good at getting his program through Congress I don't think Congress wants to get his program into law\nSo on that level Trump is a frustrating president to watch\nI think that Trump's value ingenious is in raising the question that no one else was willing to raise even think about as a kind of clarity\nVery simple clarity so he will say things like well wait a second you know we had NATO which was this great force for forty years but it existed in order to keep the Soviets were invading Western Europe Soviet so longer exist so why do we still have NATO\nWell I don't know what the answer is that's a totally fair question and one that we all should have been asking since Nineteen Ninety One when the Soviet Union collapsed or why are we still on Afghanistan Seventeen years later or why are we allowing the south Koreans cheat in this trade deal or why don't we build the wall with what's the answer speak slowly so I can understand\nThat is genius being brave enough and clear enough to raise the core questions that we ought to be debating long after Trump's gone those questions will hang in the air and my hope is that someone will answer them and solve those problems but first you need to you need to define what the problems are and I think the Trump has been really good at that\nAll right a final question because I Know I Know your time is limited so\nYou have on guests who I find a intellectually morally intolerable which is which is fine [laughter] okay so I just want to know where you see their name as listed on your program notes this is who well how long\nDo you think oh my God I Can't believe this or I dread this or you know what\nIs what I Do for a living and what the hell\nWhy put their names on that list so I'm I'm responsible for that and I just filed like literally a minute before I got on the show our story outline for tonight's show and so I'm involved on there no surprises to me because I'm involved in the beginning to the end by\nThe purpose in doing that is big Rosanna my belief that you need to hear the whole argument yes and you do that ...\nYeah I Try All right Dr bless you great to be with you and folks who is both ship a fool's Springer\nWill be blessed not all the individuals have beer all the families that's the basic you\nKnow the chair that I Want to bring to your attention is the ex chair one of my favorite products because I sit on it every day\nAt work when I Am in the studio in LA that is the chair I sit on we have like twenty chairs I could choose that's the one I sit on the X three is the new one it's mind blowing\nPhenomenal chair if you have an office this is the greatest office chair I Know of\nYour employees will thank you which is nice and end up itself you could simply try it out go to ... chair Dennis dot com\nThere is a thirty day guarantee so it's easy to send back you do show no questions asked X chair Dennis use the code Dennis a hundred dollars off and a three foot rest ...
