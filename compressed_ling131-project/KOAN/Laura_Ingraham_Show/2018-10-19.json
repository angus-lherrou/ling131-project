G ... GM forte who's running for ah for Congress out there in Montana um\nDoes this Walsh with you does this negate the mobs somehow out there a swarming Capitol Hill in your community in marches and rallies breaking windows antifa\nThat whole ah explosion of violence and hate we're seeing\nThe congressmen in a disagreement with a reporter who slams them down equate with these mobs were saying by the way that happened back months and months ago and\nIs Trump side comment I I think it's just a joke I and and to add to this not\nUnlike Lesley Stahl which we we decompose is doing or ... or a demystify that interview written decompose we broke it down for you last week earlier in the show\nAnd Lesley Stahl unwittingly I Believe no was really used by the president as as a stand in for the rest of the media\nAnd I think when when the media begins its echo and they stop having original thoughts but begin to echo one another the public utterly tombs them out in fact this is why I Believe so many Democrats gave the president a second look\nBecause they said wait a minute wait if all these people are against him and they're all saying the same thing what is this guy really doing and they looked closely\nThat may be what's happening now as we\nThese midterms I see some of these polls everything tightening up that naturally happens in the mid term or will there be a Trump effect let's go to cliff New Jersey what do you think clip what move do you what is moving due to the polls what's the issue\nTo the polls is after the Democrats I Believe or behind this march\nAnd drink at all you talking heads should find out who's paying for their ... who's trying to treat him coming north and you're going to find those Democrats and then ...\nAnd that will change\nMhm you're talking about the caravan which we're going to get into in a moment Pat Buchanan joining us uh yeah that caravan is moving up and look I'm there is certainly\nA an ecosystem let's put it that way there is an ecosystem of support for this caravan\nIndividuals who fund the housing the food the legal services for members of this carbon and not only the Caribbean but more\nI I don't know if you saw the story the other day Lutheran refugee services as well as ah the Catholic migration refugees services came up with a statement demanding that we'd be more welcoming to not only these ... but anyone seeking to come to the United states\nOf course they get hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants every year that had been stymied by the Trump policies you see as his contract that the number of refugees allowed into the country their coffers of emptied\nSo they have a material financial interest in this and\nIt's hard to think that these dramatic displays of people\nCrowding the border and that's what's happening now by the way apart from the Caribbean we're seeing a surge of the border and it's not individuals it's families because they know that their ticket in you have a kid it's a ticket into the country and they can't refuse you and I can't separate you\nSo you have a catch and release policy happening where they're coming across the border we're taking their names of releasing them into mainland America\nYour thoughts on that is that a concern at all\nWill get into all of that with Pat Buchanan cliff thank you very much for the call out with also share some other

the Democrats have no agenda I mean the economy isn't very good shape extremely good shape unemployment under four percent and but when the economy is good the economy is usually not the issue something else becomes issue\nA and I think that the that the Democrats are really they're pushing this ... thing\nAnd the the murder of him and this tremendously alert tale of murder and the consulate in Turkey\nI think too you know they're they they have no agenda and their season upon this and tried to attach it to to Trump but as as uh what exactly for him and\nHis the Democratic party's great agenda what is their contract with America what are they going to do more than ten they're going to do since the only house they can get I Believe is\nThe one house of representatives what is their agenda they don't have one\nThe big issue in this campaign is Trump\nRight no that's all they have I mean this is the he is he is the centerpiece and uh now you're seeing some polls are saying by internal polls\nAre the president's approval ratings are are surging and that the Republicans could squeak out just enough seats to hold onto the majority if that doesn't happen if the Democrats take control of the house even by a slim majority what do you think happens what will the next\nYear look like ... [laughter] I'm sure did health [laughter]\nBut now you're generally gauge as far as the eye can see anything\nThat can enact anything they can't you know we revise Obamacare and send it over to Republican Senate\nThen send it down through President Trump at the White House so they can't do anything so they're going to investigate everything they will be looking into his tax returns are going to be looking into any financial connections with Saudi Arabia that got to get the Boulder report there'll be looking into alleged\nYou know alleged a obstruction of justice in the Russia investigation all of these things and New York\nThe southern district of New York will be investigating and the grand jury here in DC so I think that's all that they've got going for the you know but they don't want to raise the real issue you've wondered if you ask him deeply what you believe it ought to be they would say you know the goal here is impeach Trump and lock him up\nBut you go ahead and announce that is your goal and you shrink\nYour base your democratic base down to it's hard core\nWhich is insufficient to win the house of representatives to the degree that you rally those folks in the Democratic party on that issue you don't get the broad based sort of the ballot and you live over in northern Virginia you know they've got a fighting chance on this congressional district here right if you did something like that it would kill it\n... that I Want to play something you you just mentioned the impeachment the I word impeachment uh last night\n... go to ... three games a NATO Rourke um\nWho is Ted Cruz's challenger in Texas did a town hall meeting and he had this this thing [laughter]\nAnd you said in July that you would as a member of the house right now vote to impeach have you changed your mind I haven't according to the constitution that mean that the president has committed a crime that tree than primary bribery or a high crime and misdemeanor which one of those do you think the president has committed\nI wouldn't like in an impeachment to an indictment there there is enough there to proceed with a trial for a full vetting of the facts and to make the best informed decision in the interests of this country and our seats for\nYour reaction to that that does that help him and helped democratic candidates across the gun it\nStill didn't hear the charge was\nHe exactly he died that\nDoes that help it doesn't help better over or can it was in a and veterans got his own problems he's nine or ten voyage down was sixty two million and the bad guy thing mhm but I you know no I don't take it helps him I think\nWhat federal work it seems to me he's running short of heart left or very far left for Texas a course in in parliament for the Democratic party I'm beginning to wonder if he doesn't see himself as Abe Lincoln who lost the Senate race in Eighteen fifty eight and came back to win the presidency and and uh Eighteen shifting\nYeah well aside from heights there's very little commonality there that I think you I don't remember honest Abe on a skateboard but maybe I missed that chap ah you'll\nFind a lot about it I don't know what I'm going to put him in a corner you and\nPut you on the record year do you think the Republicans hold the house and Senate going into these midterms where do you think the populist is right now you know the the the the people out there who are elected from\nI think the I think over all that you would have to say that the Democrats are probably going to get to twenty three votes to take the house I mean that would be a dramatic victory over the Republicans and I think the Republicans are favored by even more to hold on to the Senate\nThey've gotta lose a number of races where they're hit right now to lose the Senate and so I Would say it's going to be a Republican Senate dealing with Supreme Court nominees and appellate court nominees and it could be a Democratic House with all these investigations all the rest but I don't necessarily believe\nThat it's a bad thing to have Nancy Pelosi's crowd and in charge of the house and doing all these things with the American people I don't think they're going

that\nThat's right it's a ... she wants to be the speaker of the house\nBy again\nI I I Know it's not really shocking or run a there's a woman writes in playground drama drama to a\nDeer Carolyn here um we live in a world where boys got everything and girls are left rip the crumbs that her son was entitled to crash those girls only time in a public park\nAnd she says I Know I Can't legally keep her from a park which means she'd like to know that this this woman is perfectly typical leftist\nShe has been brainwashed by the insane bigoted divisive polarizing left that divides us along lines of race class and gender\nThis is on gender and gender and gender and gender and on and on and on\nBut this is a classic example this is the lefty believes that we should be divided up by race you're black you're Hispanic your European Caucasian you're Asian Asians you don't get anywhere near the front of the line at Harvard\nA black and Hispanic people you'd do Whitey or you just come in on a legacy affect everybody's treated differently based on their race\nEverybody's treated differently based on their gender the women must be believed unless they're accusing cute fellas center of Bill Clinton\nAccusing Republicans must be believed that's another level of corruption that they bring to those two\nShe believes that she should be allowed to discriminate based on gender because we live in a world where boys get everything on girls are left\nWith the crumbs she's a perfect pair of today's Democratic Party everybody's a victim she's a victim her daughter's a victim the boy is somehow a tyrant by virtue of is a gender and he should be discriminated against because [noise] this is Chris plants show [noise]\nNow if they agreed on a curve it should be for\nBut he admits that the news reporting on the DNA test was a complete joke and in the end he circles back and says but it's still shows that she's part Indian and what she's always claimed as true so ... again it makes no sense he he spends four pages saying everything we wrote about it was wrong\nEverything the Boston Globe wrote about it was wrong everything the RMC set about it was wrong although all they did was referring to in New York Times article and the New York times article made a point that the Washington Post now says is wrong because they'll sacrifice to New York times when they're defending Elizabeth Warren\n[noise] he types on behalf of his party which is the Democratic party of the United states America it's a press release for Elizabeth Warren masquerading as a fact check at a news organization which is in fact not\nAfter being done by President Trump puts all Trump's fault this is how it begins\nSenator Elizabeth Warren deem mass released the results of a DNA test on October Fifteen that indicated she had native on Native American ancestor now and again that they they they dance and skate around all of the fun facts that don't contribute to funny cause\nThe result which identified Native American DNA from six to ten generations ago were immediately misinterpreted\nAnd he's and then he says that they were misinterpreted by the Boston Globe they were misinterpreted by the Washington Post their own real smart they're they're the smart next that we um we keep our ear to the ground for what they have to say because they know\nThey're using the old noodle all the time up there it started with the Boston Globe report which initially indicated the test showed she was at best one thirty second Native American and possibly just won five hundred twelve Native American\nAfter confessing twice twice to a math error they confess twice to two different math errors but but\nLet's not get technical you're just a news reporter right the globe corrected the numbers to one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty fourth Native American that would translate to between Ninety eight point forty four percent and Ninety nine point nine percent\nNative American well that's right and that's the correct interpretation of this right isn't it oh not so fast they are and see now he wants to politicize it instead of making it about the truth\nThe RMC then issued a news release directing reporters to a two thousand fourteen New York times report that said European Americans\nHad genomes that were on average Ninety eight point six percent European\nPoint one nine percent African and point one eight percent Native American\nSo it sounded like Warren had less Native American DNA than the average European American yeah that's what it sounds like 'cause if you look at the New York times piece in the Boston Globe is that's what you might surmise if you whipped out your bum are calculator and did a little busy work with your digits there I'm thinking\n[noise] we even issued meaning the New York for the Washington Post we even issued a tweet along these lines\nAt a moment when the globe still indicated the range was between one thirty second and one one thousand twenty fourth now he just got it for a brief time it's true they only corrected the second\nFigure and not the first figure because they're not very smart this is this is the conclusion that must be drawn from all of this and I I drew that conclusion the day this came out because I started questioning the figures immediately as well\nAnd as did everyone else except the geniuses at the Boston Globe the Washington Post the New York times\nSo in any case the the Washington Post he goes on and on for four pages and in the end he gets to the Pinocchio test and you'll never guess that it's mostly somebody else's fault because terror liberal ... you know\nHe said Pinocchio test we're not trying to defend Warren's decision to release the test just to set the record straight about what the test shows the media bungled the interpretation of the results first they bungled the math and the results than they bungled the interpretation\nAnd and but all in favor of Elizabeth Warren let's not lose sight of that\nAnd then ... opponents used the uninformed reporting meaning the Washington Post the Boston Globe the New York times\nTo undermine the test result even further by introducing the New York times article from a couple of years ago\nWe fell into this trap as well this is the Washington Post confessing to the falling into the trap and we're too quick to send out a tweet not deleted said that they don't they just to delete their mistakes that they don't correct them\nThat made an inaccurate comparison we should not have relied on media reporting before tweeting\nThe Washington Post says they should not have relied on media reporting and you know what they're right there right about that they should not have allowed on a relied on media reporting by the Boston Globe or by themselves and and you know what Glenn\nI don't make the same mistake every day I avoid that ... that that pitfall that trap is one that I'm aware of\nEvery day when I get out of bed I'm Still rubbing the sleep out of my eyes when I say I wonder what the Washington Post is going to lie about today and then I pick up my paper which lands outside my door and my best girl and I laugh out loud and hall at all to be asked that you're phony baloney newspaper publishers every day\nBut keep in mind that the conclusion here is that the Washington Post said we should not have relied on media reporting\nFrom her words were never spoken I think that Glenn Kessler should there should be the Glenn Kessler award and on the loose ... block it will say we should not have relied on media reporting and and that would be the Glenn Kessler one side block sharp edges\nWarns Native American DNA as identified and the test may not be large\nIt ... it may be one one thousand twenty fourth and it's not Native American because they can't compare to Native American which he admits and page four of this and say that he wrote on behalf of Elizabeth Warren\nAnd and we know what we know what it is I got it right don't worry about me Glen I got it right because I didn't depend on your phone reports\nI got it right don't worry about me Glen\nI got it right because I didn't depend on your phony reporting because I read you every day and I know that you're not only crooked you're not very smart you get the math wrong and then you interpret it wrong then you change one statistic without changing the other statistic which means you're really incompetent when it comes to basic statistics\nAnd I knew a long time ago that I could depend on your orange DNA identify the test may not be large but it's wrong to say it's as little as one one thousand twenty fourth\nNo it's not no no you're wrong again I mean these people are just incompetence on intelligence an serious\nParty hacks that will say anything to do anything and when they're caught being wrong they come out to be wrong again\nHe just explained higher up in the piece that it is perfectly fair and square to say that on the low end it's one one thousand twenty fourth those are her numbers that she issued summer expert Carlos Bustamante who is a revered he's not really but they claim is because he did Elizabeth Warren's a test\nAnd and uh and then they so here we go\nIt's wrong to say as little as one one thousand twenty fourth or that it's less than the average European American no it's not\nIn fact reading your own piece that is in fact a perfectly reasonable conclusion to counter now it may be as high as one sixty fourth and it may be as little as one one thousand twenty fourth those are the numbers Glen there\nIn your own piece see if we can sort this out in your little brain and maybe tomorrow you can come back with a correction of your correction of your misinterpretation of your misunderstanding of statistics and facts\nSo they end up with this three Pinocchios all around including to our tweet your tweet it's not just your tweet it's all your reporting it's your home and and now it's this idiotic pays which once again misinterpret misunderstand send misrepresent the facts so thanks for that Glenn you're quite a guy\nThere it is and they give themselves the Washington Post give themselves three Pinocchios but they think they're sharing it with the Republicans because the Republicans one or two in New York Times article which the Washington Post says\nThey don't know what they're saying because the New York times article is fine and when you compare it to their Elizabeth Warren claim you come up with the accurate numbers which Glenn Kessler is trying to muddy the waters on because he's a crook\nAnd he's a Democrat water boy have water boy I let's go to the uh let's go to the telephones [laughter]\nHey want a boy let's go to a let's go to Lamar calling from the
