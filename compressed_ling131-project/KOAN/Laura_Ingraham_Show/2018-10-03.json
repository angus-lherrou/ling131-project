right through this let's go to I'm Melissa Missouri line what Melissa\nHi I just wanted to say I'm I've been on both sides I've been in in a doctor fourth position and I've been in jets Kevin opposition where um I was a tax on the left in a in a doctor's office in fact\nAnd then um another time a former friend accused me or spread rumors about me that I was sleeping with her husband and I had no way to protect my reputation and so I Would have believed her\nShe had come out with Kavanaugh's demeanor and said you crave you did this to me and if he had taken her to meet her and said oh I don't remember I don't remember what I did when I was at high school I Would have really the story but I didn't believe it\nI didn't believe her allegations from the get go just because of the timing of the letter and I want to start a match or on your show right now Dianne Feinstein must resign\nNah I appreciate it eight five five forty Laura oh let's go to Paul main real quick Paul\nI'm I I just wanted to say I think um\nTries to say so many people said a doctor for testimony was credible but that's because it's the polite thing to say it's the politically correct thing to say it's like saying Santa Claus exists I think\nAnybody that looks at her testimony objectively which they it wasn't credible and Mr Trump President Trump is willing to hope that balloon of the social why he's willing to say no Santa Claus doesnt exist we need to grow up and and I I just\nI I think that's you know I think that's what he's trying to do here but\nI appreciate it a five five forty Laura uh this is going to go down as one of the hardest fought confirmations and Supreme Court history if not the most difficult ah but in the end I think it's worth it you know why you can't reward people who make false charges you can't reward people who make allegations after\nThe process has gone through with no contemporaneous preparation who\nHave some type of axe to grind can't do it\nAnd same goes with these people showing up in the Senate and cornering people in elevators none of this should be allowed it's a game of intimidation they're playing it\nWe know people who practice emotional

women law has been perpetrated by the Democrats in this case\nYou know I'm Dr Ford whether you know I don't know the woman but she wanted this to be kept confidential and the Democrats exposed it they leak didn't expose it intentionally for their own purposes\nBut this is part of a bigger attempt by the Democrats to take this to a new level I mean the paid activists that or well right now or my wife and I were physically accosted at a public airport on Monday This week because of this\nThese people were paid by the center of public democracy or they get money from the open society foundation which is George Soros who was putting to listen to this more than thirty two billion billion dollars into this effort over the last couple years this is a bigger issue and it's not going to go away when we confirm Kavanaugh this week\nNow and I think ah you're exactly right I think it's time for conservatives to stop playing defense and everyone on their heels all the time like Jeff Flake or an hour in\nThe elevator and then you get these ladies are yelling at me it turns out the woman is a ... executive\nDirector of of the Soros are funded group as he said Center for democracy\nAnd I think it's time to turn the tables were again sunshine I knew who are you people\nWho are working for this organization you are carrying on and I think you could make the argument senator that are in maybe a good lawyer plaintiff lawyer could do this or just go to good litigation attorney could do this this is kind of a\nIt's a Rico deal like these groups are working together to deny other people their rights to movement free movement which is guaranteed under our constitution free association\nOr they're ... they're acting in a way to deprive\nOthers I I Would say of there are inherent civil rights and totally agree meant to intimidate\nI totally agree but listen to what the senators are doing to incite the crazies in this effort this is senator Cory Booker you just had him on their here's another one\nThis is Corey Booker please get up in the face of some congresspeople representative Maxine Waters they're not going to be able to go to a restaurant go to a gas station go to shop at a department store\nTheir absolute get up and absolutely harass them Nancy Pelosi I don't know why they aren't uprising all over the country I mean it goes on and tell me again while we shouldn't confront Republicans were they eat where they sleep where they work until they stop being complicit\nThis is outrageous law and if it if it doesn't do anything else that should serve to wake us up you're exactly right Democrats had been playing office for the last hundred years this time for Republicans to stop being a minority party in ... and and grow and grow up and\nYou don't have to grow up and become a you know stop playing defense this is this is the time right now\nA senator for do uh there's so much a that it's happening a which is positive\nOr in this administration the news has been a ... ... only negative uh because ... that's just where the media are they're not going to that I mean we had this NAFTA deal pass okay a or B or negotiate has to pass the Senate\nEveryone said this couldn't happen they said Trump was a big uh ... uh Obama ridiculed I'm gonna made his way this magical hours I'm going to renegotiate all these deals well didn't took actually work to do this like Nineteen months of work I and and you know you don't hear nothing of this huge alone milestone for this administration\nIt's huge but it's part of it is part of what's going on this this economy is growing at twice the rate it did\nUnder President Obama we have a new free trade agreement with South Korea were about how wall with Mexico and Canada Europe is talking about zero tariffs we have to pay stepping up and paying attention to us now we have a nuclear\nConversation going on with North Korea to to end up in the ... of North Korea this presents agendas working at all we talk about is what the Democrats want us to talk about that is what you're saying is that we need to be on the op is talking about what's working in his agenda before we get into these elections in a few weeks\nI I can tell you the senator no one's going to want to try to stop me moving in a public street or try to harassment or restaurant okay this is a new I tolerate that anyone comes up to my family and my kids\nThey they they better be they'd been it'd be really ready because this is a ... I'm not intimidated by some rich kid who lives at home with his parents than in his free time you know jumps on the move on dot org website to get his marching orders okay like go home to rich parents and and who pay for your your three square meals a day and you're you're\nYou know your your activism on the side I mean I just it just doesn't impress me I call these people right after their faces\nLaw that's where we're going to be under the this week and it starts right here in the United states at people who are supporting this actively encouraging in citing it we have a state representative that actually was involved in our altercation on Monday a state representative\nFrom Arizona okay of all places here in Washington these are not genuine ...\nOut of Dr Ford or anything else they are paid activists this is a George Soros conspiracy and it's time we wake up expose them in stand up and fight for our country because that's what's at stake here\nDo you think we have enough Republican money bags types\nTo counter the effort is dire and Soros because they're just pumping tens of millions of dollars and boom tour into voter registration and two are educating people in these training sessions on how to approach new voters\nUh this is you know they're going to the ... the new a Puerto Rican voters and in Florida and and land on line on them like oh Trump aides you and you had to throw the Republicans out in Georgia you see this tight governor's race which is really disturbing to Stacey Abrams ...\nLost weight or Georgia could elect a left wing Stacey Abrams to be governor great state of Georgia\nThis is what you were saying earlier one of the one of the good by parts of this is I think it's a wake in the Republican base\nA was a little pass it particularly in Georgia maybe this year but I'll tell you this\nUm that race in Georgia has drawn thirty million dollars from um [noise] uh Mike Bloomberg and ... and two other California investors what they're doing is they're California investors and New York donors are trying to sneak into Georgia instill that governor's race because they believe that's the way to the presidency and twenty twenty to get those electoral votes down there\nAnd it's just not going to happen we're not going to let that happen Laura\nI'm David Perdue a hearing the lowering them show a Jeff Flake yesterday seemed to kind of shift the goalposts a little on Kavanaugh or maybe it was just commenting on his overall demeanor with the committee let's listen I was very troubled\nJust commenting on his overall demeanor with the committee let's listen\nI was very troubled by the the tone of the of the remarks or the initial a defense that a judge ... capital gave a ... was something I Hope that I Would sound that indignant if I were a if I felt that I was unjustly\nMaligned but then it went on and the interaction with the members\nWere sharp and partisan and that concerns me\nA year reaction was concerning to you Kevin ... getting in their face of a older cloture\nFloor he did exactly what I Would have expected him to do he was in ... and he should have been listening to what these guys are saying Chris Coons says if judge Kavanaugh seeking a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court\nAnd who I think now bears the bears the burden of disapproving these allegations the presumption of innocence has been a trashed in this whole process is not convenient for the Democrats I mean they talk about him being Cory Booker again cause an evil\nOr the other one said a a Yale alum said people will die I mean the vernacular here has risen to a level that we haven't seen in decades Laura and it's dangerous Republicans had better not be asleep at this because these people are now mobilized they're funded\nAnd quite frankly this is just the ... the tip of the sphere of water are there ... there are more activity I actually\nA Center for do in Georgia just going back briefly to this very tight governor's race\nUh what is your sense what are the people need to know I'm again this was a poll by landmark\nPretty decent polling outfit I likely voters um and it was basically a forty five forty five dead heat or this governorship it's very important for so many reasons the state of Georgia a and the growth economic growth and George has been very strong ah but what could a left wing governor due to that growth\nWell here's what they what she's saying she wants a single payer and she won't always give away programs that would cause a state tax has to be tripled this is the most extreme liberal progressive candidate that Georgia has ever had and she's getting funded by a all these outside donors not donors in Georgia by the way\nInto what's happening is all of this conversation about war women everything else is can do the issue Georgia right and it was rated the best state in the country and what to do business and she wants to tear that doubt\nWe have a great Republican candidate Brian Kemp is go to bake a great governor and Republican so they get the vote out we will win that election\nI think that uh the people of Georgia and maybe they've gotten a little uh a little bit of an awakened awakening during the entire cabinet ideal I think camp should make this a huge issue down there and push push this uh the Stacey Stacey Abrams enough just come out in the cabinet thing\nBut I Would push a right to the wall and on nothing I mean it in the figurative way not literally I said don't start talking about you know you can't say anything anymore everyone's in every little word you say like slice and dice buddies left wing groups again funded by George Soros hateful little people in their basements\nUm but I I Hope they continue to preface issue because I think

allegations by Julie sweating neck I got an update on that OK let's check that box up let's look at the water and the New Yorker article who said she wasn't sure [noise]\nBut it's not clear that that's even real she said Kevin who is president the party's Julie never said anything about being sexually assaulted raped gang raped or having sex against her will ... said she never mentioned Brett Kavanaugh in any capacity\nHe said that when he was running for Congress in Nineteen Ninety six he called Julie sweat Nick's father to try to get back in contact with Julie to ask her help with the campaign quote\nWhen I talk to him Julie sweat next father when I talked to him about possibly bringing Julie ... to help with my campaign he told me she had psychological and other problems at the time ... said\n... submitted a statement to the committee under penalty of felony if he's lying\nMichael ... the creepy porn lawyer representing Julie sweat ... said the letter from Canada is desperate and called on the FBI to interview both cat her and sweat Nick they just want to keep expanding and add more people to the list\nWho's the creepy porn lawyer said don't let her from Dennis ... is garbage the G O P is desperate yeah it's the GOP that's desperate\nThe allegations he makes are false and without any basis as opposed to her allegations of gang rapes going on for years that little suburban parties in Washington and nobody came forward we\nDemand that the FBI interview my clients and him and that anyone found submitted false info to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law\nI think that's a good idea I'm all in favor of that I've already talked about that and that would include your clients and it might include you creepy porn more speaking of which Alan Dershowitz says that if Julie sweating to glide she should be tried for perjury and sent to prison and that's what he said\n[noise] Alan Dershowitz a law professor emeritus at Harvard University professor to all of the like half the players and this this grand stage play\nHe was a law professor at all of them let's go to a legit and ... and he's the one who famously Dershowitz yeah Ted Cruz as a student and he said he was one of the most brilliant students he's ever had in his entire many decades long career teaching law at Harvard\nAnd um and also brought about all went to Harvard law school and he was asked well what about Rocco Baba and he said something like well a bronco by my tended also\nLet's go to the phones let's go to a let's go to Ken in Centerville, Virginia Ken you're on the Chris plant

allergy and using Harper Lee is excellent novel huh\nI think it'd be a second I'm Sorry I was just ... I think it's rather ironic that um you would use that Lynch mob analogy when it seems just that is what's being done to Dr hoard\nIt does wouldn't you rather a full impartial investigation\nI think we've already had this notion we've already there and I don't know how many full and in ... they'll listen to this is All right now uh you you you're suggesting that the Lynch mob is in reality and not the Democrats going after Brett Kavanaugh\nNo I think the Lynch mob is being led by our president who is mocking someone who only a few\nDays ago he called credible true\nAnd and that is an attempt to push this nominee through yet is honestly if if you're if you're trying to dispute the kangaroo court yes we didn't have an impartial investigation we should have the FBI do a full\nUnrestricted investigation\nI think you're a few days behind our insurance is not taking place now or is that an adequate to ask\nIf there are questions on whether or not it's restricted there are people who haven't even been interviewed yet and there's reports that\nYou've been watching MSNBC completed maybe even today yeah that was that he had to leave that are\nBeing rather restricted if they have an interview with all of the people who were you know in question\nYou are faithfully agree Lee are faithfully parroting the party line which I saw faithfully pirated\nOn her face really parroting the truth and I was walking through does that seem to be sticking to your narrative mother [laughter] quarterback and you're sick no sense of irony without the kangaroo court against judge Kavanaugh none none of them had been a sense of irony what's happening against Dr Ford they don't listen how do we\nKnow let me ask you this that you think he committed perjury he should be charged and going to prison\nSure well yea or whatever they may have lied wasn't there's evidence that there are only applied to the Senate do you think there's a lot about about drinking in college\nWell about legally drinking\nThe Seventeen now let me point and this cat and even when they can\nGet on your your faithful Democrat and you're trying to be reasonable so let me\nKnow I'm just faithful to the truth and you're ... you're no longer no you're not that fast no that's not the fact now that's beautiful I don't know that's not indisputable much any dispute it didn't just the other day called doctor for ... ... you're not you're repeating yourself you're you're like Dr asking you know you don't understand you don't understand that you just said that a minute ago\nYou're not going to answer the question because you want what ...\nWhat's the question you I I you're you're incoherent than it sounds like you're having some kind of a\nRound well you're not getting a heart attack combination because you can't answer the question and listen to these more on what's the question of the jail Pete ... that\nCan stop talking stop stop put the brakes okay what's your ... shut up what's your question\nMy question to you is Brett Kavanaugh allied\nTo the Senate already answered that it'd be jailed like you just answered that works for me I only answered that\nAnd your answer\nI you know if we're getting rid of cat then you're done you know I got to tell you this is the problem with you guys you know you're you're nuts Ken you've been made nuts by your party um that that that's just

Juanita Broderick and the context of pound me too and women must be believed\nThe rape of Juanita Broderick and the context a pound me too and women must be believed and\nYes judge Kavanaugh lied under oath about what about whether he had a night in college that he couldn't remember because the Democrats were trying to build a case that maybe he didn't remember groping\nFor good old doctor blah blah blah [laughter] not too many doctors said about Dr Ford um I you know Ken ... first of all you're breathing I'm a little concerned for you might be having a heart attack so let's let's let's focus on that for a minute your health could be in question here they\nThey and and the idea that they try to turn everything around well having a panic attack I just\nTry to turn everything around no we're not trying to Lynch Kevin Oh we're trying to get to the truth really did she tried to get to the truth and the hearing with Brett Kavanaugh where everybody had hours and hours and hours to discuss it with them\nThat that can did a Senator Dianne Feinstein what the Chinese spies in her office for Twenty years did she tried to get to the truth by sitting on\nDr Christine Ford's letter all through the hearings and through the entire process through the FBI background process was that was that her trying to get to the truth is that was that all about the truth and can you believe\nThat as a Fifteen year old that this Georgetown Prep boy with the ... was drugging girls with\nBuckets full of quiet loads and running cereal gang rape operations for years as this sweating the person says I just read to you from the sweat ... file it's what you are going to call it a dusty I [laughter]\nI have a ... here can I have a ... or that I got it from the Russians\nAnd the Russians tell me that Julie sweating it goes nuts and the Russians tell me that Julie sweating that are told her ex boyfriend that she liked gang bangers going back to high school and that that sort of sort of preferred form of a of a sexual enjoyment\nAnd uh and I and she never said anything to her longtime boyfriend who was a Democrat candidate for Congress can now I don't know how many holes you have to have punched in this thing before you recognize that who is that I saw somebody yesterday who said something very clever\nThat I thought was a oh I Know who it was it was a Senator John Kennedy\nWho's a pretty clever guy much of the time his kind of fun\nAnd he said yesterday talking about the Democrats so they launched this attack\nOn a Brett Kavanaugh but there are about to face plant\nAnd he said you know sometimes when you're falling it feels like you're flying for a second [laughter] sometimes when you're falling it feels like you're flying for a second and I think the Democrats felt like they were flying in this smear campaign and are there are updates candor also updates\nOn a Dr Ford updates on Dr Ford and I don't really feel the need to update ms Ramirez from Yale very much because\nThe New York times killed her story they killed her she's completely without credibility because of the New York times destroyed her credibility\nThe New Yorker published that peace with

I Want to know what it is with the the bitterness and anger of black women in America today we had to look into that don't you think\nI'm just kidding but I'm referencing the new\nNarrative from the phony baloney news media which is that white men are angry about all of that sits racist then that's missing trust but never mind all of that in fact uh we were contacted today now this is kinda funny we're ... do they cut that to your today or yesterday NPR\nToday NPR national panhandler radio called today and it's very funny they reached Victoria\nA producer of our humble radio show and this shows produced by its Victoria and Michael on myself the three of us if we're at NPR there'd be twenty two of us because it's not their money it's taxpayer money shuttling at the taxpayer teach day and night\nAnd they have a staff of twenty two people for a three hour show we've got three ... ... they got taxpayer money we have to make our own money pay the electric bill to keep the lights on around here and all that stuff\nNPR called said that and there was some confusion that apparently they want to interview me they want to give me you know you know what about how about\nUh the anger of white men in America today the anger of white men today are so I blew up their cars I uh what do you mean anger so and then it was it was kinda strange of their cars blew up just as the ...\nAnd it was funny because the person calling from national panhandler said well a who's who does you're booking and Victoria was a little confused 'cause it's not like we have a booking department for our show [laughter] you know we have three people\nAnd the proper response is you know listen kitten missing NPR we don't have thirty people do in a three hour show we have three people because this is the free market not the taxpayer teach just a just by the way\nAnd there were still debating whether to do the interview with ah with NPR are they the angry white man this is that so they called me I'm Hispanic my name is ... call somebody else\nAnd I and I'm black parts near black so uh you know what do you I\nI as I was so like if I Do an interview with them I'd have to I'd have to do my NPR\nVoice well I don't think there is a lot of anger among white males Tiffany I um I think that perhaps you should look at and chief uh if you're looking for angry white males Tiffany now back to you would you like some peanut butter\n[laughter] and the spoon maybe we could [noise] so let's\nGo to Laura ... she seemed to quite angry she was on CNN Today they say she's a former prosecutor but she looks like she's twenty six so I don't know where they find these twenty six year old former prosecutors for cable news all over the place apparently they got fired the first day and then go to work for cable or something like that\nBut she was very angry that President Trump dared to a raise an eyebrow at Dr forwards many many variations and or at most of the so she came to her defense and I I Love her defense that made me laugh\nBut primarily for like I think that in fact for cough syrup called they named the people who were in the party and the name of a person with an enemy by the FBI uh-huh orange land\nOr Leyland all of whom have said nothing like this ever happened as far as they know all of them legal and said\nI don't know what she's talking about I've never met Brett Kavanaugh but uh uh uh Laura coats and and CNN they leave that out because the most insidious power the news media has the power to ignore and what they leave out is often more important than what they put in and this is a good example of that\nThis well here's what she did remember she remember the names of the people that write the party um\nShe didn't remember who's house it was that what year it was ... months it was what day it was what neighborhood it was uh how many\nPeople were there changed again and again what the gender composition of the number of people there changed again and again one beer but she didn't know how she got there she didn't know how she got home a and did she recovered this and repressed memory therapy\nAnd if you're going to cite the names that she was angel able to conjure up you might also point out that PJ has said none of this happened this just didn't happen that's PJ Smith where the why\nThen there's Leland legal and what we wouldn't Kaiser and she said\nUh she's the one woman that apparently a Christine bossy she wasn't a doctor that he wasn't performing brain surgery and she left her friend Leland dared to be raped by these violent\nDrunks and ran out of the house like Jamie Lee Curtis in Halloween uh and uh there's just no evidence doesn't support what's your there was this little thing called evidence\nAnd and I I Believe in evidence because I'm from western civilization I was raised here I Believe in it I Believe in the law I Believe in the protections of the law if not the constitution of the United states at least the magnet Carter let's just use the magna Carter yeah let's go to twelve Fifteen and see if the Democrats can live with that code\nI don't think they can they can't\nThey are your give their their ... motto let's go to let's go to the phones [noise]\nI've grown tired of these people they're tiresome and and let me say that the Republicans are winning you know why they're winning because they're fighting\nThey're winning because they're fighting normally they don't fight because the news media is all against them and the Democrats are all against them and that's hard to tell the

domestic abuse and then Tina Smith my opponent is showing the complete hypocrisy of herself\nThe Democrat because the Democrats are interested in speaking out on sexual assault or harass and when it comes to their own party and Tina Smith is campaigning around the state with Keith Ellison and she had said because Keith categorically denied these accusations\nThen Keith Ellison therefore is innocent yet when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and the uh uh unsubstantiated allegations against a judge Kavanaugh\nAt the end he for under oath that he didn't do it a cease calling for a full FBI an investigation and she also said that Kavanaugh had committed sexual assault she said that in the video\nAnd what ever happened to being innocent before proven guilty it's now all this and the proof is on those that are accused and that's it that's the sad wrote that the Democrats have gone down and it's going to get discouraged a lot of people from running profit and for voting for them because this is one issue\nThat that it popped up that has really got a Republican and independents extremely extremely angry at the hypocrisy and the double standard that the Democrats are are showing right
