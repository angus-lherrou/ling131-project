support the Confederate flag how many times that we heard that question raised so it goes to the Confederate flag robbery leaf statues\nNone of that creates a one job for African Americans not one job but they beat that drum why why did they beat that Trump\nYou're listening to your health the radio addiction your reaction to Trump flipping the script will it actually result in more African American votes for Republicans or at least get them to look twice at the Republican Party\nEight five five forty or I Want to hear your reaction OK so cognac continues after he talks about the the fact that he didn't have a lot of it was basically saying you didn't have a real ... male role model at home and then he continued\nEveryone but they can't\nJust didn't make me feel that the guy that he can get to see my dad all the time like a guy\nWas there was something about when I put his hat off it made me feel like Superman made\nThat was the favorite superhero and your middle Superman case for me\nSo Donald Trump or as someone who\nDefied the odds to win the presidency that is what Kanye West is\nIs referencing there I Believe like anything's possible in America\nThey all said you couldn't do it they all said you your campaign would flame out they said you would get trounced by Jeb Bush they said that ah the Hillary was then going to destroy you and it was going to be a member of the other productions that Trump would lose in a massive landslide you remember that I Do\nWe played them every night and every day\nWell all of that was false and Trump became president and Kanye West I think is a man who you know he didn't have a lot of male role models Donald Trump has been a friend for a long time it doesn't mean Donald Trump gets everything right personally we know he hasn't none of us do\nBut I think that there was something profound and what he said there the ... the Hillary campaign slogan was I'm with her\nAnd for African American men they love their moms of course a lot of these women are heroic are trying to raise kids on their own it's not easy\nAnd but they he's saying and it's it's probably in today's day and age not politically correct but he doesn't care to I I wanted a male role model to follow in\nSomeone who is going to bring male energy to the office of the presidency Hillary slogan didn't speak to him it's just his personal opinion I mean you can disagree with it you can say it's well it's kind of off off base Hillary was just really smart and she would have been a bit better president how we obviously no that's not true\nBut they\nDo you notice that Don Lemon et cetera did not actually speak about any of the substance economy I brought up let's keep listening to Kanye West slipped listening\nCan use a lot of other need someone to help him and if the guy them and then he's a hug more than anything calling you back away from the cameras\nDo get some help and then come back and make your case nobody if you want to be conservative if you want to support Donald Trump that is your business as you're doing it have some sense with it make sense educate yourself oh wait a second so\nJay Z and Beyonce who were at the president's side and on speed dial I think they joke they're big policy experts and George Clooney because he testified before Congress he's the be all and end all and human rights and in Africa I mean I guess I woke up okay\nHe knows more than all the diplomats and all the people have devoted their lives for this well I mean you could raise the question about that right but no one ever did they never raised questions about any of these folks and how about Miley Cyrus running from dorm room to dorm room\nKaty Perry running around college campuses it's trying to explain domestic policy to students okay these people wouldn't know a domestic policy of a bit I'm In the back side\nWill take a break John Cornyn coming up your calls eight five five forty ... we'll get to all your calls Kanye West helps Trump and the Republicans\nFlip the script this is a unconventional moves and we'll see if it pays off it certainly is interesting don't go away\nThis is Michael ... and here with Mike stole from health markets helping folks find the right Medicare coverage that news reports say that the rates might be going down the cost of many Medicare plans are decreasing this year so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best rate health markets offers a free service with access\nTo thousands of Medicare plans plans I can eliminate you're out of pocket cost plans with zero dollar premiums and even plant that pay you back\nWhat is that people need to keep in mind with so many new options it can be confusing you can get objective help to find a plan that may cost sweat and cover more with lower co pay more choices like dental vision and prescription drug coverage\nAnd the freedom to see the doctors and you don't miss out on savings you deserve our health markets Medicare assistance is free thanks my this is Michael ... for health markets\nKnow it wasn't a I think Steve ... police and Rand Paul ... be\nJustified to this best but you know at some point it it gets to the level of incitement we're not talking about free speech we're talking about inciting people to violence like Eric Holder did which is a dangerous and I don't think ah I don't think we ought to reward that at all\nNow and it seems to me that the more successful Senator Cornyn this administration is the more Congress unites with the president on issues such as this statement actually and United\nIt's almost like it's driving the last ... into aid uncontrolled frenzy and they can't stand it the better America is doing they are there more and more angry\n[laughter] well as you know one of the holy grail for the left as the Supreme Court and they can't stay on the idea that a President Trump is now pointed to outstanding nominees to the Supreme Court as well as our confirming a number a large number of probably the largest at this point in the presidency I'm\nA court of appeals judges and a district judges and this is the driving them I think to a\nA two to this uh on attractive or to say the least I'm sort of activism which frankly I mean do we want to turn the government over to these people after the midterm elections I don't think so\nThere was an interview with a colleague Ted Cruz's challenge or the other day Beto O'Rourke about on the confirmation of Kevin I'm going to play it and get your reaction let's\nListen let me get you on the record on on judge Kavanaugh would you voted to confirm him\nI Would not have we the Supreme Court justice who believes in voting rights\nA justice who believes in a woman's right to make her own decision about her own body and have access to the health care that ensures that she can he fails the bar on each and every single one of those tests so the next justice can be nominated can only be confirmed if she were importantly she can meet those qualifications\n\nYour reaction to that\nBait do ah I Know they do pretty well and he's a he's a he's a nice enough guy but clearly he's not running for the United States Senate from Texas\nI'm he's out of step with the with Texas values and and this and every other important area my only suspicion was he's running for the Democratic nomination for president twenty twenty because he's appealing to the national Democrats and the hard left\nOr who are who are ah we're seeing a or create these the sort of mob rule\nAnd then it or what is your best take right now on the Republicans in the mid terms mean you've heard broker very confident that the Democrats are going to swamp the Republicans in the house and Senate but how does things really look we'll start with the cruise the\nWell I think Ted's and that's in good shape the latest Quinnipiac poll shows him nine points up but as you know this was all about turnout we know the left as angry the people that are still angry that Trump won in twenty sixteen\nThe mid term elections we usually see a down there in a turnout but uh I think the Kavanaugh hearings shoved energized our our base and um we've seen people like governor ... and in Tennessee said while he would have voted for a cab and all but I'm the truth is\nIf you are what the Democrat this mid term than we're going to jeopardize our ability to conform more federal judges and a sharp turn to send it over to Chuck Schumer and uh I just don't think ah ah the country is ready for that\nNo well I certainly I certainly hope not speaking at this back on account on an issue for a moment I devoted a lot of time on\nMy show senator to be discussing what next when the president if the president gets another Supreme Court pick the incentive to me seems to be still there for that type of circus we saw\nFor cabinet and namely there's no there's no repercussions for leaving a FBI report\nOr or a or a letter or anything confidential that's not supposed to be public there are no repercussions\nSo given the fact that there were no repercussions at least now there hasn't been yet do you think it's appropriate for the president or would you recommend that the president authorizes an FBI investigation into how this information about Dr Ford ended up leaking out to the press [noise]\nWell I have pretty good suspicion about how it leaked out to the press has you know after Senator Feinstein sat on the SAT on the letter and then leaked then sent it to the FBI after the initial um initial hearing\nThan it was returned by the FBI to the judiciary committee's background investigation file where it was available to every senator on the Judiciary Committee\nSo much suspicion is that uh one of the one of the Democratic senators or their staff are the ones ultimately responsible for leaking\nThe letter or um\nThis cat's a doctor Ford's lawyer although she certainly didn't serve Dr Ford interest very well in the way she handled all of this but yeah we're gonna we're gonna get to the bottom of this ah I pick up they'll probably be an ethics committee\nInvestigation and my hope is the Judiciary Committee will get to the bottom of this 'cause this is simply unacceptable and thank goodness we didn't reward this with a\nA success and killing the nomination of of cabinet or this would be the new normal\nYeah I I agree with you senator I I just think it's so important for the country going forward that\nNames when we need to know names we need to know who did this and we need to know the extent of the a collaboration\nWith outside groups many of them funded by the political ... of the Republicans and how that coordination occurred that means people have to preserve their emails and their tax messages I I just think you know getting involved the ethics an ethics investigation is fine\nBut there is nothing like an FBI investigation really trace what happened who did it\nAnd someone is lying someone dying here\nWell I guess what we need to do is identify the what are the jurisdiction the federal district whether a federal crime was committed here\nEither you or what are the jurisdiction the federal district whether a federal crime was committed here uh I I hadn't really thought that much about it but perhaps there isn't that would provide the hook for an FBI investigation and if there has been a federal crime committed I wholeheartedly support that investigation by the FBI\nOr Senator John Cornyn uh here in the lower income show senator or for the next ah you know three and a half weeks on this is going to be a sprint to the finish for Republicans I have the sense that the Republican Party is more unified than it's been\nI don't know since when I mean it just it seems like all hands on deck people are working together they're not back\nBiting each other as much and Jeff Flake is is not a fan of the president's he wants a primary challenge but Marco Rubio said the president will win reelection you haven't had Nikki Haley thinks he's going to campaign for the president twenty twenty or what is your sense of the Republican unity right now\nA lot more optimistic that I've been in a long time or I'm In the record of accomplishment with the Republican majorities in the house the Senate is pretty darned impressive I Know the mainstream media doesn't cover a lot of the success that we've had here but\nReally this focus on the judiciary and the fact that uh the Democratic candidates for the Senate are not going to support President Trump's nominees this has become the crucible in which I think\nThat it has United all all Republicans and people all across the political spectrum from the center right uh uh to the right and so I'm I'm very optimistic but we just have to keep that energy up but the fact of the matter is people like John tester who didn't support either Gorsuch or\nOn Capitol or some of the other Democrats on the ballot Catskill\nMcCaskill exactly on Missouri I'm did not support President Trump's nominees and that I think is going to be the issue that's going to pick up seats force in the mid term\nSenator your reaction to the Kanye West to parents in the\nOval Office yesterday [noise]\nI just think it's hilarious that are that the mainstream media is hyperventilating over that uh we all know that President Obama had rappers and other celebrities in the oval office during his time but there is a double standard as we all know uh for this president and uh I just thought it was a I thought it was pretty hilarious\nYeah I mean Michelle Obama invited that profane rapper common to the White House to read poetry his his his stuff is filled with every expletive on earth but he was up there reading poetry so and now with everything that's great we're reaching out with this wonderful it's authentic and meanwhile Trump has is that near west in there\nYou have to admit Senator Cornyn\nTruck makes things pretty ... pretty unconventional and in in kind of holds up a mirror to the Democrats does he not I\nI think so well it's it is just drive he makes their heads explode and they act in all sorts of or Russian irrational ways and\nAnd uh we've seen that in the in the judicial confirmation but we saw again yesterday on on TV and uh I think this or we just need to get this midterm election behind us we need to keep the house in the ... so we can continue making progress for the American people including the adding more federal judge to the bench\nOh my gosh that is the judicial branch coal equal branch of our government article three judges and we need more a Trump nominees on the bench and when you declare those are cleared those through Senator Cornyn again thanks so much for all you did a

written a few things for the Washington Post so now they say that he's a reporter for the Washington Post he was never reporter it was a columnist on and on the news media is lying about it all over the place that apparently it's all Donald Trump's fault because Donald Trump\nJust once that Saudi money so he's going to let them kill anybody they want just like broccoli Obama did kill American citizens overseas without due process but that was okay because it was also slowing the rise of the oceans and that made it better [noise]\nBut that ... story is kind of a fascinating fascinating story and I got a couple of a couple of thoughts on that a couple of articles on that didn't you know that ... has a link to some uh bin Laden not one link links to Osama bin Laden did you know that\nThere's you know that Jamal ... show he has links to the Muslim Brotherhood that you know that long time links to the Muslim Brotherhood and that he has spoken out against the ... in Saudi Arabia a strict form of\nOf Islam a buddy only ... and the only reason he's done that is because the Muslim Brotherhood and the ... hobbies are in conflict with one another and he's a Brotherhood guy\nSo it's probably you know a a Brock Obama supported the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt over our thirty year ally Hosni Mubarak who had kept the peace in the middle east for a generation\nA bronco drama betrayed him Mubarak ended up in prison and all of our allies in the region and around the world went running for cover\nWhen they saw rock Obama during that but never mind all that a couple of

this morning as well\nAnd in the meantime we we need you know next time a Democrat wins the White House I assume it'll happen someday it remember when Obama was the end of the Democrats were saying the Republicans would never win the White House again\nThat's because that lie all the time because they they have a fertile imaginations that's why they're run Hollywood and they do a lot of dress up and make believe sometimes just at home behind closed doors with the curtains close\nBut sometimes in Hollywood and on TV and in the movies and stuff too\nAnd um they said that the Republicans would never owned the White House and never control Congress again and it's just because they lie about everything all the time but the next time there's a Democrat in the White House and and they are presumably will be um\nAnd it will be a terrible day for humanity when that happens but it it's likely to happen anyway we need to form like Romney's raiders and ah you know the McCain resistance front and and whoever the Republican as that loses to the Democrat in the presidential race\nNeeds to former resistance group they sell group an underground network of operatives inside and outside

... it's a little bit he's like I said earlier his eccentric he's not crazy because he's rich\nSo his eccentric can and he's been so incredibly successful as a businessman and marketer and a writer of music and I'm not necessarily a big fan of most of his music\nBut I've always thought he's kind of an interesting guy he got entangled with those traditions that could be a problem in the long term you know most of their relationships with men having turned out very well and that's generous understatement\nBut you're absolutely right and then he goes any talks the Trump who's an industrialist an and I know a a a builder and up a big wig\nAnd he just starts drawing it and it's not like a completely out of the blue\nFactories buddies is talking about factories in Chicago and jobs and creating an economic base which is vitally important in every other ethnic group in America has successfully done that over the course of the last nearly two and a half centuries and the United states\nAnd uh the Democrats you know their idea is sit down and shut up\nOr or we're going to call you and Uncle Tom\nYou know that's that we're going to call your house negro we're going to call you a token negro we're going to say this is what happens when negroes don't read this is what we're going to do to you we're going to take away your black card white liberals are going to take away your black card because what Frank they don't want a millions of African Americans\nLeaving the plantation and following Kanye West to a place where you have serious discussions about serious things that stop and frisk is it's a serious discussion I'm a big Fourth Amendment guy and stop and frisk on now a offends me on principle\nAnd then you find a New York city you stop and frisk are caused a massive decrease in shootings and gun crimes and things like that\nSo then you have an honest in serious discussion about about how far you're willing to go sacrificing a personal liberties and and uh stretching the Fourth Amendment\nTo save lives in neighborhoods where the killing us out of control there is a serious discussion to be had there but the Democrats as you said ... the Democrats\nAre never going to have that discussion there are just going to tell you to sit down and shut up and to not think for yourself that's that's the Democrat program that's that the party of both counter an herbal fathers and George Wallace and Jim Crow tells black people to sit down and shut up and if you stand up and speak they'll shop your head off\nHer record thank you for you to keep doing what you do and they were very government or like I say one more thing I have a a couple of young African American men working three and a couple uh\nA Hispanic man huh and I'm going to tell you and everyone

president does scrub of media people all looking at him with disdain on their faces you could see the reporters looking at him with attitude on their faces like\nWho are you kidding don't you know we're just going to call you Uncle Tom again is that you know the hurricane Katrina George Bush doesn't care about black people that was telling you the Democrats took that the media took that they ran with it I\nI'm the hurricane in Puerto Rico how dare you throw paper towels to people don't you know that forty six times as many people were killed as you said and\nThat is completely fabricated Mitt number and and if they're if they're not going to use the same formula for every hurricane from now on then I'm not going to use it for the one in Puerto Rico never technically to hurricanes that hit Puerto Rican\nKind of amazing steps and now here we come kind of full circle and a strange way and Kanye has changed sides and what are the Democrats do they\nRace smear him\nRace shame him you know like slut shaming it's the racial version of slut shaming the Democrats are engaging in now\nBy destroying Kanye West they send a message to other would be African Americans who might step forward and say you know President Trump\nHas created the lowest unemployment rate for African Americans in the United states since Republicans took their slaves away from them and that's a huge deal that's a big deal\nUm stop and frisk is a legitimate threat Frank is a hundred percent right Kanye made a serious points more serious points to Nancy Pelosi's ever made and I mean ever\nAnd she's been at it since you know roughly the Emancipation Proclamation Kanye West in the oval office yesterday with the president the United states\nA I have a conversation that welfare of the reason why a lot of people say you know first of all it is a limit to a lot of jobs as the father's losing jobs and they say we're getting more money to have more kids all\nKnow the left is very upset because they say oh we did away with that yeah but it was the case for two generations and that was the Democrats demolishing the African American family in the United states of America just like the Democrats did before Eighteen sixty five\nAnd and they haven't changed much they really really haven't you know you're looking for crackers look at look look no further than Michael Eric Dyson he's a he's like a black

line get back\nBecause you know I'm going to say something rhyming about you that will be really insulting Kanye West I'm the second amendment guns a reporter a reporter to play says put Kanye we're all against the second amendment aren't you against the second amendment shouldn't we\nWe're all against the second amendment aren't you against the second amendment shouldn't we all do something together ... I'm a Democrat you're black\nUm you have to be with me and I want to get rid of guns because that way will save black people and they'll send a check to Planned Parenthood so we get rid of forty percent of black people in America\nBut without the debate and I think and then then\nThe problem is the legal or illegal guns is the problem [noise] nah nah nah legal ... we have the right to bear off\nWhat this shocked them all they're all up Paul how dare\nYou you're black get in your place you could see it on the faces of the reporters in the oval office at the time and they were talking about Chicago you know we might go live on yesterday Mike Phillip\n... well if you'd only listen to us and banned guns the Congressman Steve school lose would never have\nBeen shot um you know you're banned guns in Chicago how that turned out not working pretty well for you how does how does the homicide rate there compared to the rest of western civilization John yet west on liberals controlling the minds of African Americans\nOne of the movie that I Love the liberal side to do with how\nA black person to the concept of racism because they know that we're very proud of most people do and I said I like try to like someone that liberal they'll say oh well he's right you think of race and don't get to the\nSenate visible wall and Trump's it racist because uh I got to build the wall ten feet higher and um some of them are good people I'm sure that's it that's that's basically ... now the Democrats on the other hand slavery let's start with a\nK.

right to be with you on this Friday immediately opening up with one of the most distinguished people helping our time in my opinion [noise] many if you will recall that when Stephen Harper was the prime minister of Canada which he was\nA for nearly a decade between two thousand six and twenty Fifteen\nI Wish I said to you I think the best leader in the world at this time is Stephen Harper I said this when he was listening you smell listen to me but I said what he was it I said that uh he was in effect the Ronald Reagan of Canada\nAnd now I have him on the line that he has his book is literally hours it published today or published this week right here right now\nAnd it is his thoughts on what is happening in the world today specifically the phenomena of Donald Trump the phenomena and indeed if Stephen Harper the phenomena of other leaders and the ignoring of a lot of their own citizens\nBut of course I Will let him explain what he's written and just say that it is an honor to have ... former prime minister of Canada Stephen Harper on the line welcome searched or by show\nYeah thank you that thank you where you're very kind words I I Do know that you that it was well it was it off but I appreciate hearing it now at first it\nWell I'm Glad you knew it while you were in office that that seems a lot\nI by the way I just ... just before we START I I Love Canada I have been to nine of the ten provinces I've spoken to nine of the ten provinces by the way if you could arrange a speech for me I'm prince Edward island\nThen I can say ... or ... [laughter] so [laughter] I Know you\nMay look we will keep that in my yes I Do have cloud [laughter]\nThere are there are pretty limited speaking opportunities\nThere I bet yeah like a lightning [laughter] ... [laughter] pretty limited to speak you got to do these that was your best or the other state but All right so tell us the thesis of your book\nSo that I wrote the book uh obviously you know from my background that prime minister but in the context but who role by no have I run my own global consulting business in which I one of the things we do it by\nClients around the world about what a code red good political uncertainty and how to respond and prepare for that but also I'm chairman of the idea would\nAnd how to respond and prepare for that but also I'm chairman of the ideal which the global federation of conservative party includes the Republican Party the United states and uh since twenty sixteen I had been observing a obviously a series of\nNew and unorthodox than unexpected electoral outcomes Donald Trump selection boat primary victories in general election victory was the big us but the upset ... breakfast referendum to ride with so called populist movements in Europe and elsewhere and so I'm really trying to address what I think is going on\nAnd um and what um how leaders business and political but particularly how conservatives should respond to some of them so that it's really the essence of the topic and I guess to put my thesis in a nutshell\nThe red cross dot org slash Alaska for more information\nOn what you tired of silver robots we find printing company policy save on board and we don't have policy we have common sense low overhead and honesty would you want me to save on for looking for just buying a little\nBit and you will that will solve it hard would we do this a few times a week with emotional sexual from the middle in Georgia and what did you save on ... and he's always working harder it's all hospitality like we all used to know is American you know that you would tell you about somebody save on jail Minnesota drives the release changing the way for you so\nDo you have a left wing struggling with alcohol prescription drugs not sure how to help you're not alone [noise]\nCome on you and your family into recovery team\nThat's telling Chuck ... will present\nUnstructured covering two pm Saturday answer for twenty seven pm Monday October twenty second in the auditorium in Anchorage register and learn more we had a connection got now has real addiction messages once you're by about addiction aired by the Alaska broadcasters association and the station\n[noise]\nMm\n[noise]\nWhy every body image Prager here on the most powerful people um international politics [noise] former prime minister of Canada is on the line Steven Harper was major fan of during those two years I looked\nTo Canada I had kind of envy it wasn't for me and it was actually real I I did I remember at the time when when we had our left wing president and they had this very thoughtful intelligent conservative prime minister\nShow a prime minister Harper by the way I just wonder what I call you prime minister Harper is that an American thing only in Canada when you're interviewed or you called Mr Harper prime minister\nOr well that there's a long answer that question Denison I'll keep it short which is in Canada officially we do not keep the titles are we do not keep the title prime minister but it is actually quite common for people to call me that nevertheless\nRight on so I was trying to sue ... I think it's more of an American idiosyncrasies I think it's much but I was just curious\nWell one of the reasons we love the Americans you know [laughter] exactly [laughter] if you're ever feeling down just scored a barricade radio station exactly\nThe prime minister has written a book out this week right here right now he's one of the most thoughtful of people as I said in international politics so were you surprised that Donald Trump won what did you feel on election day twenty sixteen us election day\nSo I Know people I was surprised I was less surprised than most I had\nIncluded mostly through what I had been told anecdotally by a large number of Canadians who have been going back and forth to us than my own experiences going back and forth that\nA lot of Canadians had been down there and the what finally had told me they thought Donald Trump what's going to win so I gave him a a low but nevertheless while the chance of winning\nUh so I was I I'm not that I Would still a surprise but I was not shocked a as a shock to some observers not only were but they'll clearly are\nSo back to Canada is there a chance that conservatives can come back to power\nOh I think absolutely we've got a chance um you know we've been uh uh the polls go back and forth we'd been uh you know within the margin of error and a lot of them\nUm [noise] the the uh our fundraising is far exceeds the government I think the issues are on our side of the bay area we they candidate Dennis I don't mind telling you is that\nUm you know we have very little in the way of conventional conservative media television every network at MSNBC in Canada um is really amazing\nAsian every network is MSNBC in Canada um is really amazing when you look at places like Ontario and Quebec if you were to see the election coverage especially in the province Ontario\nYou would not imagine that concert party is going to get any votes at all and yet they won the election and want it handily so I'm a I'm optimistic but a book I leave a\nI leave the day to day up Canadian politics the my successor whose name is Andrew share and go I think will make a great and thoughtful and intelligent informed prime minister which really badly need\nI Want to underscore from our listeners what you just said because whenever I speak to concern for conservatives in Europe this comes up\nAnd sometimes they say if only we had a talk radio Europe ... why isn't there in Canada I think I Know the answer but I'd rather have you explain why isn't there something like talk radio in Canada\nWill talk radio does exist in ... well I mean conservative talk radio forgive me okay\nYeah I Know knows ... talk radio does exist a dentist and conservative talk radio does exist it's just much smaller and unfortunately a lot of our best conservative talk radio host not all of them but a lot of our best ones are have been kind of at the stage where they're retiring in recent years\nBut look it's an area where there really is a deficiency generally and what's interesting Dennis about this is generally a conservative talk radio hosts will do well\nIn terms of audience likewise conservative media to the extent that exists generally find that audience because there's a lot of meeting conservatives who are craving outlets but the fact is that the dying media continues to cater to all cater to a left wing audience\nThere was a powerful ... you said earlier right it did not pass over me at all all of our beauty or MSNBC I Hope my sister's ... that one that I look a well aware of that\nSo there is however and I frequently read at the national post\nYeah yeah the national post um was founded as a Twenty years ago as a more distinctly conservative newspaper and it has maintained\nA fairly conservative editorial line unfortunately\nA lot of the day to day reporting and columnists are simply not that bad and in terms of federal federal politics cup which I I Would not today considered the national posed the conservative paper in terms of the day to day coverage of federal politics but its editorial rely line remains\nRelatively concern the more conservative papers are actually what's called the sun chain their tabloids but they are quite um quite consistently conservative\nSo where would an American goal for thoughtful Canadian conservative news coverage\nNowhere to hide it tough yeah you have to do a while you have\nYou have to you have to look um you have to really find individual journalists um\nUm and and I would also say that you know that there's a huge market and particularly the phenomenon you have in the United states will pod cast\nUm you know I think there is a big market in Canada for that kind of thing to take off what as I said there is a\nYou know thirty percent of Canadians will always vote right of center at least thirty percent bottom at kind of the the the low number\nAnd so that that audiences in my judgment if I were an entrepreneur and the media business I'd be trying to figure out how to get to that audience which for the most part has very little and the way of of outlet servicing them\nWhat about young people or let me put it let me actually before we get to the young people you said something that's very important to me that it was a polarization in the United states left and right doesn't exist in Canada is that the caller lean to the same basic rights\nSo it was but but on the issues they differ is just as clearly as the left right differ in the United states so is it because the Canadian temperament is just more subdued how why isn't there that polarization\nI I think it's a fact that you know I I ... I hate the generalizations about our country but it's a fact that Canadians happening more civil public discourse than always have um it it's also the case that\nA larger percentage of Canadians are not idiot logically committed the you know the number of people who would be hard core conservative or heart or left liberal would be much smaller and the percentage of the population that would float between parties significantly bigger and Canada\nPlots Dana I think the other factor that often forgotten when people can they can uh when people compare Canadian American politics is we have more than two parties and that really changes the dynamic significantly like I always say when you have a strictly two party system\nYou know if Kennedy day and have a candidate B. he can bring candidate B. down in a in a system where you got more than two party there's always a risk to the candidate intact Kennedy be effectively the winner become Kennedy seat who's\nNot oh All right listen this has
