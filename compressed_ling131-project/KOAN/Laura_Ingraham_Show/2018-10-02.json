standing at a Catholic university called Georgetown University here in Washington DC and she is not um a disgusting wretched\nExcuse for a human being that she is a revered a college professor probably tenured she's got a PHD I was talking to a friend of mine last week who said that he was impressed with Christine for before she testified because she's got a PHD you know she's got she had to work hard for that PHD like really that impresses you [laughter]\nHanging out at a college campus for Twenty years to get another piece of paper that impresses you and uh I'll take a twenty five year old female combat veteran any day of the week\nWhen it comes to being impressive and brave they love brave thrill brave a combat veterans they spit on but a Braves you're brave of you\nFalsely accused some one of the I I don't even know what he's really accused of she calls it attempted rape I I haven't heard enough detail to know whether it\nWould legally qualify for that Dr Christine fair not Dr Christine forward but Dr Christine fair at Georgetown University trade and\nLook at the U.S chorus of entitled white men I think she meant to write this but she uh misspelled the word vis because she's a PHD in a college professor\nLook at the U.S chorus of and maybe she speaks in middle English maybe her specialty was in middle English or something I look at the last quarter to seven titled white men she's a racist\nAnd uh she engaging in gauges and miss injury she hates men I don't know if she really I don't know if she's that way or whatever deal is but she hates men it's very popular to hate white men if you're a Democrat um\n[noise] I don't know if anybody's had any personal experience with this ah hating white men stuff but they have the Democrat they've turned up the hate machine on men\nAnd white people and white men in particular and you're supposed to have them even if you're a white man and they've got white men doing it it's it they've got like you've heard of self loathing Jews they've created a generation of self loathing white men because they hate\nAnd somebody's just got to say it out loud\nThis is sick these people are sick All right uh I'm just going to call these people sick because I think\nThey're sick they really are as white men justifying a serial rapists arrogant entitlement a that's a pretty tortured\nSentence there Dr fair Dr fair

Christine fair who's apparently had some kind of a mental breakdown now let me let me let me just pause here for a second because I just said this is like a mental breakdown\nIt is like a mental breakdown and let me say\nTwenty years ago Thirty years ago for sure if a Georgetown University college professor said things like this\nShe would be corrected away like Dr Lecter on a hand truck with a face mask on\nBecause twenty or Thirty years ago this would not pass the civility test in in polite society where she presumably operates but I um I don't like this woman at all I think she's filth\nAnd Georgetown University if they're going to pretend to be a Jesuit college they should fire this piece of debris\nOr for her insanity she's like a Nazi she's like she's like a stopover
