can react differently you could\n... at some point you just explode like this I've worked a brick cabinet\nTwo hundred and federal federal a court opinions\nDecades in public service no question ever about his character and suddenly right before his confirmation vote they pull this\nWhile judges are supposed to put a most as a side they're supposed to in effect be objective impartial judge is often become an average believe me I've litigated for\nClose to forty years I've seen some angry when they made their ruling when they speak about what they're supposed to\nPut those emotions to the side\nThis op ed in no way in effect cleans up that basic failing [laughter]\nWell what about the temperament of the protesters\nHow about the Democrats are some of them are called cabinet evil that he was going to be a threat to women nationwide was that was that the right temperament to have as a sitting senator and your advice and consent role that a boy I mean you could have fooled me if that's the kind of temperament we're teaching our kids to have in\nIn public life this is what Kevin wrote in the wall Street Journal ... late yesterday\nI was very emotional last Thursday more so than I've ever been I met a ... I might have been too emotional at times I Know that might tell them was sharp and I said a few things I should not have said\nI Hope everyone can understand that I was there was a son a husband and a dad I testified with five people for most in my mind my mom my dad and my wife and most of all my daughter's\nGoing forward you can count on me to be the same kind of judging person I've been to the entire twenty eight year legal career hardworking even killed open minded independent and dedicated to the constitution and the public good as a judge I've always treated colleagues and lit against with the utmost respect I've been known for my courtesy on and off the bench\nI have not changed a terrific Columbine Cavanaugh I think\nIt's it it was both well timed and important to do this or let's go to Steve\nIn North\nCarolina it's a ... wait and see if we go to Robin Massachusetts first online five Rob welcome\nI Laura I'm first off can I say that at the end of my day\nWhen I sit down to watch your show that is the capstone of my day I really love watching you and and she knew an action and it's an honor to speak to you right now to what I wanted to say is that you made a point on your angle the other night and I quite honestly don't think it's gotten enough attention\nAnd that's the idea that you said if I recall that Trump is teaching the Republicans how to fight and I absolutely think that that was a brilliant insight I mean it I think a true are seeing the results that all over the place right now\nI think Rob that came to me as I was watching Lindsey Graham during the confirmation battle when he he saw that Kavanaugh I think was getting a little too he was besieged and the\nQuestions and Kavanaugh was I think he was getting real hot okay\nAnd I think Lindsey Graham decided you know something to heck with this I'm I'm going to take the floor and I'm going to reset this debate about the cabin are confirmation he did that I think it was after the president's press conference with the president came out an hour and a half and he was just fantastic and his support\nOf Kavanaugh and with whether what what the reporters how we dealt with the reporters he was having a good time but he said yeah I'm not doing this anymore I'm not I'm not playing defense anymore\nAnd the Republicans have got to stop playing defense Trump won by being on the off and he's not in perpetual apology mode because he said he sent a sharp tweet about someone\nHe kept moving forward he didn't look back he's not going to do well over mistakes we all need to do that and he looked forward keep moving the ball down the field that's what Trump has taught us as Republicans and guess what a lot of Republicans are now seeing it he's transforming the political party and it was in a moment too soon\nI really appreciate your comments Rob we have a great team on the anger mango we're going to take a break Kellyanne Conway up next\n\n\nThis is Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new Ginny cell sunspot correct her she says she loves that it should go to product every day she has sunspots an age sponsor can see a definite difference in her skin since using it\nWatcher sunspots age spots and even written slain patches vanished right before your eyes\nAnd just like Renee if you click or call right now you get the ... correct or absolutely free for just trying Gen yourself or bags and puffing is watch those stubborn sunspots fade away\nAnd do it before you get busy with the holidays my friends and those bags and puffing is you'll see them diminished as well for fast results a genius tell immediate effects is also yours free go to Jim you sell dot com now recall eight hundred for a zero fifty two zero six order this week and received ... luxury micro germ abrasion also free\nAnd then those who are protesting this is about truth and justice in fact finding\nA pressuring her to change her story which is a fancy word is saying asking her to lie\n... votes or crime yes I'll Try and\nDo a lot of that can be looked at ... who ... who leaked Ford's identity will kind of emails were going back and forth why Dianne Feinstein recommended these a democratic activist\nLawyers to Ford why they never told her she can testify in private and keep her ... her face in her name out of the press as much as she could she could just do it in California they go to them that something is Senator Lindsey Graham told me right away he said she can do it by phone we can send somebody out there but no no no they needed a clean slate and the cameras\nOn for them and I guess there next client base so it it's just an awful but America has been watching and I don't the after he's confirmed and hopefully he will be I won't get ahead of the way certain senators are grappling with their vote decided to vote Lara but\nUm if judge Kavanaugh is confirmed as a justice of the United States Supreme court this will not end there they think it won't end because it's still be shouting at men they've never met for things he's met have never done to them personally and individually\nBut other folks won't forget how people behaved how they were her raining folks try drawing them out of restaurants publishing their their kids' names in their personal home addresses\nThat that's not that's not the first amendment that's just crazy that's completely crazy\nYou know do you um think that in part I mean are are you argue this last week uh when the president came out of the press conference which I think was one of his best press conferences last week of incredible I mean you could have gone for three hours or that he taught\nA a really needed lesson much needed lesson to Republicans on how to fight for what\nYou believe in a fight for a principal fight for a person instead of being back on your heels cowering in an elevator that the the reason Trump got elected as because he wasn't gonna take that any more he wasn't going to just keep getting pummeled and beyond perpetual a perpetual apology tour for either him sell for America and\nHe he's not they called him ... I think the bullies are the people who are swarming individuals in public or the Senate or restaurants and and screaming at them within a centimeter of their skin but I think Trump's taught the Republicans a lot throughout this whole thing\nIn a large struck me just last night after I was on your TV show and thanks for having me or that the way everybody describes Donald Trump President Trump is exactly that they're behaving and when I don't see from him he's\nFuming he certainly thinks of the TV he's angry he's a bully it's exactly who they become he's not\nThat way how they're welcome yeah these unbelievable job numbers in and bringing peace across the world and bring make us prosper it at home if he's sitting there fuming all day they they owned the acrimony they own the ... to predict vicious wave via way they've gone after people um\nAccording to one gender according to one's politics and you're so right he doesn't retreat and backed down when he believes in a principal\nOr a principal in this case PAL Brett Kavanaugh and they didn't know each other before this they didn't know each other well at all but the President Saleh judge Kavanaugh somebody who sat\nSo is sitting on the DC circuit second highest court in the land over three hundred ... judicial opinions that none of these Democrats even try to pick apart I respect them far more lower if they said you know we have a problem with the five following opinions that he wrote and these particular passages we think he went outside the contours of the constitutional law there is no such\nAre no doubt on about ...\nThey're talking about a passage from a yearbook you can sit in a post it note versus three hundred judicial opinions the answers to twelve hundred written questions over one million documents you need a Mack truck the hall around all this stuff he's produced and you need a post it\nTo talk about a passage in your book so this just strikes a lot of Americans even apolitical Americans learn as a logical and beyond commonsense I respect them or if they said we're angry lost the election two years ago and that President Trump is reshaping the federal judiciary was constitutional less than all this nonsense\nWe're going to later on in the Showtime and have a discussion about what these\nCurrents feminists are doing to poison the relationship between men and women and specifically the ah this idea that if you're if you're an accuser\nYou must be heard and you must be believed and if you're not believe then you're anti woman or you're anti victim and justice Thomas's talked about this a lot you know the ... we all have to stop\nIdentifying ourselves as victims of this or victims about because I mean that's not going to help you advance as a person as being you know ...\nDoesn't and that every every man as a perpetrator every man has to shoulder the burden of the need to move in every man is a rape is every man is a sexual harassed or by virtue of their gender and then everyone is a victim\nOn even those who many who are that have been victims of\nSexual misconduct or worse don't necessarily consider themselves victims overall and that's being lost in the den here as well I mean if you if you asked if you do one of those are asking everybody who's out there with the masking tape when their mouths and those signs are holding up why are they there what this what is this about\nIt you're going to get answers that have really have nothing to do with his confirmation and really nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh that the Democrats used a Ford because they they breed shirt anonymity they revealed her identity to the world they sat on this for six weeks\nAnd then they set her up with attorneys who never even gay already to even the of telling her what her rights were what she could do and they're using Kavanaugh and\nHis shoulders should not be\nShould not be shouldering the entire me to live by the way large ding ding ding happy anniversary one year anniversary of the me too movement but you know who started it not Brett Kavanaugh Harvey Weinstein you know ... a year ago today it was Harvey winds dean major democratic donor you're not going to find him in a picture of Brett Kavanaugh if you're gonna find it in pictures with Hillary Clinton\nAnd a lotta a lot of a powerful now powerful female actresses in Hollywood who looks the other way long after they were just starting out long after they were very powerful and very wealthy but\nLet's remember how who got this all started let's remember he's facing criminal charges he's facing criminal charges and dozens and dozens of women describing kind of not something thirty six years ... years ago is dong corroborated\nWomen describing kind of not something thirty six years ... years ago and song corroborated\nThis was a a moment yesterday on MSNBC a network that I literally don't even watch it anymore because it's so pretty interesting so predictable\nBut this was Mika Brzezinski are reacting to ah your comment that Dr Ford look she was not treated badly she was treated like a fabric the egg let's listen to make a\nWhy can't you be the egg Kellyanne the fabric egg and tell your story because he say women should be heard you talk to both sides of your mouth they say that women should be heard their stories are believable are credible and understanding and compelling well let's hear yours\nThat's very convenient to drop that but I Want to know your story I Want to know what happened you should have justice Rome shouldn't hold on I'm not done all I Know you're ... you know K. you can't just throw that out as a political dagger to protect this reprehensible predator of a president\nYour reaction to the\nWho I have to reaction to that not I think that many people generally has made my point for me that people are judged women are judged by of what their grief or they're harmed\nWhere they're recourse or their quote victimhood based on their politics and I think many people are making the point for me but I don't dignify many things out there\nAre because they're they're wholly irrelevant and I will tell you a lot of blowback yesterday a lot of pushback and a lot of low back on and I'll I'll have my say about that\nAt some other time but at the moment I think it's completely irrelevant given how how high the stakes are Laura odd to get justice Kavanaugh confirmed in as an associate justice United States Supreme Court\nBut it won't be bullied and won't be bullied either\nAnd I I won't be bullied um and I I'll have my say I'm not going to say much else right now that I find it to be\nOn basically are relevant and when I talked about the ... which by the way it is trending on social media I Love I Love informing generations

break\nHealth friend's children parents work oh and marriage of course marriage so\nThat was a six items very few people have them all really good so you\nHave to get happiness where you can maybe one maybe if you don't have any of the others and you have friends that can compensate maybe if you don't have any of the others and you have marriage\nNow have to say this health is a health issue we generic health is unique because if you don't have any if you don't have friends if you don't have happiness from friends or children or parents were worker marriage and you have your health\nEr it's er worker marriage and you have your health\nWell that's not enough\nHealth care health is health is more capable of ruining your happiness than it is giving you happiness so it's it it but I'm sure it has to be on the list because I'm living in reality\n\nFind happiness where you can okay that's the point instead of concentrating on where you don't have it all\nRight and every body and let's go

to hit the right note on a on all those categories and I'm just wondering I mean you know I think it's easier how their happiness our\nI mean if if you are you know sort of within a successful and all those areas I Know that if I were successful in those areas I Would probably have that happiness our I'm On my show every every day I mean\nIt's a younger okay apple that okay it's a very important and difficult question because I I really do have to open up to you I\nThe question because I I really do have to open up to you I of all most listeners of a long time no I have not had a pain free life by any means I've been divorced and uh it was a very painful period in my life\nAnd if the only time in thirty five years of broadcasting where I had tears wall broadcasting was when I announced the end of my marriage or my\nSeventeen years and I\nI went through a lot as a result of that I ... it's not been a smooth road in my life I did not grow up a happy child I became happy in high school but before that I I was not happy\nSo in fact if I didn't have all of the pain that I've had I don't think I could do happiness out so in in the question has merit\nI think if you if you have everything that I listed with no glitches and I think about ten percent of the population does one out of ten people I think ... might well I don't think you could do what happiness there I don't think I could have written\nA happy this book I wrote the name of my book is to give away happiness is a serious problem if I had all these things how can I write a book happiness is a serious problem
