caravans of people storming the border was politically time they see the Democrats think this is a good issue for them\nI think they made a mistake horrendous mistake it's a terrible issue for them the Republicans must stand with the president eight five five forty Laura\nLet's go to Jerry in Pennsylvania on line for chair\nGoing to\nSpeak up I don't know why are you guys are on bad phones are bad I don't know what it is but you all have to speak up because we all want to hear yours if you're on a speaker phone you can like\nI said I couldn't I couldn't I I panic over the more the Democrats are staging the who to say that mothers of babies are banned but are crazy but I was at one of us are with you\nI think the ah we don't need immigration law ... what we need are unemployed unnecessary costs a lot of these jobs\nI think you hit the nail on the head we need people to develop skills in this country the trades how many times you read articles that that we don't have enough tradesmen\nEntry and what can you say tradesmen any more people who do trade we don't have enough of a skilled uh labor's hand on hands on labor as we need that and that's where people from all walks of life\nAll walks of life can learn a skill in your you can learn a skill after you've left your your current career\nAnd work I'm not talking about being up on a roof and roofing that's more of a young person's job but you know what I'm Talking about the idea that America has to import uh foreign workers to do every American job is lunacy I when I grew up we didn't need that probably didn't have that problem when I when I was growing up Americans did\nAll sorts of jobs from picking a tobacco which my brother did to picking fruit which I did\nWho I mean all of us did all of this work in yeah if you have to pay more to get Americans to do these jobs good you should pay more I told you when I was in Switzerland it was really interesting to talk to the Swiss about a Swiss jobs they don't do this big importation of laborers in Switzerland they don't do it\nThey didn't actually people who do everything from sweeping the streets to caring for children they get paid for doing that work eight five five forty or let's go to Evie in Florida every\n[noise]\n[noise] Hi Laura I again I think on on this than an American Jewish as far as the border but as a you know an American citizen here I I don't want to just think that voting is going to help what more can we do\nWell the border the border has to be enforced the president's right if these other countries won't enforce their borders we need to put a we need to put some thought into how we are going to better do it here and he's got to ... and if it's a national emergency the president has extraordinary powers\nAnd drugs guns or criminal element of gangs we've already caught them trying to get into the country and we've already arrested people who are within the so called migrant population\nWho are are only coming into the United states to hook up again contacts we brought you story after story about that\nAnd this president understands that they this president gets this like no one else how many have you saw the\nFrightening the frightening display last night on the ... it was called meet the chairman you remember that movie made the parents\nSo it was called meet the chairman and I went through chapter and verse what would happen to various committees and the house of representatives\nOr if Republicans lose control of the house and let me tell you something forget the new Jamie Lee Curtis rendition of Halloween the movie the most frightening thing you can imagine is what's\nGoing to happen to the financial services committee the house ways and Means Committee the Appropriations Committee the intel committee the energy committee\nIf the Democrats have their way five five forty Laura let's go to Eric in Michigan Eric go ahead\nI Believe that the easiest and quick a solution to the border problem would be to open the home studying act to all of the federal I Am for rounding border and as you can make a structure dwelling a part of uh being able to get into the home studying act\nYou could just as easily make it that they need to put up a barricade a fencing or whatever\nAnd with the uh that's already covered the priority on any old studying at the open up your could wind up with a lot of our whole study which would be helping all the American and at the same time\nCourt one hell of a wall dollar\nOf another interesting idea well our our callers have more interesting ideas and most Republican or Democrat congressman but Democrats just want an open border open borders open markets don't go after\n\n\n\nThe ... that are real life story from community to management\nI had a lot of credit card debt and I couldn't pay my bills I was feeling so bad I got to a point where I needed some help so I reached out and contacted trinity\nIf you're into and you need help coal trinity a one eight hundred seven mine for over four three something to talk to a certified towns where\nThey were able to take all of my different payments and put them altogether trinity will consolidate your accounts and the one easy to manage monthly payment put a stop\nTo late season over limit charges reduce your interest and possibly improve your credit score you save the house and they were actually able to work with my creditors or being able to pay off\nClose to Fifteen thousand dollars in Alaska Eighteen months\nFine now this is all a bridge too far\nIt is and I got to tell you I saw that Chris Cuomo a prime time last night Steve Cortez as a warrior\n... for the president he really is you know he he's a Latino and his credit ... is a as parents\nCame here legally and he indoors so much defending the president's policies including his immigration policies on CNN it's just amazing to me you know I appear on CNN often as well but I look to see it as a model he I Know when I get off CNN after defending the president\nI get so many threats some of the death threats I'm certain ... gets the same kind of feedback from CNN viewers and yet he goes on every day swing him for the fences I'm so proud of him\nAnd you're on the uh the ... the Democrats signed up for this and I think they're going to pay for it\nI think that again people who work hard for a living trying to take care of the kids just you know they don't have the money to send their kids to than the private schools\nThey're just out in the country and they're working and they'd like to take a vacation every now and then and they see that the economy has improved so much under this president leadership and then on the other side they see\nChaos identity politics\nConstant cries of racism or embracing the illegality and and now open borders which is you know it's been the case for some time but now it's literally they want to open borders its it's beyond clear\nAnd I think it I think this blows up and the Democrats faces morning noon and night if the Republicans do the right thing here and hold on to this issue and actually pass legislation to stop that this was an emergency what's happening to this country\nTo learn the now but back there on the income and toward the border and I think the president is standing tall you know I I've been in politics since the Reagan Era you know you have to we first met in Washington back during the Reagan years and you know I've worked for Jack Kemp and\nIt was people like Jack Kemp and Ronald Reagan stood up for this country and and had backbone and unfortunately over the years we really haven't had a president like Donald Trump and have backbone\nWould never have stood up to these caravans coming up against the border would never have stood up for justice Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd you saw what happened when the president just said simply nope I'm not looking at another another nominee you're going to have to approve\nAnd confirmed a Brett Kavanaugh we saw spines grow and senators we didn't even think Adam anymore re Lindsey Graham was a hero of German Grassley a hero Susan Collins a hero in all emanates\nFrom the strength and the White House and the immigration issue you know he has not backed down you remember when he came down that stairway in Trump Tower\nThen his speech which shocked everyone he promised starts the word and they tried to conflate like you mentioned uh uh uh illegal immigration with immigration and they tried to do that\nOver and over and over again and they're still doing it today\nBut it's not working because the average man and woman working every day in America you know taking their lunch buckets of work you know dropping their kids off at school they understand the difference between somebody who jumps the border fence and somebody who comes here and stand in line and does it legally\nNow you're listening to your health the radio addiction in five five forty Laura every poll that's been done the last few years on immigration shows that most people want legal immigration either to remain the same and that's a million people a year it's a lot\nOr or to be decreased so it was like thirty seven percent want it to remain as saying that the Gallup poll from June I'm thirty seven percent want that level to remain the same I'm Talking legal immigration twenty\nNine percent want it decreased okay twenty eight percent wanted increased now that's legal immigration\nAnd that those are the convenience factor inconvenient fact that people like Chris ... they don't want to deal with because when you live in a you know a doorman building in New York you don't have to worry about illegal immigration citizen affecting your life your kids go to the best schools your kids or you know probably driven to work\nOr in a different school excuse me but you don't have to deal with illegal immigration and you don't have to call in with a a legal immigrant for for a job and find that wait a second they're doing the IT work I used to do for thirty percent less\nSo you know people don't want this\nRight I live out in western New York where it's a it's a very blue collar area and a ... year a year or so we've seen you know truckloads of illegal illegal immigrants arrested or the seven eleven on their way back from a construction site where the\nOr were they were working we've seen a chain of Mexican restaurants in and uh and west in Buffalo or wherever they pulled out of a whole load of workers where the owner of the restaurant was housing them and paying them in cash on he just got a found guilty the other day\nOf this kind of crack down needs to continue because I'll tell you in western New York in Buffalo where we used to be a strong steelworkers town were not anymore we're we're starting to come back under the leadership of president Donald Trump\nBut men and women here me these jobs need these jobs and and do they know who's taken the job they know what illegal immigration is all about and the Democrats and the mainstream media spend their time trying to gas light them on this issue\nTalking about how important\nAre immigration to the United states when they're really the issue that they're they're they're conflate against illegal immigration the president is against immigration\nIs against illegal immigration\nAnd I think the American people see through it you know my wife\nIs an immigrant we went through the whole citizenship process is the first the immigration process and then the citizenship process it's difficult it takes time and if it got to hire a lawyer it's expensive but my wife will tell you it's really worth it you know and the problem she sees is if she surrounded by people were all\nWorth it you know and the problem she sees is if she surrounded by people were all surrounded by people who are here illegally some of them are now over ... etc\nIt since it's infuriating and again I say this repeatedly\nYou ... if you can't even blame you can't blame the people who are trying to get here because they've been given a green light probably from their own governments and in one way shape or form a and they've been told you can come and stay\nSo people who are just want to come here and work I don't even blame them but they ... it can't happen because because without a border you're not a country Reagan said that he was completely right a border exist to help you maintain your sovereignty and to protect your own people an orderly process of immigration is\nWhat we need but look the chaos at the at the border is is not dissimilar\nA Michael to the chaos that we've seen in the streets and the ... in the aftermath of Kavanaugh are and the Democrats prefer that because if there's chaos you need more government government grows government gets bigger and the Democrats are never happier than when the government is growing and growing and growing that's what they want\nIt's true and if your listeners white what they saw during the month long confirmation process of justice Brett Kavanaugh\nThe screaming in the hearings the uh the people running down the are always a base of the United states Capitol screaming at senators the the people trapping senators\nIn an elevator illegally and screaming at them for the cameras the mobs of people outside the capital and after he was confirmed the people trying to literally rats with their fingernails through the metal doors of the United States Supreme court building\nIf they'd like that they're going to love twenty Nineteen if the Democrats take over the house of representatives and you know or if the election were held today we would lose the house Republicans wouldn't lose the house because\nA lot of people who were not measured well by the polls and twenty sixteen they call us deplorable right that people who haven't voted in recent elections because of their frustration with issues like illegal immigration making up their vote didn't matter at all they found a champion and Donald Trump someone they fought\nA non politician could make change for them\nAnd you know in in a midterm election\nThose kinds of folks to tend to think well I got my guy and I'm going to go ahead and sit this one out and they don't take their lunch break to go vote they don't drop their kid off early at school so they can go vote on the way to work or they don't you know a skip the for the birthday party after work to go vote\nOn it and and that this time around they better do it because they think the part of the president's not on the ... ... is\n... ... that's an excellent point and Michael what's happening in the twenty seventh congressional district in New York Congressman Chris Collins what's happening there\nWhat Collins as of some of your listeners might know or was charged with insider trading yup I'm a recently after it was too late to get them off the ballot um you know he declares is in a sense and you know we believe provokes sort of stuff but New York twenty seven is an hour plus eleven district it was a safe seat\nAnd uh they have a pretty strong Democrat running against them kinda leans toward the Democratic socialist side of things really hates Donald Trump has said he's open to impeachment\nAnd has changed his tune because this district New York twenty seven is very pro Trump and now the Collins has been in some federal trouble he's changed his tune to talk about how he wants to work with the president yesterday\nI'll treats no trick\nDoing buddy bought one at a gym I Am\nThe U.S takes one step back on the
