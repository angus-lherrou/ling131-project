when things are going back for one party you throw in that distracted and then use that this ... as a bludgeon legend people with politically okay what's happening here that people in which bombs are being set up to them\nBut it was going off I mean clearly not one of them go off I mean it was the damage your bottom layer that one goes off yet when a liberal or conservative though that they you know at least they get shot or something happens to\nThe south like are the bad things going for the Democrats and all of a sudden look they care that they have anything for 'em so they that's I mean it's like well\nYeah well again this is what I'm seeing a lot of on on line and I'm I'm going to try not to speculate because I don't I don't want to say anything until the facts are and\nUm but I we do know what happened in June of twenty Seventeen that the media spent not that much time really unpacking what motivated\nJames T Hodgkinson to almost kills the skull lease with the goal of killing as many as he could and that\nCongressional baseball game baseball practice now he wrote on Facebook here's a Republican that should lose his job but they gave them a raise and it was a company by a cartoon depiction of Steve school is\n\nThe story was ... you know it it was horrible and it happened everybody had a moment of unity and Congress came out and give them a standing ovation when he came back so that was nice and everybody appeared thing we've heard reject this of course they did\nMember of their uh you know their own congressional body had been you know it was hanging on a thread his life was hanging on a threat but then the story really didn't\nI don't think the story shut down all of the media for days and days and days man they covered other stories\nOr let's go to John and Florida on line for John [noise]\nHey Laura thanks listen I just wanted to point out what can be is a kind of eerie similarity between the string now a veiled\nBombs were bombs patient barks and the string of increasingly salacious a accusations of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh during the hearing as they approached confirmation vote\nFor me it expects a pattern orchestrated ... with the agenda sporting trunk and Republicans and a complete ... station I just would be interested to hear your comments on that I Know\nWell it seems again\nIf this is someone who is a fan of Donald Trump than it's got to be someone who's insane\nI'm just completely nuts as my main people who do this have an ... an element of\nOf insanity evil all all combine in my view but I'm not an

bombs or when they're designed to go off look like and what they must contain\nBut at the the the list of targets are all Democrats than all outspoken critics of President Trump\nEight five five forty

has that frontier feeling well the the ... not a very populous a state but it's a pro Trump conservative\nPro Second Amendment of course and believe in fairness just general fairness in the cabinet deal\nJust wasn't fair\nAnd I think most people just law that you know and so she's obviously not going to apologize for not supporting him but I think that was the straw that broke the Democrats back\nIt was ... but at the same time you know I've had a double digit lead for quite a while on her and\nAnd I think the comparison was already resonating with with North Dakota and she just blew up with the cab nothing because again her everything she's pretended to be was revealed in one major illustration\nSo and the fair to say she was really big but also she's a former state attorney general she was a former North Dakota attorney general so the idea that you didn't understand fairness or due process or the value of it at a time Laura when the polls in North Dakota\nNever showed ... never showed even thirty percent support for ... for opposing\nCabinet but rather short anywhere from sixty to fifty sixty sixty four percent favoring confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh so it wasn't like she didn't know where North Dakota and stood so she had a hard time and by the way even ... blaming\nHer ... she changed her her opinion first she believed him and believed a professor poured then she didn't believe him but believe professor for it and then it was not about that at all it was about his demeanor she watched his hearing or you know with the phone turned off and noticed his demeanor\nYou know just ... it was phony on top of phony and again I think it was just the veil removed\nBecause everything you described about North Dakota law that the independent spirit the rug and is the frontier spirit that's what she has pretended to be\nAnd now all of a sudden it's quite clear that she's really quite a liberal activist\nNo I think again people have been well they've been exposed during the Trump era\nThen media have had a ... mirror um I think raised up to their bias\nAnd it comes out in different ways but Trump really has driven people to just peroxide frenzy and fury and upset and and the left always takes it too far they took it too far with\nKavanaugh or we don't know what's really going on with this these packages that were sent to Trump's critics but I think people have a lot of theories there um\nAnd I and the leftist they're never satisfied with they get one thing and that's an okay we're going to go to the ... and now we're going to push for universal health care and it's going to be Medicare for all and it's going to be healthcare for illegal immigrants than a one lesson that you\nYou know assuming you and what it looks like you're going to\nUm Congress than in North Dakota or what lesson did you share with others who are listening across the country about about this period and politics and\nWhat we need to do to keep this prosperity going obviously the markets had a rough ride last few days but in general things can't be couldn't be going much better on the economy\nNo you know the main lesson I Would share and and you know I was a energy regulator before I went to Congress six years ago in in North Dakota and the thing I Would share is let's return to a respect for states\n... you know the the these incredible laboratories of democracy called states will show the way in North Dakota chief among them and by the way\nSo will the soul of the states that I Would consider bad states places like California\nNorth Dakota is the second leading producer of oil in the in the country not because we produce more necessarily although we have a lot of it obviously in technologies unlocked it but but because places like California that have lots of it\nHas screwed it up okay they have a right to do that and and they have a right to have a a cost of living higher than than there are a ... quality of life but\nI I'd say that the thing I'd say is this trust the laboratories of freedom at the state level and that's what President Trump has done he's restored you know\nStates' rights and and that's what ... what a guy like Brett cabinet does on the courts and ... and just trust people at the most basic and local level and that means with their tax dollars that means with regulations it means having a respect for a return to\nCooperative federalism and you're going to find a federal government is far more efficient\nAnd much less not necessary frankly in many cases and you'll have a you know you'll have a much better country in my view\nUm congressman finally or a month at a time but your thoughts on these packages arriving at the residences or offices of Trump's critics\nWell it's my first thought is as a as a member of Congress my first thought is you know here we go again and whether it's you know the left or the right we all need to be more diligent ... and it's frankly it's scary but my my main thought is let's please not jump to conclusions let's\nYou know this is less than twenty four hours oh let's let's calm down let's let the FBI and the other law enforcement agencies do their work and let's

everybody's involved\nAnd the New York post reports today that a source briefed on the device at cirrhosis house and the one cent to CNN told the New York post on Wednesday that's yesterday\nThat they couldn't actually have blown up the devices and this is what I'm reading right here that they couldn't actually have blown up because neither was equipped with a blasting cap or other means of detonating explosive material\nThe source said there was nothing to ignite there was nothing there\nNow if these are not real explosive devices but only half baked explosive devices\nThen they're virtually identical to the castor bean attacks the pseudo rice and attacks we had [noise] and it wasn't just there was you know this guy was charged a week ago but we had these rice in attacks early against all of these government officials CIA director FBI Director secretary of defense\nOr chief naval operations turns out the guy was a navy veteran he's got to be for the navy but he's a democratic aides Trump one was sent to the uh the White House and to Trump\nAnd um and they caught the guy that is good\nBut it was just after it and that was early October earlier this month\nThen at the time of the Brett Kavanaugh vote there was another terrorist attack by left days with white powder and envelope sent to the home of Susan Collins Senator Susan Collins of Maine and also to Senator Ted Cruz\nNow the news media doesn't care about any of these things that I brush them off and they say well to the powder was a nurse so it's not a big deal well with the black powder here is effectively a ... because there is no way to detonate and uh that's that's important these are important clues\nAt the scene of the crime\nAnd I expect I certainly hope that we catch this SOB real soon either way I don't care what his politics are I Want I'm caught anyway but just reading the tea leaves there are a lot of\nUh peculiarities they're a lot of\nStrange little items here who's is the guy really so dumb that he misspelled okay you misspelled Brennan a B. R. E. N. A. and instead of N. N. A. you misspell she'll she'll leave off the the seat in ... and then you misspell Florida\nAnd you don't catch that and you're so smart that you're out buying these parts in your building the thing and you're on the Internet you know looking at all kinds of websites how to build a bomb in the kitchen of your mom\nAnd you build these devices and you get the clocks and you're now you're saying you're and you're wearing rubber gloves and you know finger bend you're so smart now you're doing this the pretty advanced stuff right and you misspell Florida and you misspelled\nNow you're doing this the pretty advanced stuff right and you misspell Florida and you misspelled Brennan and you misspell shields and use the giant American flag um things now now my friend Danny I talked to my friend any last night\nAnd here's his favorite clue at the scene of the crime\nThat leads him to believe that it's a Bernie Sanders fan the return address on all of the packages is to Debbie Wasserman Schultz in Florida she didn't get one male tour oh Eric Holder was involved in this\nShe didn't get one mailed to her but or should they be rejected for delivery to their actual destinations they return address was Debbie was mentioned it's now who despises for if you're like a right wing not living in a cabin in the ... year the right wing Unabomber\nDebbie was a mention it hasn't been on the radar for a long time where she's irrelevant she's not she hadn't been on television and months she might be having her makeup read tattooed on or something she's she's been out of the bill limelight for months now\nSo you can't have what you do see unless of course\nYou're a huge Bernie Sanders fan and you still bitterly resent\nDebbie was a man Schmitz for stealing the nomination from Bernie Sanders to give it to Hillary Clinton who hates Debbie Wasserman Schultz right now\nSome right wing Unabomber living on a mountainside in a cabin or being bitter to Bernie Sanders supporters who feel that Debbie robbed them of the nomination\nWho hates Debbie Wasserman I I mean if you're out there I you know Republicans here W's name and and sort of go there you know but that's about it because she is she hadn't been a part of the discussion for ages now\nAnd she was replaced when it was found she was cheating and lying and stealing for Hillary and uh and and I don't think Republicans are all burned up over that'd be ... but I can tell you that Bernie Sanders supporters are\nSo now if you're just pursue that line of thinking for a moment of frothy hate filled angry Bernie Sanders supporter is lashing out and and I don't like the you know false a ... you know that phrase I Try to not use canned a heck need Washington phrases\nBut this might be one of those or it might be a fake\nA right wing or a guy trying to pose as a write ringer and he thinks that also stupid he deliberately misspelled her name he thinks they have a flag on them at all times so he gets the big flag I'm a stamps and in the end the big joke is that a Debbie was mentioned it gets all of the mailings that are rejected ha ha that's funny\nBut it goes down the list of people that President Trump has taken shots at which directs the big giant hand in the sky the finger in the sky at a Donald Trump for the media\nAnd uh you know and and their habits so these are these are clues let's go to other telephones let's go to David in Maryland David you're on the cruise plant show\nBoring Chris how are you a great David thank you I was wondering\nI don't I'm having a hard time buying this whole thing

elections which the Democrats have said are so important\nWell there's a big debate about civility and who's aside as more violent and obviously it's the left\nI mean throughout my lifetime the left
