obviously\nEverything you think you can't you can't broadcast and I I don't mean mean over the radio just to others in general but it was very interesting and it's it's apropos of the big and kill a thing in more in our society so that a pastor called earlier or the wonderful man from I Believe was Cleveland\nOr Columbus I mean it was all\nA wonderful man from I Believe was Cleveland or Columbus ohio but I remember\nAnd\nIt was calling in about the importance of religious people voting specifically in his case Christians\nBut he began unbeknownst to me a ... law during my commentary on the

meant to be for Jews Christians atheists Buddhist Muslims agnostics every anybody\nIt's kind of makes sense to every body or does it make sense but why would I be offended for a Christian to say to a

function of our time\nAnd the Megan Kelly situation while obviously very very different is related in my opinion we have become walkers on egg shells in our society\n\nIt is it is a wonderful thing I

you if you can't say what's on your mind it's that's not that's not an achievement against racism or anti Semitism or other forms of bigotry some achievement\nIt's it's a form of\nHyper sensitivity

think I mean malice than don't listen than I should be I should be extra painted from your wife and I don't mean identity anybody\n\nBut if there isn't malice intended then then what is the ... ... what is the hyper sensitivity it's it just means I Can't talk to you naturally\n\nAnd that's what that's what the left because it's it always means of cause you see it's it's it's that they've got to be fighting some some new evil why they're micro aggressions because they acknowledge there's so little real racism in society they have to make it up\nOh you didn't mean it but you really are are you

what about the possibility\nWhat about the possibility that this could be\nA a a Russian effort and then FSB effort now I had a conversation yesterday with Peter joy ... Russian expert he was actually attacked possibly by\nA a potent cronies present I I ... anti puente stances he he specifically said to me no do you do not believe that this was a Russian effort this would have been sort of beyond the pale but isn't it interesting\nI edit your your that Chuck Todd was talking about this uh yesterday on ... on on MSNBC\nI have this fear that it could be some Russian operation to design to do what's happening now more of this you know I think it ... and so in some ways we shouldn't allow me to lie to extraordinary strange moments and and we have no idea where it comes from\nWe have no idea where it comes from it's absolutely true and remember I said context\nIs everything right when we talk about when we talked about uh the Peter Struck Lisa Page the FBI situation with regards to the Trump campaign contacts with everything with that time what you had to understand the timeline in order to understand what was going on\nThe same thing can apply here and get knocked conspiracy the horizon again I Am just trying to find meaning in what is a very bizarre situation\nVery bizarre situation how how do you have ten bombs or a fake or otherwise go through the postal service without a without a um a post mark on them and without that post mark on them\nHow do you discovered that they came out of Florida now that's very strange to me but but the point is this is interesting [noise] so this all the episodes from happening a couple of days ago last week\nLast week the United states announces\nThat they are pulling out of the intermediate nuclear intermediate range nuclear forces treated the I N F treaty signed by Bob uh signed by um I'm President Reagan\nIn negotiations were pulling out because the Russians are violating that treaty Vladimir Putin's turns around and says if the United states starts deploying missiles in Europe\n\nThan the Russians are going to have to retaliate they're going to start targeting those countries and that's a that's a very direct threat\nAt the same time us backed forces and us equipment is being used to kill Russian or or to kill a Russian soldiers on the ground\nIn Syria the Russians are not happy about this and so to me given what the Russians have been willing to do\nIt is not beyond the pale and it wasn't remember the Russians were literally killing people in Great Britain or trying to kill people in Great Britain I should say\nLiterally trying to kill people in Great Britain we notice\nSo it to me it's not it's not beyond the realm of possibility\nThat they would turn around and send bombs that were knocked the we're not real bombs fake bombs dummy bombs through the post office to a bunch of democratic targets in order to turn the left and right against each other even further that is what Vladimir Putin wants\n\nAnd I think it makes a heck of a lot more sense than either a right wing or or left wing or sending fake bombs through the mail\nIn any case when we come back we're going to be joined by Todd would former air force pilot editor in chief ... dot com national security columnist for the Washington Times taking your phone calls eight five five\nForty war that is a number of taking your tweets at Andrew underscore lender on Twitter I'm Andrew leg or I Am sitting in for ...\n\nIt's your last week to get the Gen you sell sunspot correct or for free for

spray nerve gas all over the u._k. yeah field several\nPeople or one person and so it is possible however I think it would be incredibly reckless and literally an act of war targeting you know former political leaders and for you know vice presidents et cetera or the United states I don't think the Kremlin is that reckless at this point now that's just my point you know I have reporters\nAll over the former Soviet Union and I just don't believe that they would do that\nAt this point in time well let me ask you this because getting getting back to this high enough treaty and you've written about it and I agree with you wholeheartedly the time has come for America to pull out of it um but ... has now turned around and said that that if the U.S starts placing intermediate range missiles in\nCentral Europe he's going to target and I don't know what he means by targeting maybe you can elucidate us on that\nBut what you know that he's going to target these countries I talk so what is it what does that mean and and how ... what is what does it mean that he's going to target and how seriously should the u._s. be taking various threats by putting on the treaty pullout\nWell that's exactly what you would think he would say I mean what else is going to do except threaten you know the U.S in countries where we may deploy intermediate range nuclear missiles\nJust like we did a you know in the eighties under Ronald Reagan with that person to is against the ss twenties et cetera that were deployed throughout the Warsaw Pact against western nations\nAnd so when he means by targeting is is really just putting the coordinates of Warsaw or you know hungry or whatever in the in the uh targeting part time out those that carry this\nTime and this is so you're literally he literally means targeting like like when when I'm a Michael Moore went to Russia to try to find the nuclear missiles that were targeted at a at Detroit is literally he's talking about about changing target coordinates\nOh for sure he he I mean what I mean my point of that article is that we've seen this all before it and this is how we bankrupted the Soviet Union there is no way that Russia\nCan keep up with us economically especially under the Trump academy which in two years maybe pushing seven percent growth there is just absolutely no way they can keep up and he's trying to Boston and then I noticed he went to the United nations and the you know tried to drum up support there to force us to not\nWithdraw from the treaty but this is classic Trump negotiations that you know threaten to try to keep them in the treaty to begin with and had them stop violating what they're doing\nMy guess is Todd more he's a former U.S air force pilot a he's a national security columnist for the Washington Times this piece in the Washington Times an arms race with Russia bring it on I think it'll go up on on more as a a Web site certainly will go up on the ... show page\nOn Facebook so go and check that out there explain to us a little bit about what ... dot com is 'cause that's that's fascinating to me\nYeah well I Know I have a long history or in Russia studied it at the air force academy the language I you know learned about the Soviet Union are flying for the airports I traded emerging market down on Wall street for almost Twenty years\nFocusing on Eastern Europe and other countries and so I Know a lot about the region and I just really realize that the west especially Americans in you know middle America or don't know anything really about what's going on over here so\nI have built a team of reporters and we're growing rapidly the traffic is growing and and we're really just trying to bring news analysis culture opinion as to what's happening here\nWell and the important point and and you and I own a lot of talk more about this because I was I was a Soviet Studies major in college myself and so and I also learn the language are you at the very least I Need to brush up on my Russian so I'm always looking for people to talk to the pot a show dog\nShe was on a show [laughter] so not but my my question a lot of sleep people what they don't understand is it is it this is really it's not for ... and it's not about\nReestablishing the Soviet Union but it really is about reestablishing the trappings of the Russian Empire and and\nAll you're exactly right until the end of things like me\nWell ... thank you but you got ... [laughter] as I Do not suitable show ya [laughter] playing that a little bit explain explained what that means in the modern context of what a modern Russian Empire looks like\nWell I don't know what a modern Russian Empire looks like but I'll tell you what the ultimate looked like it stretched from Poland and people don't notice all the way into San Francisco there's a Fort roost you can go to in San Francisco Yeah Bill exist today as a monument\nAnd so bizarre empire was huge Russia before the Soviet Union was one of the most productive successful countries they said to you know really half the world with their economy and their agriculture\nAnd adjust now a hundred years later got back to that point and so that tells you what the Soviet Union did to them it destroyed them economically destroyed them politically culturally\nI mean what Russia last with the Soviet I'm a you know the ... revolution is just astounding and I would that's what I don't want to happen here so we write a lot about\nThat but I mean this is this is why this is changing stance visa V. Russia is so important I mean the the idiotic Russian reset that's then secretary of State Hillary Clinton was talking about was completely ineffectual the the the you know it's not just that the Russians only understand strengths it's not quite that\nBut the Russians have to respect your ability to push back and and to know that you're serious about what you're doing I mean don't I mean that that's what makes what we're doing now so different than what the Obama administration tried to doing that right\nOf course and if you want collusion I mean the Obamas or their their entire administrative on down with the ones that colluded with Russia and still probably are in some ways uh you you look at a uranium ... you know those sales you look at what's going on with the Trump dossier et cetera I mean there was\nIntricate interaction with the Russian security services by the bomb in his administration against a political candidate and so\nIt's just amazing to me that people don't get that still or they don't want to I guess\nTaught how to folks have folks find out more about what you're up to the good working and doing that I listen to how I get in touch with you when I Want to talk Russian whether you're\nA well I can always go to ... dot com the S.

I don't want to lead to any conclusion to\nThe news media is that well this is so Trump's well this is Trump's will then again who James Hodgkinson was a Bernie Sanders volunteer who loved Rachel Maddow on MSNBC and the Southern Poverty Law Center and he was shot to death by the police in a suicide attack where he attempted to mass assassination of Republican members of Congress\nThat is a non story in the pantheon of stories of the Trump Administration that as an uncovered story they again last week\nUh our rights and to Susan Collins the week before that the death threats against cabinet

something approximately three am they kept changing the time but approximately three am the president tweeted about this\nAnd the news media became very upset\nBecause he took a shot at the news media and he said that there should be unity and now he's taking a shot at us but unity isn't about unity with you it's between um you know neighbors and family members in the United states of America you

book on it as happiness is a serious problem I don't usually mentioned it but it would be idiotic for me not to but\nI I Wish I could put out a list of people who said that his changed their lives and I that's what I Want to do with my wife does change people's lives for the better so I Know it sounds corny but it's completely sincere\nTopic today is identity that you are going to be a happier person a with more identities and I specifically gave sexual national and religious as examples\nIdentifying as your sex identifying with your nation identifying with their religion\nIt makes you a happier person the alternative is to be what if you don't identify with any of those forgetting the sexual for a moment ... ... you would uh if you don't have a national religious identity then what are you you're a human which is lovely obviously\nBut there is no happiness in nearly being human I'm human as opposed to what frog cow\n\nOr I don't I don't see why that gives you any sense of happiness I think we should all care about all humans that's a separate issue that's a moral question I'm not speaking about morality mailing speaking about happiness and identity\nThere's no identity human as opposed to what as I said you're not a ... a turtle\nI don't see how that can contribute to one's happiness\nI can see how celebrating being French or being Japanese are Being American tech contributes to your happiness but I don't know how celebrating being a human as opposed to 'cause it all of these or in distinction identity by definition is in distinction\nTo obviously that's fine no\nThere's nothing wrong with that it doesn't mean that others are bad or that you hate others that's that's that's what you learn to graduate school but it's not true in part because you did learn to graduate school\nSo I if I if you if you celebrate being French then you're not celebrating are being Paraguay him as that is correct or American that's fine I I think it's great you celebrate being French that that's good\nSo long as I mean if someone's there aren't obviously immoral components to your celebration but that would be true but anything but if you're a human you're celebrating um human as opposed to what it doesn't mean anything there was no other thing that you could be\nOkay that was important\nOkay it was important okay everybody let me\nLet me talk to you Long Island

that need to explain myself the they push of if you will um ... left U.S forces which are attacking these identities I\nI don't know how to handle it any longer I truly don't because I feel that's how

want to talk too much politics on the happiness our but I'm not going to deny reality or what what she says is true\nSusan wants to know how you handle it ... the only way to handle it very well there
