U. V. first time I've always just driven a car\nAnd anyway shopping for an SUV and I are very rarely shop for cars because for much of my the last decades I have been driving cars of advertisers which\nEventually they they sold their businesses in any way be whatever it is it now as we're having a new experience to having had in a while ago in the car dealers and I don't want to give car dealers\nIn ... to having had in a while ago in the car dealers and I don't want to give car dealers the business I Want to do with the Internet I Want to know what to do it with the car dealers\nLet me give them the business but it was it was really fascinating everybody was nice I mean all the sales people were nice it's not an issue there almost all young men with whom I took the test drives I think in every instance of five I think for four or five five young men\nBut the thing that got my wife and me was any question I mean ... any question that I asked was clear they didn't have an answer and they said with no embarrassment I'll look it up oh let me let me this look that up\nSo uh as I said at the end I think that if this is it all representative and it may not be fully acknowledged that but if it is it all representative\nThere were two things that immediately strike me and one is that the idea that you should know as much as possible even about a product you're selling has has not registered\nBecause hey I could look it up\nWhy why do I have to know if that SUV can come in all wheel drive why would I have to know the ... of the of that an SUV versus the other one it's like ... all I could always look it up and the other is in general knowledge may not be valued\nWhy do you need to know anything if you could just pull out a little smartphones from your pockets and find out all you need to know\n\nThis is now if you feel that my general generalization is not valid or you do I'm very curious\nTo hear from you because it made a real impact on us I

human rights campaigner and an ...\nThe guy put people's lives in danger he has no respect for US law no respect for us immigration law and apparently his goal is to do one thing\nFlood the United states with mostly indigent low skilled workers who cannot speak English and who just want to live here and not follow our laws because if they did they'd be filling out immigration paperwork like everyone else around the country\nNo respect for Guatemala's migration for Mexican migration law and now us migration that's three countries laws they violated by doing this busting passed police officials in some cases assaulting police officials it is a scandal\nAnd by the way other elements in this a migrant mob are present us border patrol officials have reported that\nThe vast majority of these people are not criminals\nThere no terrorists and they're not even immigrants that refugees and ask a nation in the United states we have to choose what kind of mission we are and treat them that well we had our pre Josh ... we're going to say all of them are are criminals all of them I represent that is not true so what do we have to do\nIs to listen to them through the cases and they just sort of political asylum Ben run if\nHe so he so uninformed he he refers to them as refugees\nA newsflash Jorge refugees under US law have to apply out of country they can apply at a port of entry so don't refer to them as refugees or not their economic migrants meaning they want to come here because it's a better place to live\nBetter place to live in Honduras well yeah a lot better places are I'm sure a lot of places are not as nice as the United states but that's that's just the way it is\nYou don't respect our laws you do not deserve to be in this country period\nEnd of story respect or laws enough to apply legally and that is it\nWe cannot be mom out by these uh by these emotional extortion is no way\nThey're emotional terrorists these people and and I and we know what they do they did it with the separation of families they don't give a rat's you know what about the victims of illegal immigrant crime in the United states they never and by the way when these midterms are over they won't even be covering the care of them don't want to be covering it did they think somehow this is going to help them\nHere you have the probiotic stage demonizing thousands of migrants coming towards this war that effectively shut down the border to asylum seekers and refugees and so on a who many of these people were sexually qualify for that kind of status use going off on these migrants are describing them as I must Thirteen or no Middle Eastern\nI I don't need to hear about Bangladeshis joined the migrant caravan in Guatemala according to Univision correspondent yesterday\nA Spanish language reporter who spent weeks embedded with the migrant caravan said said that people from Bangladesh had joined the mass of people trying to cross from ... in Mexico but on the east coast Santa Ana reporting from the bridge separate in Guatemala Mexico the bridge had been packed with thousands of migrants\nThe Bangladeshis he said were detained and immigration facility though it's not clear what happened to them after the detention\nThey infiltrated themselves in his care of and they tried to cross with a crowd if that would have benefited them greatly but everybody's here everybody is here just to just to add\nTo our are already rich culture because everything's a melting pot and now we're literally it's all a melting pot ask\nWestern Europe how mass migration into Western Europe has changed Western Europe has changed Germany has changed Italy it's changing Sweden\nAsked their pants\nHow uncontrolled migration has affected their crime their way of life period a five five forty Laura we got a lot more to get you don't go away\nHappier much here author has really mellowed\nShe is a hundred and five pounds of shiny happy dog for life the shooting

tried sail except of come to a diner by drought and now the I\nGuess he wants to talk now you got to be the ... the omega three fatty acids and the thing that I just love I Love that are cooked out of regular dog food fight is Tricia dying to fight for life\nHas been in politics thirty six years that's about as long as I've been alive she's been in Washington for twelve long years she's become a party line liberal I mean whether it's immigration we're sponsoring this open borders bill with diet fine died\nOr whether it's the judges you voted no on justice Kavanaugh was all for the terrible me or that her party carried out she voted no on Gorsuch ... Supreme Court justices\nThat are McCaskill is a seat just terribly out of step\nWith the state of Missouri of what the people of this ... voted for and that's why we're going to replace\nSo right now on this issue of this migrant mob I don't like calling in a caravan it does not now that doesn't really [laughter] it doesn't really capture it in my view\nI one of the people of Missouri thinking about like a crash like this on the border I mean it's a ... it's going to be a crash and it's going to and it's going to cause a huge problem for immigration officials and it's for the national guard\nThat I think that the people in Missouri really worried about it I mean I as I travel all over the state I have I have people talk to me about it especially the last few days I mean this yesterday every stop I made all over the the people asked me they said what is going on and they all with their status thank goodness but we have a president\nWho is strong and who is willing to take steps to defend the country on like the Democrats unlike Claire McCaskill who they're open borders policy of course are what encourage this kind of lawlessness and this kind of threat to the country and now to have Claire McCaskill of base of this threat\nOn during an open borders bill I I just can't think of any worse I Can't think of anything all week I Can't think of anything that's more dangerous for months food or for the country\nWell when you ah Josh look at uh the rest of America right now it seems that\nThe support for Donald Trump is growing you than its highest point in his presidency which is stunning given how perpetually negatives\nThe press is I mean it is a negative drumbeat coming out of almost every mainstream media outlet even with that he's at forty seven percent which is higher than Brock Obama was or how important is the president in this race for you\nTo report and you know Missouri voted for Donald Trump by almost twenty points on that that is a huge huge margin in Missouri which is still a swing state and it's because people wanted what I Want a strong America I mean people voted to rebuild our country that's what they were voting for my state\nWhen they voted for President Trump and his policies\nAre rebuilding the country under good from Missouri You know we've got our lowest unemployment rate it decades and the state of Missouri\nJob growth finally hitting new high we've got blue collar economic growth job growth of the highest point since the Nineteen eighties in the state rural unemployment slow so we're finally starting to get those jobs back from overseas your wages grow but\nHere's what scared folks is that the Democrats Claire McCaskill want to take all that away throw it all in reverse reverse of all the games and then go back to the policy of weakness\nOverseas weakness on our border and the you know we just can't have that and that's what this election is about\n[noise] Josh how has these if at all these undercover videos of Claire McCaskill Harris her and her staff is that\nResonated at all what the voters where people are are saying that worked for a while we have to kind of lie to the voters we can't really say what we really mean about a various issues\nThough I think it's been usually resident and you know the people to pay to to have a politician especially lifetime politician like Claire McCaskill the one thing to their faith in the open up behind their back into the sea Claire McCaskill on tape\nSaying that she wants to take away the second amendment right now he's a constitutional rights\nBut the belong to people by virtue of our constitution to hear her talk about I was to take those away from all by citizens here staffed talk about\nConcealing the donations from Planned Parenthood and other extremist abortion groups to talk about the fact that well you know the McCaskill really agrees with Brock Obama on everything but she won't say that publicly because you know Missouri voters are\nAre so close minded I mean that's essentially what our staff was caught thing over and over and over again\nIt's it's really the condescension the contempt for everyday voter is really remarkable and people are tired of that they want somebody who believes in the state who is not ashamed of our way of life in this state and it's going to go represented\nA Josh or\nWhen you look at the makeup of the Democratic party today the\nPerpetual mob mentality that seems to be encouraged and even celebrated or by some of their top leaders or how does this you know I mean it seems like maybe it's just a big cities and this is happening it's not so much and\nAnd you know in in places like Missouri but it it it's covered a lot in certainly certainly at Fox and other networks\nIs that on people's minds the president says mobs not jobs ah ah and it seems like people just want things to calm down and government work for them\nYou know I think that we had ... you know I I think that what the Democrats have on offer what Claire McCaskill is offering it chaos at home and weakness abroad and this this model behavior it it is chaos than it is ...\nAnd I think with folks watch mom's driving people out of restaurants screaming them down and public\nBanging on the doors of the U.S Supreme Court and shouting obscenities I mean this is not the United states of America or this is not\nCivil democratic discourse I'm all for strong disagreement that's great that's the first amendment but to try and shut down speech and harassed intimidate and even using violence against people I mean and have Hillary Clinton as you say Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder out they're encouraging it\nClaire McCaskill you know she is she's going to ride along with it I mean she is happy to see the mob tactics employed that is not what the people in my state voted for that that is not who we are as Americans\nAre Josh I'm the concern I think a lot of um conservative\nReligious voters have is the\nTransformation of the country the the idea that gender is something that is changeable and uh that\nThat gender is something that is changeable and uh that you know that we should really\nCelebrate their things in public schools and and obviously the conscience rights and the religious rights of many say that's not what we believe we love all people but that's not what we believe how ... how are the social issues playing in your state this election cycle\nYou know I was earning leaving the company they believe in the first amendment First Amendment guarantees the freedom of religion or to purchase individuals you know this is something wrong but the most of my career holding the politics your\n... and I know you're doing a lot of girls out there but\nYeah yeah most of my career as a constitutional lawyer\nBut as a religious liberty lawyer and the people they they are they're minded people ah they you know we don't discriminate against anybody based on their religious views but you know what we believe that the important for the value of faith and we believe that the important value family community and those things built around\nThe churches in our houses of worship and we want to see those protected and I have the again the left wing agenda which has become so hostile\nTo people of faith a so hospitals are religious liberties just like a talk show through our Second Amendment rights just like to come off all the free speech me think about it what what the left wing of the really offered to\nYou know you agree with us or you shut up\nAnd that is just not what the people of ice they want people to country\nI'll tell you Josh why I think that Missourians are going to do the right thing and vote for you or met many reasons obviously substantive reasons I mean you have the right views on critical\nIssues from crime to the economy and immigration so forth but I'll tell you why I think you're going to win is because the New York times is already writing ridiculous\nArticles about about your office in turmoil first of all you show me an office that doesn't have personality conflicts and and uh and people moving in and out and departures and so forth\nBut if this is the best that they can do with you that oh well we had a a a surprising number of purging departing staff from the attorney general's office I started reading this today and I was screaming laughing because it's just like they can say that about pretty much everybody knows office\nWhere we are definitely getting the Donald Trump treatment\nLove your time from the liberal state and\nI Do I wear a badge of honor I mean you know and I by the way I'm not going to apologize but all taking up government bureaucracy you know when I came to office I Would I'm the first Republican uh twenty five years\nOf the office needed to be shake it up it needed to be made more efficient it needed to be a ... that's what we did and you know what a great result but I don't care for New York times likes it or not I promised I Would do the people ... done exactly what I said I Would do and that's all the better\nYeah mom I I just think it's I mean as someone who has been written about so much Josh I mean you don't you just gotten a little taste of it compared to me\nBut I read these things and I read them much differently than most people I just read between the lines like oh okay uh-huh mhm yeah right now anyway I I think that is the best news this article is like the best news I read about you\nAre so now I I like you even
