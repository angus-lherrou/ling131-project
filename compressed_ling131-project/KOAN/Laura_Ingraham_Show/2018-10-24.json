Salvadoran they left a during the war in Nineteen in the Nineteen eighties uh Nicaragua's same thing left during the war came here settled here amazing people great families\nWhy would they think the

lot of debt credit card debt and I heard a commercial for trinity I gave them a call\nIf you're inducted and you need him called trinity of one eight hundred seven nine for over four three seven\nWhen I first called I was a little embarrassed and kind of a shame and I looked at the numbers and I saw how quickly that astronomical debt that was in my life would go away\nTrinity will consolidate your accounts to a new one easy to manage monthly payment reduce your interests and possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands\nWhat I Would tell other people please pick up the phone and called trinity just let them put together a program and see how affordable and easy it is to pay off your debt\nHis answer to me was that votes have consequences and you will be held accountable and November it wasn't I'm Sorry it was an hour to realize the parallel it was like I'm going to college you even more in spite of what I've just gone through\nA and people in Pennsylvania and have just you know just come up leaving his friends can't understand what would cause him to do something to be so heartless evil\nSee are you saying that he green let this commercial and he in in twenty four hours he they wrote a commercial that used or or had an example I'm an anecdote that used your story or that it was already in the pipeline they should have taken it down\nIt wasn't running yet so whether they already had they had it in the pipeline of what they were going I I've I've just found it pretty ironic that yeah well it's tasteless yet he was a commercial that had twins with cancer you know something you think about doing when you're doing a commercial\nAnd the fact that he ratted after he knew what happened and and and wouldn't take it down he he only will take it down in Scranton uh because his own friends and family chance than seeing a but yet it's still running as we speak today he's he continues to run this\nNeck about despicable as disgraceful excuse me on but I think like the very least you should have\nJust taken a taking the thing down if you didn't know if it if it was some wild coincidence you should have just taken a down a little bit I think for you for you the best thing to do at this point is to run on the issues and the issues are facing the country today\nAre are of course if immigration crushed at the border which affects every aspect of our lives from economic to national security and health and and uh all other concerns a sovereignty and so forth\nAnd what do you believe should be done with these ah roving hordes of border busters\nUp they would have listened to me back in two thousand six maybe ... you know we wouldn't have had this problem you know I I I've been a standing up against illegal immigration this is an invasion there's no other way\nThere's no other way to put it and it's people like Senator Bob casey who supported support catch and release\nA that is really just encouraging people ... and you know for all these years of of the week politicians in Washington who who want to talk about a pathway to citizenship basically giving a green light to people all over the world come to America once you get here you can't leave\nThe American people are fed up with this this is why Donald Trump was elected president because they want people up a backbone and save lives and we're the most generous country in the world but you've got a follower rules\nWe you know we we need to know who you are you know what your background your medical we need to do all this you can't just walk in here and tell us a you know whether or not you you're going to leave or stay and we have politicians who actually support that case you support sanctuary cities\nI it's just beyond me that that uh that we have people who who are in elective office the frying our laws\nAre a little the state of Pennsylvania they've gotten twenty sixteen was going to be a you know the Waterloo for Donald Trump he ended up winning a and yet some of those numbers have\nA very least softened for the president in Pennsylvania what what's happening there that would that would cause an erosion in Republican support is it isn't isn't demographic changes due to immigration is it trade what is it\nNo it's nothing it's that these experts of pollsters\nAnd Washington consultants have it wrong and just like I told them in twenty and twenty sixteen I told the then candidate Donald Trump in Gettysburg about a week and a half before the election\nDon't pull out of Pennsylvania the polls around his how when he was down ... points I said they're wrong they're not getting the right in Pennsylvania they they don't understand people here in Pennsylvania and many of them who were Democrats because their fathers and grandfathers were Democrats\nAnd they were JFK Democrats and this Democratic Party\nRepresents nothing that people here in Pennsylvania or can can associate with but they're not going to change their registration and they're not going to tell a pollster they're afraid their grandparents will roll over and over a grave if they switched parties or or or said they were going to vote for Republican but they did and the and\nDonald Trump is not disappointed people here in Pennsylvania one bit and the pollsters are wrong they they have our race ...

actually meant\nRacial nationalism or white nationalism Oh thanks yeah and if he called himself or not so you're going to call himself a Nazi but he didn't do it so they're changing what he said so they're going to attack them for what he didn't say\nWhich is of course Greg types\nExactly what he did me liberals know what people mean they can tell that there are no criminals in the care of him

the New York times they knew what was in his heart what he was thinking\nAnd they all know that President Trump says that if you go into the crowd there you'll find them as Thirteen you'll find people from the middle east they found people from Bangladesh not technically geographically the middle east but close enough\nAnd they're they're not coming from Central America well they are but I'm

immediately identified during routine male screening procedures see there it is as potentially explosive devices and we're appropriately handled as such\nThe protests keys that is Obama and Clinton\nDid not receive the packages nor were they at risk of receiving them the secret service has initiated a full scope of criminal investigation that real leverage all available federal state and local resources to determine the source of the packages and identify those responsible\nNow that's the role that the secret service has in this um and protecting protect tease as they're called the secret service would also I'll be putting out a statement if one was in fact receive that the remote mail facility for the White House they would be a responsible likely for putting out a statement on that as well um\nThe White House or put out a statement also president Donald Trump has been briefed on the packages White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders released a statement condemning

ten what does that now thirty six fifty and uh and uh that many suspected terrorists every day so it's inconceivable it's just it's I I don't think that what it means what you think it means\nIt's

uh then they started gaming gaining steam and ... says told the television station in Honduras you an e unique\nUh that uh they're going and that's what started so he's a hardcore left wing a guy and
