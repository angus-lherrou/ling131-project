can already voted early vote early but get out and vote Rhonda Santas in Florida he's up against this Gillum this horrible socialist guilt we Florida governorships going to be a bad deal so everybody's got to get out and vote\nThat he and he's getting millions and millions of dollars from a left wing billionaires Gillum even as the mayor of aid at of one of the few cities in Florida that was handled and run really badly you want him nowhere near the governorship I can tell you that right now eight five five forty Laura oh let's go to Mike in Arizona on line three Mike\nHow are you I'm great I was so proud to be a conservative and I love my president I think you did a great job handling list and I don't want him to cater to the Democrats have you done with their city and he should have\nBeen accused of of of of being wrong then if you could go on down there and paid more attention in study showed leadership you did what you were supposed to have things in or if you were not suffering because\nYou know I see a red wave in our area I don't know of any Democrats are going to be elected year I'm I'm just like\nMy own and but just like you got to ... to the right thing on

something terrible what is it\nAnd that's kind of their approached everything right now and it makes them frankly a little bit nutty\nWell and I think that uh again the the theory in the frenzy ah has gotten to a point knew that when I was talking to folks say yesterday who were in Washington and in Nineteen sixty eight riots after Martin Luther king and Robert Kennedy or both assassinated\nAnd they were saying that they hadn't seen anything is is angry and frenzied since then do you think that's accurate yeah\nI think I think basically you had extraordinary intensity up through\nWatergate you had a memory at a million people surrounding the Pentagon at one point or you had soldiers who found that they couldn't go through airports are being harassed or the new is a very bitter very divisive time\nAh but I think after that uh we became sort of more normal for a while and uh now we're drifting back a because this is a genuine\nA cultural civil war I mean you know [noise] what Hillary Clinton said that it wasn't and actors that shot some people but she's basically right or when we're point or somebody like a justice cabin all\nBecause we want to return to a constitutionally based court system that uses the American system as this model not some European or South African or other kind of system and as a result\nIf your a left wing a Democrat we we we're at the end of your world ... you know they had hope desperately\nTo change America and now\nThe American people are responding and saying no we don't want to say we liked Being American and I think that has become\nJust an enormously good or blow for the uh people who who thought up until election night two thousand sixteen they were ... Hillary Clinton who's gonna when they go at the two justices you got\nAnd he'll or even ... oh my God you know they'd be so far to the left and so so unwilling to look at the American constitution that will really been a very dramatic difference compared to where we are now\nOr I Want to play for you or Larry ... who of course famously bombed and his protections for twenty sixteen but nevertheless has this production for the midterms\nIf there has ever been an abnormal presidency where he had it\nAnd the Trump is violated so many of the rules of politics in so many of the norms of politics a red wave ain't gonna happen it's just a question of how big the blue wave is sick it'd be a suit on me it could be a middle sized way they can be a small way it's going to be a blue wave\nAh what is your reaction thought\nWell maybe he's right with probably isn't I'm In the first question I asked is how come we just one hey you a state Senate special election\nIn Texas state Senate seats in Texas were bigger than congressional seats eight hundred thousand people along the border sixty three percent are Hispanic or and we won the first time on a hundred and thirty nine years what's his explanation\nOr how come a mix Sally the Republican nominee in Arizona's now heads or how come that uh Kramer the Republican candidate in North Dakota is ahead by maybe fourteen points or in his in ah\nTennessee as people begin to realize the British and actually the Democrat actually wrote a book explaining that Obamacare didn't go far enough and explaining how you could get to a government run health system ... starting to fall apart mhm and Tennessee is going to end up affecting remote and I'm just getting a sense of\nYou know somebody out of ... and say uh where is the worst of the blue wave in the Senate I don't think it exists\nNow and of course we see these races in any somebody's governors' races the one that I'm really watching is the Andrew Gillum\nVersus Ron I'm a dissent is because for me and for some many of watch the growth and flow of Florida and how well it's been a run by Rick Scott\nAnd and to the idea of turning that state over is critical that stayed in the country electoral politics to a guy who was basically a socialist is just that just cannot happen and yeah he's getting millions and millions of dollars Newt from all the usual suspects\nCharlie Chaplin I mean Gillum is um [noise]\nThe latest great hope\nBecause you came out of nowhere as radical Democrats uh he won an upset primary victory or eat the key temporarily looks very good I think you'll be fading day by day as this goes on but uh but when you say governorships remember that there's a study just came out the ten most popular governors in states\nAre all Republican every single one of the ten highest rated governors or a Republican or the governor of Massachusetts hardly a red state is gonna win in a landslide the governor of Maryland hardly a red state is gonna win or in a landslide\nAnd the reason is exactly why we're building a majority in the country they get results\nThey don't just have resistance are they actually have things that work they don't just have fantasies and strange ideas and I think we have to be prepared to wage a campaign\nThat drives home again and again and again the difference between a the kind of left wing fantasies that are not you can't afford them you can implement them a long run they're not going to work\nAnd I think that's one of our key jobs this campaign to draw the distinction between results and resistance and certainly the attorney General Holder was a perfect example of a resistance says the alternative\nYeah I I really think and again we'll see how it translates into turnout\nAnd says the alternative yeah I I really think and again we'll see how it translates into turn out I think those images of the protesters banging on the Supreme Court doors completely out of control\nA I think that's I I don't\nThink people like that they did not like everything Trump tweets or\nThey might be annoyed at some of the things he says are exaggerates crowds I what I get that but I think the this frenzy people want it all to calm down they just want things to calm down they want to come down on both sides and I\nSo I think the Democrats made a really bad miscalculation on this cabinet thing and\nI think it puts them in a much more vulnerable place in a midterm cycle that they thought they you know they were going to just roll right into with you know fifty seat pickup ah so that's my sense of it in holders comments\nMaxine Waters I don't know I think all of it is it gives people a bad feeling\nAnd I think you can draw the contract students here you have an economy which is\nBooming at a level people said was impossible you know jobs being created your lowest\nBlack on employment in history the lowest Latino unemployment in history or you have a remarkable achievers would deregulation you have solid conservative judges being appointed show every time you turn around right now you're seeing genuine results\nAnd then you have as you point out um people who seem ...\nI mean is this really the America you want you really want people who come into a restaurant to harass people and drive them out when people banging on the Supreme Court doors are and I and I think in some cases of course we know the George stores and others actually pay for them uh which doesn't you know does that justify him\nBut the whole system that the left to try to create I think used in the end or not a sustainable systems\nNewt I Know you're doing a lot of uh of events before the midterm elections and there's one on October Fifteen or\nWhere you can register to um attend an evening with Newt Gingrich and you'll be able to hear you talk about\nWhat's in store for the country what's at stake for the country in the mid term so how do people end up uh attending this do they do and and and you know let me let me just\nSay also that we're we're very excited they they can go to\nAn evening with Newt dotcom launched weaker and the evening with Newt dot com Leo beep and I are going to be they're talking about our American story and I'm going to take questions and frankly let the audience direct me I'm going to put them sort of pick what other topics we should talk about\nWell that's fantastic\nOh my gosh that's gotta be a lot of great an evening with new dot com so you can go there and I'm just have a lot of fun and look it's time to it's time to stand up for the American you want and I think I think Americans are they have a good now BS detector Newt for an an artful way of saying it but\nI don't know what what Trump's eccentricities came amazing results

effect\nAs soon as President Obama chose this holder guy you know his wife makes a lot of money off the abortion industry in Atlanta getting rid of the black population\nBut that's okay because he's
