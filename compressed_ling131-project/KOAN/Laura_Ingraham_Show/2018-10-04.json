reflect the will of the people so when they do it you have your Sean look Lindsey Graham the other day he walked through a Fox out of the green room\nPeople who are applauding us he's walking down the hall and hands shaking and like you just came back from war but he made a speech and the committee defending the nominee that's what he did\nBy the way the Durban letter just quickly it says no where this is Dick Durban to ... a Senator Grassley\nNowhere in any of these six cabin or FBI reports which the committee has reviewed on a bipartisan basis was there ever a whiff of any issue at all related in any way to inappropriate sexual behavior or alcohol abuse he wanted some of that\nReleased he thinks that the tweets that Grassley has been sending out mischaracterized what's in these FBI find\nIt so it's it's casting a poll that there might be more information about sex abuse or alcohol abuse in\nThis FBI report\nOn line three scouting the\nUh the I think a lot of people I've lost an appreciation for actually how profound your through all the political saturation of or you know the back and forth\nOut profoundly positive you exposure of the left or they're they're I mean they're rabid aggressive approach to New York to need need for power um it's\nIt's really almost like a like a drug addict addicted to the drug they're addicted to the pursuit of power so that literally anything to get there and what's happened in his cabinet hearing is literally\nFrom what I you know for I'm fifty three years old and from what I can see\nThis is literally one of the most important periods of time to witness you know that they it's their own destruction they did it to themselves but everybody else can now see I mean I've got plenty of Democrat from that or\nIt's just common sense you take a look at what what's been going on and everything that they're lobbying if this guy and they're really taking themselves down they did it for themselves and it's very very odd\nYeah that was the uh that was the open a show last night now if there's any doubt in anyone's mind just how out of control the Democrat Party is how they want to so chaos\nWhere we should have calm where they want to rebel route and intimidate instead of show results intimidation over ideas\nThat's where it is\nI think about it it's intimidation tactics you saw in the elevator and the restaurants in airports intimidation\nOver information and insights they intimidate this is all ... they're the biggest bullies in town they're intolerant other of other people's views while they claimed to be the most tolerant they call you haters while they're the most hateful\nThey say that you're anti immigrant when all they do is talk about white privilege racist and you're they're obsessed with race we want all people to be treated the same\nThe rule of law should treat all people to fame doesn't matter what color of your skin is when you cross the border illegally that's the that's why the law so important doesn't give preference over one group or another shouldn't a five five forty Laura glass half full I Believe that's coming up next a former assistant FBI\nOr a staffer from New York has interesting insights on what we're about to find out or not about these reports\n[noise]\nThe\n\nThe ... that are real life story from trinity debt management and\nI had a lot of credit card debt and I couldn't pay my bills I was feeling so bad I got to a point where I needed some help so I reached out and contacted trinity if\nYou're in depth and you need help cold trinity a one eight hundred seven mine for over four three something to talk to a certified comes and where\nThey were able to take all of my different payments and put them altogether\nTrinity will consolidate your accounts to do one easy to manage monthly payment put a stop to lead season over limit charges and reduce your interests and possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands\nAnd they were actually able to work with my creditors and being able to pay off to Fifteen thousand dollars in Alaska Eighteen months\nNot make a copy of it I don't know if they're going to allow him to make notes I don't know how they're going to stop that and um and then they can leave it for the next person to review but this is it's just a matter of time before something like that leaks out bottom line is how many interviews do you have to do are\nAs many as it takes is the latest pass the election that's what\nIt looks like they're out of cards so the the current mayor coming down on this don't you don't you get that sense there's no there's no more delays are going to vote on this this weekend\nI think they should or should not be any more delays you do the best you can do and the bottom line is the only thing that the that the Democratic side of the house really wants to hear is how many more interviews you can come up with people day after day after day that have something negative [noise] to to\nAllegedly offer ... and only to the way of looking at a a vote\nI think this is a it's going to be voted on I Believe by the end of the week [noise]\nThe um the complaint is that they did not looking to judge Kavanaugh's drinking when he was in college and law school or high school that that wasn't adequately investigate it and the supplemental what was your response to that they\nDo they know that if they haven't read it how do they know what's in the supplemental\nYou know they they don't know what questions are asked who was interviewed they might very well have interviewed a couple of guys that the the judge has some beers with or who should yeah I had beers with them and nothing ever happened to you know they don't know that they just socializing that they just want to keep the pot stir it up\nIn order to the you know continue that the alleged doubt\nA contrived out I look at it is but those that are opposed to the\n... we have an update here that Bill Bill a question for you Ronan Farrow in the New Yorkers are reporting that\nAh the FBI prove ignored testimony from former classmates of cabin all these are people that went to Yale with him and are they the the ... they're trying to\nRonan Farrow claims that these are primary eyewitnesses are witnesses to the Deborah Ramirez allegations the problem is as you read into this story you realize these are all here say witnesses who claim somebody told them that somebody told them that this happened\nSo would the FBI pro those people are they just seen as not credible witness is\nProbably not credible witnesses and and bottom line first of all it's coming from Ronan a secondly I'm a these if they're if they're not I witnesses after that they not permitted on the stand and a quarter law never mind are doing this and if you have to make that cut off someplace into what is ... you know\nComment what does make sense to do and none of these people make sense than anybody can come up with some sort of a story I heard from a friend of a friend that doesn't mean Gary any weight with anybody [noise] mhm\nWell again people think that the FBI is conducting some global investigation into any allegation no matter how remote\nAnd interviewing people on a hearsay basis where people have just hearsay recollections of things that happen Thirty years ago it make sense\nIt makes no sense for and that's not happening I think the problem that exists here\nAre the bureau is going to get sucked on the one way or the other if it comes out the way it appears it's going to come out in the ... the the democratic side of the houses are going to say they're all from\nTrump bands from the bureau if it if for instance something comes out that that does give everybody a pause and ... and it's credible uh then you know live there has got to take a black guy from the other side of that was\nI I just think it's a it's a very tough way to go but it's an investigation that um was demanded and done and let's get a vote\nI think again in the end people want to have\nPeople have faith in our in our institutions of government especially like the FBI and\nYou you don't want to believe that the FBI is acting in a political manner ever and I think that the media do an enormous disservice went on an issue like this with no you know with no corroborating contemporary contemporaneous witnesses\nTo expect field agents or the FBI to be doing these types of you know broad ranging ... brought us this kind of broad ranging slew thing into the background\nOf some and this is not what the what the FBI does and people don't either get that or the media has been so remiss\nIn not reporting properly what the role of the FBI us\nBut you see the ignorance that it's a willful ignorance of the media and then the the poor people who don't know any better or who don't have time to delve into these issues I'm like wait why are they keeping the secret outrageous this shouldn't be secret this is our Supreme Court you know that's going to happen\nOf course it's going to happen we write is a combination of everything that you said or bottom line is the some of these people\nTruly don't believe um that there's anything going on that's wrong here it's because of who they support they have to say well I Believe that uh\nThat the judge Kevin I was guilty that you can't look at the facts and come out with that

full of liberals the audience is full of liberals 'cause it's in Atlantic event and Jeffrey Goldberg event and they fight a bunch of left us some of them actually had a baby organs in their pockets and he says I think\nAnd Lindsey Graham decided to try it on the line about a hundred dollar bill through a trailer park and the audience responded very negatively and Jeffrey Goldberg jumped in and he didn't want to say oh don't worry about it that's\nWhat we said about all of a the women accusing Bill Clinton of rape and sexual abuse he doesn't say that he kind of mumbled something oh it's somebody else's life or something but he didn't want the stupid audience who didn't know the line\nTo be told that it was James Carville a speaking on behalf of Bill Clinton smearing women that I had

disparaged her son who are watching that she was a victim of sexual President Trump's monitoring Court nominee\nI say I can figure this out and the thing he said was factional he's frustrated his

into Vietnam or something like that in mind [laughter]\nAnd ... and a Goldberg who knows perfectly well that is James turtle his buddies is a is a team guy is a total team got it's completely in the

the most important historically one of the most important conservative magazines in the United states to take him out an anti Trump or conservative flavor\nUnfortunately but it is what it is and I respect these people I'm not sure they respect me\n[laughter] I I I Do think that there is a a there are at least there was like that's what my point I think until the cabinet earring\nI think that was the suspicion among many of the anti Trump conservative intellectuals I'm a conservative intellectual who was pro Trump\nAnd I think that the handful of us have been suspect in the eyes of a lot of these people ... and ... and they've written about it Dennis Prager is devoted his life to character\nTo to speak about character writing about character to the importance of moral I mean this was

is is beyond belief and\nThat's why I send you to tax cuts work done calm I Love these people I'm a you know I don't say that about the sponsors all the time [noise]\nI I think all of them are grateful told them and I happen to know these are ... ... who is the I I always ... names of any ... and ... it's an exceptional human beings is you want to say wow some wild something from the living more you know ...\nLet me say something about tax cuts work their whole purpose is to make people realize how much could this president has done for this economy that is their purpose they want the country to know certainly to no by\nNo November\nHow much the economy has improved and and who's responsible\nThat's pretty that's a pretty noble purpose especially in light of all the other noise that's going on so these people are doing very serious important selfless work on our behalf so that I share your\nAdmiration\nWell that was a really eloquent and uh you know how rarely speaks\nSo that's that's that's right\nI think ah I think that the Capitol hearing has been a a seminal moment now you know when I say civil war I was never exaggerating I don't exaggerate\n... almost ever I Try never were in the civil war tax cuts work that they don't want a nickel for me they just want you to to go to their website take tax cuts work though\n\nI'm telling you that I Am perceiving a turning point half this country sickened by what the left has done and what the media have them and that's good they should've been sickened by the media\nThirty years ago they should have been sickened by the left since marks they should have been sickened by the Democrats since Vietnam\nBut OK okay\nNow there is a genuine disgust now those have you on the left are proud of your party you are proud of smearing a man's name with zero evidence from high school you think that's a noble endeavor\nI think that is morally sick of you I'm Sorry I Try not to attack listeners [laughter] ah but I'm Sorry that's I represent about half this country\nWho you have to Tempe before I got it we understand that that's not an issue to me I don't care if you have contempt for me\nIt's all it's based on lies anyway as I read to you the last hour the attacks on me at Colorado State university where I'm headed for a speech pure on adult rated lies about me\nPure I mean I absolutely like I Want to ban homosexuality there is not a ... still a lot of evidence for such an idiotic position\nBan homosexuality [laughter]\nIt's not even putting quotes they don't even feel it necessary to make up lines that I've said anymore but it's fine it's OK I'm used to that\nWhat is happening is there you you know what it is it's like when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor a Japanese admiral said we have awaken sleeping giant\nI Am not lining the left with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor I Am merely noting that the same words can be used\nMost Americans who are not on the left are not fighters most Americans who are not on the left do not believe there was a civil war that Kavanaugh hearings may have changed that Brett Stevens who is this anti Trump conservative as exists\nThis is the name of his column the title of his column today for once I'm grateful for Trump\nIn the president won big bully stands up to others I Can't wait to read will have bread on bread is done bread and I are are good friends and we are obviously have a rift over ... over Trump when we don't have a rift between us\nAnd in fact he devoted a whole column to me a ... which I thought was wrong not not devoting comment to me but I thought what he wrote was wrong I devoted to call up to him and then he had me on the New York times Facebook to debate and ask for more than that\n\nBut a ... a Brad Stevens for once I'm grateful for Trump it's because of how disgusting\nThis is an to Brad Stevens credit listened the first moment a few more if you moments of crystallized my view over the past few days this is Brad Stevens in the New York times anti Trump conservative\nThe first moment was a remark by a friend I'd rather be accused of murder he said then of sexual assault I feel the same way Stevens writes\nOne can think of excuses for killing a man none for assaulting a woman\nBut if that's true so is this falsely accusing a person of sexual assault is nearly as despicable a sexual assault itself eh\nPrager wrote Twenty years ago the rape of a name is also a rape\nGee\nThey're coming around I don't mean coming around to Dennis Prager\nI mean just coming around\n\nIf you are or a Republican or a conservative and you are still anti Trump you are more preoccupied with feeling good about yourself been doing good for your country\nPeriod period that you think Trump\nPeriod that\nYou think Trump is a greater problem than the left what the hell is wrong with you\n\nThe second moment connected to the first boo hoo hoo\nBrett Kavanaugh was not a victim that's the title of a column in the Los Angeles times which suggests that the possibility of Kavanaugh's innocence is infinitesimal\nMazie\n... there's there's no evidence there's no nothing nothing but it seems pretty simple\nYet false allegations of rape all relatively rare or at least five times as common as false accusations of other types of\nCrime according to academic literature how often do you read that thank you Brett Stevens\nSince when did the possibility of innocence become for today's liberals something to waive off with an arch sleep on feeling boo hoo\nWell I'll tell you the answer Brett left this are mean liberals are fools but left this or I mean\n\nI I read my last call them my friends very important Columbus Columbus week explaining the left\n\nA third Bowman connected to the second listening to Cory Booker explain on Tuesdays at court ultimately it doesn't matter if Kavanaugh is guilty or innocent because of ... questions had been raised that it was time to move on to another candidate\nVicious rhetorical sleight of hand let me give you three reasons for the moment watching Julie sweat Mick the woman accused who accused Kavanaugh of attending parties decades earlier where women were gang raped gang raped\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo the sport fishing season ... and most of us into ... frozen fish in our freezer and that's why news to die in city market had

weeks\nBut I don't want to take my time some of my wonderful guests Daniel ... of the wall Street Journal who's written a major piece today and we're we're discussing\nEssentially when I Do believe is a turning point I didn't believe it really till yesterday or today\nI I Do believe that a lot of conservatives who were ambivalent or even hostile to the president now understand he's not he's not their enemy the left is how is that fair\nThat's fair and um I think it has done has remind a lot of conservative a lot of Republican\nWhy they voted in twenty sixteen I'm\nYou know this is Donald Trump got about sixty three million votes they weren't all the lunatic fringe data and as we know um many of those ... people voted for Trump for a couple of reasons that actually worrying about Donald Trump himself many people voted because they understood\nBut the future of the Supreme Court with that issue a Trump or follow through on that promise by nominating Neil Gorsuch and uh now I'm Brett Kavanaugh the other reason many many people\nVoted on the twenty sixteen election wants to vote against Hillary Clinton\nBecause of the implications of the Clinton presidency falling on Obama's two terms and they did not want a Democrat\nOr in that office and I think these hearings resurrected both of those issues down as the data for the Supreme Court indeed the law in the United states and the behavior of the judiciary Democrats and the party itself have reminded a lot of people\nOf what the fate of that a party looks like right now they're riders mob inside the hearing room outside the senator's office a threat for people who have been receiving\nI think it's all coming back to a lot of conservatives and uh the quantity of that beating into ah the mid term elections and a boy you know just as a ... a day of the Republican National committee that's just reported here today that uh their contributions across the board over the past month\nPast month or up well over a hundred percent for something moving out there on the land a dentist and ah I think if it's going to show up first Tuesday in November\nWe had a I don't I very rarely have politicians on the show not not a I have no nothing against politicians it's just not the nature of my show\nBut uh we had the ... the Republican candidate for governor of Minnesota I'm very impressive woman and right afterwards my uh my producer said I'm sending her campaign money\nI I Lived in the exactly what you just described ... we live in California and and my producer is sending money to the Republican candidate for governor of Minnesota\nYeah and I think uh you know and it is going to be up to the Republicans to sustain that energy I mean some were worried that uh if Kavanaugh is confirmed this weekend that way you will of uh crashed and\nCrashed on the shore and the energy will go out of a [noise] what has happened here but um the the the Democrats certainly intend to go out there and use it as a campaign issue and we're going to be seen\nWhether the Republican candidates do but ah here we are a month away from that election\nAnd nothing bigger is going on in American politics right now and uh the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh which is just as I said guys I really think it has become a finding of that yeah for a lot of them\nAre well that's exactly the the other thing is as you and your editorial uh both at the explicitly by the editorial end implicitly by yours that we're all deplorable now\nThis thought that they believe they really do or or at least they lie effectively they one of the two that people like you and I do not care about sexual assault of women\nIn the word disgusting doesn't doesn't do half justice to that charge\nYeah that's right and uh you know as our editorial make clear that the the goal here is simply a lemonade a conservative thinking conservative politics from the public discourse from public square that he wants to push\nThat those ideas off the cliff because there are in such opposition now or they didn't care about Republicans or conservatives years ago when they just sort of stood author of the sidelines pot trotting but the
