suffer\nYou have to suffer for the dream of open borders the Democrats will have more democratic voters and the chamber of commerce will have cheap migrant labor they want cheap labor they wanted never ending flow of cheap labor which ultimately ensure that we lose America\nPeriod that's just that's just it we don't have public schools that are in coal Keating American history and encourage surely is with us now\nHistorian extraordinary author a founder of ah surely bands for public affairs and dish and everything else he does ah but Craig the more I see this is this coverage is sob story coverage of the caravan the more I think about what these individuals would do if someone\nBreached their threshold in their own homes and whether they would\nYou know welcome them in give them food shelter tell him to stay a while would they of course not no commercial out\nThough of course not and we know or you know the answer of uh Mexico when they invaded there a country is is that the assaulted police officers there well first of all we need to stop calling this a caravan of care of us just this is fun comical or ... or ... you know a circus or something like this\nThis is a mob of illegals that's all it is no no better no more no\nInvasion it's an invasion\nPrecisely and these everybody everybody is a member of Congress swore an oath to protect the United states gets all enemies foreign and domestic\nRight from the president I doubt every member of Congress they are a duty bound to protect this country against all enemies foreign and domestic and these these are illegal so that they cross the border than their enemies that's all there is to it and if they're not and they should resign their offices\nI think again the fact that we are not\nAll hands on deck to stop this right and that I mean\nThe president is apparently the only person willing to really hold is what it is\nWe don't violate the immigration laws of Guatemala Mexico you ignore the rule of law in are about to do it in this country right what what are you but at the older they're not criminals well ... well [laughter] they have no respect for country's sovereignty or borders period\nWhich makes them criminals that de facto makes them criminals and that's why\nA gotta stop treating this as a PR disaster this is you know for a political standpoint this is this matter from heaven for people like yourself myself others who are concerned about the sovereignty of this country now we've got now instead of a trick or them ... you know sneaky over on the cover of darkness or\nClimbing fences or whatever now got an open massive out in the daily invasion it this does it scare the bejesus out of middle America that nothing will\nAgain we want we want people to come to our country who respected enough to ... do not violate law the first chance again or game the system that is in\nYou know as to the game the system as it's as it exists anyway well the system right now is if you want to claim asylum you come here you go to a port of entry and you say I claim asylum then we'll have to process them into the country then we do know that for them so we released some most of them don't show up that's it but\nI but I but I wouldn't I I don't like the word asylum because to me means somebody\nIn the United states because of political oppression\nIs that these people are not politically oppressed this there's no such thing\nAs economic asylum only political asylum and so if you come here for the good news for the free stuff for the handouts for the welfare for the food stamps is that you're not coming here for asylum you're just coming here to to\nYou know uh to you know to you know pond yourself up on society without giving anything back with these people are were water than the old country anyway but the fact is is that they need to go back\nWell and again uh the president\nSeems to have the pulse of the people again better than any other American politician on us yes I mean I'm Talking I was I was a shopping with the kids over the weekend [noise] and you know I'm In my my mom soccer closer than\nThat my son was on so nobody knows why nobody knows who I Am in my head was my uh with my camouflage baseball cap on [laughter] and uh I'm listening to people's conversations about this people are outraged I Am outraged about this\nYeah ... same right where I live to is is that we're we're grocery stores we can listen to people everybody was talking about this ... outraged about this nobody is nobody is it there but this except for the elites but the funny thing is that at least never let these illegals into the neighborhoods anyway\nNo bingo well they want they they don't want their classrooms filled with people who speak multiple languages don't speak English ...\nYou know they don't want their backyards yes there are probably the private schools\nAnd there's nothing to do with skin color where you come from a ... has everything to do with the fact that this becomes a burden on the system\nIf you don't have an orderly process of immigration puree like in ... and it's it's just absurd let's let's I Wonder\nIf that's the other thing Trump the rabbit hole and the Republican Party and anybody concern about the rule laws every one of these people in this movable mob of illegals could apply for citizenship all they have to do is go to the process\nI Know they don't want to do that but some of them I don't have time it's too ...\nGo through the process you know they don't want to do that they said well I don't have time it's too dangerous in my home country but that's not\nYou know that is not a justification for asylum because your country is corrupt well welcome to the most of the world\nYes precisely then go back and change your government\nNo no one wants to go back and change of government they want to just you know get on to get into the\nMovable mob I liked that movable mob a mobile mob it's a mobile moss

doing that going forward it's not going to be carrying around this is the mobile mob a crank out to play something from your dear friend John ... who has moved so far left now that he's on a regular panelist on MSNBC this is what he said about\nThe Democrats' chances of a massive blue waves wave now slipping away because of cabin on probably this immigration and these great numbers on the economy that came out today with Trump's approval Republicans approval way way up um listen\nTrump is not a wholly new force in American politics he's but he is the most vivid manifestation of many of our worst characteristics\nYou know the constitution was written for moments like this it assumed that we we're sinful and driven by ambition and appetite and greed is why they made it so hard for us to get anything done\nThey basically bad that we would get things wrong more often than we get them right and we have proven them correct uh with with ... regularity\nReaction to that\nBut I I agree with his analysis of the constitution but to what end to what point I don't understand the point he was making is is that what is Trump gun to violate the constitution sounds like Trump is supporting the constitution is the liberals were were were were opposing the constitution so I don't understand I don't understand his point\nNo I I again it's we're sinful because we elected Trump that's it that's why we're sinful and how to deal with because of of all this other stuff that's happened and criminality and pornography and all the other things that we've embrace were simple because we elected Trump\nBy the way just a racket I think the uh the blue wave is going to turn out to be a leaky faucet\nBut I\nI I just there's nothing I sense out their law there's no but you remember Ninety four

up and we have a list of demands because that's not going to work\nYou know we might have to let the Democrats loose on 'em with fire hoses and dogs are they they they don't do that anymore or they just do that when somebody wants to exercise their right to free speech things like that\nFox News center reporter William a larger ness down to the border between may call and go walk\nThem a lot of Honduras has the highest murder rate in the world Honduras has the highest homicide rate in the world outside the door\nHas the fourth highest murder rate in the world go off My Lai has the I I Do that kind of like ... um has the fifth highest homicide rate in the world you should probably\nWe're counting that should see what you can do about that to decrease the homicide rate\nJust in Tallahassee also you know a Gillum is his name right the Democrat running for a Senate in or for governor rather in uh in Florida and I'm here under his watch under his two college under his leadership\nTallahassee now has a the highest murder rates\nIn the state and they've they've shattered the record for for Tallahassee um and and I guess that's a point of pride or something um [noise]\nBut if you're a Democrat it's not really a big story or I suppose because\nYou get promoted it's like round the manual it's like Rocco dumber Brock Obama organized the south side of Chicago good job there and I was elected to the Senate from the state house the U.S Senate from the state house in Illinois\nAnd then to present the United states because he's fixed the south side of Chicago which is like Aleppo\nRight what's Aleppo or let's go to William ...\nDone along the border and um it it's true though this Gillum guy it at the the homicide rate in Tallahassee has shattered records and that's not even something that reflects on him at all\n... why would that be a problem\nHere Democrat it's really not a problem All right let's go because William washing us with Fox News yesterday I was watching this live yesterday afternoon and William ... was speaking to one of the organizers of the caravan\nHis name he said was Luis and Louis was wearing a vast like he's a crossing guard you know as with the reflective orange stuff on the vest and\nWilliam washing their smoke temperature because he was a a designated as a spokesmen and one of the organizers of the thing and it said what you know when these people get to the United states what what did these people want why are they fleeing their homes in Central America what are these people going to say when they get the United\nStates [noise] friday or something I don't know they were probably ask [noise] they they get into something they can say as a United States and they can't they can't go to school so they can apartment for they can go to work\nSo they can get but there there are kids aren't with them so they want to bring their kids and after they get here because it's mostly adult men that are that are coming in but I didn't hear him say anything about a living in fear about ah the crime the gangs or\nTheir current tells I didn't hear anything about that it probably has to give them something so they can have stuff so they can stay so they can get an apartment so they can get a job so their kids can go to school\nYeah\nAll right well okay I understand that I genuinely do I understand that and for that we have something that we call the immigration system and you go to the embassy in your country and you apply and you know now let me let me ask you this so many half would live out their\nLet's say somebody gets on an airplane in Aleppo\nAnd flies to Cairo and then flies to London and then fly to New York and gets off the plane and says I'm here to stay I Want to live here\nI I I got on a plane and I came to the United states because now I'm here and I'm not leaving is that how our immigration system works is that our immigration system should work is that how the immigration system of any country works or should work\nThe answer is obviously know Luis\nWas asked by William large enough they say well look the president said he's going to ah\nHe's going to shut down the border as you bring this caravan up toward the United states the president said he may call it the military and he's going to shut down the border but listen Louis knows she paid attention last time around the\nDemocrats ginned up that whole fake news story completely fake huge lie that's like the red solo cups story\nThat from\nBecause of a zero tolerance policy in a part of that was true separating families like never before none of that was true\nObama separated them all the pictures that they use word from the Obama administration but listen Louis learn and then because of the media slash Democrat but I repeat myself pressure or the president was forced to basically like the Caribbean and they\nWere processed they were let loose in the country catch and release because the
