excited to be in the bay area I'm here for a variety of meetings and conferences the chipmunk CEOs some it is on Monday and so I'll be\nSpeaking of that and attending uh with uh some of the a C suite executives them essential services industry from around the country\nImitation only event I'm really glad to be out here for that and to spend time in the bay area which I Love to do um\nWe've got some really good news coming out of the financial sector and uh I'm not sure if you're a fully aware of what's going on because I'm not sure that you've been participating in it\nLose you could argue is actually a little bit mixed with the uh the yields on ten year treasuries is now at the highest level in seven years yeah we've exceeded the interest rate on ten year treasuries since two thousand eleven\nNow people would say ordinarily well gee golly isn't an ... you know higher yield better because that means I'm earning a higher rate of return on my bonds no because if the deal goes up that means the interest rate ends up\nThat means the value of the bond is down so if we're the highest interest rate since two thousand eleven means we're at the lowest price since two thousand eleven uh and that is not good news if you own long term bonds and that is why you've got to be\nAnd it was if you own long term bonds and that is why you've got to be really careful about your investment strategy\nA but I you know there's another statistic that's that's really fascinating at the same time the Dow Jones industrial average\nHit an all time high earlier this week it gave some of that back later on in the week but the fact that it in the stock market is continuing to hit new highs while the bond market is struggling to avoid losses due the interest rate increases\nDemonstrates that is as is usually the case in the world of investing it's a tale of two cities and it's really important that you recognize this\nAnd maintain a highly diversified investment portfolio last week I talked about the fact that\nHighly diversified portfolio doesn't guarantee against the law says it doesn't mean you're going to always have above average returns in fact it's probably going to mean you're going to get kind of average return to vats how you've invested\nAnd this year in particular as a kind of a wacky year because although value stocks normally do better than growth stocks that's not the case this year although foreign stocks usually do better than us stocks that's not the case this year\nAnd so we also find that that energy stocks are down gold stocks a gold itself is down or so we were finding that a diversified portfolio isn't performing the way that the ordinarily you might assume it would early space\nHistory would suggest to us that uh that it was in fact we're seeing highly concentrated investment results six stocks in the S. and P. five hundred have accounted for forty percent of the total profits this year in the U.S in pay six out of five hundred are you able to pick the six that matter you know\nThe numbers are rather astonishing\nThirty one percent of Americans who are age of Eighteen to thirty four thirty one percent we're talking basically one at a free of people in their twenties and thirties or living with their parents we actually have more people who in their twenties and thirties living with their parents than living with a spouse\nThat something new and different for the society parents are\nSaying they're not going to be off the hook anytime soon fifty nine percent say they expect to help pay for their children's weddings okay nothing new about that mom and dad have been paying for their daughters weddings for pretty much forever but twenty six percent say they're expecting to contribute to their children's first homes\nThirty three percent expect to contribute to their grandchildren college costs so it's not just you're paying for the wedding for the kid you're paying for the house you're paying for their kids' education as well\nAnd here's what's really shocking an amazing about this the reason the parents are providing so much financial support to their kids is because the kids are unable to handle this on their own independently maybe it's because kids didn't grow up with any financial education they are financially illiterate\nAnd yet about sixty percent of parents say that they taught their children the benefits of investing all really\nOnly half of teenagers agree with that statement so mom and dad you might think\nThat you have given your kids the information that they need to begin investing but chances are you're wrong about that changes are your kids don't agree that you have given them the information in education men device in counseling that in fact that they need is it any wonder\nThat three fourths of parents wish that they had help teaching their children about investing hello here I Am\nAnd so I'm really excited to remind you that we have a new book for children on money\nThe squirrel manifesto is being published by Simon and Schuster it's being released in November it's our first children's book Jean and I wrote it together we collaborated with ... who is a fabulous artist he's a former animator for Disney he did such movies the lion king and beauty and the beast and others and\nIt's lavishly illustrator I'm not sure the contents great but they are is fabulous and we're really excited that this is our first children's book aimed at kids three to six years old\nSo that it's designed to help you teach your children and grandchildren the basic fundamentals of what's most important about money in your children's lives we need to make sure that our kids are growing up correctly and parents\nYou need to recognize the old school notion that when you know the kids are out of college they're out of my life financially that is not likely to be true you need to recognize your financial support of your children is likely to continue for another decade or two\nAnd you need to factor that in your financial planning\nIt's rather amazing I'm asking this question do you know the meaning of the phrase savings account you know what that is I'm sure you do ... percent in a recent survey knew the answer to savings account Seventy six percent could explain what a credit union is\nSeventy two percent milk what a net worth is by the way network if you're not sure since thirty percent or not you'd take\nIs by the way network that you're not sure since thirty percent or not you take everything you own and you subtract everything you oh so you take for example your house minus the mortgage balance\nSo you take your investments your savings and used to track what you owe to credit cards and loans that your net worth\nSixty seven percent are able to explain what a recession is are you able to do that you know what a recession is a recession is when the U.S economy has gone backwards\nFor two quarters in a row so instead of economic growth it receives picture the tide going out that's what a recession is and how about that point can you explain to anybody would bitcoin is less than half of Americans know that is it any wonder\nThat only sixteen percent of Americans say they have a high level of financial literacy these kinds of issues and questions faces every single day taxes insurance\nMortgages employee benefits at work\nBuying versus leasing automobiles signing up for credit cards understanding how to establish a bank account and how to balance that bank account estate planning\nAll of these issues regarding retirement planning in college planning affect us on a daily basis and yet most Americans are not able to answer\nA lot of these basic questions and we find now as a result of this that kids are growing up in sufficiently prepared for their personal finances forcing mom and dad to help them pay for the wedding pay for their houses pay for their kids' educations\nSeverely impacting the parent's ability to save for their own retirement according to the age way survey\nFive hundred billion dollars a year that parents are spending on their kids who are in their twenties and thirties even paying seriously for their cell phone\nOn top of this to our prices just come out with its annual parents kids and money survey\nTwenty seven percent of parents say they're losing sleep over college costs by the way think about that\nOnly twenty seven percent you know what I say only twenty seven percent two years ago it was forty two percent two years ago nearly half of parents were losing sleep over college costs now about half that number\nWhy is that because parents are far less willing to take on massive student loan debt\nOn behalf of their children so hey parents I I'm sleeping just fine 'cause I'm not borrowing the money to get you into college parents are now more willing to send their kids to less expensive schools\nIn order to avoid student loans and all of that is fabulous parents have been around the country are saying the student loan debt is ridiculous one point four trillion dollars in student loan debt in this country more than we owe the credit cards collectively\nAnd it's just damaging the child's ability to get a good start in life it's damaging the parents personal finances of they co signed those loans or outright paying for them\nAnd so it's a real crisis and yet\nMany parents are still not saving and the best way meaning in a college savings account one third of parents mistakenly believed that they'll lose any money they don't spend in a five twenty nine account if the kid doesn't use that money for college that's not true the money isn't lost\nHalf a parents think that contributing to a five twenty nine account will hurt their ability to get financial aid and that's not true either and here's the worst part\nYou tell me if you had to choose one or the other which would you choose saving for your own retirement or saving for your kid's college\nSeventy four percent say that they would choose to save for their kids college instead of their own retirement that's a huge mistake why\nBecause your kid can pay for college while they're working for the rest of their career but you can't pay for retirement while you were in retirement you must refund your retirement account you must save for retirement first even if it means that child has to find an alternative way to get the college degree\nIf you need help with all of these issues how do you adjust your personal finances to consider the fact that you're going to be spending money on your children for a decade or two longer than you thought if you're struggling to both pay for college and your own retirement\nGive us a call call us a triple eight plan wreck

Nineteen so I can see where it can cut the expense of my income is pretty much in study I Can't do much about it\nI Know is is not enough just to promise myself I'm much I'm going to spend every most but is it a place to start\nSome listeners may be facing a similar situation and it suggests for us make a budget turnout thanks her time\nWell that was cast her with a really good question about budgets ten had the very same question let's listen to him\nHi Rick this is Tim from Santa Barbara California\nI mean you don't like budgets I've been listening to you for a long time to blanket statement that I don't agree with and been budgeting myself for Thirty years and it's worked very very well for me I understand your position is that most people just can't stick to budget okay fair enough but most people can't do anything to tell you the truth\nTo me a budget is essential especially for retirement plan you have to do pro forma budgeting [noise] maybe you could explain your condition a little bit more than that I Would really appreciate it\nWhile I'm happy to reply to both ah both of you tend to Castro thanks so much for your aspirin submission and yeah it's it's a big deal because we all are raised on the importance of a budget and frankly it's a waste of time I know that is what you disagree with hearing me say but here's why I say\nA budget is a promise on how you're going to spend money\nAnd we all know that life gets in the way I'm sure you're not budgeting for the fact that your car\nMight break down in six months you're not budgeting for\nA medical issue that you don't know you're going to incur you haven't budgeted for a job loss you haven't budgeted for your sister announcing she's getting married and you not only have to buy a draft but you've got to buy an airline ticket to go to the wedding and you're going to have to buy a president and you're going to have to have to have to have to life\nGets in the way unexpectedly and that's why budgets rarely work out so there are two things I Want you to do instead of budgeting that are far more effective\nFirst\nInstead of telling me how you're going to spend your money which is what a budget is telling you what you're going to do I want you to go backwards in your checkbook for the past six months or even better one year\nAnd show me how you did spend your money because I'm willing to bet that how you did spend your money over the past year how you're pretty much going to spend your money over the next year it'll be a far more accurate analysis of what you can reasonably expect your expenses to look like second\nDecide first and foremost up front how much money you are going to save for the future\nHow much you're going to save for retirement how much are going to say for college how much you're going to say for say home buying or buying a boat or whatever it is you want to save for you tell me how much money you're going to save and in fact more importantly you go

half hour on the lookout Ullman show it on Mazie statements by the c._e._o. of seniors last week any land for I mean you you know what's going on at Sears right I mean if you're planning to go shopping at Sears I've one piece of advice for you [noise]\nI mean I just don't know how much longer this company is going to be around any Lambert\nSaid that his company is struggling to compete in the marketplace\nThe reason he says the blame he cast was due to the company's own retirees\nWow Sears has paid over the past five years two billion dollars into its pension plans since it merged with Kmart and oh five Sears has paid for and a half billion dollars into pension plans\nSears says according to Lambert if the company had been able to put that money into operations instead of engines\nQuote we would have been in a better position to compete with other large retail companies many of which don't have large pension plans unquote\nAnd here's the crazy thing Sears ended its pension plan back in two thousand six twelve years ago but long time employees and retirees are still entitled to the benefits that they've been promised Sears was once the nation's largest employer\nIt's got eighty nine thousand employees right now what a hundred thousand retirees eligible for benefits under the pension plans and Sears says we just can't handle that you take a a newer company like Amazon dot com\nWhich never had a pension plan in place never had that obligation and you can see part of the rationale I Would hasten to say part of the rationale\nThat Sears is facing hay and it's not just Sears it's not just old line companies that had created pension plans America's cities and states are facing this to Chicago is the third largest us city\nAnd it has a twenty eight billion dollars\nThe largest us city and it has a twenty eight billion dollar gap between how much money it knows\nPensioners and how much money has to pay them yeah they're twenty eight billion in the whole so one of the strategies that Chicago is contemplating they're going to float at ten billion dollar taxable bond offering to help close that gap\nBut if Chicago can't repay the bond than the city will end up with even more debt and Chicago's not alone according to Moody's the total unfunded liabilities of pensions around the country like for example the ... billion that Chicago has\nMultilateral the rebels and show we often talk about the Social Security trust fund and the fact that it's slowly being depleted well some would say not so slowly over the next\nTen to twelve years it's going to be wiped out that trust fund is at risk of being completely depleted and that's kind of ... not only for American retirees with American taxpayers who might be asked to foot the bill for restoring the trust fund to it's needed levels\nDealt with talk about all this and more importantly what's going on in the retirement security marketplace and what is the field of behavioral finance got to do with all this\nI'm happy to bring on to the program Brigitte ...\nWho's a professor of public policy in corporate management at Harvard University she's also Dina Brigham Young university has married school of business Bridget thank you so much for joining us on the program\nIt's my pleasure to be here so bridges also retirement commissioner of the bipartisan Policy Center she got her PHD in economics from MIT and it's a two time recipient of the ... award for scholarly research on lifelong financial security\nSo ... you're one of those experts that people like me love ... love to talk about all the time so let me start with a little quiz you're you're going to know the answer to this but I Want to see how well our listeners do in this cute little quiz you're ready for this\nI'm ready so if I were to give you a penny or one in ten chance to win ten cents which would you choose the penny or the one in ten chance to win a dime\nMe I Would pick the one in ten chance to win a dime\nYeah I I think most of our listeners will agree with you on that now let me change the question though if you're a little bit let's say I were to give you ten million dollars for\nA woman ten chance to get a hundred million now which would you pay\nNow I take the ten million for sure\nAnd I think most folks would agree with you on that but here's the fascinating thing and of course you realize this in both cases the chances of success or one in town they haven't changed and since the one in ten hasn't changed your answer shouldn't have changed either\nClassic economics says the boats should result in the same attitude but you've demonstrated a very different attitude between the penny versus the ten million dollars and that's the core of behavioral economics isn't it\nYeah that's exactly the court may rocking out like that or the psychology with which we approach financial decision making often results and different answers that if we were to be purely rational logical and consistent with all of the financial choices we make\nAnd the crazy thing is that Richard Thaler won the Nobel Prize last year for his work and behavioral finance and also there was a Nobel one and two thousand two on the same subject what took so long for the field of economics to figure this out\nThe fact that humans don't act rationally that the markets aren't rational because humans are emotional creatures what took so long for everybody to figure that out why is it only just now finally becoming part of public policy\nThe interesting thing is if you go back and read Adam Smith is often cited as the father of modern economics who is\nA you know writing back in the Seventeen hundreds a hit very much a behavioral economist in the Nineteen thirties and an attempt to to be taken more seriously I as a as a science kind of started using mathematical model with people being rational\nSo it's only and I you know more recently that has caused economists to to rethink their model of how people do make decisions as to pose to as opposed to how maybe they should make decisions\nGive me one example of how that's translated into the marketplace affecting ordinary folks\nAh companies are now moving towards automatic enrollment you're automatically enrolled in a savings plan unless you opt out the U.S is encouraging this um other countries that have gone and you know a step further so the u._k. several\nYears ago a role that attention for reform and they are requiring employers to use automatic enrollment and they've seen the fraction of their workforce that's participating in a retirement savings plan increase by more than twenty five percentage points in the span of four or five years\nAnd in fact this really does the same thing they have a nine and a half percent mandatory were contribution for their retirement savings for every employee in the country and so their savings compared to other nations is huge and these theories of personal finance improve how we think about Social Security and\nThere is a personal finance improve how we think about Social Security and the challenges it's facing\nI think they can so uh one interesting feature of Social Security is that you can start claiming it as early as age sixty two ah but if you wait\nStart claiming the benefits later your monthly check will be higher\nUm and that creates an incentive a financial incentive to delay claiming but if you can get people to start thinking about reasons why it might be beneficial for them to delay claiming Social Security into a later age you can get people to uh\nYou know move away from the mindset of oh it's available out a ticket right away\nIt was a bit of a challenge I remember reading studies where they put a five year old in a room with a candy bar\nAnd they said that the child if you don't eat the candy bar now leader will give you two almost every kid takes the candy bar immediately they don't wait the notion of delayed gratification is really difficult to overcome compared to our desire for immediate gratification\nSo when you said or retiree how you can head eighty percent of your benefit right now sixty two but if he weighed eight Seventy you'll get a hundred and ten percent of the benefit it's really hard for that person to say okay I'll Wait eight more years we overcome that challenge\nBoth at one way you can overcome it as it is to reframe that decision making and you frame it as if the normal thing to do the regular thing the thing that most people do is to wait and we're very cute in to social norms\nSo you know that's five year old if they were in a room where all of the other kids were waiting for the second candy bar it'd be much easier for them a two way as well\nYeah and also if we were to say that\nIf you take the money it's sixty two you'll be paralyzed in some form of losing some of the money would otherwise be entitled to receive yes\nIt's so exciting to see the science of behavioral finance being applied in very fundamental material practical ways that can have a huge impact on people's lives and by extension the entire Social Security situation are there other changes uh policymakers can look out to help us close the retirement savings shortfall\nYes to only about half of the workforce is participating in a four O. one K. plan so we have a number of states that are a setting up\nUm they face programs\nThat will facilitate savings by workers at these companies that don't offer a four one K. plan in the U.S it's really easy to tap into your money well before retirement and some countries it's impossible or it's extremely costly to do so\nI'm about forty cents of every dollar that goes into the system is pulled out of their retirement system but for people even get to age fifty five so before they're anywhere close to retirement\nSo that the word that gets used to describe this in the industry is leakage we have a lot of leakage and we need to find ways to reduce the amount of leakage and that's going to leave a lot more money in the system uh for the long term which would be a good thing\nSo I'm really glad we've got this kind of thinking going on to the public policy arena and how can help people despite our own natural tendencies improve our likelihood for achieving the financial security that we've been looking for\nWe've been talking with Richard Matt ... who's a professor of public policy corporate management at Harvard University and deal to Brigham Young university Marion school of business Bridget thank you so much for joining us on the

had taken Social Security at sixty two uh if you do wait until toward Seventy or Seventy you're surviving spouse will get a much larger monthly benefit after you are no longer able to collect them\nI think you're raising really too too very important points Donald I'm really glad you did you get it and that's great are a lot of folks really don't\nThe one thing I Would stress is not merely that you earn this extra eight percent for every year delay starting at your full retirement age of sixty six that begins starting way back at age sixty two in other words if you begin to collect benefits at age sixty two you get eighty percent of what your benefit otherwise would be and if you wait\nA year it'll be eight percent higher you wait another year early another eight percent higher every year all the way the eight Seventy so you're absolutely right there's tremendous value I'll call it delayed gratification\nMany Americans are taking the money at sixty to simply because they don't realize that they don't know that there's a huge economic value to delaying\nAnd so uh it is really interesting now there are some caviar that that we have to recognize\nThat could impact the decision for folks\nAre not least of which of course some people just frankly need the money they don't have the luxury of waiting eight more years to get their Social Security benefits but assuming it's optional for you\nYou've got to take into consideration several things number one are you still working or are you still earning an income because if you earn too much then you could lose some of those Social Security benefits either by claw backs from as I say\nWar the Social Security administration or uh some of the benefits could be taxable so that's one factor another factor is that the benefit you receive could have an impact on what you pay for Medicare\nUh so we have to offset a the benefit you're getting versus the cost you might be otherwise incurring so there are complications that's a shame for Social Security system is so crazily complicated\nBut fundamental way all of the factors being equal you're absolutely right downloaded written any Americans would be better off for so many years\nBy delaying their Social Security benefits this is like a double whammy it's a double benefit that I think you really can't match anywhere else so I'm really glad that you brought this up because uh you you you've been thinking about it a lot you you're right on the money\nAnd I wish everybody else is doing a good his job as you are and we'll pay close attention to what you're saying messages real simple\nBe really careful about when you begin your Social Security benefits do not assume you should take them as soon as you're eligible for a longer you wait in many cases the better off you're going to be Donald thanks so much for that phone call\nLet me share with you now changing the subject\nUh I'm here in San Francisco as I mentioned to you that's why I'm broadcasting

described right at that time I enjoy your show\nA chord of oil every hundred and fifty to two hundred miles seems like\nA lot ... on the ground yeah that's a that's a lot we can know that may be a head gasket or something else you're gonna have to find out where the leak is from first and see if you want to go on with any further repairs 'cause it was a head gasket weekend and it was running out or bell covers yeah than those\nOther ... unusual on a big ... like that yeah it that you normally when you get that kind of oil consumption on a V. eight 'cause I'm assuming this to be a Fort

be\nEating that oil not leaking it most likely but as far as the bell developed go if if it was if the liquid something separate and you could identify how to fix the leak\nThose older Veit engine it

Jim you're on the end of the ... what can we do for you\nRecently wrote an article about a company in England that has developed a new engine that gets rid of the terminal chain timing bell bell springs\nIn the valves are controlled by computer controlled electric motors\nAnd by doing it that way this company has been able to do die in a mom and her testing what this engine and\nThe emissions are reduced by about twenty percent and they explained that the way they get the computer to time the opening and closing of the valves is they place a sensor up some time on the Korean shaft\nAnd from reading that article it just really interesting it seems like just when you think\nA gas engine really cannot be improved the very much somebody comes up with this new system to control the opening and closing all the valves and\nIt just looked super cool I just hope that they can continue to develop this engine and get it into a vehicle some day because it just a a huge embarrassment in terms of using computers to make engines more efficient\nAlready got some similar to that in America or in in our cars now they've taken the throttle body off the car completely\nAnd what they've done is they use the\nThey're using oil pressure to power the valve and then electronic solemn wide open and close it and they open the valve the open more or less to control the Airflow so they open up more than its like opening the throttle buddies open that less to cut it down those those are still using timing change\nThe one you're describing is I've looked at too and it's it's one step more advanced than that\nThe one you're describing is I've looked at too and it's it's one step more advanced than that but these these cars that you're talking about they don't even have throttle body on him anymore they just have a whole like a diesel does the intake with an air filter or a turbo chargers but there's no there's no blade in there to control the\nThe Airflow at all anymore which ... everything just changes on 'em and it's like a\nA better mouse trap you never thought they could come up with a better one then they came up with a piece of sticky tape but uh [laughter] you know these engines it is true they are coming up and we think that's as far as they can go advanced I'll bet there'll be something\nTo manufacturers are there are screaming and screaming would be a bit of

speak to candidates for sometimes\nThere's a there's a race of such to me moral significance and political significance that I Do current house we use the Republican candidate for governor excuse me for senator sorry I just wishful thinking going on in my mind\nI Wish you were a candidate for both actually can you run for two things anyway for senator\nStranger things have been done I certainly true a set of golf course in Minnesota\nAnd uh tell me what\nI have so much to ask you I mean I've been to Minnesota so many times I Love the state I live in a state of confusion I understand California where I live I don't understand Minnesota Minnesotans are known for niceness than they vote for a mean party\n[noise] right right we we went to selling are really really nice people and they like they like balance and they like people that treat others like three back and we are we are a strain state\nWhere we we cross ballot though we don't vote we don't stay in our lane we\nWe cross over a Democrat Republican and we like to go for big names Haley had Jesse Ventura as governor with Al Franken as us editor so and and and I even in the same year\nThey voted the most conservative US Senator ride grounds at the same time they go to the most liberal senator in Paul Wellstone's so we do we we vote on some some different things or heard from from all of those across the country that I I I think I feel even worse for you and California none at\nAll you should [laughter] I mean you have you ever real chance now your opponent is campaigning with Keith Ellison Keith Ellison is a is it is as far left as we have in American politics\nAnd Keith Ellison of course has serious charges against them with regard to abusive a woman\nAnd I'm not saying they're true I'm not saying they're not true but they're they're they're not from high school they're not one incident how does that play out\nAnd write a I'm and I'm running actually for that has to take me to Al Franken the so there is a lot of responsibility in that seat and who represent Minnesota and the United States Senate and\nAnd to treat everybody equally when there is a charge of sexual harassment sexual abuse domestic abuse and their peanuts that's my comment is selling the complete hypocrisy of herself and the Democrats because\nThe Democrats are interested in speaking out on sexual assault they're harassed and when it comes to their own party and Tina Smith\nCampaigning around the state with Keith Ellison and she had said because Pete categorically denied these accusations that Keith Ellison therefore is innocent yet when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and ... a a unsubstantiated allegation\nComes to Brett Kavanaugh and the uh uh unsubstantiated allegations against a judge Kavanaugh\nUh see any for under oath that he didn't do it I see is calling for the FBI and investigation and she's also said that Kavanaugh had committed sexual assault she said that in the video\nAnd and what ever happened to be innocent before proven guilty it's now and the proof is on those that are kids and that's it that's the sad road that the Democrats have gone down and it's going to discourage a lot of people from running profit and for voting for them because this is one issue\nThat it that it popped up that has really got a Republican and independents\nExtremely extremely angry at the hypocrisy and the double standard that the Democrats are are showing right now\nOkay so that's a double standard issue what about the issue I have to believe that most Minnesotans on Americans who are anti Kavanaugh\nOn on the grounds of sexual assault forgetting they're against them because they would be against any Republican nominee to the Supreme Court do they have husbands brothers fathers sons whom they love I mean why use all the identification visa Vee Vee Vee alleged victim\nAnd I was just talking to a group of hockey mom the other day and that's exactly what they were saying and\nAnd they fear for their husbands and their sons and their fathers that anybody can\nMake an accusation it becomes the you're the land a front page headlines and there are are guilty by a public accusation and\nNot having a fair hearing and not having any sort of private process to go through and and the Democrats will do anything they can to\nUh have an issue come out and attack Republicans and the the regular person out there Dennis I'm telling you it absolutely appalled that something like this comes up and and can be their son or their brother or their father and it's it's so deeply saddening emphasis on the road that they've gone down\nSo you you just use the hill you have to climb the Minnesota is simply mail more or less liberal slash left\n[noise] uh no no no absolutely to the hill that Tina that's half the climate is she's such a metro area liberal elite that this is not a DSL sorry Democrat farm labor here in Minnesota\nThat of my mother and father's area era it was mostly Democrat back in the day and it had the Democrat Party has left the Democrat\nOr in the last ten years and it has become the far left extreme liberal socialist party of Minneapolis and St Paul and that it not to\nMinnesota Democrats are so they are leaving the party and the eighth district up on the iron range which has a historically always voted Democrat we're going to have a Republican Congress and they're not they're down in southern Minnesota always voted Democrat that's going to be Republican\nSo Minnesota is not a Democrat as it used to be and we what we're seeing a real red wave here because it got so far to the laugh and they've left to people and that's not who we are here in Minnesota\nI I I just wanted to tell you what I see that every Republican candidate for Senate for house governor\nThat you're not only running\nI mean this is on solicited advice I humbly acknowledge that fact and what you you every Republican is not only running against their opponents they're running against the destructive left wing party as you just\nNoted and I I I salute you for doing that I think people have to understand as nice as and and I don't know your opponent but it's nice as any Democrat individually might be they represent a destructive force in America the Democratic party\n[noise] and they really do and it and it is a a responsibility on us as Republicans to make sure that the people know what\nThat we really are the party of education and health care and freedom and they are the party of obstruction and that's exactly what my opponent Tina Smith has been doing can only been in office for nine months and at every single time\nI see is an directing and blocking good things are happening here one judge cabin not to see a ... medicine\nOr here's the great
