to resign this current traditional position because having a quote convicted unquote rapist on the benches unseemly\nFor these reasons he now has the right perhaps not a legal rights butter right based on fundamental fairness to have the charges against him put to the test of clear and convincing evidence or some standard close to that\nA judge Kavanaugh been rejected an ideological or professional grounds before the sordid accusations were leveled he can go back to his life it Robert Bork did but if the Senate fails to confirm him now his life\nWill never be the same judge Kavanaugh wouldn't have been my candidate of choice for the Supreme Court I'm a liberal Democrat who believes Republicans improperly denied judge Merrick Garland a seat on the high court\nBut this is no longer about who would make the best Supreme Court justice\nWell listen to this is about the most fundamental issue affair and issues of fairness this country has faced since the McCarthy Era\n\nWhen innocent people were accused of trying to overthrow the government\nAnd have their lives ruined based on false accusations won't being denied old semblance semblance of due process or fairness\nThe American civil liberties union stood strong against McCarthyism for demanding due process by demanding due process and hard evidence but the ACLU now argues that quote unresolved questions regarding credible allegations of sexual assault unquote be resolved against the accused nominee\nWe have come a long way since McCarthyism but we now live in an age that risks a new form of sexual McCarthyism we must not go to that even darker place darker than McCarthyism liberal Democrat Harvard law professor\nDarker than McCarthy's\nThe left ... so it turns out the left opposition to McCarthy was not for for being irresponsible for smearing people who were innocent but simply because he was on the right\nThe left is allowed to do exactly what they oppose but they claim to oppose\n\nThis is a very very bad moments in American Life days before your ah your your vote they bring up a high school charge they used before\nI said it should've been ignored and they could have

is incredibly difficult to prove but this case is even weaker than that\nThis is from Rachel Mitchell ate a prosecutor of sex crimes duck the Fort identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either refuted her allegations or fail to corroborate that\nI Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee nor nor do I believe is evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of the evidence standard you understand the difference folks there there is the standard beyond reasonable doubt that is for conviction\nBut outside of the legal world all you need is the ... I think in the ... if I'm not mistaken in civil suits the preponderance of evidence standard\nThat's different from beyond reasonable doubt just preponderance of there but it doesn't even meet the preponderance of evidence\n\nIt's a very dark day in America it's a very dark day because the ... there's an entire\nPortion of this country the left that does not believe in moral norms they acknowledge it that that oh if you put them if you do you believe in moral norms oh of course of course but tell them yeah where are they from their their from them their moral norms are left this moral norms\nWhy did they have such contempt for vice president Mike Pence\nMike ...
