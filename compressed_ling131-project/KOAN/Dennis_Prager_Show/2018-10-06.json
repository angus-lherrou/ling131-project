[noise]\nAs an entire world of literature surrounding friday [noise] welcome indeed every body and there was a cloture vote in the U.S Senate do they in other words a vote to put the vote on the justice\nUp for vote\nYou cannot closed debate and cloture it's cold\nAnd you cannot extrapolate necessarily from that vote to how they will vote in actuality\nSo you can vote for cloture and then vote against Brett Kavanaugh so it is not a given at all in my mind that he will be\nNominated by the spot or chosen ratified ... confirmed by the U.S Senate is not a given\nI heard and I have to verify heard that a Republican senator from Montana it will be attending his daughter's wedding he's walking down the aisle\nOn Saturday So that would deprive the Republicans of another vote already Lisa Murkowski she even voted against cloture that which theoretically possible she would vote for capital having voted for cloture but it is unlikely\n\nI just my heart breaks for the man and I don't know what else I can tell you\nI have made my case\nI don't know what else I can tell you I have made in my case\nFrom the beginning that it did not deserve the U.S Senate hearing\nYou cannot make a high school accusation that has never been made against any one Republican or Democrat with zero corroboration and have the United States Senate close its functions and ... and entertain your\nCharge\nOr it just it wouldn't be done with anything else\nYou know we uh we we saw him in gay I saw him engage in an armed robbery and high school\nI think they would have stopped the U.S Senate for that hearing a fully credible person I saw Brett Kavanaugh engaged in an armed robbery armed robbery when he was a junior in high school\nAnd guess what I can mainly the people who uh who saw him do it then every one of them says I don't know what the person's talking about including one of them who is\nA best friend of the person making the accusation\nSo why is why did the why does the U.S government shutdown why does the U.S population preoccupied with one charge from one woman from high school thirty five years ago why and we all know why\nStarting businesses um and all of the um things that are you know and and the unemployment rate for women is that a half century low\nUm and and now we're seeing today with the new jobs numbers a three point seven percent unemployment rate both the overall unemployment rate in the unemployment rate for women are at a half century while we can see that as a headline right now we don't\nLive\nWe don't we don't see a period at which is you know part of what the president is recalling the fake media\nWhich I think that you're going\nI was just going to say that's why the the job creators network is doing this a national poor called tax cuts work\nWe have been visiting state throughout the year um we're just about to launch our final phase\nOf the tax cuts work Torre and we're going from city to city we will have\nCompleted fifty stop in twenty five feet by the end of October and we're meeting with a congressional representatives and small business owners and community leaders and business leaders and getting the word out to the media and to the public\nHow these tax cuts are impacting small business and how much they're helping small business in general\nUm you know our members are ... we represent main street small business owners and they're telling us that they are raising wages and that there are they are investing in their business we have a a small female and the main factor that I highlighted in my op ed\nNicole Nicole Walter in Illinois he owns a small manufacturing firms and she's not only taking advantage of the tax deduction a small business tax deduction\nBut you can also immediately expense equipment investment so she buying a half a million dollar piece of machinery and she can hire three people to operate it\nIs a real job making real money and then and and investing more into our economy and that's why we're seeing GDP at forty four point two percent\nRight and and people don't know that with the with the tax cuts there's more tax revenue going to the government\nThat is absolutely true we are seeing an increase in the tax revenue to the treasury um because of the increase in economic activity and and that's fantastic people are keeping more of their own hard earned money\nUm because of the tax cuts and the the changes in the withholding tables and they're spending it they're going on vacations and they're buying things and they're they're investing in their children's college education and more things stock market rise\nAll of these things are happening as a result of the tax cuts deregulation\nOverall optimism about the future and the only thing that we need to do now is it got little little news that ah that cause the house voted on tax cuts to point oh last friday\nAnd now it's headed to the Senate and that will make the tax cuts permanent for small business and individuals because right now they are set to expire and twenty twenty five and we need to get predictability to our small business owners so they can continue doing what they're doing and investing in this economy\nMale folks you can help okay this is a big deal all you need to do than I'm asking for money they just want you to go to tax cuts works dot com that's touch which were dot com\nThey'd like you to share your story that like you to email your representative your congressman or senator you don't have to do any of that you could just go there and read

there\nYour listeners can take a look at where our next stop is a will be an Indiana Ohio Nevada Arizona West Virginia and North Carolina Georgia and Florida between now and the end of October\nUm we'd love to have people come out and support these events we'd love them too often they can share their stories about their tax cuts story than what they're doing with their tax savings\nOn the reality is this is I'm In November and this is going to be a big choice for Americans they're going to choose between the continued pro growth and job a policy that the minister ration or they can choose to see them rolled back in the tax cuts um go away and we'll see taxes increased again\nYou know there's a lot of states All right listen\nI salute you need to tourists magnificent your website
