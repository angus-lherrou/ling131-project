[noise]\n[noise]\n\nUm [noise]\nBy every body goodness Prager here on the most powerful people um international politics [noise] former prime minister of Canada is on the line Steven Harper and it was a major fan of during those ten years I looked to\nCanada I have a candidate envy it wasn't for me and it was actually real I I did I remember at the time when when we had our left wing president and they had this very thoughtful intelligent conservative prime minister\nShow a prime minister Harper by the way I just want to know what I call you prime minister Harper is that an American thing only in Canada when you're interviewed or you called Mr Harper prime minister\nUh well that there's a long answer that question Denison I'll keep it short which is in Canada officially we do not eat the titles are we do not keep the title prime minister but it is actually quite common for people to call me that never\nWrite I so I was right Troy issue but I think it's more of an American idiosyncrasies I think it's nice but I was just curious well\nOne of the reasons we love the Americans\nYou [laughter] exactly [laughter] if you're ever feeling about just scored a barricade repeal act exactly\nThe prime minister has written a book out this week right here right now he's one of the most thoughtful of people as I said in international politics so were you surprised that Donald Trump won what did you feel on election day twenty sixteen us election day\nSo I tell people I was surprised I was let pride than most I had included mostly through what I had been told anecdotally by a large number of Canadians who have been going back and forth to us than my own experiences going back and forth that\nA lot of Canadians had been down there and the what find a we had told me they thought Donald Trump what's going to win so I gave him a a low but nevertheless while the chance of winning\nIn a a low but nevertheless of possible chance of winning uh so I was I I must admit I Would still I'm surprised but I was not shocked a as a shock to some observers not only were but still clearly are\nSo back to Canada is there a chance to conservatives can come back to power\nOh I think absolutely we've got a chance um you know we've been uh other polls go back and forth we've been uh you know within the margin of error and a lot of them\nI'm a ... the A R fundraising is far exceeds the government's I think the issues that are on our side of the area we paid in Canada Dennis I don't mind telling you is that\nUm you know we have very little in the way of conventional conservative media television every network at MSNBC um Canada um is really amazing when you look at places like Ontario and Quebec if you were to see the election coverage especially in the province Ontario you would not imagine the conservative party is going to get any votes at all\nAnd yet they won the election and won it handily so I'm a I'm optimistic but a book I leave a\nI leave the day to day have Canadian politics the my successor whose name is Andrew share and go I think will make a great and thoughtful and intelligent informed prime minister which we badly need\nI Want to underscore for my listeners what you just said because whenever I speak to consider a conservative in Europe this comes up\nAnd sometimes they say if only we had to talk radio in the Europe why isn't there in Canada I think I Know the answer but I'd rather have you explain why isn't there something like talk radio in Canada\n... ... talk radio does exist in all I mean conservative talk radio forgive me okay\nYeah no no ... ... talk radio does exist a dentist and conservative talk radio does exist it's just much smaller and unfortunately a lot of our best conservative talk radio host not all of them but a lot of our best ones are have been kind of at the stage where they're retiring in recent years\nBut look it's an area where there really is that efficiency\nGenerally and what's interesting a dentist about this is generally a conservative talk radio hosts will do well in terms of audience likewise concerned immediate to the extent that exists generally find that audience because there's a lot of median conservatives who are craving outlets but the fact is that\nThe dying media continues to cater to all cater to a left wing audience\nThere was a powerful ... you said earlier I did not pass over me at all all of our beauty or MSNBC I Hope my sister's cool up that one that I look I'm well aware of that\nSo there is however and I frequently read it the national post\nYeah yeah the national post um was founded as a Twenty years ago\nAs a more distinctly conservative newspaper and it has maintained\nA fairly conservative editorial line unfortunately a lot of its day to day reporting and columnists are simply not that bad and in terms of federal federal politics cup which I I Would not today considered the national posed the conservative paper\nIn terms of if it's day to day coverage in federal politics but its editorial rely line remains relatively consider the more conservative papers are actually what's called the sun chain their tabloids but they are quite um quite consistently conservative\nSo where what an American goal for thoughtful Canadian conservative news coverage\nNowhere to hide it tough yeah yeah have you know a while you have you have\nTo you have to look um you have to really find individual journalists um um and and I would also say that you know that there's a huge market and particularly the phenomenon you have in the United states with pod cast\nUm you know I think there's a big market candidate for that kind of thing to take off what as I said there is a\nYou know thirty percent of Canadians will always vote right of center at least thirty percent bottom it's kind of the the the low number\nAnd so that that audience is in my judgment if I were an entrepreneur and the media business I'd be trying to figure out how to get to that audience which for the most part has very little and the way of of outlet servicing them\nWhat about young people or let me put it let me actually before we get to the young people you said something that's very important to me that the polarization in the United states left and right doesn't exist in Canada is that the caller lean to the same thing right\nSo it was but but on the issues they differ is just as clearly as the left right differ in the United states show is it because the Canadian temperament is just more subdued how why isn't there that polarization\nI I think it's the fact that you know I I ... I hate the generalization about our country but it's a fact that Canadians having more civil public discourse and always have\nUm it it's also the case that\nA larger percentage of Canadians are not idiot logically committed the you know the number of people who would be\nHard core conservative or hurt or left liberal\nWould be much smaller and the percentage of the population that would float between parties significantly bigger and Canada\nPlots Dennis I think the other factor that is often forgotten when people can they can uh when people compare Canadian American politics as we have more than two parties and that really changes the dynamic significantly I always say well you know the strictly two party system\nYou know if a candidate a hack candidate B. he can bring candidate B. down in a in a system where he got more than two parties there's always a risk that a candidate in tax Kennedy be effectively the winner becomes Kennedy seat who's\nLast night I spoke to twelve
