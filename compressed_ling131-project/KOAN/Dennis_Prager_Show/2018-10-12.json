first theory I wrote up a few weeks ago in a very important column I know it's important because it got just on town hall or should we were twenty two thousand\nOr what is it again what am I forget that we're not forwards ah when people pass on to them no no no come on guys shares yes I don't know why I and it's I think of shares in terms of stocks I think that's the problem\nAnyway\nI wrote the first reason I Believe that is that the left unlike liberals again the left\n\nDo not believe that they are\nObligated to the to society's rules of of behavior facts Hillary Clinton said that just now did you see that\nWe have we have are saying we have a clip or or any way if we do I would like to get it I Want and the Eric Holder that's exactly right when they're down ...\n... and there is you

but it's even find things that I have noticed you open [noise] many years\nTogether [noise] why I Believe there will be violence from the left especially if they lose the congressional elections almost impossible even if they win that will further the problem and that\nIs the connection between high self esteem which the left has more than the right I don't mean every single individual but ... self esteem is I Am better I better not my ideas I Am better\nThan all those I differ with and I am I Am better in that and this is more important than normal middle class Sybil are the rules do not apply to me\nThen that will that inevitably leads to violence\nAnd it already has led to just a awful behavior cutting off relations with parents not going to the homes of friends of twenty Thirty

this is not a ... a fundraising appeal I have three of those a year and I wanted to mention third later on pre please go to ... for Hillsdale does come\nAll right my friends this is my theory or read to you from the the psychological journal and it's all over the place higher self esteem\nBetween two groups of high self esteem and less self esteem behind her self esteem it'd be more violent these are all psychologist and I'm In a serious academic journal you can find that also where as well and makes perfect sense how can you hurt somebody unless you think you're better than them\nYou don't hurt people you think your worst then write the murderer thinks you know who are you a me I can murder you who are you on me I can rape you who are you I couldn't you know you're nothing\nThat's why they're there are very offended when they're arrested there just offended I Can't believe who the hell are you to arrest me\nAll right now Julie Julie are you in Alaska\nNo I'm In\nAh right so we've got a teacher or screaming or that eight K. is Alaska a are is Arkansas okay\nAll right well [noise] I don't know I learned to be professional [noise] All right no no no no don't\nBe sorry it's a it's a tough call whether the screener deserve the living martyr does not think uh she deserved to see in this case out of it was great yeah we we are truly egalitarian and whom we punish okay go ahead I'm Sorry Julie\nJulie are you there [laughter]\nLike what happened maybe she was offended that never happened Julie\nWhen you hear me yeah oh what happened okay I don't know I had\nI guess than I I guess I'm having trouble with the wording self esteem because where Haile products are going to have\nSelf esteem means that you are comfortable here you are\nIn fact that like something I said almost every day to them remember have meaning to different things meaning you're a child a God and\nYou are part of their family so um I guess we have very high self esteem and I always have and so someone for greener yelling at me or not agreeing with me\nIf it's if it's really something that I blame it doesn't really bother me and I never thought of myself as violent in any way that I can guarantee you I have a lot of self esteem so I guess\nI Want to let me show you know it's an important subject what do you think of giving trophies to kids are on losing teams\nIt's ridiculous\nOkay so you okay so I have two theories about your notion of self esteem which would be hard with mine one is\nThat there is when you said I Want you to know your child with God I couldn't agree with you more that's not the self esteem that the psychologist to talking about with regard to rapists and murderers and the like\nNot that they they don't walk around thinking I Am a child of God I promise you\nKnow okay so I agree with you in that we are all in God's image this gives us a certain ... that is unique to every one of us I I I learned that as a child in my religious school and I believe it\nThe self esteem they're talking about is I Am terrific\nI don't think you told your children you are terrific\nAnd we you know okay you're even laughing at that so that that proves right point so there's there at the other is you believe I Am I won't put any words in your mouth I'll tell you say I Believe I Believe in er into self esteem I totally believe if you have done well and you have done good\nThen you should think highly or or well a viewer cheap and that's a very that's a totally healthy thing\nYeah okay so I think we're on board on that the self esteem movement wanted you to feel good about yourself no matter how you behave\nIrrespective of religion ... grew up Catholic got very angry at his Catholic upbringing rejected it this is a secular self esteem yours is religious self esteem\nI think there's a big difference I don't see evangelical Christians going out there\nAnd screaming at the at the legislature tours more pro choice than stopping their dinners\nThey the more likely to ah to pray for them than they are to scream at the one eight Prager seven seven six [noise]\nGoing to be interesting I'm going to Colorado State university\nAnd uh [noise] they're already I'm providing
