I Will go to a second column in the Washington Post they have a feminist column\nIn the Washington Post where women were feminists or or one I think in particular feminist columnist writes and I was reading some of them on the plane last night\nAnd I I shared some of them with you know some of the quotes\nI think that these are so important to understand the damage\nThat feminism image each make believe world ... ... is a step emanates from the left or make believe socialism is make believe and feminism is make believe ... is make believe it's all make believe\nFor whatever reason and it's all psychological what ... ... it's there's no other explanation there is a beep beep beep\nOr unhappiness maladaptive ...\nReality on the part of the people who embrace these things and certainly those who develop them they have contempt for the world as is conservatives understand that the chance of making the world worse\nOr is the chances of making the world's worst or at least as good as as making the world better when you have a revolution\nLeast as good as as making the world better when you have a revolutionary idea making the world incrementally better is spectacular that's what we should be doing in every generation but\nThe foundational ideas of a society because you have a dream of something better which is what character respects the characteristic of the left remember from the will to fundamentally transform the United states of America that's revolution\nThat is where only bad things will happen in the bad things do happen she writes here that she's a middle aged single heterosexual feminist by the way one of the things that I did not mention in my first read of her\nOf her column in the Washington Post and I'm not seeing her name deliberately 'cause I have no desire to a model leftist I have no desire to humiliate people\nAnd it's not important who she is she they're interchangeable they have feminists are feminists are feminists are feminists are on the left\nA but it is interesting that there is no mention in any of the columns by her or other women riding in this column in the Washington Post that may be part of the solution to their loneliness and she says I have never been so lonely to marry\nShe seems to be looking for a relationship but she has the word marriage does not even enter she's a she is divorced if I'm not mistaken a but ...

talks about relationships where am I think that she would do better if she actually saw to get married but that wasn't at all the basis of my critique by the basis of my critique was\nThat cheese all she's very lonely she doesn't like the idea is that a man just is not assertive and then if he is assertive then he's obviously you're not someone she feels safe with so no wonder she's lonely\nI think part of it it's like I heard I don't know who that is and I don't know their background but\nI saw it as someone who may have had for both of them maybe a more strong feminist position and now they're kind of struggling with well I found myself in this dichotomy you know I Want it his faith that strong\nThat we'll be right yes I agree with you now but I agree with you but at no point have
