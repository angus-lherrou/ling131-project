then they're totally free to wouldn't folk God and Jesus Christ in their language exactly fair summation of your comment\nOr question has more on everyone\nElse right correct they're not offended by African Christopher for a while or smoke there they're not they're not so they were there were so many issues that you raise here was so we'll take that one first\nThey're not only not offended on

paying\nA lot of people do and I don't and I explain what I think\nThe commandment really means because I Know the Hebrew very well and the Hebrew vet commandment these do not carry God's name and vain not to do not take God's name and fame and the people that I Believe carry God's name and vein of the people who in the name of God do evil\nBecause that is the only one of the ten commandments that God says he will not forgive\nIf so it cannot be that it is about oh God that I have a hard day at work today or Jesus Christ I just really hurt my finger I I I it's hard to believe that God will forgive murder but he won't forgive\nThat so it has to be really bad since that's what set is said God will mapped forgive those who violate that commandment ... doing evil in God's name\n\nThat is
