election perhaps in American history that's my opinion\nThey didn't tell me to say that a tax cuts work your savings your tax savings or on the ballot the American economy is on the ballot jobs are on the ballot your kids jobs are on the ballot your wages and a four O. one K. is or on the ballot small business owners your tax cuts are on the ballot\nAnd here's the biggest issue on the ballot who's

send emails text knock on doors this is not a fundraiser\nBut they need your help to just know what they're doing a help them help you tax cuts work dot com let's not get out worked in November let's go to let us go all through tax cuts work dot com\nAnd I'm Dennis ... this is the ultimate issues or were the third of our own Tuesday's so my question is do people prefer liberty or there'll be taken care of\nEverything in life has value is is one of the revelations of the second half of my life I did not know this is a kid\nSo many things that I just assumed were given like love and marriage go together like a horse and carriage that assumes that love and marriage\nOr some somewhat or automatic you you were you horse and carriage are pretty much on America ... without the carriage nobody goes in the ... and the character up of course it doesn't move so they go together and so do love and marriage but it's about troop marriages choice\nAnd so do love and marriage but it's not true\nMarriages choice marriages of value even of value and\nWe have not taught these values and the and liberty is a value this is the one that shocked me this I I I figured out the one on marriage but this one really surprise me\nLiberty is not a year ... liberty is a value that's correct\n\nThat is correct some of you may know the greatest do a project of my life I'm engaged and now it's thirty year project in the first of all you will be coming out next April commentary on the first five books in the Bible the first one of them coming out with this book of exodus\nAnd it's fascinating how the Israel lights or liberated from Egypt and then constantly complain oh bring us back to Egypt at least we ate better there or imagined that the better there\nWhat is the slave mentality the slave mentality is hey\nI got taken care of I got three square meals I they they took care of me medically I had no liberty but I was taken care of that is what the sleep mentality is now that's not all slaves were treated decently to save at least it's obvious but if you were decently treated\nYou weren't murdered you weren't weren't whipped if you did you work\nYou got fed\nLifers ... no she didn't have to worry about anything no one does she live on your part was necessary that's that's not all that bad for the human the human human nature is not geared toward yearning for freedom believe it or not\nIt's not you may think it is but it isn't\nThat is why that book is so powerful maybe it's not such a great idea to leave slavery habits you know there are all forms of slavery addiction as a form of slavery and we've there I'm not being poetic interest is you're you're a slave to\nWhatever it is you're addicted to\nBut the the choice before Americans and before Europeans in before others is\nAre you prepared to give up liberty for the sake of being taken care of and the answer is almost always yes and the more that you are given the more less freedom you really want\n\nThis is the great experiment of the United states the great experiment is liberty liberty in God we trust people resume our what I call American trinity wrote a book on the American troops to be still the best hope\n\nPeople are not necessarily in sync with us take care of people take care of my if you take care of me\nTake care of my children\nWhy people who are home schooled their children are looked at very often negatively but a lot of other parents the states should teach your children who the hell are you to educate your own children\n\nSo this has been a revelation in my life is the ultimate issues that are because this is an ultimate issue do we do we want to preserve liberty number one or take care of people\nBy take care take being taken care of now obviously there's there's got to be an element is being taken care of we we all understand that but an element is not dominant which is dominant liberty were the other\nEven being taken care of to the point where I don't want you to have the liberty to speak because what you say\nMay offend me there's another example of liberty being downgraded on behalf of being taken care of I I don't want to hear anything that may hurt me\n\nOkay\nLet's go to a are too doesn't agree so he gets on first pillow or and who doesn't agree Allentown, Pennsylvania Hi\nHi Dennis I think I think that people want to be on good terms\nI mean if I can explain\nIt clean your all the benefits that you talk about they get their food clothing everything is like the teenager was not properly culture rated the teenager read though\nWhen the teenager even though they're getting and then they end up in a stream case and they joined a gang\nGang different culture that culture is director for a long\nA controlling than anything that parents ever did and if they decide that culture the punishment is worse than anything your parents ever did so it becomes a question of two things one is yeah we want to be taking care of I ...\nAnd the second thing is what was the man in a large part determined by our culture right\nAll right I don't know where we differ but uh I really appreciate your call thank you\nI think of the gangs is a good example you're taking care of in the game [noise] I think kids in particular they you know they scream I Want to do what I wanted to do and I want to do but they love guard rail\nThey love restrictions actually and by the way certain restrictions are very powerful and give you more freedom but the best is when you restrict your cell will be back in a moment\nBack in a
