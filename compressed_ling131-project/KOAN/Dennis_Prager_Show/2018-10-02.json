war\nAnything and everything goes now lying is kind of place you know with a Senator Harry Reid and writing Romney's taxes someone told them that even pay taxes and later on he said well you know it was effective right that's the issue is it effect if not if it's true or the total insanity of the charge\nThat Kavanaugh was part of a group allowing for women to be gang raped or not gang rape the

not on my side Joe you're on with mark\nAnd Mark I'm I you know with all this stuff going on and all this um brings it to whatever comes their connection to break up for what I call call me a moment on\nFriday mhm when the FBI agent and they said we have a conclusion and I'm ... ... a criminal charges and you can follow extract cabinet that solving say like ... and you know we ... we were just up the house we should have said that\nThey come out and said that which are not supposed to this is over because that's all that and needed that these Republican played white entertains them than just one week extension\nThat now is you know that the the FBI doesn't draw conclusions all the Trump ... at a press conference and he just said they they can ask whatever questions they want to go where he wants to go but the FBI is not supposed to draw conclusions I understand your point that we can we already said that person but I I don't think it's going to happen again not\nThat I'm In love with the president is ... director I don't know where they get these people from the same thing with Jeff Sessions very disappointed in both of them that they you know they don't understand what they're dealing with they have to be aggressive they have to be strong so they're both pretty uh disappointing to me let's go to Steven in Pensacola, Florida Steven Iran with mark\nMark real well how are you doing\nI'm good because I didn't want to add to the border conversation you know during testimony she was very confused and I don't mean confused about okay Molly regarding God at all\nMaine confused about her cat slowly regarding God with all the very first thing that she was that you know she said was map labs golfing\nNobody asked for joining rather Kathleen till I got the tea I'm a ... or so or a cup of coffee which comes many different ways I mean don't you don't just come in law and order or I'd like some gap thing you've got all these other person what you want\nYeah she also said no you got to remember this funny he's got two master's degrees and the ph said\nWhat does that mean to understand that they really wanted bothers you regarding the choice to the person that there'd be a\nPart of a ... bar graph was um she also didn't understand the time on your behalf regarding anyone speaking for the call goes after she'd taken that test well that one and she doesn't understand the term\nScope of dairy evidence\nYeah the one on on your first thing you said about the coffee I I don't hold that against a actually that makes sure look sympathetic in some ways bought to the thing I remember you're right when you said what does that mean on your behalf that\nKind of surprised me a little bit um\nWell I mean not only not only the ... the way he tried to the boss Peter tried to explain it to work and she's still didn't get it\nYeah well you're ... you make a point which is that there are a lot of things that are surprising but again as the other side which is if you micromanage anything uh a lot of us won't look that good right\nI I think it is the the only thing that the the interviewer or that's what was said she didn't seem like a prosecutor from each you know the ones that were what was her name the one ... the Republicans Mitchell yeah uh I Would have thought she was going to go somewhere with the whole thing you know very gently do everything in ... in kind of shows\nShe got her and she got I guess the flights you know that he or she said that she didn't want to come to Washington because she's afraid of flying or whatever it wasn't he or she took all these flights\nSo I thought she was going to pile on all these inconsistencies and I thought they were going to have to get them to see like what I expected which probably is why she wasn't there and the second half right\nYou guys all have great calls are mostly yeah let's go to a sure in Minnesota sure you're on was marked\nBy mark Hi how are you well good I'm Out of a couple of things I'm the last caller was talking about her um her inconsistencies and her behavior um I look at this\nTwo different types she was confused when they asked her if nothing later handled like I've never heard of that before and what I Do and I mean you know she just\nAnd then she had those hurt I don't know if anyone else do that but those glasses looked like they were either that or she never clean them and almost gave her this little sad confused kind of look about\nAre actually the one hand yeah I ...\nI actually heard that you had including the glasses for thirty five years\n[laughter] get on the other hand she got two master's and I'm sure it and she teaches in two different colleges\nWait wait wait wait wait wait wait I Do oh you telling me you respect GHB degrees master's degree you know I'm just\nSaying I'm just saying there is a huge did\nThat um this threat maybe that's not the right one now but yeah I agree with you on a huge\nDifference says the other thing that I I Want to mention is that and I've not heard anyone say that um when they asked her about her friend Leland and if she would cut from there um she she talked about the present well she's got some health issues and I'm going to respect the health issues\nI'm thinking about this as a former fourteen year old girl even before cell phone that next we'll end what I call her and said well you\nKnow she\nIs I can remember sure ... miles from home\nWell I should get home one of my you know I didn't\nLike it and she tell her that she was leading or at least give her a call and say you know what happened after I left or any of those kind of things that get very little oil but you're holding her testimony that I Wish someone had jumped on\nYeah were you disappointed in the a prosecutor also asking those questions I didn't you think like I did this is going to reach a climax and\nI did and I kept thinking yeah I mean you know when it came to the new drink and then she got my heart sank because I thought boy oh boy this is how the rest of the day goes\nYou know you were done for\nAnd I was so proud of Brett Kavanaugh when he came in guns blazing and and anybody that you know make fun of him for crying or for bringing up his daughter pay I guess ... ... what would you not do if you were accused of something so horrific\nWell yeah but you can't prove a negative well of course and you can't win because if you've been come they would have said well he was accused of all these terms you to do but not find something and the other thing is to deliver it to be a justice if she can't win with them ... to point you did well ... thanks you recall shirts you you can't win with them\nHow could you win was um it doesn't matter what you're saying it doesn't matter what the truth is can't win with these people's\nPeople's people thank you mark six that let's see some other great calls let's go to um well we're going to get that break Amy uh this is just this could be brief in Columbus ohio Iran was marked\nKind of hard to say anything you need high I just\nWanted to make the point really crack 'em I just stopped the other day I'm not sure what happened or not but one thing I think if I was in the south and\nI was the focus on the person that was assaulted not what's going on and\nOn the lap pool laughter or whatever she said what's going on I Would be so terrified it's just a little girl that I Would be focused on a person that was on top of the um one hundred percent so um but the other thing\nWas quick I I Can't I Can't remember where I thought\nWell I'll do it for just because

was reading several articles this morning one of them kind of disturbed me in the fact that uh it was stated that Ford\nActually broke the law in the state of Ohio within minutes of California within minutes testify by saying she was a strike a psychologist\nThat to to be able to claim that you're a psychologist you have to be licensed psychologist and you have to perform three thousand hours\nOf post doctoral put pressure on experience and pass rigorous exams to get that licensing\nAnd she she is not licensed\nThe only thing that bothers me and all of you are doing this they're there and if you throw in things that made me not you know be things that are so serious that anybody could have made that kind of mistake ... it looks like you're looking for lots of stuff and you know you have a chance to be a Monday morning quarterback\nI see you've got to be careful in this as you try to build up the case I Know why does Mitchell was so bad and building up anything now this is interesting I Wonder if they live in the same household because we have\nCarolyn Florida and sundry in Florida and they both why one's a little different before planned her testimony or let's go to that first the other one says red testimony of paper maybe there in the same household soccer you run with mark\nHi Hi Kara\nHi no doubt at Simon let's say you know the fact that characterize that corporate America\nAnd let's say ... park and the fact that just arrived at court has now that are going on black worked on a show and I am not against is lying horrible woman\nBecause he had to lie after lie after lie under out number one she took off her social media and plan for it that you had did you ever found if he had nothing to hide why did he remove all of it\nGiven to them every drop that had to do with her since she fighting our pet\nSecond according to their testimony from the comfort that she and her husband right to the red carpet we're having marital problems and end the counsellors had this episode\nThat she describes occurring during the last ... send a card for men wearing pop tart tested on my own and to make it very ... and he joins catch Kavanaugh so that's another why\nNot why was she was flying out with your regular freighters why well that's what she and her husband fly all over the world but that was another life\nI never lie was hide the fact that her brother\nHas that relationship what Peter is\nUm\nIt's a little bit right now but only three people were low so I think that that needs to be investigated as\nWell you know an awful\nLot about the woman that was very emotional I felt that women really relate and emotional pets no money mhm and they find it hard to back away from it but it was not that\nShe did you hear about actual question for not done\n... did you hear the code ice a paraphrase what Thomas duck Thomas all said that you can't confuse the motion with facts right she was really good on that emotional level right and and a lot of women especially with others related to that but you just said\nIt but that has nothing to do necessarily with it being factual ... go go to your job now okay\nI Will\nGo but his shoulders are saying to me that people are so affected by this or even if President Trump doesn't seem to be as as emotional you guys are said oh no see what happens is a\nGood man he's a fine man but this was really upsetting since the OJ Simpson trial maybe were struck tabs on for Larry Elder one day when a strict testimony happen I mean this is really hitting people hard by the way the response all this is you got to come out and vote you got to come out in such big numbers\nThat it it makes a huge difference is not enough just it's great that you know we give me a chance to express your feelings about what we we can't let these people get away with it and since I mentioned Sondra in Florida go ahead sundry you're on with mark\nAnd I'll just scratch a radio on so that's the delays are you there sundry okay I got to chew on hold because it's going to really make you crazy if you listen to the radio a jak in Annapolis, Maryland Jack you're on with mark jak yes mark thank you sir\nOthers appointed to be

was that the pool told her about it and and she ended up uh you know going from that information she was asked who that person was\nAnd she said she wanted to keep that person anonymous well I think
