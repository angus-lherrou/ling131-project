President Trump's speech last night in Houston where he spoke favorably of nationalism and unfavorably of globalism\nGlobalism is a ... when I think of it I think of the people who are in fact the big fans of the United nations which has done tremendous amount of harm to humanity in the ... existence is also done some good\nThe good that it has done has not been in the political arena the good that it has done has been in the health arena for example and that's fine\nBut the the notion that the the United Nations will solve problems or that we should shift power over to the international court or a from from American courts that's an example I mean the president is right\nThere by and large they are in some conflict everybody in America who who has a a functioning brain understands that we are part of the globe of course I I don't I don't know any nationalist to denies that\nOn the other hand a global lists tend to be preoccupied with the globe and find the question what is good for America to be morally obnoxious if you should be realistic about that\nThey have greater admiration for the United nations with in for the United states if they had to enforce if they have to have a world policeman\nThe global list would prefer the UN to the u._s.\nWould prefer the U.S to the un okay let's continue with Don Lemon ... and ... and guests on CNN\nDon Lemon ... and ... and guests on CNN of this comment\nI've been uses a slur\nOf sorts sometimes even against those in the administration often with anti Semitic overtone\nBy the way I'd like him to give an example of where the president has ever used the word globalized with an anti Semitic overtone which just happened to historic I leave or go on\nWhich has happened to make president come right out and embrace nationalism\nHe did while stopping for someone who once called the single biggest liar someone who Trump wants implied was not sufficiently American due to his foreign birth\nMakes strange bed okay ... wait wait wait okay wait wait a minute\nYou know this disappoints me 'cause I've only had good relations with Don Lemon\nHe he he said that Ted Cruz would not sufficiently American because of his foreign birth no he said that he might not be able to be a candidate for president because of foreign birth that doesn't make you insufficiently American\n\n... how can how can you see that I [noise]\nWithout ... wanting to insult um I just want to say left for the left truth is just not a value it's not like they think oh I'm going to line now it's like it doesn't matter\n\nI mean I remember that Ted Cruz is what does Ted Cruz was he born in Canada was that the or was that the issue\nAnd and that is it to make you insufficiently American it means that you're not qualified to run for for for office so what\nAre for president I should say yeah Calgary, Alberta good okay go on please\nPolitics makes strange bedfellows tapas upgraded his nickname for Texas Senator Ted Cruz from lying fed to be able to protest this one of many stump speeches the president is making for the midterms about which he seems\n\nWhen the president's son in law and senior advisor was asked about Republicans chances he was a bit more a garden\n\nI don't know I mean I see you next data the data that we like that shows that it's all about the turnout a lot also I think people who have different turnout laws will show different things but one thing I've learned is I I wouldn't bet against Trump he's a black swan he's been a black small of his life\nSo a black swan a statistical anomaly defined as an occurrence or phenomenon that comes as a surprise because it was not predict it or was hard to predict certainly no one could have predicted this president\nBy the way I just want to say I'm a I'm a little amazed that the that Jared Kushner was not declared a racist for using the term black swan I I I really to be honest most expecting that go on please", "year": "2018", "show_name":
