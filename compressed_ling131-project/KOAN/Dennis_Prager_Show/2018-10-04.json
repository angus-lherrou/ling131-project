he is the Republican candidate for governor excuse me for senator sorry I was wishful thinking going on in my mind\nI Wish you were a candidate for both actually can you run for two things anyway for senator\nStranger things have been done right [laughter] I certainly true a set of golf course in Minnesota and uh tell me what\nI have so much to ask you I ... I mean I've been to Minnesota so many times I Love the state I live in a state of confusion I understand California where I live I don't understand Minnesota Minnesotans are known for niceness then they vote for a mean party [laughter]\n[noise] right right we we might have cell phones are really really nice when they like they like balance and they like\nPeople that treat others like three back and we are we are a strain state where we we cry ballot though we don't vote we don't stay in our lane we we cross over to Democrat Republican and we like to go for big names Haley had Jesse Ventura as governor with Al Franken as us\nEditor so and and and\nGovernor a way of Al Franken as the U.S Senate\nOr so and and and even in the same year they voted the most conservative US Senator ride grounds at the same time they go to the most liberal a senator and Paul Wellstone so we do we we vote on some some different things are different from from all of those across the country that I I I think I feel even worse for you in California that\nOh you should [laughter] I mean you have you ever real chance now your opponent is campaigning with Keith Ellison she's almost ... is a is is this far left as we have in American politics\nAnd Keith Ellison of course has serious charges against him with regard to abuse of a woman\nAnd I'm not seeing their true I'm not saying they're not true but they're they're they're not from high school they're not one incident punish all the\nPlay offs\nAnd wait a I'm and I'm running actually for that has taken me to Al Franken seat so there's a lot of responsibility in this seat and who represent Minnesota in the United States Senate and\nAnd to treat everybody equally when there is a charge of sexual harassment sexual abuse domestic abuse and that Tina Smith my opponent is showing the complete hypocrisy of herself and the Democrat because\nThe Democrats are interested in speaking out on sexual assault or harassed and when it comes to their own party and Tina Smith\nIs campaigning around the state with Keith Ellison and she has said because Keith categorically denied these accusations then Keith Ellison therefore is innocent yet when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and the uh uh unsubstantiated allegations against a judge Kavanaugh\nUh see any for under oath that he didn't do it um she's calling for a full FBI an investigation and she also said that Kavanaugh had committed sexual assault she said that in the video\nAnd and what ever happened to being innocent before proven guilty it's now all this and the proof is on those that are accused and that's it that's the sad wrote that the Democrats have gone down and it's going to get discouraged a lot of people from running profit and for voting for them because this is one issue\nThat it that it popped up that has really got a Republican and independents extremely extremely angry at the hypocrisy and the double standard that the Democrats are are showing right now\nOkay so that's a double standard issue what about the issue I have to believe that most Minnesotans on Americans who or anti terminal\nOn on the grounds of sexual assault forgetting they're against them because they would be against any Republican nominee to the Supreme Court\nDo they have husbands brothers fathers sons whom they love I mean why use all the identification visas the the the alleged victim\nAnd I was just talking to a group of hockey mom the other day and that's exactly what they were saying and ed\nThey fear for their husbands and their sons and their fathers that anybody can\nMake an accusation and it becomes the uh you're\nThe land and a front page headlines and there are are guilty by a just public accusation and not having a fair hearing and not having any sort of private process to go through and and the Democrats will do anything they can to\nUh have an issue come up and attack Republicans and the the regular person out there Dennis I'm telling you is absolutely appalled that something like this uh comes up and and can be their son or their brother or their father and it's it's so deeply saddening up is is that the road that they've gone down\nSo ... is the issue you have to climb the Minnesota is simply now more or less liberal slash left\n\n[noise] uh no no no absolutely the the pill that Tina Smith has to climate is she's such a metro area liberal elite that uh this is not a DSL party Democrat farm labor here in Minnesota\nThat of my mother and father's area era it was mostly Democrat back in the day and it has the Democrat Party has left the Democrat\nOr in the last ten years and it has become the far left extreme liberal socialist party of Minneapolis and St Paul and that is not who\nMinnesota Democrats are so they are leaving the party and the eighth district up on the iron range which has all historically always voted Democrat we're going to have a Republican congressmen up there down in southern Minnesota always voted Democrat that's going to be Republican\nSo Minnesota is not a Democrat as it used to be and we what we're seeing a real red wave here uh because they got so far to the left and they've left the people and that's not who we are here in Minnesota\nI I I just want to tell you what I see that every Republican candidates for Senate or house governor\nThat you're not only running I mean this is on solicited advice I humbly acknowledge that for\nYou you every Republican is not only running against their opponents they're running against the destructive left wing party as you just noted and I I I shoot\nYou for doing that I think people have to understand as nice as an and I don't know your opponent put as much as any Democrat individually might be they represent a destructive force in America the Democratic party\nAnd they really do and it and it is a a responsibility a on\nUs as Republican to make sure that the people know what that we really are the party of education and health care and freedom and they are the party of obstruction and that's exactly what my opponent Tina Smith has been doing she's only been in office for nine months and at every single turn\nI see is obstructing and blocking good things are happening here one judge cab and not to see a socialized medicine\nShould not come first and a woman's life I'm not saying they should make your own choice I'm just saying
