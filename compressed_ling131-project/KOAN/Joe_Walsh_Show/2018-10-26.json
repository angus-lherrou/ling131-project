prosecution\nThey'll get to the bottom of this and I don't think it's going to take that long but the packages were sent off to ... to be a to be investigated a total of ten gimme FBI number

said they know without a doubt this was a false flag operation you know what it may end up being that but you don't know\nA Rush Limbaugh love you love your your the master but you don't know and and

Joe\nAnd Joe I have two points if you don't mind ...\nI you know I don't remember you know Trump going out there and telling people go harass people go salt people go bomb people he's not doing it and\nWhere where is the outrage with people like Maxine Waters and Hillary Clinton all these people who've said go out and harassed people don't be civil where you know where is the outrage from the media from that instead they passed a clock and blame it on Trump no matter what it\nIs a Scott today I being an\nAnswer your own question why is CNN not outraged by what Maxine Waters said\nThey all have the same mindset\nBingo there on the same team Scotty you know that\nAbsolutely brother\nIt's Saturday pathetic that this is the world we live in that the majority of the media out there is controlled by the left and people like lemmings just blindly follow it\nNo Scott ... there on the same team CNN and Maxine Waters there on the same team generally they really are forget generally they're on the same team ... and yeah you're right about Maxine Maxine made a you know a a pretty specific call get in their face confront them\n\nBut no the bigger point here is CNN\nIs so anxious so anxious to try to make Trump look bad that they want him to claim responsibility\nIt's like it's like claimed responsibility for a murder before\nWe even know who the murderer\nIs wow Hey Steve you're on with Joe Walsh\nIs a lot going on and uh you know right now I don't know but I gotta feeling rotten and leave it at that but a\nLot with those crime adds up to form a a psychology ... to ... to ...

again\nIt is Steve they keep it up all day they keep that up at the bottom of the screen all day they do that for a reason\nPeople turn on CNN people walk by TV people or the airport people at the airport walking you know walking through a\nWalking to the gate and they look at the end up at the TV and their CNN on and they seem to cry on at the bottom of the screen they don't really hear what the talking heads saying but they see at the bottom of the screen Trump has no plans to claim any responsibility for inciting serial bomber there is a reason why\nCNN puts it up there and keeps it up there like that\nLook\nYou can't say enemy the people but I Will say and I've said it a million times before the best thing Trump is done is exposed the media I really do believe that's his
