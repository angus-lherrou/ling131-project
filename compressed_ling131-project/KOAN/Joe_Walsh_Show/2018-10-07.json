alcohol and it's all a centennial hops and in fact a bell is the single largest purchaser of centennial hops in the world and\nAh the great thing about too hard it is a the centennial hops plus our east and the way we prevent it it's sort of the equation where one plus one equals three um because the the work together so well\nIn when you smell that you think it's all hops but it's not really there's a lot of uh of yeast and from our fermentation schedule that goes into developing that that aroma as well\nAnd incredible roaming the taste definitely happy it's not overly bitter it's not a sweet beer but it just got the right amount of that happiness and this goes great with a medium body cigar no ifs ands or buts\nUm you know I think we sort of Great Lakes mid western folks we like bomb and you know it's been almost beer and uh we like balance so um you know we're not using sugar in it to dry dry it out and drive more bitter that's\nIt's got to from bitterness but it's not over
