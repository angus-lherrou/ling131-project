and again if it ends pretty much towards the end of September my answer is what are they just call it the September ... but we celebrate cigar October fest air my pleasure welcome back\nFront and center Christopher now already editor of rebound dot com as we look at the state of the craft brew industry\n... what do what trends are you seeing right now is there are we going to see more mergers are we going to see a shakeout are we going to see I Know that there's been some bankruptcies and some of these craft breweries we're going to start ... is it saturated right now [noise] um\n[noise] I Would say that there are definitely region of the country that are pretty saturated um if you look at markets that are well established for craft beer\nUm the opportunity to launch a new craft brewery in those areas is is pretty small um just because the if you look at the total market share um say and\nYou know Portland, Oregon or a San Diego or you know real hotbed for for craft beer um you're you're kind of butting up against a what most people think is you know that sort of peak\nMarket share for a high end product like crap um I've heard\nYou know numerous theories about how big the segment and get 'em in terms of uh you know how many people are actually buying craft beer and\nUm the birds association at one point want it to the national craft beer a sales be twenty percent of or or national craft beer sales or be twenty percent of of total beer sales\n'em and they're not going to get there based on\nUh how their definition works um because so many ... sold like like we talked about um but yeah I'd say that there are some market that\nYou know they're they're kind of hit their peak um that being said there are still plenty of opportunities out there for breweries to open you know tap room focused the operation sell directly to consumer um and create a nice little niche for themselves they're probably\nNot going to get richer um you know felt or the other companies for millions of dollars um and they might not even be able to you know than their uh\nTheir kids to private schools ah [laughter] in that in that model um but uh you know that they're passionate about what they want to do and they're okay and comfortable being small I think those opportunities exist\nThat being that we are seeing a number of re closures um and that number is increasing I think there were about a hundred and sixty five three closures last year and a you know all signs point to about you know as many as three hundred a closures and twenty Eighteen is is kind of\nA where we think the the number could climb to I'm at the same time we'll probably see about a thousand ... open\n'em in about a thousand breeze opened last year so if you look at that sort of ratio of a closing the opening um that the gap is shrinking and at some point or those lines are probably going to meet because we cannot add thousands breweries to the segment every single year it's just not sustainable\nUm so yeah I think a craft growth has slowed a breweries are finding it more\nDifficult to compete um some people are giving up entirely because this isn't you know what they thought it would be um some people took on too much debt to grow and and that's why they're going out of business um so I think we're probably in the beginning stages of what people would describe as a shake out right now\nChris ... the editor blue bound dot com or just as we celebrate cigar October fest talking about the state of the craft beer industry we come back we'll start looking at some craft breweries up you know maybe some years you should be on the lookout for as we enjoy fantastic craft beer on a cigar October official\nGardens officers club selection this one is an agent named isn't competing to those artists\nSpanish bugs risk is introducing flavor and the room and ... you're not with with notions grieving white separate send them over and over and we won the governorships directly do you each month long ago it was a guard dog June police officers club [noise]\n\n\nGorka has just launched three new cigars at the cigar Dave alpha pleasure festival water in Buffalo the ... the ... Marquez and ... ghost goals all three unique flavor profiles\nThe ... more traditional mild and creamy cigar typically found in many of the high end Dominican cigars ... squares of flavor very ... Ecuadorian ... rap or the burqa Marquez very Cuban asked all the way around from flavor\nAnd packaging with an earthy shoe macho rapper ... is a is a bold well balanced medium bodied and spicy cigar the burqa ghost gold little different than the regular circuit goes more flavor a little bit bolder featuring it Ecuadorian a bottle rapper\nThat we may be able to find their products that we haven't been able to the last number of years yeah for sure\nUm there are a few that come to mind a you know if you think about\nUh now that the the trend is obviously more local right so a lot of these companies that are growing um tend to have tighter distribution footprint so access to their beers\nOr for a lot of your listeners are might be a bit of a challenge um but you know some of the names that come to mind in terms of you know really successful uh quickly emerging\nCompanies would be a like a Ryan Guy brewery out of Cincinnati\nI'm Melvin brewing out of Wyoming\nAh there's a company in our backyard that expanded quite rapidly I'm lord hobo brewing um and and their beers or actually available down there in Florida and out on the west coast so they've taken a slightly different approach\nUm you look at a company like three Weaver is a which was a quiet they're out of LA ah they were acquired by the ... or ... collective that we are city as a a a part of um and as well as the balance they were acquired by Ken archaea as well so\nUm those are all a really fast growing ... that make a you know really good beer and um I Would say that you know they're probably ... more accessible than some of the smaller ones um if you're looking for some some newer companies to experience\nYou know one of the issues for any\nConsumer products companies always shelf space and beer is no different I Know that many of the supermarkets across the country has really increased their shell space for careers specifically craft beer many of the a beer and wine shores across the country of now put in different uh taps\nWhere you can fill a growl or in generally rotate those which show space is always an issue and\nYou know I think there's just so many brands out there that it's it's difficult for the supermarkets for the retailers to be able to say okay we want to carry everything but we can't and so that's always kind of be a big juggling a balancing act then really the retailers have to see what moves\nBut do the craft beer enthusiasts do they really help is there is you see now a vocal craft beer a connoisseur movement where they're influencing now what goes into the retailers yeah I mean I think that\nThat probably already happened right I'm consumers were demanding more a a local beers or and they wanted you know better access to them at their local grocery stores and liquor stores and you know total lines and\nAnd all that um and so I think that sort of period already happened um and honestly I think a lot of retailers actually you know kind of went off the deep end with how much crap here they were they were selling and they allocated to much space to craft beer\n'em and they have to be cognizant of the velocity at which those uh those products and move off the shelf 'cause you know it it's pushing poll right so you can push product into retail um as much as you want but if it's not being pulled off the shelf\nUm then that's just kind of wasted state that at at at the retail level so I think retailers are starting to kind of rain some of that in\nAnd they're starting to look at their shelves and say All right you know what are the fastest moving product what our consumers most interested in\nAnd what's going to make me the most money and how can I bet utilize the states that I have um and in some cases that's going to mean that a a a beer that was on the shelf before isn't on the shelf now um because it it just wasn't getting cold\nSo where do you take a look today at the trends in terms of taste what are you seeing I think at one point you know there was a trend to go very very full of happy I TAs seems that we're starting to see a shift back to may be more moderate tastes\nAbsolutely I mean the the pendulum has definitely swinging back towards session ability\nWe're seeing a lot of craft brewers are small craft brewers get in to the sort of light log or or ... space\nUm if you look at the great American beer festival a award went winters list this year um there were no large a brand new no mainstream brands that one in either the white log or or the larger category they all came from small craft brewers so um I think from a quality standpoint\nUh the the smaller companies are able to prove that you know their ears and stack up\nJust as well uh next to you know a Budweiser or a Bud Light in terms of\nYou know how well it made and for years you've heard the company say well you know we make the best ... in the world in terms of just you know technically speaking they they are really high quality beers you might not prefer the the taste or the ... of those beers\nUm but you know technically speaking there really sound and now you're seeing a lot of small brewers\nA start to flex their brewing muscles and and produce those products so there is a move towards a session ability the concern there is that you know are we moving into a space where uh the beers or more a commodity than anything else if you're a small craft brewer making you know Fifteen twenty\nYou than anything else if you're a small craft brewer making you know Fifteen twenty twenty five thousand barrels a year and and you're producing a light blogger and you're trying to sell you know twelve pack and compete on price with you know mega corporations and so\nYou know fifty sixty a hundred million barrels of Barry year that's that's a really tough spot a plan I'm at the retail level\nAnd ultimately the consumer is going to decide you know do I want to buy this light beer from my local craft brewer for I don't know Fifteen bucks sixteen bucks a twelve pack or the Miller Lite taste good enough for me at you know ten bucks a twelve pack\nWell you know it's interesting because we have seen over the last number of years where\nA ... at one time ... was everything people drank the loggers and and you know the ... and the bugs and the corps\nAnd the Miller's and price was an issue women all of a sudden a different group of beer enthusiasts came in where they were more willing to pay a premium prices price was not the number one indicator\nOf what they would buy it was taste it was brewery it was you know a shrank nuances show we've seen a total shift to the market and when you look at the percentages of the big guys you know the traditional the bugs and the Baylor's they've really been shrinking on a continual basis every year\nAbsolutely I think some of that is the brand um you know the consumers don't necessarily identify with those brands any longer um some of it is they want\nTo trade up to a different a product to higher quality in their minds a higher quality product or a different flavor profile um but you know there are there are some macro factors to look at here as well um if you look at\nYou know just where we are as an economy where you know ten years removed from the last recession\nUm and and and the whole banking collapse\nAnd um typically you know that that ten years is a long time to have the sort of economic\nUm a a momentum that we've had and after after the market kind of collapse um you know craft beer actually crappy yourself actually accelerated but\nI have some concerns about that you know happening again I'm In a period\nOf a recession water consumer is going to do are they going to go back to lighter cheaper beer is because they're watching their
