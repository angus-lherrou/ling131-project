mid term election I wanted to get kind of a view on what's going on out there especially with some of these Senate races happy to be joined by Alexandra dissing this she's with a National Review\n'em a publication that everybody should check out every day Alexandria thank you for joining me uh let me start broad work twenty days out right now I'm it appears that when it comes to the United States Senate there's momentum for Republicans yeah\nI think that's exactly right read on where we are and that was always the case I mean looking at the map if you're always favorable a Republican given are so many democratic incumbent up for reelection that Donald Trump won and twenty sixteen but I think you know even the momentum now as clearly as favoring Republicans perhaps even more overtime\nI'm intrigued Alexandra by a ... a couple of races I shot debate a couple of nights ago in Arizona a mix Sally against cinema um give me give me your thoughts on this race it appears to still be neck in neck\nI think so I and we haven't ... if you'd probably died in there hasn't been a new poll in the last couple of days but I'm awaiting very early at the most recent polling that rate over the last couple of days in particular some really interesting stories that come out about accuracy than American Democrat\nAnd the re um and she apparently has passed or being intensely about the Iraq War project thing our troops\nOut you know got elected very strange kind of even attacking her state thing that people in Arizona are crazy and I I really can't imagine that comments like that are are going to have some kind of negative effect on her campaign\nAre you surprised a that cinema is doing as well as she's doing in Arizona and and the only reason I ask is I Know Martha ... she's a strong military she's got a really strong record I guess I'm surprised at that race is close\nYou know I I thought was as well but you have to think about you know the fact that Jeff Flake get the current incumbent retiring at least in part a presumably because a certain that effort in fact a Republican is resonating in a state anymore for some reason I make a big regret it changing demographics that you know on the state which pretty clerk and twenty sixteen is not your standard\nRepublican voter there and I think perhaps that I'm able to sort of capture the messaging with Florida and Arizona style and come across as a progressive than she actually is an appeal to people\nNow we're a last question Arizona I Know that Trump is coming in I think before the weeks out how does Trump play in the state like that\nI think that's actually a tough question I'm a I'm a little bit surprised to see him going out there but I Do think at the same time there happened some victories and are they like order dirty\nBut I Do think at the same time uh there happens to them victory then or something like border security the president could in fact the motivating for a lot of Republicans who feel strongly about that issue or maybe even want to be a wall get built it and people who again don't like Jeff Flake and then those could be Trump Republican so\nWhat a a ... I'm hopping Alexandra but it it just your your quick take on the house\nControl of the house um I I think the conventional wisdom still is the Democrats are the favor to assume control but that's no sure thing is it\nI don't think it's a sure thing and I kind of buy into that conventional wisdom for the most part but I Do think if you look at the end do they ask them gap obviously going into a misnomer lecture and first term president the momentum would very much on the Democratic side and I think it still is but to me I think that the whole cabinet confirmation fight the extent that it's still on people's mind I\nThink that at least has helped a little bit and you're out there and do the ads and gap and get more Republican a little bit more wrapped up and they might otherwise be especially if they're happy with that sort of President Trump status quo might be staying home I think you might see some more of those voters turning out and then maybe suburbs I'm In certain places that might end up just a couple of those races back this year pie\nI Know you ... and if it feels like a lifetime ago already to Kevin hearing and I know you\nCovered it extensively I mean we're twenty days away from an election in maybe this is a stupid question if it is I Apologize when most people go to the polls in twenty days are they still going to have the whole cabinet mess on their minds do you think\nI think that's sort of I think that's most important question right now honestly because it is if it is on their minds I think that'll be intensely motivating for Republican voters and to me\nIt's lost about what those voters are thinking once they get to them on your roof and much more about\nIs that if you're going to be important enough to drive them to the polls because again the status quo for Republicans right now probably happy with the economy and for the most part happy with the president out or at least a policy that we've gotten the last two years might not really feel advantages to get out and vote but in the states like Indiana\nMissouri North Dakota places where there are a democratic incumbent\nPeople who voted against a Brett Kavanaugh I think though that Republican voters might be thinking to themselves hey look I Know something off it but I I don't want my democratic senator and there anymore is is that bad I got to do something\nWhat ... what this this whole notion of this gender gap or there's this chasm between ... with women those opposed to to Trump and wanting to vote Democrat because they opposed Trump as as to those who support\nRepublicans it's huge the gap is pretty big why is that\nThirty so put on those costumes grab your trick or treat bucket enjoying this person at the Alaska\n...\nAdvantage CGI FM surveys [noise]\nWaiting for a report I'm Lisa ...

are\nWe're we're ah we're a few weeks before the midterms\nDon't rag on Republicans announced that a good time to talk about the deficit I got a bunch of that and then I got a bunch of\nUh hey uh Joe not all deficits are the same and\nAn interim trying to grow the economy why don't you focus on jobs and wages and [noise] and on and on and went and uh all all good and I appreciate by the way I appreciate anybody who reaches out to me if you would like to reach out to me please do\nA good bad and ugly you can tell me what you think email me info at Wal freedom dot com\nInfo at Walsh freedom dot com or send me an email let me know what you're saying ... show good bad and ugly Albert spot I Love to hear from you and I I respect everybody who reached out to me\nBut all of the the emails that were sent my way\nWe're a variation of excuse making\nFor Trump and the Republicans because of these deficits\nThe rapidly growing debt under Republican control and I had a bunch of good decent people making excuses for Trump making excuses for Republicans\nAnd these are the same folks you're the same folks who would never made an excuse in fact she didn't make excuses for Obama or the dams when they were in charge when they were in control and they ran up huge deficits\nYou jumped on them rightly criticized the Democrats rightly\n\nAnd it it looked it it's simple it's not complicated ah we're all hypocrites to a degree we all are we all can demonstrate demonstrate and manifest great hypocrisy I understand that\nAnd on this one\nAnd that and on this one\n... I'm Sorry we've got a hell of a lot of hypocrisy on our side\nTo the folks who said Joe why talk about the debt and the deficits now a few weeks before an election this isn't a good time on my answer is excuse me\nNot a good time\nIt's always a good time to talk about the bankrupting of our kids and our grandkids isn't it\nIsn't that the whole point to constantly bring it up isn't that the whole point\n\nEight five five six for two fifty six hundred\nYou'll hurt Republicans chances in November\nWhy don't first off I don't know that I Will because it strikes me that there are a hell of a lot of Republican voters out there who don't care\nAbout the debt and the deficits now when they didn't care\nSix eight ten years ago\nAnd the only difference I see this is personal to me by the way because the bankrupting of\nFuture generations is what got me up on or off all my asked to go run for Congress back in two thousand and ten so this is personal and this is why I ran for Congress this is what I wanted to do something about when I got to Congress the\nVery first bill I ever earned ... introduce towards a balanced budget amendment\nThis is personal to me\n\nAnd I I Can't hide my disappointment I Can't but it bothers me something big or it bothers me that so many of you so many of us conservatives Tea Party patriots\nThe very issue or that\nActivated us eight ten years ago the bankruptcy of this country that issue that issue that issue ... from the Tea Party movement to life\n\nAnd here we are eight years later\nAnd we're doing it again and all of my Tea Party folk are quiet\nAnd and I know why and you know why it's because Trump's president not Obama it's because Trump's president that George W. Bush\nAnd it's this thing where you treat Trump or like a a unlike any other politician it's this thing like you got so much invested it him it's this thing like you hold Trump to a lower standard\n\nAny other president who runs up these kinds of deficits that they can be strung up the Trump no that's different Joe\n\nI hear that a lot I hear that a lot in it bums me out\nA ... I Hope I'm not bombing you out harping on this but I\nI'm doing it on purpose and I'll drop it here in the ... but I I Want you to think long and hard about\nThis what's more important standing by Trump no matter what\nWe're stopping the bankrupting the future generations in this country what's more important I Want you to think about that I Want you to think about this\nDo you still care about the debt in deficits [noise]\nAnd if\nYou do why aren't you speaking\nOut [noise] think about that [noise]\nJust for show bash programs where there's Joe Walsh former Congressman Joe Walsh a guy named Joe ...

right letting people men and women go out and\nStart businesses grow businesses and invent things and then hire people and then hire more people and then create wealth and get wealthy and then start

gift\nTo the world or\nOver the course of the last two hundred years and for\nFor some time uh we were in essence alone in how we practice free market capitalism and then especially after\nThe end of
