thoughts and I'm also glad that you called in I'm going to give you just my answer from my God I think your observations are correct I think things are ugly or an messier and more divided now than they've ever been or then since they've been in the long very long time\nI don't think it's going to get better\nAnd I don't think we'll ever all be in this one together any more I I just think we've reached a point in America where we have people in America who just fundamentally believe they've got two different ideas of what a miracle is\nAnd I don't think you can fix that or bring that together show I I don't see I don't see the country ever becoming more unified I'm Sorry do you\nThink Russia but I imagine accidentally for that are so\n[noise] um yes yes but in in my defense Becky and then I'll give you the final word I Am certainly responsible in\nHelping to nudge this divide along\nAnd vets because Becky I I actually think the divide is good is a good thing\nI think it's natural I think it's natural that America has become so big after two hundred and forty some years um that division is probably the best thing for us but boom Becky I'll give you the final word go at\nThat actually make skin crawl to hear that\nI'm Sorry but you know hey\nLove me for saying what I Believe though right\nI'm Sorry but you know hey you love me for saying what I Believe though

division here's what I Know I Want to live in a country of free men and free women\nI Want to live in a country where most men and women get to keep damn near all of the money they make I Want to live in a country where we are responsible for ourselves our families are communities and our churches in government stays the hell out of our lives and Becky that's the country we were given Becky we don't have that\nCountry anymore and I'd argue that there are a lot of us that want that free country back that's the divide these days I appreciate your call Becky I really do please call a again let me go to Jason hey Jason your turn\nOur drill high man it's a pleasure to talk to your an honor right back at ya I\nI just wanted to run something by you are usually agree with everything you said but I have to disagree I feel that ... the lack of civility coming from Trump or to what the laughter during those are not even close the lack of severity as much worse on the left\nWhen you consider the soup or Steve ... he was to consider the herded or antifa out in the street beating people up on on during the violent people were bike locks on the hug 'em on\nA jury member Jason let me stop you from it I agree on an actor and let me stop you I'm not comparing Trump to any of that I'm comparing Trump to what Hillary said you're right the violence now on the left\nIs like stuff we haven't seen a long long time there's ugliness and violence on the right to but no that's not what I'm Talking about I'm just talking about basic civility and in fairness to Hillary\nAll she's talking about is she all she said was we can't be civil anymore Hillary didn't say good bye when she just said we can't be simple and I would argue that Donald Trump is not a civil dude\nYeah I agree that he is rough around the edges but it does seem that that's what we need all the time because of politically correct to conservative would have won the office\nWell hey Jason you make a great point and I agree with a lot of that it's kind of what we wanted we wanted a\n... on civil jerk doesn't it make it then Jason but doesn't it make sense that the Democrats like Hillary saw that and now they're saying you know what to beat Trump weren't going to need another civil SOB is well doesn't that kinda makes it and what\nJoe that I never I never looked at it like that before that's interesting\nYeah maybe maybe they learn Jason I really appreciate man good call call again I I look at this and I think the Democrats are just learning from Trump\nLook guys don't don't life is too short just be honest Donald Trump is in uncivil SOB you know that even those of you out there that worship him you know that well\nHe's been pretty damn successful\nSo you're the Dutch all Hillary said you're the Democrats what's what is she saying what is she telling her fellow Democrats you know a lot done we're done being nice the only way Democrats can win is if we have our\nOwn on civil SOB that's all she

races there aren't as many senators and congressmen it's house members are but we're seeing candidates for the house raising a million two or three million dollars a quarter\n\nOr ... or ... who's running for the Senate down in Texas I don't think he's going to beat Ted Cruz\nHe raised a\nLike five million dollars in one night all small dollar contributions the Democrats have this thing called

Republican raises more\nOr not this cycle Democrats are raising more money this election cycle and it's not even close so I look at that\n\nAnd I look at the Democrats who are out there working pounding the pavement knocking on doors and making phone calls I see a lot of that all over the country and it reminds me of what we did in twenty ten\nWhen people on our side the Tea Party we were knocking on doors and making phone fault calls for candidates and we've pulled off a bunch of surprises in that twenty ten election\n\nI don't want to be surprised in four weeks I don't want to be

... got to take care of yourself first where you know really what do you\nAgree man agree look I that's not she's leaving and resigning for whatever reasons are and I'm fine with that uh she's an asset and she'll be missed that's not the issue\nTo me the big issue which has every Republican and Democrat wondering is why make this announcement now three to four weeks before the midterm it's not that she's going to make the why make the announcement now\nThere is not a Republican in Washington DC there is not one single Republican running to get re elected this November who would have wanted Nikki Haley to make this announcement now\n\nThe Democrats are beside themselves you know why because this takes Brett Kavanaugh off of the front pages\n\nLet's hope glory or if you're still listening
