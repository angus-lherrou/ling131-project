hope you relax but you can't relax for only Fifteen days away from a big mid term election nobody can relax hey there is a a a former Republican congressman from Florida his name is David Jolly um\nI did not serve with him he came in after I left um [noise] he is a moderate to slash liberal Republican I Am a hardcore conservative Republican former congressman Republican\nDavid Jolly yesterday this former Republican congressman tweeted the following\nAnd I think this is an important issue that we all need to think about ah in these rather rock is revolutionary times in which we live David Jolly said the following tweeted the following\nI'm just going to say it I don't think there's anything wrong with confronting elected officials in public\nNothing zero we should do more of it\nIt is who we are as Americans channel for road just do it no politician was can scripted to serve they asked for the opportunity\nShow there is a a former Republican congressman who says it's perfectly fine to confront elected officials in public\nI responded to him this morning and my response went like this up to a point\nConfronting an elected official who's having dinner with his wife in a restaurant is not confronting them in\nPublic it's called harassment it's trespassing and it should get you arrested where are you on this\nThis is an important issue because we've got people on both sides advocating resistance advocating getting in the faces of elected officials administration officials members of the media\nThe fish oils administrators shouldn't officials members of the media\n\n[noise] we've got acts of violence right now primarily on the left\nDo you agree with this former Republican congressman that it's perfectly OK to confront elected officials in public\n\nThree one two six for two fifty six hundred again my issue is this and it's really two fold\n\nIn public fine your elected official right if I were still a congressman and I'm walking down the sidewalk or in the middle of a town in my district any buddies got a right to confront me\nTo ask me a question to get something off their chest\nThat's in public\nIf any constituent is any American sees me seas\nOr seized an elected official in public they have a right absolutely they do to petition their government they got a right to say hey Jeff Flake a I think it's wrong that you supported Kevin ...\nThey have a right to do that in public but eating dinner in a restaurant\nLike Mitch McConnell was this weekend when he got harassed eating dinner with his wife now that's different that's a public if you're an elected official and you're sitting in a restaurant eating dinner with your wife and people come in to that are ... that that restaurant to confront you\nThat's not my definition of public that's\nCrossed the line you're not in public anymore you've crossed into a private space you're harassing people in that restaurant this weekend were harassing Mitch McConnell\nWould say you on this three one two three four two fifty six hundred one other point I've got is the whole definition of confronting\nI mean when I was in Congress I was very public member of Congress people coming up to me all the time I held town halls all the time people could get in my face people could poke me in the chest people could say whatever they want to say to me that's fine but what do you mean by confronting\nYou mean getting physical with an elected official pushing an elected official\nPutting your hands on an elected official\nWell that's not right you don't have a right to do that I I think\nWhat we forget a lot is these elected officials yeah they got to answer to us and if they sign up to run right they got to put up with the heat and they got to put up with the American people we put them there they got to put up with us when they're in public getting in their face\nBut there are Americans as well and they've got rights and you don't have a right to push them you don't it if you see Mitch McConnell walking down the street you don't have a right to push him you don't have a right to put your hands on him you don't have a right to obstruct him you don't have a right to get physical with him\nHe has rights to\nThis is an issue that we as a country need to think about\nBecause this is going to get worse when I saw David Jollies tweak this weekend I was bothered by it he uh ... it's really open ended he basically said game on we all have a right to confront elected officials in public\nIt depends\nUpon what you mean by public eating dinner with your wife in a restaurant\nThis mass public what to say you\n[noise]\nIt's time to check the more freedom voicemail when you're saying about you oh my God I Know [noise]\n... and on\nThe

debate over the weekend a ... look at the good work I starts our men and women advice\nThey'd been going after him in and around Boston they've been going after these MS Thirteen gang members they prosecuted sixty think about that sixty one members of ice in Boston alone last year sixty one members of this el Salvadoran street gang\nA street gang that's probably the most brutal street gang in the in the world\n\nAnd and most of their members are here illegally and Geoff Diehl says look this is what our guys do they do great work they help keep our street shape you want to get rid of ice Well Elizabeth Warren man she responded\nAnd again listen to what Democrats say she responded uh uh by ripping nice\nBy cherry picking um certain instances in order to make the agency look bad and she concluded by saying ice isn't working and it's not making us safer here's what Elizabeth Warren said\nI Want to see this agency reformed bull crap by the way she wants to see the agency eliminated she said so\nBut now she says I Want to see the agency reformed because an agency that can't tell the difference between\nA seven year old girl\nBetween a woman going in for brain cancer surgery and a terrorist or a criminal is an agency that is not working it is that making us safer and it does not reflect our values\n\nA fancy way of Elizabeth Warren saying she wants to get rid of ice\nWhich is uh just wrong\nAnd again that flies in the face of what ISIS doing in her own state\nI'd like to over fourth ah I I'm getting this from the daily wire the daily wire dot com daily wire dot com I just a couple of weeks ago ice joined\nThe U.S attorney's office for the district of Massachusetts the FBI the da ... or ATF to announce the arrest of dodged aims of\nIllegal gang members in and around Boston they seized a ten kilograms of deadly fentanyl as ice noted the operation they stopped in operation targeting\nThe they targeted major tropical traffic herself fat no opioids and other drugs as well as well as repeat felony offenders many of whom were also illegally present in the U.S eight of these illegals that ice helped to bust had already been deported at least once\nAll\nOf these arrested had prior\nLeast wants all\nOf these arrested had prior convictions for acts of violence firearm offenses and or drug trafficking and most were determined to be here in this country illegally\nAnd Elizabeth Warren\nWould want to get rid of the agency that does this great\nImportant work Elizabeth Warren said back in June at a rally\nWhen she at which she called for abolishing nice she said hey President Trump seems to think that the only way to have immigration rule is to parents from their family is to treat rape victims in refugees like terrorists and to put children in cages ditches ugly\nAnd this is wrong and this is not the way to run our country the president's deep immoral actions have made it obvious we need to rebuild our immigration system from top to bottom starting by\nReplacing ice with something that reflects our morality and something that works\n\nListen my friends to what they say\nAnd ... and by the way this is no Elizabeth Warren's no like radical nut way out there she's a mainstream Democrat she's the United states senator\nShe will in all likelihood be a candidate for president of the United states of America\nAnd this woman\nWants to get rid of our immigration cops that's what they are I mean don't don't don't get cute with this and don't let the Democrats get cute with this\n...\nOn\nThe family\nMaking a complete about face on

about the border whatever they say about Saudi Arabia whatever they say about this caravan\nEverything that every politician says for the next Fifteen days it's all\nPolitical\nIt's all designed to position their side for the midterms I'm including Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer I'm including every Democrat running for office I'm including President Trump and every Republican running for office
