believe in uh the free market we believe in capitalism we believe in keeping Muslims out of this country who aimed to do us harm a un I write who most people today would call a conservative ...\nThere's a reason why academia is against us there's a reason why [noise] big business is against us there's a reason why\nThe media is against us there's a reason why Hollywood is against the ... the reason why popular culture is against us\nBecause each and every one of those facets of life each and every one of those industries is dominated by people on the left\nThat's all against us and its ban of Guinness it's been against us for a long long time\nYeah even big business you you may have Republicans who run some of these big corporations but big business in general they're ... they're big God if the Republican or moderate politically correct would see Republicans they're not conservatives or the conservative businessmen and women are small businessmen and women\nThe people

because\nThe vast majority of news that's thrown in our faces every day I'm are thrown in our faces by people on the left\nNow what's been really interesting is um again the market at work so cable TV and then Fox and then talk radio and then the Internet\nAnd and then social media\nShow all of these alternative sources in formats have made it possible for people like you and me who are conservatives to go elsewhere for our news we don't have to\nTurn on the NBC nightly news every night and get a biased\nLeft this newscast\n\n... when we we we don't have to turn on CNN every night we

get a completely different set of facts you look at like uh this this Russia investigation demolished investigation people who watch Fox News\n\nAre being told something completely different about the Mueller investigation night after night after night after night than people who say watch MSNBC I mean completely different\nCompletely different basic notions\nOf what the Mueller investigation

know there's good and evil in the world and if God had control over everything that went on on this planet\nThen we wouldn't be fighting wars with ISIS free will be different portions her abortion and so on and so forth\nSo social J. lo I said let me just let me just stop you there and then you can continue so you're\nSaying that God do you believe God can't control does not control everything\nNo okay go ahead I'm just ... go ahead continue out in my mind [noise]\nUh so I Believe that there's good and evil both in the world and if there wasn't on there wouldn't be a fight to overcome evil and I got and is not the has nothing to do it and even my God the guys I diverge yeah she has nothing to do is evil okay uh that's the way I was raised\nThey've got a guy did those guys have a hand in picking who our president is\nAh the outcomes is that we have godly people that put we have people that\nUh uh that act on behalf of in a godly ways that have respect for values for the proper values for civility and so forth built Christian values showed them how to react failures\nShow the godly people helped get Trump elected\nExactly did and but they may even I Would I Would I Would contend

won't again I I Want to hear people's opinions so I'm not going to fight with anybody on this one just one final question Jim show\n... in your mind God allowed the uh on guide lead people to elect Obama got allowed that to happen\n[laughter] well if God could strike evil out completely if God had the force to eliminate evil altogether than he would have done it a long time ago\nJim thanks for your thoughts thanks for your thoughts\nSo God allowed Obama to be elected\nBut God had a hand in getting Trump elected\n[noise]\nHey ah Mitch your and my friend\nGot great show Joe thinking man I I Believe God\nElected salt and got also put all by away but God used Obama to set up a Trump when he used Obama to push that Christians\nAnd to see how bad it could be under Obama so to get Trump so when he had to show 'em how bad it could be\nHey Mitch and again that's an interesting thought but what about the other half of the country that likes to Obama and doesn't like Trump\nWhat what if what\nIf they would say the exact opposite that God wanted Obama elected and God didn't consider Obama evil\n\nWell it also deception is in there you know people are just see in a trick\nYeah I Believe that Obama was elected so that it would push people all the way to the other side to get a Trump election in ... in your eyes on back you know get people back in line to get their country back
