of uh like I said before if you want to talk about a\nGlorified strippers and not bankrupt lawyers or how hot peppers make your a digestive tract go call it other station this is about discussing\nThe topics that are controlling us that are seizing aren't that there are being used to seize property and we're being told wars are good for us and these bad guys are so bad in fact they're good and not everything's just fine do what they want us to do and just trust the politicians\nAnd as I I think about the people who are whether it's Trump or Obama or Bush we mean trust the politician trusting the politician\nIs not only exactly what he what he wants you to do but it gets you into positions where we know lie about debt we're okay we pretend it's twenty two trillion and we're all phony outrage when you really factor in what we're obligated for is ten times that\nWhen we pretend that we have some sort of a property rights or free markets when at every turn your you're turning around your pain astronomical gas taxes astronomical property taxes that we're talking about income tax without focusing on the part that's less than fifty percent of all the taxes you pay as a citizen\nThat how do you have property rights when the law is used to control your in Obamacare which is what Republicans now run out is free nonsense health care free college that socialism has now become so interwoven with our society conservatives run\nTo protected that as you we as you watch it creep into society that's metastasized to where even good people are now fighting for bad ideas and this is what happens when you lose your fundamentals when you lose your principles when you pretend elected\nOfficials who actually said two different things to two different groups of people that you trust them\nIn fact the only restraints in this country should beyond that that I'd us the idea that they sit in these in these pretend a positions and a mess tens of millions without working a day and we call them honorable\nThis is what happens when you have a stupid fight citizen when you when you chance for control when you turn to your abuser so how do you get it back if we pretend enemies of our country that are giving money to to people who are declared themselves\nForever enemies like Saudi Arabia they're our friends and we stick up for them you don't have to pick between two bad you can

Want to clear up China is a socialist light socialist really communist light country um or they were ... lightening the restrictions on property ownership for their people yes economic growth yes there\nAre growing because they produce items and do they have a mandatory pay scales and restrictions yes but so do we\n... we they're producing something we're giving them money 'cause we are getting products\nEveryone says oh what are you pro China an anti ... no no no I'm against anybody that's using our money using our goodwill misusing our military power and I have no problem with the country I don't have to agree with every inch of their policies\nTo want to have an open free trade system with them that that's different because I Believe once people are exposed to liberty once people are exposed to prosperity a property rights they will demand it\nI recognize what is the enlightenment and where's the enlightenment from from Europe\nIt's from it's the concept of a lack articulate it so well it's what the foundation of our country I Want that to spread that through military force and I think when you expose a country to prosperity it will spread\nAnd I think you can trace back where China started and where it is today and see that that that our trade with China and other countries by the way we only make up Seventeen percent of Chinese trade\nAll the nonsense out there like they only exist for us know when it when it's a big piece puts Seventeen percent they're going to do what they do regardless of our tariffs policies\nThe point is do you believe in freedom for the citizen or do you just want to mandate it through certain corrupt ... countries and none more represents a corrupt ... and Saudi Arabia but let's go to the phone lines David thank you so much for calling the Joe Walsh show how are you\nGood good you know I wanted to go beyond just term limits and just to bring it this way let me just say real quickly go have a six terms ... or so congressman return for senators plus if you marry a lobbyist\nThan you are the numbers on your post at the end of your term you after you are dumber Congress you cannot live in Washington sent her with her thirty mile race and you're set up your ... year for twenty year\nHere's here's here's where you and I agree David to me the only restrictions in this country should be on politicians and the thing about when you're when you are marry a lobbyist that's a little different than what they did the urban did which is he was married and then his wife became a lobbyist and you know you wouldn't believe\nWith the batting averages of her clients who hire her to get something done and the fact that gets done what do you think it is\nBecause I tell you what it's better than tie cops batting average that's for sure\nSo and and the idea about term limits of course there should be term limits but why would they term limit themselves to pick packets cut their hands off\nCourse they don't why would they term limit themselves when they have the best job in the world they literally do do do less than zero have targeted special interest that paid them for their benefit then at the end of it you know what they get called adorable and the pension\nAnd they could do whatever they want why would you leave that\nWhy would you leave that so the difference is we need to change that we need to change it all limitations in this country shouldn't be on you and me and what insurance policy what the silver platinum and they shouldn't be ...\nShouldn't be and you and me and what insurance policy you want the silver platinum and they shouldn't be announced it should be on them and some of these things need to start with the money because you know what the article in the Drudge Report what's today on the top article Democrats raise a billion dollars a billion one billion dollars\nI mean I Know it's not conservative anymore it's not a a fundamental principle of Republicanism to want to limit the money to the politician but I Do\nLet me say right now the absolute only limitation in this country should be under a politician because the idea that we let Mitch McConnell make forty four for before Seventy four million dollars and his father in law become the greatest shipping mobile in China and we pretend these on my team\nIt's crazy to me crazy\nAnd it doesn't stop David recognize a thank you so much\nA kid do me a favor give me a Andy blind to Andy thank you so much for calling the Joe Walsh program I appreciate it\nA shot or you don't go by [noise] um I I wanted to figure out about it for very much\nI Love it stealing a write up opening notorious feeling I Love it\nMan the the local municipality I I just moved out of a little town ... Charlotte cornfields and sure this big developer wanted to move in North point yeah\nDarren how you could be relieved of the taxes you pay\nTwenty three years and and\nTwenty three dollars ... it's a lot\nOf the ... getting bigger because every day or and more and more accidents on interstate eighty mainly right where all these trucks are falling off and on the interstate to go to the existing federal court\nAnd oh it's going to be all these hundreds of millions of billion dollars\nFor the same here's the thing Andy here's what you gotta know\nChicago Illinois in particular the entire state for the you know that's what I mean Chicago's been doing this for decades Illinois is not doing it because the reality is they can't get economic growth without giving the money to do\nSo in other words they're giving them twenty three years of no property taxes now what's killing the average Illinois and his property taxes are ... so you get this company in and we didn't listen promise I promise we won't make you pay those Texas for twenty three years not only that\nWe're going to give you sweep percentage deals on the loan you need\nNot only that we're going to make sure that there is no real restrictions and very answers and different things other people have to do 'cause we're going to make sure you come here because we want you to create jobs\nBut when you do the math what you are happy that Illinois\nHas subsidize any pretend growth there is no real growth there is only the illusion the the a Potemkin growth that Illinois pretended had because of its fail you failed policies people who can do and they leave\nNo other people are tethered here through love and affection and family obligations and they can't leave\nBut how does Illinois it proceed and and fake the the the the pretend the illusion that it's a it's a state that's running okay they give money to targeted industries and people that's why if you're an independent taxpayer you want to get your taxes lower it's easy call the right clothes\nCall up the right call go to a bird go to Mike mad to get hired their law firm and you can get it done and that's the thing to remember is that failed socialism is the most corrupt of all governments because it what it does is it takes those politicians and it makes them gods and that's why they sell it\nWhen you say you can't be that all these politicians can't recognize this oh no no no no they recognize it and they like it\nThey recognize it and they want to put Mussarat if they love it because it makes them gods and it makes you slaves that's why if you read one book and you're like make it the road to serfdom by Hajek because what he warned about Seventy five years ago it was what you wake up to in the morning\nHe wrote he warns you do not cook food with socialism for it is a cancer that metastasize as of which no host can survive not\nNot the Soviet Union that Venezuela not Chicago because that's the other thing recognize we pretend there's an election going on over there and they're Seventeen version for the same freak Seventeen versions of the same nonsense and then spread it out to the state\nYou got seven foot stupid Laurel and hardy of failure you got router and Pritzker ooh what's the big difference\nAnd I are the ones got a wife that's very involved the other one's seems like she doesn't say much I'll go with the quiet wife\nBecause it's the same policies that same bend inspired borrow the same nonsense not accountability and it's the same conclusion and corruption because if you're sick a Democrat lobbyists and hacks go take a look Nancy Kimmy is\nFive foot two or three hundred pounds of corruption all wrapped in a trench coat that's what you get\nBecause it is the most corrupt system you've ever seen because that's the only way it survives is it fake success it gives tip agreements it gives a low interest loans to special targeted\nIt here in Illinois junk bond status failure as far as the eye can

slashed Betty rubber I don't know if that's true or not but\nFor Tonight Show it will be because I called her my girl and then right away Joe you know he's very competitive and all of a sudden you were his girl and it was back and forth well tonight you're my girl and I was wrong you from the Eric the red cage and I brought in misty Callahan\nFor um the syndicated our for the Joe Walsh program which is a big deal at first thing we do is they have technical difficulties\nNot for everyone like it'll come to yourself oh my God\nAll due to the ghettos and I are the shirt and the other room doesn't hit the right ... well\nWould also have to fight with a few more times you know if he told me one minute or is that a different side I'm All right but you\nKnow the only thing that Sean Thom ... element park\nFinally finally yachts and that means nothing to the people with me but the way that it started the way that I got here for those of you are not listening as I Would pastor Joe Walsh and some people in the morning I Would call up for my car because I'm a very opinionated capitalist\nAnd I'm a very frustrated um citizen of America who believes that liberty should be the foremost not party affiliation I've been rejecting tribalism really since after Reagan since I was told that the Bush senior was doing the right thing when I recognized him with his compassionate conservative\nFraud that he was I never liked any of his policies I never liked any of the Saudi Arabia nonsense which I Believe those chickens are coming home to roost as we speak\nI didn't like the collusion with um different Middle Eastern affiliates against certain other Middle Eastern affiliates not that I was picking winners or losers but I didn't like his whole agenda foreign policy I didn't like his economic corporate is a\nBig bank friendly and look at what's happened so I was either ahead of my time or I'm just crazy enough to be right it's all how you look at it um so I befriended a couple that I worked at a job where I never listen to radio never wants to listen to talk radio\nI was tired from that changed careers you know five and I started listening to talk radio and um\nI call up at the time Joe Walsh was not even a in the in the news at that time he was like myself are frustrated citizen just before he became a congressman\nCall up some talk radio here in the Chicago land area and I would argue with the host and now here I Am filling in\nFor that day and here you are it's like a marriage every once in a while a well placed argument can really spicy things up a little bit amen to that and\nReserve is all rams and were never charged for an estimate of bills racket [noise] five hundred expenses across\nThe mid ... an ad for two inches started turning up on the radio station I own I'll bet you've heard it the tale of two Charlie's\nIt close to home because I directed my mouth for years it was getting embarrassing so I gave him a try I wound up seeing Dr Spalding expected a lecture I deserved it I'll tell you that I deserved it he looked he said\nWe've got some work to do and he got started everything good was said about modern dentistry in that ad that use true the staff really is pleasant caring in professional and I'm Amazed at how quickly modern anesthetics work\nI never should have quit going to the dentist but now that I'm back\nI'm Glad I'm seeing Charlie Charlie or is there officially known encouraged dental associates two seven six seven three six six [laughter]\n[noise] [noise] joy for the job offer a ramp\nShots hops an infant Joe Walsh and I sprung his girl friday [laughter]\nBetty Roberts the cab free from the producer pay you know here's the other thing\nIt's one thing you as you get older mhm and you know I have to admit I was born in the sixties you believe that the late sixties Nineteen sixty seven\nFifty one I'll be next month well happy early birthday yeah thank you very much but I'm I'm noticing as I'm Around real people that no one is understanding my references for instance I sit by the rubble and there's a couple of people walking around her look no like real who that\nThey thought it was a real person the only ... funny enough it was a kid with the iron sure looks like he's loving guy\nHe's the one kid they got it but um it's\nNice to see young people working mhm and you know this is the thing I I I real against what's happened to the Democratic party and that they become ... I recognize them a decade ago maybe more really you could argue three decades ago they were Soviets there were socialist and not when you see a Bernie Sanders come to come to power each chanted new videos and the kids are taking\nThis guy's guilty of he's communist coup Luther does not mean that when the war was up he was honeymoon in their eyes preaching communism he comes out with the messy suit and and the ... what's what's left of the hair and I've had met at all of a sudden these are big friendly grandpa your communist you sort of a gun so\nHey Shaun Shaun Shaun member real socialism has never\nBeen tried that and like a but as soon as somebody who thinks like me you think to yourself you're losing kids ... you know I've got teenagers myself\nAnd really what do they know except the house values which is pretty much socialism and all of our house that's the only place it really is a threat that comes on me throws his money on the table and he gets nothing to everybody thinks it so they they see that and they think it'll work around the world so you lose faith but it's nice to come to work here and you're all young mhm when you're a young kid you\nCould be higher daughter or a wink wink nudge a generally\nOn the kids in the other moments so and I do have optimism I think that\nThe socialism net is these kids ironically are charging a champion against their own demise I think that's something that's taught ... I think inherently in their bones and the reason we're in America and the reason you see around the world\nThese um these people who look like they're just steeped in poverty or you know demanding freedom and demanding limited to a certain extent\nThese people who are coming here to the border mhm I'm not ready to condemn a mall\nOr maybe there are some of them and I'm hoping all of them who are coming here because they want to be free and see and this is an argument that I have in standard conservative circles right because to me it's about what would you do if you're not born in America you know\nWe're all lucky they wake up were American right they reminiscent of flag will more babies and you're American but what\nAbout if you're not mhm but what I Do if I was born in Ecuador or if you're in like as a father in Venezuela right now\nI got to look at my kids and I you know it's funny because\nThat those are the policies that the Democrats champ yeah Venezuela's the reality of where those policies lead those are like a ... billion ... percent inflation has changed the money's words junk it's nothing and more more over the policies of of utopia is really a prison right and and so what do you do when you go home and you look at your kids in your victimized by this\nI get my kids and I put them on my back I grabbed my wife and I don't care what she was I got out I'm walking maybe I'm getting a lot I hear ya a Mandel amen to that what I like the growing up about America and I would hear the stories of of lady liberty and give me your tired your poor way I liked about that is it made me think that we were the good guy right when Reagan\nMountain and thought what that means that's that's more than just the position that is a responsibility\nWhat that means that's that's more than just the position that the responsibility of responsibility to to say\nAre you being crushed by your government are you living under tyranny well then we will help you know unlike Republicans I don't want to send a war over there to help them right on like the more on\nBush and I don't mean W I mean the father I don't believe that we could um just\n... a ... the regime and implement a system of voting and all of a sudden it's it's like Kentucky [laughter] that's not going to happen now okay but I Do think that those people who are living under that system should have a place to go where they can see I reject it too\nAnd I love this idea of America and in ... growing up in a community I grew up in a million neighborhood mhm I'm half Italian grew up in a ... they were first generation and some case brand new immigrants who were the most patriotic Americans I've ever seen\nAnd I I think that for the most part there are a large group of these people that we are ... railing against\nWhen we reject all immigration so it's a hard line for a guy like me to walk I Want to get the idea about security and I agree with it a hundred percent and I agree with even a wall I really do\nI Want a system of immigration\nThat protects the American people but also makes new American people right now I also recognize through decades of failure\nThat we do not have a law for assimilation right so I had the ... either ... it was a brilliant the way ahead of any right to grow up he was a pet but inventor and he this is in the seventies\nI Lived in a community called ... Park Illinois mhm and most particularly why was it was one of the first towns where I'm at that time illegal aliens Mexicans in particular came\nThere was a small community of Mexicans and they were welcome there and we welcome them there for the most part and they came but one of the things that we saw happen was that all of our documents started to have to be printed\nIn Spanish mhm and it was a tremendous cost of this little community and we saw all of the things exploding the cost of\nSchools the cost of healthcare but one of the things I recognized as a young kid\nIs well that shouldn't exist anyway\nSo I don't want to use immigration as an excuse to protect American failed social was\nThere shouldn't be public school I'm Sorry can I Know a lot of people out there benefit but it shouldn't exist your neighbor shouldn't pay for your kid to go to school and if you believe in freedom and he believing liberty you would have rejected it out of premise because it's also hard to argue while your neighbor shouldn't pay for your health care we should pay for your kid's school\nAnd I would just interject by thing especially these days you know going back to what you were saying earlier about socialism being taught\nWhere do you think these kids are getting these ideas they're getting taught like that you know capitalism is right there was just a recent article coming out from teen vogue magazine talking about the end world poverty you need to and capitalism stuff is being taught\nIn school which is ... and you know in these teen magazines apparently now I'm so when if I ever have kids do I want to send them to a public school where they're just going to be indoctrinated with basically socialism nonsense a let me tell you I Do\nHave kids I threw teenagers ... my wife and I wish I am a regular guy to real estate broker type of food on the table I own a little cigars are but I Am a real estate but was hurt some types of sometimes I'm leaning month we have never never taken a our kids are put them in a public system of anything we pay that extra money you want to complain about\nAn average it's them when they went to grade school was like seven thousand a year and a lot of money yeah but you want to know something to public school waste twice that\nBecause they don't waste their money they waste our money it's always easier to spend somebody else's money than yourself if you have kids I got news for you out there you have an obligation to that kid is that your old neighbor already raised his ... year kid so let's not use laws a weapon to extort on\n'em and that's the problem so when you argue about immigration to it on an intelligent level where you're not arguing to protect American failed socialism you're arguing on principles and when you really dissect\nIt should be a principled American my name is Shawn Johnson in ...\n\nFish that show from France where the Joe Walsh former Congressman Joe Walsh is Joe ... radio [noise]\nJoe Walsh
