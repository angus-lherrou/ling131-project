cast now to Stephen Moore and the piece he wrote in the hill are entitled the best way to punish Saudi Arabia is to drill baby drill\nPerfectly sad\nHow do you want to deal with Saudi Arabia how do we punish them for what they did um drill baby right or be energy independent baby don't be be sold day dependent\nUpon Saudi for our a Saudi Arabia for our ale oil um Trump's critics have been confused by his as Stephen Moore puts it by his slow response\nIn condemning the Saudi Government for the killing of that Saudi journalist um\nIt's clear more makes the case that Trump didn't want the oil sheiks to retaliate by raising the price of oil\nAnd as more goes on to say if that were Trump's reasoning or it as we've discussed wouldn't be the first time that a Middle East policy was driven by our thirst for oil\nUm in fact as Stephen Moore describes you can make a strong case that all American foreign policy in the middle east over the last five decades has been driven by our need for foreign oil um\nNow the Saudis have threatened to drive the world oil price a which would mean a substantial jump at the pump for us um\nBut here's the deal uh for the first time is even more says since the early sixties we we no longer bow down when the Saudis threatened to drive to world oil price up because\nWe now have more energy available to us\nOr than any of these nations that we were so dependent upon and then more goes on to describe what has been a game changer in shale oil and gas revolution that has been a lot of people don't realize is made America\nThe number one oil and gas producer in the world say that again\nAmerica these past few years has become the number one oil and gas producer in the world and that has obviously a free to shop\nFrom being so dependent upon Saudi Arabia and OPEC for our oil um we we have nearly America has nearly tripled\nOur oil and gas production in the last twelve years there's no end in sight most of the analysis says we have two hundred years of production capability without running out right here\nOn in under our soil ah\nThis is all meant to simply say\nThat the best way to continue to punish the Saudis and as more says and punish the Iranians and punish the Russians for bad behavior or we just gotta keep drilling here at home every barrel of oil\nThat we drill is one less barrel that we have to buy from say Saudi Arabia\nThe barrel that we have to buy from say Saudi Arabia\n\nIt's the best way to deal with these Arab sheiks these Arab thugs\nI'm more Stephen Moore and the hill today believes a\nThis would actually be the perfect time for Trump to give some sort of a national speech calling for a national crusade for energy independence by twenty twenty and energy dominance says more says by twenty twenty to\nThe future is in our hands um it makes a lot of sense and America First energy plant\n\nSo many people don't realize avoid I speak right now because we've made so much progress\nIn our or own oil and gas\nProduction or we've tripled our oil and gas output since two thousand and five uh our our carbon emissions have gone down because natural gas from fracking reduces greenhouse gases\nFracking right reduces global warning warming or last year alone a PR Stephen Moore our carbon emissions were down about two percent even as the economy boomed\nSo Stephen Moore then asked the president what are you waiting for Mr President\nYou said many times that you won a future where we are not just energy independent but energy dominant\nTo quote the late great football coach legend George Allen the future is now never again should we be captive to the ... of the middle east for our energy needs\nPerfectly put Stephen Moore a free market economist in the hill today perfectly put\n\nHow do you get back at how do you punish Saudi Arabia for what they did\n\nAnd if you want to go down that road should they be punished is that our place to punish him it they they are and evil country and evil
