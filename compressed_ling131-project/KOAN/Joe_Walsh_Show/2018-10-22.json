miss the show catch the podcast code walls freedom dot com slash pod cast now does Stephen Moore\nAnd the piece he wrote in the hill are entitled the best way to punish Saudi Arabia is to drill baby drill perfectly said\nHow do you want to deal with Saudi Arabia how do we punish them for what they did um drill baby right or be energy independent baby don't be be showed day dependent\nUpon Saudi for our Saudi Arabia for our ale oil um Trump's critics have\nBeen confused by his as Stephen Moore puts it by his slow response in condemning the Saudi Government for the killing of that Saudi journalist um\nIt's clear more makes the case that Trump didn't want the oil sheiks to retaliate by raising the price of oil\nAnd as more goes on to say if that were Trump's reasoning or it as we've discussed wouldn't be the first time that a Middle East policy was driven by our thirst for oil\nA Middle East policy was driven by our thirst for oil\nUm in fact as Stephen Moore describes you can make a strong case that all American foreign policy in the middle east over the last five decades has been driven by our need for foreign oil um\nNow the Saudis have threatened to drive the world oil price up which would mean a substantial jump at the pump for us um\nBut here's the deal or for the first time is even more says since the early sixties we we no longer about down when the Saudis threatened to drive the world's oil price up because\nWe now have more energy available to us\nThan any of these nations that we were so dependent upon and then more goes on to describe what has been a game changer in shale oil and gas revolution that has a lot of people don't realize is made America\nThe number one oil and gas producer in the world\nSay that again America these past few years has become the number one oil and gas producer in the world and that has obviously a free to shop\nFrom being so dependent upon Saudi Arabia and OPEC\nFor our oil um we we have nearly America has nearly tripled\nOur oil and gas production in the last twelve years there's no end in sight most of the analysis says we have two hundred years of production capability without running out\nRight here on in under our soil ah all ...\nAll meant to simply say\nOr that the best way to continue to punish the Saudis and as more says and punish the Iranians and punish the Russians for bad behavior or we just gotta keep drilling here at home every barrel of oil\nThat we drill is one less barrel that we have to buy from say Saudi Arabia\n\nIt's the best way to deal with these Arab sheiks these Arab thugs\nI'm more Stephen Moore and the hill today believes that\nThis would actually be the perfect time for Trump to give some sort of a national speech calling for a national crusade for energy independence by twenty twenty and energy dominance says more says by twenty twenty to\nThe future is in our hands um it makes a lot of sense and America First energy plant\n\nSo many people don't realize of what I speak right now because we've made so much progress\nIn our own oil and gas production or we've tripled our oil and gas output since two thousand and five uh our our\nEmissions have gone down because natural gas from fracking reduces greenhouse gases fracking right reduces global warning warming\nUh last year alone a purse Stephen Moore our carbon emissions were down about two percent even as the economy boomed so Stephen Moore then asked the president what are you waiting for Mr President\nYou said many times that you won a future where we are not just energy independent but energy dominant\nTo quote the late great football coach legend George Allen the future is now never again should we be captive to the suburbs of the middle east for our energy needs\nPerfectly put Stephen Moore a free market economist in the hill today perfectly put\nHow do you get back at how you punish Saudi Arabia for what they did\nAnd if you want to go down that road should they be punished is that our place to punish him it they they are Knievel country and evil regime it is what it is they are what they are well if if you're going to get back to Adam if you want to make them hurt\nRight uh if you want to make them hurt then\nProduce our own oil\nSo that we don't have to pay for their ...\n\nAnd it's such a Saudi Arabia it's it's it's a Ron it's Russia it's a number of these countries in the middle east we are now at a point in America and this began\nBefore Trump this has been going on now for a number of years we are ah we've become energy independent\nThere is the opportunity here\nAs Stephen Moore spelled out for America to become energy dominant\n\nAnd we've made great strides\nA whacking back against all the ... the environmentalist and the people on the left who don't want us drilling here who don't want us fracking here\nUm it's clear that this is a debate\nAnd an argument that we've won because fracking or can be done now is in fact done now in an incredibly environmentally safe way that the the evidence and the data supports that\nThis is a jobs engine all the drilling all the fracking a it is a wage a ... a wealth\nCreation engine and it is
