I I respect his opinion I disagree with him he says cops are trying to figure out ways to gun down black people that some bunch of BS um this is what makes me sad\nYou know there's a reason why what this verdict is so unusual and show unprecedented that this is the first Chicago cops in a half century to be found guilty of murder case in almost a half century\nNow my friend Mays Jackson will say that's because the system is biased against\nUh the black man I Will say no in Ninety nine percent of all police shootings they are justified shootings jurors jurors or or judges but our legal system finds in almost every case\nBetty cops shooting somebody even if it's tragic it was a justified shooting and that says you should be\nWe should not be convicting cops for murder left and right of black people or white people\n\nBut this one and I'm not a cop and I will defend cops you know me I'll defend cops are beyond when I have to\nPut this one just didn't feel right and when\nYou saw if you really watch that video\nAnd you saw with officer Van Dyke did to this black teenager I don't give a damn ... what he was on I don't give a damn what he had in his hand I don't give a damn how troubled he was you watch the video he was shot\nSixteen times other cops hanging around and again as a layman he sure didn't seem like he was a threat in that moment to officer Van Dyke it saddens me\nThis saddens me\nLet me hear from you let me go to a Kurt hey my friend Kurt\nRight that they all around or a family trip and I hope the media all kind of come out saying look it's kind of all been avoided if we're not on drugs or not committing the crime and when you officers command that's that's kind of grow at all police officers should African Americans\nAnd yeah not true and the meaning of things are run with it and Kurt Kurt any crime on yeah go ahead you may give give me your\nTake from your perspective because you've walked in officer Van Dyke shoes um you watch the video the whole case do you think the jury kinda got it right\n... and ... or ... or ... years old and they're probably got it right on that\nBut the media needs then don't grow that everything was going to be part shop at the ... how many rounds human body yeah or they go out\nOn your are your sample thing yeah [noise] [laughter]\nYeah [noise]\nYeah bring them\nBack and we'll take that one [laughter] [laughter] yeah\nThank you my brother Kurt thank you my man thank you and I I I I have very little face that the media will do any of what you say and I have all the fear in the world that the media is just going to pile on top of not just officer Van Dyke but a\nCops again in general let me go to Kate tied their Kate\nHi Joe how are you how were you I'm\nGonna give 'em a point of view from someone who has a daughter who is Chicago police officer and I have to say that this was not victory today I'm without having to repeat what everybody is already talked about I'm going to be the voice for a police officer\nWho basically for Fifteen Years and then I guess I'm Larry job he never won an of fire\nA weapon at anybody and I've heard you and I've heard other people speak about well why didn't he look why didn't he slowed down why did he do that\nMy daughter said it pretty clearly that the first time you have to pull your gone out of your holster yeah and so split second yeah you can't help but think one I'm here to do my job and here to serve and protect not myself only but everybody else yeah\nUm we can say what we want about the victim we can say what we want about Jason Van Dyke but what we did today as we made somebody a sacrificial lamb and we basically tied in the hands of our police department\nFor ever and I literally cry today over that\nIn a bad day I uh I so appreciate your perspective into your daughter thank you for her service will do thank you Joe okay thank you thank you for your thoughts in your opinion I\nI I'm ... I'm sad about it too because\nLook I think the reactions going to be stupid I think the reaction on our side uh I I I got all the respect in the world from aids Jackson and I I understand\nThat the reaction in uh the black community in Chicago they're going to feel good about this I get that and I understand that um\nBut like like uh the Brett Kavanaugh surfing was not about the me too movement and it's not about all women it was about did Brett Kavanaugh do this\nOr this officer Jason Van Dyke thing is not about\nA cop shooting black men in black violence in the city it's about did officer Van Dyke commit murder natural justice but we want to create and blow out of proportion all of these other narratives that fit where we are politically\nThis is a sad day\nFor me Kate I think a lot of

important to address this question and try to answer this question\nBecause we've kind of sort of been down this road before with North Korea you can't really believe anything North Korea says or does that's a given I Can't imagine North Korea given up their nukes that's a given as well but you know what a Trump deserves credit\nFor really changing the whole dynamic here something's going on I don't know if it means anything don't know what it might mean but something\nIs going on [noise]\nI mean is going on\nA five five six for two fifty six hundred David Ignatius longtime foreign policy expert writes for the Washington Post he's ... he's generally a left of center guy\nWell he's got a piece today even he has a piece today that says the headline asked the question is the Korea denuclearization process for real\nAnd even Ignatius this guy man of the left says that after this week Singapore or after that the Singapore summit in June\nI'm\nMost analysts doubted that there was any real substance with any sort of a deal\nA ... regarding North Korea but Ignatius says you know what we're beginning to see the first signs of what a serious deal might look like this week's north south summit meeting\nIn North Korea historic right South Korea going up to North Korea the head of South Korea big deal I'm\nProduced\nA agreement on some basic essentials\nWhen it comes to denuclearization\nAnd I ... I think these are overlooked and Ignatius point some out North Korea agreed to accept internal inspectors\nTo monitor destruction of one of its test sites that's good uh that's a first step toward bigger and broader inspection North Korea also agreed in principle to dismantle\nIts main nuclear weapons facility at Yongbyon\nAh again Ignatius points out the details on that are fuzzy though I'm\n... ... all its offer is all conditioned on reciprocal us corresponding measures whatever that means\nA well again might pump pay or secretary of state put out a potential timetable this week by completion of denuclearization by twenty Twenty one\nThat's pretty optimistic\nBut as Ignatius says it provides a baseline for us the United states to protest if North Korea daily Delhi's around\n[noise] um it it's interesting what's going on or North Korea wants a formal declaration of the end of the state of war\nAre unclear or what that will look like a\nTrump and Kim Jong loan I mean they continue to flatter each other and stroke each other and cheer lead for each other I I I mean I don't put a lot of stock in to that but\nIt it it's it's different and it's better than having them fight with each other\nAnd even as a man of the left David Ignatius says today emerging signs of detente between the Koreas is very exciting\nKim Jong il and also this week said he wants a second meeting with Trump\n\nThis week's summit between north and South Korea also advanced Kim's goal of economic modernization ah North Korea is a country that desperately needs to come in out of the dark ages\nThey they made the proposed bed north and South Korea did a joint north south Olympics in twenty thirty two that's pretty cool\nTo do that or would be impossible without upgrading modernizing North Korea over the next decade\nSo stuff's happening State Department's going to a ... going to go back to North Korea\nUm\nKeep that talks going show show what what's the downside of all of this well as David Ignatius points out there are still way more questions than answers\nUm\nYou can't trust or believe anything North Korea says or does\nA\nWhat's behind what Kim is doing I I think that's a concern\nUm\nWhat is his motivation what's he after what she up to\nThe U.S and Japan a need to keep a close eye on what's going on right now when it comes to North Korea or ... ... there are huge problems\nBut I come back to this\nYeah I I criticize a lot of what Trump's done domestically\nBut I Do believe on the world stage his Bella custody his unpredictability the fact that he you know can be a jerk\nWell there are a lot of bad dudes and a lot of jerks in the world Kim Jong is one of them\nAnd I I really think that uh you know you got to be a jerk to understand jerks\nTrump pest that
