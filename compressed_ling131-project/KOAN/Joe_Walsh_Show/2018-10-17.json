Walsh or eighties Tuesday a thank you for listening if you miss the show catch the podcast go towards freedom dot com slash pod\nCast she kept saying cup everyday she kept saying cop everyday stand with our men and women and blew 'em right now about twenty six hundred Hondurans are pushed into Guatemala yesterday\nUh they are making their way up to our southern border\nUh after they made it into Guatemala and they were held for about two or three hours by the police who then let them continue or their march or they started out on friday just a few hundred now they're up to a few thousand\nTheir goal is to try to make it all the way up to our southern border to seek asylum and to come into this country\nA President Trump getting wind of this caravan we've been down this road before or sent out a pretty a\nStrongly worded tweet the United states\nHas strongly informed the president of Honduras that if the large caravan of people heading to the U.S has not stopped and brought back to Honduras no more money or aid will be given to Honduras affective immediately know word\nOr from the president of Honduras a Mexican officials\nAre remember last time when this happened in April and may Mexico just let him walk right on through no word yet as to what the the Mexican officials will do\nOur U.S Department of homeland security said today that uh what we see day in and day out at the border is a result of well advertised and well known catch and release loopholes we cannot allow it to happen you will recall and I need to say this\nDon't get angry at me\nPresident Trump made a similar threat back in April with the last caravan\nPresident Trump last time when a couple of thousand of them came up he threatened to withdraw aid from Honduras a that never happened and the uh the migrants the illegals reached our southern border\nWe can't let that happen again\nAnd if Mexico is not going to cooperate or then they will probably make it to our border\nBut that doesn't mean we have to let him in and let's hope this time or\nThe Trump Administration sticks to that let me go to Greg Greg\nAge I was just going to say a couple things first of all if someone\nHey Joe I was just going to say a couple things first of all if I Want thinking asylum right\nYeah the idea is they're fleeing from something like violent yes if the violence in Honduras when they reach Guatemala they've already found is Iowa thank you right\nThat's really what they're looking for is not asylum they're looking for to come to a place where there's more fluid nothing wrong with that I don't blame them but that's what they're looking to do\nAnd don't buy the only record Greg Greg I'll give you can point but just to back up your first point Guatemala again has said they will not provide asylum to these people\nRight out of the matter is you know if it if there were another wealthy country between art\nAnd you cannot mandate what you're up there exactly right yup they're just come in here because we're wealthy countries because they they've they've already escaped the violence when they get to whatever the next country is that they're not quite\nRight yep but look I don't blame if people I mean our life is not good they want to get your point about the same point a Trump can threaten the same thing in Guatemala and Mexico but he did get found\nIt if they let the caravan continue toward our border he can pull funding from Guatemala and Mexico\nBut he's got to do something you're right because we can't just let everyone in the world who wants to come to us in the U.S it just it won't work\nThank you Greg it just it well it won't work and it's not right there are proper ways to seek asylum and it's not proper to just you win a thousand to your best friends just come walking across or crawling across our border\n\nNow everybody got upset about this when this happened at the end of April and early may this past year and the Trump Administration talked tough man but most of them eventually came in we cannot let that happen again let me go to Steve Steve\n[noise] apples and they won't eat it when he allowed tens of thousands of ... in the country\nYeah what do they go who's who houses do feeds the who\nEducate them what do they get I can understand why they don't understand ... cents\nSteve so perfect because they never talk about those things do they\n\nWell where do they go yeah I\nKnow Steve you write the ... I'll tell you what they come into this country\n... and again [laughter] it's just such a frustrating issue because most people don't realize that right now we're practicing catch and release right now as we speak\nSo we detain them Steve at the border we detain them for twenty four hours and then we give him a court date or three four months down the road and we just let them go into our country and in most of them we never hear from again\nAnd they disappear into our country they find family they find friends they find communities and before you know it right there getting public ... they're getting welfare they're getting Obamacare they're getting all of that\nIt should be so simple you just don't let them in let me quickly go to will say well\nHey Joe I'm going I'm good man\nIt started up your uh uh uh George Soros horse and a big bag of cash that\nThat they care that ah [laughter]\nI wouldn't doubt it\nHe's probably but I think I I think just stars you share mangoes Trump's gotta he's gotta he's gotta talk up artist chance really shy Detroit laws that are\nNo no place you know he can do whatever the hell you watch ... ... it's a great question but no the president of the United states can do what ever he watch on our border\nHe can do what ever he wants to defend this country he has wide latitude and let's hope let's hope that he if he if these folks get here mid November let's hope that he exercises the authority he has um ...\n[noise] [noise]\nTime to check more freedom voicemail when you're saying about you know [noise]\nMaybe it's a tough\nFunding Planned Parenthood slaughter of all those babies every year maybe the depths that won't be so\nI\nGot to work on that [noise]\nIt's usually a civil disobedience\nIs just such a program on the same for [noise]\nHey Joe last year and I've got great news for people just like me who have struggled with pain I'm Talking of course about relief\nFactor a one hundred percent botanical product with four ingredients that had been helping thousands of people just like me with my back pain and general muscle aches and pains\nI'm Talking about real pain maybe you're struggling even walk because of the pain or maybe even getting out of a chair is painful or sleeping through the night it's hard to do because of the pain if\nYou've tried everything else like I did to get out of the pain than you simply need to go to release\nFactor dot com to order the three week we start for only Nineteen dollars and Ninety\nFive cents that's less than a dollar a day to see if you can lower or even eliminate your pain and remember nearly eighty percent of those who ordered the quick start go on to order Morehead that's amazing and it's one hundred per cent drug free relief factor dot com relief\nFactor dot com or call eight hundred five hundred eighty three eighty four that's eight hundred five hundred eight three eight for\nIf you're a small business owner then you need to know about you line you line is the leading distributor shipping industrial and packaging materials to businesses to North America they serve hundreds of thousands of small business customers right here in the U.S\nIn July and understands that small business owners are the engine of our economy\nIf any part of your business involves packing or shipping materials then here's the deal you need you lined their catalog is huge and it's full of high quality products\nThey offer ... more than twenty seven thousand us real products in July ... customer service is second to none for all of your shipping and industrial product needs\nContact you line called them today at one eight hundred to nine five five five one zero or go on line at you line dot com slash while sets U.

wrapping their arms around Obamacare when it was like\nIt was like the most unpopular thing in the world eight years ago again Sarah Jones in the New Republic a shows Gallup\n\nOpinion polls show now that most Americans view Obamacare favorably\nEight years ago it was unpopular lightly\nBut many of us at the time said at\nLightly but many of us\nAt the time said at the time you got to get rid of it now you got to get rid of Obamacare now route and branch she got to pull it all out you got to get rid of it because the longer we keep it the more the American people are going to like it a and won it\n\nMade me one government program or that the American people once they tasted\nDon't want a piece of\nAnd that's what's happened Gallup poll this year a majority of the American people favor Obamacare\nA Kaiser Family foundation poll\nEarlier this year highest public support\nFor Obamacare since twenty ten fifty four percent a nationally because of Obamacare is more popular or the Democrat Party is viewed as better able to handle health care\nThan Republicans and it's not even close the highest\nMargin there between Democrats and Republicans who's better able to handle or take care of health care a Democrat Party by a wide margin in fact\nThe widest margin since two thousand and six which was the last time there was a blue wave in midterms\nSee we we\nI wasn't alone but we knew this would happen you give the American people something and that's what Obamacare was\nEventually the American people are going to get used to that something and eventually the American people are going to like being given something\nAnd then you'll never be able to get rid of this something you just gave the American people\nWelfare health care\nAny any ... any benefit from the government\n\nWhat did Ronald Reagan say right when Reagan said the most difficult thing in the world to get rid of is is a government program\nWhen the ... when have we ever gotten rid of of a government program mean hell I went to Congress in twenty ten thinking that we would get rid of this program or get rid of that program would cut spending baloney Republicans had no interest in doing any of that\nSo yeah you gave the American people something than Obamacare and now the American people have grown used to it\nAnd daylight getting things they like getting free stuff\nAnd so now Obamacare as popular\nDemocrats notice\nSo Democrats are talking about Obamacare Republicans no deaths\nYou see like a a a a candidate for governor in Michigan Republican bill shoot 'em he's trying to

when he was attorney generally joined the lawsuits trying to strike down provisions of Obamacare\nNow he's running for governor seven eight years later\nHe's got about almost seven hundred thousand people in Michigan who are enrolled in uh the Medicaid expansion program which is really where most that's really what Obamacare is we've just thrown more people and the Medicaid he's up for
