I kind of believe a lot of things like you do I think it's going to get worse before it gets better but I mean if we don't or head we're all in trouble\nI'm Greg good call agree the problem is here's the problem\nThis country is so much more divided than we all know three one two six for two fifty six hundred who's to blame you've got everybody on the left blaming President Trump for what happened today\nI just I just don't buy that one I owed a let me go to watch Tony hey Tony you're on with Joe\nAnd Joe you know my first instinct this morning was you know I wanted to jump on the bandwagon of false flag and all that but then thinking it through in order to do that you have to assume the motives of this individual your last caller had it right I think it will get worse and here's the thing I Do think that Trump\nTactics um whether I agree with them or not I think you can put some blame on that they're saying that you can put blame on Maxine Waters and things that she goes out and assuming the motives of others and then acting on that is a tactic of the ... the generally what you ... you know you can\nSay you see that on that side um if for example or identity politics in order to claim something as hate speech or or to say that you know white privilege this or anything along those lines you have to\nTo say that you know white privilege this or anything along those lines you have to assume the motives of that individual before the factory and that you know we didn't want to make any assumptions before the facts rent for cabinet and I think we should make any something\nI'm Tony ... played this out for me I I'm trying to understand what you're saying 'cause it's interesting show if if if you've got Trump out their month after month call and the media the enemy the people\nAnd then some madman grabs a gun and shoots a member of the media because he can't stand the media because they're the enemy of the people are ... Donald Trump have any blame for what that Mad Men did\nWell I'm sure the the argument could be made that is to blame but the point is\nYou know when you play it out you know what your last caller said is exactly right that's what the ... the the the justice system is there for is to work on ... and ... and take it down to the level of the individual you know rhetoric is rhetoric and if people can't handle it you shouldn't get involved\nIn a good call Tony no in in your right and I think I'm right there with you look you know I and I've said from the beginning I don't like it when Trump calls the media the enemy of the people I think it's dangerous and I don't I don't think it makes sense but if you got Trump alter call on the media the enemy the people\nAnd then some guy grabs a gun and shoots a member of the media\nUm the guy who grabbed the gun and shot a member of the media\nHe's responsible for that and he's going to pay a price for that there's a big difference between Donald Trump saying the media is the enemy the people or Donald Trump saying hey come on everybody grab your gun go shoot a member of the media\nIf Donald Trump said that at one of his rallies everybody needs to go shoot a member of everybody needs to go shoot somebody at CNN and then somebody shot somebody at CNN I guarantee you Donald Trump would be held liable for that as well\nBut there's a big difference between expressing an opinion the media is the enemy the people or the media sucks\nAnd the president saying go go attack a member of the media there's a big big difference between that let me go to Dave Dave you're on the Joe\nJoe I'm I just got or heard about this on my way and work for the first time but it's funny that neither the bombs went off [noise] I mean\nYou know yeah I'm going to make 'em you think the water them or something would have went off to well you know the Democrats and the media that cause a lot of the problems you know I'm sure there's angry\nUm [noise]\nYou know but um [noise] everything goes through or two years now or a little longer I don't blame them one bit\nAnd Dave thanks um the ... the\nBomb that was at CNN it was reported to be a alive device it did not go off it could have gone off um the other devices\nIs the one got to George Soros his residence\nOr the again the the the one to Maxine Waters and Eric Holder and block Obama they\nYou know they they don't bronco bomb and doesn't go out and get his mail every day uh they they they go somewhere else where they're screened a first and that's where these devices were found\nOr just to kind of be technical on\nThat point um\nLook we live in a divided country right now the rhetoric is heated right now I think it's going to get more heated right now um and I think this is just the road we're on a I think it's imperative that we all condemn violence or as much as we can\nAll violence I'm Joe Walsh [noise]\n[noise]\nIt's time to check the freedom we smell when

midterm uh for the opposition party\nThat that's not on Trump's dishes American history this always happens\nThe president's party loses seats the president's party will not lose seats in the Senate

Democrats could pick up fifty seats in the house they could pick up twelve\nSomewhere between twelve and fifty depending on how big a Democrat year it is depending upon how big this wave is you by the way I\nCan help determine how big this Democrat wave is\nA lot depends upon what you're gonna do\nIt for publications and Democrats excuse me if Republicans and conservatives come out if there's a red wave like for public ... and conservatives come out and vote\nLike a much more than in a normal mid term\nA much more than in a normal mid term\n[noise]\nThat will minimize the games the Democrats make a again I don't want to fool yeah the Democrats are going to gain seats in the house there's no way the Republicans gained seats but if the Republicans come out in droves\n\nIf the Republican turnout is huge they can limit does Democrat gains\n\nAnd I think if Republican turnout is really solid really really strong then I think Republicans keep control of the house so see that's where like you will come in\nThat for every Republican and conservative listening to me right now run the country that's where you\nCome in ... we can't control can we what the Democrat turnout is going to be we can't control that don't even want to try to control that\n\nBut we can control what we do but just so you know or as you sit here right now and listen to me right now\nBarring a miracle on the part of the Democrats the Republicans keep control of the Senate\nOr the Democrats will make gains in the house that is certain\nWhether they make enough gains to take over the house that is on certain\nThey got a lot of stars lined up to help him\nBut it ain't a done deal yet it's not a done deal by any means a lot of the seats that the Democrats have to win\nAre right now seats held by Republicans are in many in like suburban districts\nAnd these Republicans are putting up really good strong fights\nAnd these races are like a lot of 'em are within the margin of error\nSo you see it I mean it's really it's really really close final point though on control I'll get to that right now um\n\nIf the Democrats take over the house life's going to change pretty dramatically you're giving power to the Democrats you're giving subpoena power to the Democrats\nThe Democrats will try to investigate President Trump out of existence\nI I don't know you know for sure whether they'll move to impeach him but they will most certainly try to investigate every inch of him and that's what the next two years will turn out to be\nYou know putting aside just putting aside the fact that the Democrats will stop Trump's agenda or ... ... many pieces of which are our agenda\nBuilding the wall getting tough on the border\nTax cuts for Americans or the Democrats will stop all of that\nBut they don't want to stop there they're really intent on when you control the house you control everything you control every committee you have subpoena power you control any bill that's going to be brought to the floor to be voted on that sure that the party in charge controls that\nEight five five six for two fifty six hundred eight five five six for two fifty six hundred so keeping the Democrats from taking over the house a\nHe's a really really really big deal [noise]\nWe got Thirteen Days to go\nThis is the Joe Walsh from rapid as Joe Walsh the former Congressman Joe off a guy named Joe Walsh ambulance Joe Saddam Hussein on radio and at\nThe following is not an actor but a real life story from trinity debt management\nMy story began with that a lot of credit card debt and I heard a commercial for trinity I gave them a call\nIf you're in depth and you need help called trinity at one eight hundred nine nine ... six nine seven six\nYou know called trinity a one eight hundred nine nine oh six nine seven six when\nI first called I was a little embarrassed and kind of a shame and I looked at the number and I saw how quickly that astronomical debt that was in my life would go way trinity will\nConsolidate your accounts into one easy to manage monthly payment reduce your interest and possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands\nWhat I Would tell other people please pick up the phone and called trinity just let them put together a program and see how affordable and easy it is to pay off your debt\nCalled trinity a one eight hundred nine nine oh six

Wednesday a former Congressman Joe Walsh back with you follow me on Twitter at Walsh freedom um the Democrat Party is a mess\nI mean step back for a second bronco bummer which president for eight years and you know that during those eight years Obama was president the Democrats lost control of the house and the Senate\nOr they lost like thirty governorships around the country they lost like twenty two or three control of twenty two or twenty three state\nOr a legislatures around the country are a couple thousand Republican state legislature tours were elected during the Obama rain I mean the Democrat Party underneath Iraq Obama\nGot pounded during those eight years kind of disappeared during those eight years\nBecause the Democrat Party was all about Obama Obama was all about Obama by the way that cracks me up because I Know yeah I'll admit that Trump is all about Trump Trump's all about advancing Trump but what was Obama like or Obama same deal same thing Obama was all about Obama\nAnd it it it shows because Obama really did nothing to help the infrastructure the Democrat Party\nHe just wanted saint saint Brock to be as popular as she could\n\nNo I'll admit that the Republican Party has the basic problem the Republican Party's basic problem is Republicans are dying\nOr the Republican Party skews toward old white people\nAnd I'm an old white people and old white people are dying and Republicans need to find a way to reach other constituencies because the country is not becoming more white the country's becoming less white\nAnd everybody talks about this demographic advantage that the Democrat Party has well ... me\nExcuse me\nDemocrat parties got some problems right there there's a reason Trump won because the Democrat Party has moved so far left\n\nThey are a party that seems more concerned about illegals than the American citizens they are a party that seems more concerned about letting the boys shower with therapy with the girl\n\nThan they do basic jobs and health care they are a party that seems more concerned about letting or any and all Muslims in this country even if it makes the American people less safe they're the party of sanctuary cities\n\nThey're the party of open borders they're the party of amnesty they're the party of sixty three genders near the\nParty of a not only can gays get married but everybody has to accept it and participate in it you see a pattern here they are the party of quotas they are the party of or if you look at me funnier racist\n\nThere's a pattern here today's Democratic Party has become very left and\nToday's Democratic Party has become very left and very extreme\nAnd today's Democrat Party has turned off good hard working Americans right there in the middle\n... you and I may be hard working Americans but I I'm not right in the middle I'm over on the right maybe many of you over on the right with me but there are a lot of hardworking be suit God fearing Americans who are kind of right in the middle\nPolitically speaking\nAnd they look at the Democrat Party today and and they say my God Democrat probably didn't care about me Democrat Party cares about like the the trend all they're obsessed with transgender ...\n\nThey're obsessed with letting people into this country illegally\nThey don't seem to like white people\nIt's a problem for them they become an extreme left his party\nAnd I'll tell you what and and again point the media has ignored this story 'cause that's not a narrative they won out their media is ignored it\nThe problems in the country the political they're all republic Republican Party has problems\nShow says the media\nBut you look at where things are now in and look Trump and the Republicans they got their issues ah don't know
