um\nThink we make it too damn easy for people in this country to vote oh there's a commercial right there right that there that'll be a commercial against Joe Walsh I think we make it too damn easy\nFor people in this country to vote I think if you want to vote you got to get off your ass and go vote\nI think if you're not registered to vote I think you got to get off your ash and go get yourself registered to vote\nI I mean is is that is that asking too much that that you ought to have a little bit of skin in the game\nBut we continue to make laws to try to make it as easy as possible for people to get registered to vote and then to vote I Am telling you what there's going to come a day there will come a day in America\nI don't know how how far we are way from this but it's common\nThere's going to come and day in America where you will not have to leave your house on election day you can sit on your couch somebody's going to ring the doorbell they're going to bring

give people in this country illegally government issued id\nI I mean there are times I still pinch myself that we're doing this\nThat we're doing this in Illinois and California in states all over the

promised I very rarely up\nYeah well I'll hang up and left the yo man but very rarely do you have any kind of over to this and one of the cases I Want to hear what your solution is rather than just talk back and forth what does your proposed solutions a\nCable stay on the line rush CNN and I'll give you the final word this is a tricky one because and let's talk about California in general\nMy solution would be to reverse what California did so I don't believe in motor voter a automatic registration I don't believe the state should automatically register\nAnybody to vote so that would be a solution I don't believe the state should give people in this country illegally driver's licenses so my solution Rushdie and I know what's that going to happen in California is I Would a reverse\nUh what California has done the last couple of years I'll give you the final word\nNuts that's fair enough I I have nothing else and that's where I was brought up yet you don't want to be like\n... but rusty ... and I admit you got me on this one because you and I know it's not going to happen\nUh it's not going to happen in California thank you brothers thanks for checking in a ... it's it's a good question rusty what is my solution right and again my flip answer is the solution is don't do what California did don't do it Illinois did\n\nDon't make it easier much my solution don't make it easy for people to vote in this country don't make it easy for people to register to vote I'm not saying don't make it I don't want to make it difficult but don't make\nIt easy and and for heaven's sakes
