friday I started this hour and then I got lost as I often do talking about Islam in Europe I don't want to go there you know where I stand on that but I started this hour\nThe snow chill friday this third our this notion of friday talking about how America's becoming less religious a new study out or that shows especially among millennials\nMillennials are are abandoning religion formal religion at a pretty high rate uh and they are uh\nPrefer being witchcraft and astrology witchcraft and astrology\nNow ... which is interesting is uh this this Pew Research study found that interest in spirituality\nHas been booming in America in recent years especially in a among millennials interest in spirituality or the majority of Americans though\nBut not religion the majority of Americans now believe it is not necessary to believe in God to have good morals\nPer a proof of the Pew Research center\nFor the first time it's interesting a majority of Americans now believe it's not necessary\nTo believe in God to have good morals\nThe percentage of people between the ages of Eighteen and twenty nine millennials\nWho never doubt the existence of God fell from eighty one percent\nIn oh seven sixty percent in two thousand and twelve show more and more millennials doubting the very existence of God meanwhile the same study shows that half of young adults in the U.S believe in\nBelieve astrology is a science\nCompared to less than eight percent of the Chinese public\nUm ... uh the whole psychic services industry like astrology and or reading\nA medium ship Terrell card reading all that stuff\nI'm is growing by leaps and bounds in America I'm now it's a it's a two billion dollar annual business um\nBut formal religion you know all the stuff astrology and and uh\n\nAnd and belief in a reading your palms or Sheryl cards and all of this\nReading your palms or Terrell cards and all of this\nGrowing but belief in formal religion nose diving among young Americans\n\nAnd the study shows that young Americans again Eighteen to twenty nine Eighteen to thirty four\nLook upon religious organizations religions as they look upon government\nA big business uh most institutions\nAre young Americans millennials look upon these institutions religion as well\nA with a high negatives\nThey don't trust these institutions they don't believe in these institutions\nAnd so they look elsewhere\n\nThey look to astrology\nEven though astrology has been debunked by numerous academics are studies\n\nBut the the lack of structure young Americans are drawn\nTo the lack of basic structure and that's why they don't like religion and that's why they prefer things like astrology witchcraft\n\nMystic mystic er boxes and the right key infused bath salts and all of these crazy things are just jump in crazy I shouldn't say some crazy a A R jumping among millennials but formal religion\n\nAnd their belief in a belief in formal religion practice according to a formal religion\nPart of the Pew Research center this latest study in this latest study\nConfirms other studies that we've been aware of for a long time that\nAmericans in general though still a very religious people still a very moral people still a very spiritual people\nI'm no longer practice seem uh in in\nIn religions no longer formally believing in religions\nThis country that is eighty something percent Christian\nAnd juicy this development most prominently among young Americans millennials and younger are ... ... and mass on mass just turning away\nFrom formal religion\nNow I I Believe and also turning away from um\nA a very belief in God now I I Believe\nObviously like many of you do or that there is a guy in I Believe God created all of this and I believe\nThat when they people\nBegin to turn away from God and eight people begin to turn away from religion I e\nIn our very imperfect Schumann way of\nUm giving\nPraise to a God and trying to live out our godly faith\nIn as imperfect as all religions are and I'm raising my hand right now I'm a born and raised Catholic still a practicing Catholic and the Catholic Church right now again is going through real problems right now and by the way these real problems that the Catholic Church is going through\nA A R problems that help\nUm convince especially young Americans that religions are bogus but I Believe that when people turn away from my God and turn away from\nA religious life I Believe eventuality that people are turns away from morals and does in fact turn away from goodness\nI Believe that you are connected I Believe that you can be a moral person without believing in God you can be\nA good person without\nA practice seen a particular faith\nUm but as a people lose their connection to God and religion are people gets lost we're seeing that in Europe\nAnd we are beginning to see that here in America as well\nAnd it's not a good thing\nEight five five six for two fifty

congressman came out yesterday Peter Roskam and Randy Hultgren and said they oppose what Donald Trump is doing here\nThey oppose lowering the number of refugees that we let him hear\nThose are two suburban Republicans\nNow the Republican Party man is when it comes to immigration when it comes to keeping our border open the Republican Party is as bad as the Democrat Party\n\nThis is a big change and it's an important change in the last year a Brock Obama just stunned the refugees alone we lead in about a hundred and thirty five thousand refugees\n\nPrimarily from Iraq and Syria and Iran and Afghanistan\nDonald Trump announced two days ago we're going to lower that that the ceiling will be thirty thousand I'll bet your dollars to donuts next year we let in maybe Fifteen to twenty thousand

guy Sam McCann the Constitution Party candidate for governor so that alone right he's pro life that hell right in somebody pro life if you don't want to vote for governor Bruce Rauner right in somebody\nDon't you dare vote for a guy who Mike mad again has paid for and call yourself in Illinois conservative\nAnd shame on any Illinois Republican or conservative who has been propping up\nThis union funded Mike Madigan funded Sam McCann while it gets worse turns out today that Sam can well he's been paying money pain for male to go after\nRepublican members of the Illinois state house a good conservatives like even state rep Tom Morris and see I'm a can or is going after he's jumping into some of these house races\nGoing after what he calls Rona right Republicans\nHe's paying for

that didn't work everybody right away engages in political warfare on Twitter here's the big point I Want to make\nI really have only one big broad point to make here\nHe's been caught a we now know who he is right ... ... ... when we found out about all these bombs earlier this week and now there are Thirteen them at least Thirteen you know we knew it was either\nThirteen you know we knew it was either because all\nDemocrats were targeted all critics of Trump's were targeted\nAll high profile critics of Trump's and so right away everybody knew okay it's it's either a crazy hateful guy on the right person on the right or it's this is a false flag thing it's somebody on the left who's trying to make the right look bad\nAnd right away everybody kinda thought you know could be one though it was it it is one of those probably most likely\n\nAnd I said and some of you said could be either one but how about we wait and see could be either one but how about we wait and see my beef is\nWith so many people on my side\nAnd they're the guilty ones today\nBecause the way too many people on my side on the Republican side on the conservative side not only did they say it could've been false flag this could have been somebody on the left no they told you it was\nThey told you you are a radio listener it was they told you TV viewer it was somebody on the left\nThat's irresponsible\nIt's every bit as irresponsible for somebody on the left who have set a couple of days ago I guarantee you I Know for a fact that this is some hateful Trump supporter nobody knew that two days ago\nNo my problem my beef is anybody you read anybody you listen to on the radio or the TV who told you they knew\nThey knew this was a false flag operation I'm thinking of people like Ann Coulter Geraldo Rivera Candace Owens a Rush Limbaugh Michael Savage Lou Dobbs ...\nAnd a number of others\nAll said this past week\nThey didn't say could have been they didn't say it might have been they said it is this was somebody on the left trying to make conservatives look bad this is somebody on the left trying to get the country to forget about the caravan that was the point that was the whole deal\nWell they were wrong and for anybody to have said that\nAnd I got to be straight cause I can only be straight this is my biggest problem with\nPowders and media on both sides in this case this is my biggest problem with too many in conservative media I think they try to manipulate you they try to fool you how the hell could Rush Limbaugh\nOr Michael Savage or ... or ... or how the hell could they tell you two days ago that this was false flag this was a leftist how could they tell you that they didn't know\nHow could they tell you that they did not know\n\nBut see they tell you they they manipulate yeah\nThey tell you what they think you want to hear 'cause be honest with me most everybody listening to me right now come on now this is honest radio\nFor better or for worse guys this is on his radio\nBe honest with me when this all went down a couple of days ago you all were hoping right most of you were probably hoping if it's going to be somebody on the right or somebody on the left dang I Hope it's somebody on the left dang gave me the false flag I mean when this story broke out in the first night most all of my callers\nWere convinced it was a false flag operation",
