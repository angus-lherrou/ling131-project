on this no chill friday let me go to Jim Jim\nTheir job you know a I'm a non practicing Catholic I'm not a Bible suffer I Am conservative and I am have some faith I don't I'm not a theologian yep but uh you know there's good and evil in the world and if God had control over everything that went on on this planet\nThen we will be fighting wars with ISIS free will be disproportionately pull her abortion and so on and so forth\nSo so so J. lo I said let me just let me just stop you there and then you can continue so you're saying that God do you believe God can't control does not control everything\nNo okay go ahead I'm just ... go ahead continue my mind uh so I Believe that there's good and evil both in the world and if there wasn't on there wouldn't be a fight to overcome evil\nAnd I got is not the has nothing to do it and even my God but God I I ... that has nothing to do evil okay uh that's the way I was raised\nIn cattle dog I did get those guys have a hand in picking who our

eliminate evil altogether than he would have done it a long time ago\nJim thanks for your thoughts thanks for your thoughts so God allowed Obama to be elected but God had a hand in getting Trump elected\n[noise]\nHey ah Mitch you're on my friend\nGot great show Joe thinking man I I Believe God\nElected salt and got also put vowing but God used Obama to set up a strong when he used Obama to push the Christians and\nTo see how bad it could be under Obama salt to get Trump so when he had to show 'em how bad it could be\nHey Mitch and again that's an interesting thought but what about the other half of the country that likes Obama and doesn't like Trump\nWhat what if what\nIf they would say the exact opposite that God wanted Obama elected thank God didn't consider Obama evil\nWell it also deception is in there you know people are just see in a trick\nYeah I Believe that Obama was elected so that\nIt would push people all the way to the other side to get a Trump election in ... in

Republicans for so many years were civil\nJohn McCain and Mitt Romney and George they were all shovel and when they got hit in the nuts they just took it and the Democrats kept saying no we go high we

combine them we pair them together\nNow you can go and purchase beer at a store\nYou can go purchase beer\nAt a craft brewery you could go to a micro brew but what if you would like to create and make your own\nBrew your own beer well\nThat's exactly what we will talk about in this hour home\nBrew one on one home brewing one on one everything you need to know about ruin your own beer\nAnd one everything you need to know about ruin your own beer it has become a huge hobby across the country it is one hundred percent legal and we have ah we continue from avid route company downtown St Petersburg\nAnd today for the next hour we'll be joined by Jeff Taylor the owner counter Myra their master brewer and we will teach you to prove your own\nWe welcome you back lieutenants front and center and as always follow us along cigar Dave dot com you can follow us on social media and we are tweeting pictures and we've got some beautiful beers that are in front of us now many times\nWe see we we've done stories we we've interviewed people who are in the beer industry craft brewing and they have said and I've asked them\nHow did you get into beer is why love drinking it number one and number two I decided to get into home brewing and that's a hobby that really is taken off I think in the last\nFive to ten years and we've seen many craft breweries that have been started by home brewers brewing enthusiasts so today\nWe will teach you everything you need to know about ruin your own beer maybe along the way you say they were going to try this at least once so we will give you everything you need to know so first up caught or minority or correction Jeff Keller the owner proprietor of avid brute company a pleasure to be here on site\nAnd as I look around here I almost want to start brewing something instantly\nThanks for coming days yeah we've got a we've got a small little Bruce system here it's fun to play with well\nI'm looking at some of your beers here that look magnificent we also have some Ron greens but the first thing I'm looking at is a very big shock board and there are eight different steps on creating your own a beer in fact it's called science of brewing\nNow before we even talked about step one which is water multi grain hops yeast adjunct ... I think the first thing is some of the equipment that you need to actually bruso let's talk about if somebody wants to\nBe a home brewer right there's different ways I Know there's Mr beer if I'm not mistaken the other things and you sell everything here but talk about what equipment is needed to brew your own beer\nWell you're basically going to need a big pot um that's we're going to do your matching in that's where you're boiling in um you're also going to need a some for miners in those come in the form of basically a five gallon bucket or six gallon bucket works\nCelebrating cigar October fest fight teaching you how to home brew as we get into the science of brewing today on our cigar October fest editions of the cigar Dave show where avid route company downtown St Pete\nWhere you can buy supplies you can learn how to brewer with Jeff Taylor the owner counter Meyer the master brewer and gentleman I have to say thank you for your later hosted in dressing up really getting into the October fest spirit welcome Dave you guys or this idea of telling you I like the little a feather in the in the ... you guys look like German ...\nJust got a pheasant around across the street [laughter] and actually there's a ...\nNot far from where we are so I write down every there you go now\nBefore we get into we actually talked about what you need what equipment so I'm looking at a board here the science of brewing their eight steps versus the ingredients second is matching grains number three is far judging number four is boiling number\nFive is adding hops number six is showing number seven is pitching east it's\nClose close okay [laughter]\nEight fermentation and bottling and there's nine that's not on there that is\nDrinking and enjoying it that's that's the best one that's the most important on there that's right we'll get into that because I'm looking for a magnificent samples here but first let's talk about the ingredients necessary to make beer everybody knows you need water good water right get bad water no matter what the spirit it's got to start with good water it's got to start with\nGood water water is the the main ingredient in beer so if your water tastes good then you know if you're happy with water then that's your base of your beer\nNow we don't have great water in Florida the scientific known fact it doesn't taste it's not like in Kentucky where you go to the Jack Daniel's distillery in Lynchburg and then there's limestone stream where they get all the water fortunately not we don't have it so what\nWhat do you have to do because of the bad water that that you know we get out of the tap your\nKind of interesting if you look at the history of beer from all over the world like Germany Belgium and I'm Single and you have beer styles that are based around the water profile they have so I mean like England yeah the ... reporters\nGermany at the loggers and the lighter beers and Belgium you just have weird crazy Austin delicious bears but [noise]\nAnd the lighter beers than Belgium you just have weird crazy Austin delicious bears but\nYou can see that that culture has grown around what kind of water so they had and you\nCan now adjusts your water with different mineral salts like calcium and solve faiths and you can adjust your water to whatever you want especially if you have our our water you can use that and build a what is our water a reverse off most it's just a really good filtered actually makes water as pure as possible\nI mean I think we we we think of the old corps ads where you see one of the corps\nOf family members talk you know he's in like a a a jacket he's out by this beautiful stream in the Rocky Mountains that the water is pure I mean I think that's the image that most people have but let's face it water is different everywhere around the world and there's some great beers anywhere you go around the world\nSo that's the first thing is obviously fell through the water and then you can add different compounds do it to get that water so water is the first thing the next thing you need is malted grain what type of multi grain barley\nIs modeled on the one or you can also use weeds and rye and stroke is really here worn for corn and writer\nOr what do you think about or in the number one ingredient and bourbon whiskey but when you think there's also we wishes but we'd beers we've seen so barley is number one we just probably number two yes okay so you have multi graves then hops which give it the ... or bitterness\nBitterness aromas some of the flavors most of the flavors that you're really getting that are um floral in ... coming from the from the ... of ... east\nEast is really interesting as well because there's so many varieties of it and from all over the world and you can have used that give you free flavors and nice they could use spicy flavors and nice that are completely neutral so you can get all sorts of different flavors from East that are from all over the world [noise]\nAll right and then the last thing adjunct ... which are\nStuff like dry fruits I'm mango mango yeah absolutely address all sorts of different things that you can put into the beer um cinnamon number I was gonna say that's what I mean you can absolutely so I mean it's just the the additional Z whatever whatever little things you want to add to it and coriander for\nThose aren't necessary though I mean like a traditional German beer as it's defined only\nHas grain hops water and nice as\nWell and I think there's you have beer purists that say I can't have anything but if you take a look at the changing\nTastes and demographics of people who consume beer I think people want variety they want new things they there's they're not concerned with well I've got to have exactly the way they did it in Bavaria and Eighteen Seventy five no they want something that's going to be enjoyable and taste good\nAnd I think if you take a look I was the shipyard brewing or last week we we we did a tour up in in Portland Maine and their number one beer is their pumpkins a ale and it's a great beer flies\nOff the shelves tastes incredible so there is no right there's no wrong at that time of the year for pumpkin beer exactly right we're seeing that now and also the October fest beers right yeah it was ... type of beer or good All right so the\nThe now that we've got our our ingredients water the multi grain hops yeast the adjunct ingredients next comes ... of the grains what is measuring\nSo now she has basically mixing the cracked grain with water and what that does is with temperature you can activate the enzymes natural within the grains to consume the starches and convert them into sugars and the sugars is what you need to make alcohol that's where the east is going to eat now that so that's the boiling process\nOr know that that's just the matching social system actually just basically take cold water or hot water it's about a hundred and forty two two hundred and fifty nine degrees\nThe hot water along with the multi ... whether it's wheat or whether it's barley mhm and then you just allow them to just sit\nSit for about an hour sometimes a little longer there's also other profiles for a matching like step matching or the auction where you take some out now what a step measure step matching is where you started a lower temperature\nAnd then raise it up and then raise it up again and that gets you different profiles 'cause there's different enzymes that are active throughout the entire matching and the enzymes converts\nThe starts to sugar which gives you the sweetness oh I Know that when I Believe that gives you the food for the east to convert to al ... got ya okay so you normally steep grains between a hundred and forty two to a hundred and fifty nine degrees\nAnd the different temperatures dictate whether the beer is going to be Crispin light and dry like a dry line or a little more body like a Guinness stout has that that full body flavor\nHire the temperature more more body absolutely gotcha lord of the damage agree makes a big if those are really ... how much of a difference it it it's like if you try to bring\nThe same year twice and you are a couple of degrees off it will be very dramatically different so people that are home brewers that's why you need a thermometer because you ... preferably a digital from I Would say probably I actually prefer the alcohol glass so there's really oh yeah I mean it's they're they're accurate\nAll right now all the grease we talked about except for water but multi grain hops yeast the giants\nAs well as the equipment to home brew you sell here at ... and you will help guide people we teach classes I teach classes\nI better get to one of these classes to them and I want to hear that well I Know one thing I'm going to put in there I Want to put in I Want to try something taking some of the jak I've got some Jack Daniels barrel staged\nMaybe finishing it off so we'll talk about that were that route company in downtown St Petersburg Florida with Jeff Keller the owner and master brewer counter Meyer we have learned that the ingredients you need\nAnd how to mash brains when we come back we'll talk about splurging boiling an adding the hops science of brewing home brewing one on one today on cigar October fest

many of the high end Dominican cigars ... squares that flavor very velvety I'm a pilot ... Ecuadorian ... rap or the ... mark has a very Cuban asked all the way around from flavor\nAnd packaging with an earthy Sumatra rapper ... is a is a bold well balanced medium bodied and spicy cigar the burqa ghost gold little different than the regular circuit goes more flavor a little bit bolder featuring an Ecuadorian about a rapper\nBoiling does a couple of things that sanitize it it evaporates things that you don't actually once in a jazz\nJust useful things just things you're not actually going to need or just evaporate and also evaporates water so condensed as it so you have a stronger sugar solution got stronger war yes gotcha also what it does is as you add hops throughout the boil the heat and the temperature actually\nChanged the hops into more bettering so long that you have the hops in the boil the more better they become the last time you have more flavor you have retained because as you boil the longer you're going to basically going to cook away all the flavors and aromas so you put in hops out the entire process to get different flavors of Rome was ...\nSo that boiling step for and then adding the hops step five but let's talk about boiling ... uh there's one temperature for boiling we know that that everything boils at the only one temperature how long do you boil for\nRoughly an hour sometimes up to three hours\nNow I've lived up to eight hours at one point\nNow you talked about being a ... it's all about time and temperature will temperature you know boiling that that's a constant with time how does that change an hour as a general um\nLength for a boil for for typical veteran beer if you do it for eight hours how does that differ we did that for a little bit of fun we made a like a Fifteen Percent grand crew which was a lot of fun so we broil the for really long time to get the sugar is really high so you want to the longer you boil the higher the sugars\nYes 'cause you're evaporating the water you know they have like using a sauce gotcha okay interesting show but normally an hour on average okay so step for is the boiling so as\nLong as you're ... you're you're making it more sweet and you're you're making it a changing the color as well saying more rich\nAnd I'll tell you that is when I I've sampled that that's unbelievable when it comes out and it's nice and warm that's great for a sore throat by the way oh yeah it tastes great I mean it's really\nIt's got really cool taste and and uh most people would say you know I'm happy right here but there's more so let me recap here we start with water multi grain whether it's wheat whether it is barley hops yeast adjunct adjunct could be a little mango could be pumpkin could be should have been other spices\nStep to smash into the grains we want a steep the grains in hot water between a hundred and forty two degrees to a hundred and fifty nine degrees the higher the temperature the I think you said the higher the temperature the for\nThat it's uh it can become correct okay now number three is ... which is reaching the sugars out of the grains creates the work we want to get rid of the spent grain and now we want to have that that water and those sugars great the war within boil the war which is step for\nAnd it concentrates the sugar sterilize as it gets rid of anything that\nWe don't really want in their pulls the bitterness out and then five is adding the hops now before we talk about adding hops let's talk about exactly what hops are member many people say\nIt is a term for beer flavor your taste happy it's a it's not very happy that really relates to the when you say a hobby to me the amount of spicy and is basically or\nBitterness if you will more bitterness I think kind of bitterness unit so I think that would be on the power is that correct correct
