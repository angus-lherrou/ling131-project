comes to denuclearization\nAnd I ... I think these are overlooked and Ignatius point some out North Korea agreed to accept internal inspectors to monitor destruction of one of its test sites that's good\nUh that's a first step toward bigger and broader inspection North Korea also agreed in principle to dismantle\nIts main nuclear weapons facility at Yongbyon\nA again Ignatius points out the details on that are fuzzy though I'm ... it it all its offer is all conditioned on reciprocal us corresponding measures whatever that means\nA well again my palm pay or secretary of state put out a potential timetable this week by completion of denuclearization by twenty Twenty one that's pretty optimistic\nBut as Ignatius says it provides a baseline for us the United states to protest if North Korea\nFor us the United states to protest if North Korea\nDaily Delhi's around\n[noise] um it's it's interesting what's going on or North Korea wants a formal declaration of the end of the state of war are unclear or what that will look like a Trump\nAnd Kim Jong loan I mean they continue to flatter each other and stroke each other and surely for each other I\nI I mean I don't put a lot of stock in to that but\nIt it it's it's different and it's better than having them fight with each other and even as a man of the left David Ignatius says today\nEmerging signs of day talent between the Koreas is very exciting Kim Jong moon also this week said he wants a second meeting with Trump\n\nThis week's summit between north and South Korea also advanced Kim's goal of economic modernization ah North Korea is a country that desperately needs to come in out of the dark ages\nThey they made a proposed bid north and South Korea did a joint north south Olympics in twenty thirty two\nThat's pretty cool to do that or would be impossible without upgrading modernizing North Korea over the next decade\nSo stuff's happening State Department's going to a ... it was going to go back to North Korea um keep the talks going show show ... what's the downside of all of this\nWell as David Ignatius points out there are still way more questions than answers\nUm\nYou can't trust or believe anything North Korea says or does\nA\nWhat's behind what Kim is doing I I think that's a concern um what is his motivation what's he after what she up to\nThe U.S and Japan a need to keep a close eye on what's going on right now when it comes to North Korea or is there are huge problems\nBut I come back to this\nYeah I I criticize a lot of what Trump's Don domestically\nBut I Do believe on the world stage is della custody his unpredictability the fact that he you know can be a jerk\nWell there are a lot of bad dudes in a lot of jerks and the world Kim Jong is one of them\nAnd I I I really think that you know you got to be a jerk\nTo understand
