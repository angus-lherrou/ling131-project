at this point that any Republican and Democrat says is a hundred and ten percent political and in Andy's not truthful\n\nAnd the biggest deal this week the only issue this week the the reason that we have this week is because of the FBI investigation and you and me and everybody around us we don't know what the FBI is doing\nWe shouldn't know what the FBI is doing\nLet it play out I Know many didn't want to play out let it play out I Hope that it plays out and I hope that it ah it simply reaffirms what a wonderful pick that Brett Kavanaugh yes\nBut no a handle this week differently go about your lives and let's wait let's wait to see what the FBI does and stay away\nFrom all of the the the twins are rumors and the Facebook rumors and the Fox news or the CNN rumors none of them know\nTrump spoke to it today a again he was kinda all over the map give me ... number three\nI think the FBI should do what they have to do to get to the answer at the same time just so we all understand\nThis is our seventh investigations of a man who has really you know you look at his life until this happened what a what a change he's gone through what his family's gone through\nThe me for deaf\nI Want the FBI and this is now their seventh investigation so it's not like the you know just starting a I Want them to do a very comprehensive\nInvestigations whatever\nThat means according to the senators\nHe wants a comprehensive investigation but then Trump said this demean number five\nWas that being said I'd like to go quickly and the reason I'd like to go quickly very simple so simple because it's unfair to him at this point\nSo you figure\nYou figure where we're at let me go to Jeff Jeff\n... are you doing I'm you know what I'm going to start a hash tag ... leave it's called the\nTen trash bags by ten trash bags for each of the ten\nDemocratic senators who slandered judge Kavanaugh last week\nThe point here with the FBI no matter what the FBI I doubt whether it's seven days or seven years\nThey're not going to be happy with it that try to overturn it for a new investigation mode investigated ... matter what happens they are going to say no that's not good enough they're moving the goalposts all games let's have a vote and be done\nOr thanks Jeff let's not get worked up about it this week that's my vice let me go to Eddie hey Eddie you're on with Joe Walsh\nShow thanks for taking my call I was going to give you I tried to get in on friday and wasn't able to get through uh the fact that they allowed to go another step\nIs just so disappointing um I I I think we're going to do I think it's going to go through this week but I don't think Kavanaugh it's going to be confirmed everybody has made their mind up already this is all just a big show and such but I I completely agree with you\nI'm staying out of it I'm not turn it into three but it's going to be so bad 'cause I really believe he's not going to get on\nAnd it's just a shame and I I watched what our senator from Illinois I get to that man yeah\nAnd and I want to move out of the bay so disgusted by Senator Durbin and it was appalling appalling what he did\nAnd you know Eddie I agree don't move out of Illinois because the Durban do move out of Illinois because of the taxes that's much better reason look don't I I I agree with that though everybody um don't let this week the last week there's nothing more\nThat we can do and as far as the Democrats go guys\nThey don't matter here please know that I Want to say this again the FBI's gotta week this week\nAnd they're going to come back and it's going to we're either going to be where we were at the end of last week they're just going to confirm what the Senate told us or there might be something new and if we're where we are at the end of last week all the Republicans are going to vote for Kevin Oh we do not need a Democrat vote\nThe Democrats\nNo longer matter in this process if the FBI just confirmed what we know we don't need them if the FBI finds out that Brett Kavanaugh has been lying as I said\nAnd I hope and pray that that's not going to be the case but if we find out he's been line he doesn't deserve to

carried by the color guard on the field we've used such displays from time to time in the past\nWhen other pre game elements take up a significant portion of the field the Green Bay Packers announced
