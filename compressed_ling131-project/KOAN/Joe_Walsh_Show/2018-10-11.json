behavior\nAnd I will say this again I've said this a whole bunch\nBoth sides have their nut jobs both sides have their extremes both sides have they're bad people but there is a difference\nThe left in this country\nGenerally gets more violent the less politically the left in this country they riot they loop they harass they get violent much more than the right did I I'll tell you what those eight years that Iraq Obama was president\nOr the two years when the Democrats had the Senate the house in Obama I Do not remember man I Do not remember people on the right\nOr a harassing politicians I don't remember people on the right\nGetting in the faces of politicians I don't remember people on the right getting violent with politicians I don't remember people on the right following a a Democrat United States senator and his wife into a restaurant and harassing them to the point that they had to leave\nThat restaurant it doesn't happen on the right\n\nNot even close to the degree that it happens on the left\nI think that's the truth\nAnd if you don't like that that means you can't handle the truth you remember a couple of weeks ago\nA Ted Cruz and his wife in Washington DC uh they're having a quiet dinner\nThey walked in to a nice upscale Italian Restaurant\nIn Washington DC Ted Cruz and his wife did you remember what happened you remember what happened or a group of sour left protestors a group of about eight of them followed Ted Cruz into that restaurant Ted Cruz and his wife\nChanting at him yelling at him Ted Cruz and his wife sat down at their table in the restaurant to have dinner and this group of protesters walked right\nAnd they got in the face of the United states senator and his wife and they harassed the United states senator and his wife at a private establishment at a restaurant to the point where that United States senator and his wife had to get up and leave the restaurant\nYou remember that now they should have been arrested\nBut you remember that will last night on CNN\nOr a guy named Matt Louis He's a uh he's generally on our side he's a libertarian slash conservative or he was on the Don lemon show I Know all I Know you don't

to four to one eighty seven seven eight six six to four to one eight seven seven [noise]\nIt's a\nIt's really a pretty incredible thing\nAnd nothing surprises me nothing the left says surprises me but it is an incredible thing I mean this is a guy who's got his own show on CNN Hindi goes on his own show on CNN last night Andy says it's perfectly legal\nFor protesters to walk into a restaurant and protest\nThey got that right the constitution gives them that right to walk into my business and do their stuff\nAgain I Want to believe I Want to hope I want to pray\nThat most people listening to me right now I understand the difference Ted Cruz and his wife are going out to dinner in Washington DC\nOr you get wind of the fact that Ted Cruz and his wife are going out to dinner at a certain restaurant and Washington DC so the crazies on the left\nThey put together a group of eight to nine people and they make some signs and they stand outside that restaurant and they protest Ted Cruz and here comes Ted Cruz and his wife\nThe protestors are out there on the sidewalk chant teen boo and Brett Kavanaugh vote against Brett Kavanaugh Ted Cruz and his wife walk into the restaurant\nAnd they have their dinner and the protesters in America right they stay outside they got a right to protest until the cows come home\nBut they don't have a right in fact they're breaking the law if they enter that restaurant\nWith their signs and they're yelling and screaming and harassed Ted Cruz and his wife if they do that they ought to be arrested they should have been arrested\nThere's a difference\nAnd I guess what I'm saying right now is we're in unchartered territory because the left in America either doesn't understand or won't accept the difference\nAnd by the way I think it's both because many people in the left they don't understand America they don't understand our constitution they don't understand our bill of rights\n\nLet me go to Chuck Chuck\n[noise] hello Hi ...\nHi

our side are sides gotta fight back in\nPointing the finger at Senator Ted Cruz I Love you senator\nBut when those people harassed you inside that restaurant a couple of weeks ago Senator Ted Cruz should have called the manager over and said call the police their trespassing inside your restaurant the police should have been called and they should have been arrested Ted Cruz should know left but he and his wife left\nUm let me go to a win hey Owen\nHey Joel and Joel um\nI used to work a door at the bar go through college at sixty three years old yeah\nWhen I when I was I'm going through college back in the ... I worked at a couple of bars if anybody ever came and got a problem like that shot so because they'd be rough but I don't know where the the restaurant owner was\nBut it's really up to the manager of that restaurant to come in and make sure that these people are arrested for your own disturbing the peace and and it's it's ridiculous the battle I remember\nIt at all when you said that perfectly my friend he's a freaking more up again I I'm I'm not going to watch but he ought to go on a show tonight and he ought to apologize she ought to go on the show Tonight Show tonight and correct himself on national TV last night Don Lemon\nTold every stupid left in the country that it's perfectly okay it's legal to walk into restaurants and harassed customers that's what he said\nHey Steve you're on with Joe\nAnd Joe first time caller long time listeners an honor to talk to your buddy thank\nYou brother\nA job got a question for you you know I'm Free speech right there are limitations on free speech yard I've been forced through law such as not being able to\nYell fire in a crowded theater right yup so why you know there'll be limitations on the free speech you know of assembly and is this something that the Congress would have to actually write a law employees know\nHDTV let me stop you man you're spot on I mean think about her right now is Ted Cruz and his wife go into a restaurant and eight or nine protesters follow him into the restaurant and harassed him you don't need a new law right they've already broken the law their trespassing\nYou know the problem Steve is nobody called the police and so crews and his wife left\nBut yeah hey thank you brother yeah no need for a new law [laughter] there's a law and the bucks\nYou know that I Know you know that there's a lot of folks if I don't want a restaurant if I got a restaurant you know nobody can just caught me inside my restaurant and protest I'm calling the tops and you're getting your ass or did\n\nThe problem is we're not fighting back against this crap\n\nAnd I would tell every business owner listening to me politician listening to me\nThey crossed that line\nThey crossed that free speech line they crossed that freedom of assembly line\nMail them call the police\n\nThis will continue to get increasingly dangerous we got three to four weeks to go before the selection don't know what's going to happen this election and then there's going to be a walk his presidential election two years later this country is divided\nAh we're not United maybe we're divided and we're going to get more divided by the day the week the month a year\nYou'd better ... um [noise]\n\n[noise]\nIt's time to check the more freedom voicemail with you're saying about John Wayne [noise]\nHave I I'm Joe [noise] so it\nIs the first time I write in your station and all I Want to say is you need to lighten the American public just like ...

they have done this sixteen months ago or Fifteen months ago or twelve months ago gosh even a month ago\nBut now\nNow a couple weeks after they signed a spending bill that didn't include any funding for the wall that are dying\n\nNow now you come out a couple of weeks later and you tell your voters who are upset\nYou're going to introduce legislation to fund the whole wall I don't believe you see that's it I don't I don't believe that the Republicans by the way\n\nI I don't get that angry at me I I I don't believe Trump Trump's had opportunity after opportunity after opportunity to secure to demand and secure funding for his wall or any hadn't gotten he hadn't done it he and demand that he hadn't secured it\nShow it look it's not just on the Republicans that we have not be gun building the wall yet that's not just on Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan and the Republicans\nThat's on Trump to\n... and I know a lot of Trump supporters have a hard time wrapping their arms around that because they don't believe we can say anything negative are critical about the president well yeah I I'm an American I can say anything negative or critical about anybody and I get I understand because I served in Congress I Know\nThat most of the Republicans in Congress don't want the war\nNow that's just the fact\nI understand that's what Trump's up against a but still Trump hasn't made any effort right most Republicans in Congress you need to know this if you don't already know it most Republicans in the house and most Republicans in the Senate do not want\nThe wall they don't want it at all\nSo when Kevin McCarthy comes out today and says they're going to introduce legislation\nToday and says they're gonna introduce legislation to fund the whole wall I don't believe them that's that's where I'm at I don't believe him they've had the opportunity after opportunity to do it\nAnd they haven't they've they've uh\nThey've never passed a stand alone bill to fund the ... fund the wall\nThey've past four or five temporary ... or a stopgap spending bills short term spending bills that did not include any money for the wall\nThe one they passed a couple of weeks ago that will fund the government through December seventh I Believe there's no money none whatsoever in that bill for the wall\n\nSo McCarthy comes out today\nAnd says we're gonna do it do you believe him\nShe I I think I I really do believe the Republicans\n\nAnd they convince Trump to do this they wanted to kick this issue down the road they want to kick this issue passed the midterms\nIn fact that's what they said that's what they said\nWe'll deal with it after the midterms that if if you really believed in something if you really want to do something why would you keep kicking the can down the road\nIf that's what you really want it\nSo eight five five six for two fifty six hundred I don't buy it\nI don't buy it I I think maybe I here's what I think I I think it's a way maybe to try to get Republican voters\nExcited about something so they'll come out and vote\nI think that the Republicans know that\nThe other side is still a little bit more uh enthusiastic than Republicans are\n\nSo McCarthy puts that out this morning a we're going to we're going to get the wall funded we're going to introduce legislation to get the wall funded\n\nAnd they do that so that you and I will say oh hey Joel arch awesome look those Republicans man we're finally going to get the money for a while we're finally going to get this wall built\n\nEight five five six for two fifty six hundred I'm Sorry guys I'm I'm not buying it don't want to be a Debbie Downer I don't want you to think I'm a Debbie Downer but I'm not buying it I'm not after Twenty one months\nNot after Twenty one months of having the Republicans all of them the Republicans in Congress and the president of the United states\nOr a waste opportunity after opportunity after opportunity\nTo build the wall to begin building the wall after all of that\nBut let's just say I I'm just I'm not buying it like like I told you a while back um the walls more important to me than than than Trump and I I'm no longer going to listen to Trump Telhami Telhami he's going to build the wall I'm gonna wait\nTo see if the wall gets built that's what I'm going to do from now on that's where I'm at and and I suggest that's where you should be

conservatives\nAnd if you're a conservative radio talk show host\nWell you've had to make a decision are you going to be straight with your listeners\nAre you going to tell them that the evidence is clear the data is clear Democrats are fired up their voting at a much higher percentage than Republicans have been voting in every ... special election and in every primary election students since

is to listen to what he said\nUh Eric Holder was at a campaign event in Georgia a yesterday talking to a room full of Democrats not now look we had so many Republicans and conservatives who were bothered by what Hillary Clinton said yesterday\nWhen Hillary Clinton said or the days of being civil are over now I wouldn't bother by what she said I I I understood it or they're they're done a Trump's not a civil guy or the Democrats have figured it out uh\nAbout a civil guy or the Democrats have figured it out a Trump is on civil a Trump kicked their butts show the Democrats are thinking ... uh we need in on civil guy or gal to beat him that's all they're doing right now Eric Holder in a room full of Democrats\nPretty much a put out the same message we're no longer getting to be nice

of our president what part of the future that we can read more viscous so what's going on\nBut again you can listen to Fox News and other conservative talk radio and\nAnd get angry about this and and be bothered by what Hillary said\nOr what Eric Holder said to me that's pretty stupid what's going on what's going on with the Democrats right now see I Want to know what's going on with the Democrats so I can beat them so I can defeat them well here's what's going on right so right now I'm speaking to every Republican and conservative who\nIs listening to me you're ready this is what fighting back\nLooks like\nI I mean Donald Trump comes out of the scene three years ago and he fights Andy punches any punches any punches everyday Eric Holder said yesterday that's nothing compared to things that Trump said Donald\nTrump has been fighting against the\nDemocrats for three years and that's why he's in the White House the Democrats are fighting back that's all the Democrats are fighting back look\nThe Democrats understand that Donald Trump is in that show be anyone\nAnd by the way both of those things are true Donald Trump isn't that she'll be anti did win\nAnd I don't know when I hear Hillary and I hear all these other Democrats and I hear Eric Holder yesterday a at a campaign event\nTo me it's just telling me that's what Eric Holder said Eric Holder pretty much said you know what we need an SOB to beat that there'll be that's all what's the big deal about that why get bothered about that the Democrats have wised up\n\nA nice guy isn't going to be Trump a nice lady is not going to be Trump that's what Eric Holder said and as despicable as Hitler Clinton is that what Hillary said yesterday when she said we're done being civil\n\nNow the Democrats have realized they needed a mess so be to try to beat our SOB that should not surprise anybody on our side\n\nAnd I I Would just argue I put it in front of you again everybody\n\nThere is no better motivation in the world than anger\n\nAnd the Democrats habits\nAnd when Eric Holder said what he said and Hillary Clinton said what she said forget about what they said look at the reaction every Democrat said hell yeah\nWhen they go low man we kick them when they go low we punch him Democrats\nAre fired up make a make no mistake about it let me go to Chris Chris\nWell eight Joe first of all thanks for taking my call that her and I walked away from the Democratic party and if any Democrat tries to kick me I happened to be going to take my conceal carry classes we can I say bring it on but in in regards to the door right being\nUpset about what Hillary and Mr holder said over the last couple of days yes it is what I'm gauging from this isn't so much that they're anybody's irate but they do take some ... with the fact that they're\nThat they're saying that uh they they're somehow they previously somehow being classy about the situation which they clearly have it I've never seen anybody on the right encourage us to go out and harass people in public places are abused people which they've been doing for an extended period of time so all of a sudden they're saying oh we're going to do this right well\nYou haven't done it right up to this point so forgive me for not buying or be asked\nNo no and Chris I'm not saying that they've been saints before this all I'm saying this Trump is no saint Trump is now of course now Trump's Trump's not a civil guy he isn't that she'll be\nAnd I just why voted for exactly and all I'm saying is the Democrats have reached that realization that they really need in that she'll be to even try to compete with them and and and\nAnd and that's absolutely the truth but they when they tried to say that they've been there trying to pass themselves off as having previously

hope there's a giant red wall that will hold in this blue wave but Matt here's the way I look at it I don't want to lose so I'm expecting there to be a blue wave I don't want to dismiss it I'm expecting that the Democrats are going to be fired up\nI I I'm assuming they are\nUh it's like when you're a candidate you assume you're ten Fifteen twenty points down so that you run hard through the finish line I Want every Republican and every conservative to come out and vote\nAnd knowing and believing that the Democrats are coming out and vote and and get a vote in huge numbers maybe that will get us fired up to do the same it should be easy but we got to get our folks out the data so far since the whole Kavanaugh saying\nHow to summarize it it's fired Republicans up ended also fire Democrats up its fire both bases up\nShow what you were seen is you're seen especially in the Senate most people believe the Kavanaugh saying we'll help the Republicans keep the United States Senate and may help the Democrats take control of the house because the base that Kavanaugh saying\nFired up the Republican base and most of these critical Senate races are in red states where you got a lot of Republican base voters so you're seen states like North Dakota and Tennessee\nAnd Indiana are beginning to come home Republicans in base voters begin to come out\nThat's a good thing now the flip up that is you're seen in a lot of ... in a lot of house races especially house races in the suburbs you're seeing that seemed to more blue because you've seen a lot of women\nOr move away from Trump since the Kavanaugh sang let me go to mark hey mark\nI'm good man\nI'm a I think one thing that that I'm fifty three years old and I I never uh\nAnd I'm a pilot and I've never seen a president after
