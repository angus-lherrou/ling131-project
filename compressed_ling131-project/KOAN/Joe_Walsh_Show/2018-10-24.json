you I'm\nDon't misunderstand me [laughter] yeah right like that's going to work I think we make it too easy for people to register to vote in this country and I think we make it too easy for people to vote\nI you know what I think people got to have some skin and again I think people got to show a little bit of damn effort to go vote to get themselves registered to vote and then devote\nI fear I worry I got a dream I got a dream that we're going to get to a point in this country where you don't have to leave your house on election day\nPeople are going to show up at your door with a ballot with the pizza with some Coca Cola or some beer you don't have to get off of your couch and you'll be able to vote we make it so damn easy\nBut I just think we're diminishing the importance of election day all of this early voting and we're making it earlier and earlier and earlier the game's not over the debates not over\nThe campaign isn't over how about we all wait till election day let me go to my friend your friend Sean from ...\nJoe I was I got in a car I was listening to talk and I and I kept waiting for you to say it this is for the infrastructure of corruption isn't about citizens\nIn each city could care less about citizen you got to remember this this government is the largest employer it's the largest creditor the largest debtor there's a lot of people go regents the government\nAnd they need time to get out and and not only that you have to workers you know what Chicago's like that's the only time these guys to work they got to get all the old people out driving my car was like oh for the for the in Brussels and they tell him which buttons to push\nIt just to sustain it to grow the corruption within government so you're motivating who exactly you're motivating the people that have something to gain so that's why I think it's over it's to me to me\n... it's the few of us that they listen to the judge shows like the Joe Walsh show that get involved and older the issue is the others are voting for their own increases yeah their own pockets yeah\nHey Sean great stuff man thank you and thank you for a ... a a sitting in this chair last week yeah

they\nCount the smell aren't that many counting than when\nThere are no no no no they're not supposed to be I Believe and I could have this wrong I Believe\nThey are the first votes counted ah when the polls closed on election night that's the way it's supposed\nTo say I looked up well yeah I Know I Hope they're said nobody's looking at them because I really don't feel comfortable with that and

went to the clerk's office they said no you're not registered here so I had to go up to the rock island county clerks outlets\nAnd then they said well you're going to you but we didn't change your

I think let me just let me just stop you there and then you can continue so you're saying that God do you believe God can't control does not control everything\nNo okay go ahead I'm just why not go ahead continue my mind\nUh so I Believe that there's good and evil both in the world and if there wasn't there wouldn't be a fight to overcome evil and God is not the has had nothing to do it and even my God but God I I was yeah that has nothing to do is evil okay uh that's the way I was raised\nIn ... a guy that did get those guys have a hand in picking who our president is\nUh the outcomes is that we have godly people that plus we have people that\nI'm a death act on behalf of our godly word that have respect for values for the proper values for civility and so forth built Christian values showed that ... failure\nSo the godly people help get Trump elected\nExactly did and but they they even I Would I Would I Would contend that right out from the get the the the uh the people that are are um evil in my mind\nBut the the uh the people that are are um evil in my mind\nThe ones that support abortion the ones that support on civil society that support a mob action as they are today and uh and and um [noise] I don't conduct himself in a civil way and a godly way a elected in ...\nOkay so how do you mean the newly elected to tell her mother let let let let me stop you show and again I I I won't\nAgain I I Want to hear people's opinions so I'm not going to fight with anybody I missed one just one final question Jim so mhm in your mind God allowed the uh on godly people to elect Obama guide allowed that to happen\n[noise] book God could strike evil out completely if God had the force to eliminate evil altogether that he would have done it a long time ago\nJim thanks for your thoughts thanks for your thoughts so God allowed Obama to be elected\nBut God had a hand in getting Trump elected\n...\nHey uh Mitch you're on my friend\nA great show you all think man I I Believe\nGod elected Trump and got also put allowing what God used Obama to set up a Trump when he used Obama to push the Christians\nAnd to see how bad it could be under Obama salt to get Trump to when he had to show them how bad it couldn't be\nHey Mitch again that's an interesting thought but what about the other half of the country that likes to Obama and doesn't like Trump\nWhat what if what\nIf they would say the exact opposite that God wanted Obama elected in God didn't consider Obama evil\nWell it also deception isn't there you know people are just see in a trick\nYeah I Believe that Obama was elected so that it would push people all the way to the other side to get a Trump election in ... in your eyes back you know get people back in line to get their country back in line\nAnd in your eyes Mitch God had their hand in both Obama and Trump\nOh yes definitely thank you for calling\nI I I I Apologize\nIf this is a too heavy of a question for no chill friday I just have not been able to sort through it all day and I'd love to get your take on this\nUm\nI I don't believe Trump is ... ... you know you know how I feel I I I really don't believe he's very good guy I
