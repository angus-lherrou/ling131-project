what I just did\nTalking to my producer earlier today the big story was how much Native American does Elizabeth Warren having her it's what everybody's talking about so we got to talk about it\nAnd so I went into Tonight Show figuring my God that's what all the conservative talk radio talking about how much of a Pocahontas is Elizabeth Warren and what's Trump have to say about it because he's always got something goofy to say about it but I just decided about a half hour ago I got the stomach to talk about it\nIt's stupid and it's unimportant I I mean here we are and and I guess the the the poetry right the symmetry was beautiful because this afternoon before I went on the air we found out that for this past fiscal year\nThat just ended September thirtieth\nUh we've hit the highest federal budget deficit\nThat we've had in six years seven hundred and eighty billion dollar deficit this past fiscal year and we're on our way to a one point one trillion dollar budget deficit next

Bush before him than Bill Clinton before George W. Bush then George W. Bush before Bill Clinton American presidents going all the way back man they bend over in bend over and bend over so as not to offend\nThe Saudis for political reasons for business reasons so don't don't tell me Trump's any different here he is doing the same damn thing Obama did\nBending over what the Saudi Arabia has done here is despicable but again this is true this is this is a part of what Islam is this is Islam isn't right this is a brutal brutal\nOr a or a regime it dictatorial regime\nOr Saudi Arabia leads the planet in beheadings every year okay what they did the show we hear they do all the time you don't have freedom in Saudi Arabia you can't speak up in Saudi Arabia it ... this is right this is just one more\nA Islamic one\nCountry that is living in the seventh century it's not our job to change him it's not our job to reform them but beyond that strike be honest a Trump Obama Bush all of 'em just be honest right you're ignoring what Saudi Arabia has done\nA purely for business reasons just be honest about that\nThat's all let me go to Rick hey Rick you're on with Joe\n...

for them you know I've been reading a lot of our colds I hadn't in these midterm elections like\nLike Democrats have a Latino problem and they're reading about this\nLatino problem heading into this mid term elections see a Democrats have\nThe black vote vote locked up Ninety percent of blacks vote for Democrats the Democrats this election will have an a female vote locked up they've got the young vote locked up\nUm but they're struggling with the a team no vote\n'em\nI expect that turn out for the twenty teen election overall is going to be higher than any other mid term 'cause enthusiasm on the Democrats' side is way way up and I think enthusiasm on our side is growing as well but a Latino voters\nAre lagging behind woefully behind other groups when it comes to interest in the twenty Eighteen campaign that is an enthusiasm gap\nThat could really make the difference in a number of house races Latino make up about twenty percent of the population in more than a dozen districts that the Democrats are trying to take\nA more than half of the twenty three seats the Democrats need to flip to take back the house\nA but a study after study shows that um Latino as\nAre much less likely to vote than white and black voters two thirds of white voters surveyed said they are almost certain to vote sixty one percent of black said they're almost certain to vote but only fifty five percent of Latino said they are almost certain to vote\n\nThat could make a real difference because Latino Z vote Democrat not like blacks vote Democrat and oh by the way Democrats are also concerned or because\nThey just figure that a\nBlight blacks they could get eighty to Ninety percent of Latinos to vote Democrat\nUm\nYou know Trump is\nIs such a racist they say and he's so bigoted and he's so bad I'm immigration and he's deporting illegals and the Democrats just figured that all of these\nOf Trump or would lead to certainly more enthusiasm among Latinos but also a higher percentage of Latino voting for Trump\n\nBut you know what's really interesting and Democrats don't get this and so many people in in the country\nForget about this\nYou know when you when you poll the\nYou know when you when you poll the American people I'm a new illegals\nOn people coming into this country illegally\nDo you know that most Latinos\nWho are in this country legally legally ah

in\nIn in the political media this morning is Elizabeth Warren had her had a DNA test\nAnd son of a gun and she's got some Native American blood in her how much well conservative media is making fun of her because according to conservative media she's got as much a Indian blood in her as\nBasically anybody listening to me right now I'm a the the rest of the media the left wing media thinks it's a really big deal and they asked Trump about it this morning 'cause you remember back in July Trump promised that he would donate a million dollars to the charity of Elizabeth Warren's choice\nIf she took a DNA test and prove that she had Native American blood\nAnd this morning Trump denied it said no I never said that such a thing so now we're going back and forth all day which is the issue that everybody's talking about on conservative talk radio it will be one of the big issues that Fox News will talk about tonight\nI got to be honest with you I don't give a damn about it I don't give a damn about it who cares and the beauty is yes\nBought it who cares and the beauty is this the deficit this past fiscal year\nRose to the highest level it has been since twenty twelve seven hundred and eighty billion dollar deficit\nFederal budget deficit in fiscal year twenty Eighteen is expected to to get up to one point one trillion dollar deficit next year it's on its way up\nHere we go again Tea Party here we go again all you grassroots conservatives who were so animated and energized by the way we were bankrupting future generations eight nine years ago when Obama was president but\nWe're still bankrupting future generations right now when Donald Trump is president and none of you Tea Party folk and none of you grassroots conservatives dog going to want to talk about the budget deficit today more than silly me\nI uh I just think that's a hell of a lot more important than whether Elizabeth Warren a is a a a related to Pocahontas\nAnd I would argue that a country that's really wrapped up in Trump and Elizabeth Warren and Pocahontas or is a country that does not have its grass on the issues that really matter\nAnd I would argue you know silly me I haven't been doing this radio thing that long only a few years so silly me I really don't know what I'm Talking about you know you got guys who'd been doing conservative talk radio for twenty Thirty years I Know there are a hell of a lot smarter than I Am so I don't know what I Know but I I I'm going to gas\nThat a country full of people\nA vet that spends its time\nTalking about Elizabeth Warren's a Native American ancestry\nAnd whether Trump is going to donate a million dollars to her charity of choice right these is a country that will continue to bankrupt future generations because I Would argue it's a country that's not serious\nAnd I'm not going to do it I'm not going to be a part of that\nI'm not going to be a part of that I ... you tune into me every day to find out I guess\nWhat I think matters I don't know why you tune in to me but I Would think you tune into this radio show 'cause you've had a long day you been working your ass off all day unlike me you don't have to pay attention to politics twenty four hours every day right you got more important things to do so you turned on me for a couple of hours Joe tell me what's important to\nTell me what matters and you know what ... with Warren being Pocahontas doesn't matter how much what her DNA results said don't matter and what Trump says about her does it matter none of that stuff matters what matters is we're bankrupt in our kids ... and we're doing it now at an increasing rate and what public things are to blame\nNot Nancy Pelosi not Chuck Schumer map or rock Obama you know who's to blame for the deficits right now\nThe rising increasing deficits right now\nThe Republicans in charge of the house the Republicans in charge of the Senate came Donald Trump in the White House that's what matters\nThat headline this afternoon thank God for that headline so I didn't have to talk about the lizard bits Warren and Pocahontas let me go to David Hey David you're on\nA Joe thanks for taking my call we're more concerned with Elizabeth Warren me part Cherokee how many fears Brett Kavanaugh at an eighth grade and what kind of jacket minority or worse than we are with the deficit to North Korea or illegal

entertained we don't want to think we don't want to be challenged we don't want to have to deal with real problems we don't want to be informed\nJust entertain me baby put some stupid up on Facebook baby\nI Want to hear Trump call Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas you're a baby in fact you get conservatives out there right now who are more jazzed every time Trump calls Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas on
