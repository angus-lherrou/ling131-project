happen\n[laughter] well Scott could strike evil out completely if God had the force to eliminate evil altogether than he would have done it a long time ago\nJim thanks for your thoughts thanks for your thoughts so\nGod allowed Obama to be elected\nBut God had a hand in getting Trump elected\n...\nHey Mitch you're on my friend\nGot great show Joe thinking man\nI I Believe God elected Trump and got also put all by away but God used Obama to set up a Trump when he used Obama to push the Christians\nAnd to see how bad it could be under Obama salt to get Trump so when he had to show 'em how bad it could be\n[noise] hey Mitch and again that's an interesting thought but what about the other half of the country that likes Obama and doesn't like Trump\nWhat what if what\nIf they would say the exact opposite that God wanted Obama elected thank God didn't consider Obama evil\n\nWell it also deception is in there you know people are just see than a trick yeah I Believe that Obama was elected

you're thinking about it a revolution coming and it's really scary to think about that\nAnd if everybody remembers back in Nineteen sixty five with a country with very homogenous retains the immigration policy to not just white Europeans but people from all over the world and the countries become more multi cultural diverts\nSlowly it's been like a a boiling point of cooking pot and now the countries are being tired to start because of that and unless we get our Montana is happening in Europe to an electric and uh how ... back there was no way to reverse it\nAnd and I think people in

recipe for\nCivil war and so you're saying that and I completely ... and uh I think people should wake up to the\nDemographic reality that we're gonna\nWe're going to be an civil war if we don't change the immigration policy what do you\nHave Joe ... thank you I appreciate your opinion I Will only say this but I don't think it's got a damn thing to do with race and I don't think it's got a
