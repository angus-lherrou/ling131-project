are a sovereign nation\nThe United states told the United nations today to go jump a United Nations court this morning get this order the U.S to suspend certain sanctions\nAgainst Iran a ruling that Iran hailed\nAs a big old victory but thankfully a ruling that the Trump Administration said they were not bound by the uh the ruling by the interim the UN's international court of justice\nIn theory could complicate our efforts to ratchet up economic pressure on Iran\nOr above ... but we're going to ignore it so we're going to ignore what dish United Nations court said isn't that something like the un court the international court of justice telling us\nWhat we can and cannot do isn't that something like the United nations ordering\nUnderstand this is a un court today that ordered the United states to suspend certain sanctions against Iran\n\nNow show you know the international court of justice or which rules on disputes between you and members it's got no power to enforce its decisions\nIt's pretty huge lists like the United nations is pretty useless and our secretary of state Mike Pompeo this afternoon\nCalled the case quote merit lists and said the United states would not abide by it\nAnd said that the Iranian regime is quote attempting to interfere with the sovereign rights of the United states to take a lawful actions necessary to protect our national\nLawful actions necessary to protect our national security\n\nNow to bring it up to speed again just show you remember we are a re imposing a wide ranging sanctions on Tehran\nFollowing Trump's decision in

the United nations says that we have to do something I think what a joke or a it was so when I woke up this morning and I saw that this un court or their words ordered\n\nOrdered the United states to lift sanctions against Iran [laughter] I thought huh ... me say that again the\nUN the United nations is ordering not to do anything\nGet lost they can't order us to do anything we're a sovereign nation were the ones who decide what we do we're the ones who decide what we do to keep our country to save to make our country prosper we our the boss of ... nations can't tell us what to do\nAnd how

here with Brett Kavanaugh right\nMan at\nThe end of the day I think the reason the left and the Democrats are pushing so hard\nTo stop this guy is because of abortion they want to be able to keep killing babies\nAndy it's cabin on and if Kavanaugh step down tomorrow the next nominee that President Trump would pick the dams and the left to go after him or her with\nEverything they got they try

do think it's that I think that I think it's that issue I think it's that issue of abortion Brett Kavanaugh gets\nOn the Supreme Court there was the fear\n\nThere is the fear right among the left that\nWill be way it's going to be overturned by the way of roe v Wade overturned a that just means that issues return to the states that just means state by state by state the states will decide right the elected officials the people in each of the states through their newly elected representatives will decide\nWill decide the issue of abortion the issue of killing babies but that's what

life\nIs short no matter how concerned they are about the economy and healthcare Democrats believe if they can just bring up the issue of abortion than women will forget about everything else and that's what they will vote up is that issue of abortion\nAnd I think that's a a terribly sexist attitude by the way\nYour ... only women are that way women will forget about everything else women will forget about their jobs that women will forget about their husbands jobs women will forget about the quality of life for their kids if you mentioned abortion\nThen women just like lose it may only
