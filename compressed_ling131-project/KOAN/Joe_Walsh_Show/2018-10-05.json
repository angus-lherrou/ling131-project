substance of the case that's in the hands of a jury right\nThat we do I think officer Van Dyke is guilty of first degree murder I that something might call that's not my call right now the way our system works a jury of his peers is making that determination but would always slaves to me\nIs there are people who will not accept\n\nThe justice and by the way that is justice whatever the jury decides whatever the jury dictates that's how our justice system works\nThat's an interesting notion though Jimmy of alerting the businesses giving them twenty four hours\nBecause uh you're right

who watch Fox News think the rest of the media's all bunch of fake news\n[noise] [noise]\nNow the truth is somewhere in the middle but the middle of the matter anymore because every body\nIs in the corner and they're staying in the corner and they're only talking to people who are in their corner they're only listening to viewpoints in their corner they're only turn it on TV shows and radio shows from their corner their political corner\n\nAgain you don't get any smarter doing that because you look at it like this is well you're you're not challenging your viewpoints you turn on Fox News every night you're not challenging the way you think\n\nI look I go back to this upcoming election it's\n\nThe Republicans are going to lose seats in the house\nThat's guaranteed guaranteed\nThat's just the history of it uh and that this unique here that the Republicans are going to lose seats in the house that's the truth I don't know of hand endearing room or anybody on Fox News they'll tell you that that's the truth the only question is how many\nIf the Republicans lose twenty three seats then they lose control of the house they're going to lose seats\nIn the Senate it's a tougher ball game\nIt's a different ball game in the Senate because the Democrats this is the worst re election map the Democrats have had hundred years way more Democrats up for reelection then Republicans and the hell of a lot of Democrats up for reelection in states that Trump won\nStates like Indiana North Dakota West Virginia\nI mean we're playing on the Republican battlefield here can run Republican turf friendly Republican turf ... in control of the Senate shouldn't even be an issue\nThe fact that it is an issue should tell you whoa something's going on shouldn't even be an issue\nWe're putting in a normal year the Republican should pick up four or five Senate seats that's not going to happen\n\nYou know we've got Senate elections going on in Wisconsin\nOhio Pennsylvania\nNobody's talking about those how come those races are close to\n\nThink about that thing about that Wisconsin Ohio Pennsylvania yeah major races Republican Democrat running for the United States Senate the Democrats are way ahead in all of them\n\nAs an objective\nObserver that tells me something to the climate the climate is friendly to Democrats this year Arizona's close tendencies close Indiana's close\nTexas Texas shouldn't be this close I don't think the Democrats are going to win in Texas\nIndiana and Arizona Tennessee a coin flip\nThat's the truth\nThat is the honest to God truth\n\nThat MSNBC and CNN they're going to give you their slant on all of this Fox News is going to give you their slant\nBut when you hear anybody\nTalking about a red wave oh boy don't give that time of day don't give that the time of day\nThat's just I I mean I suppose there could\nBe a red wave ... on the monkeys uncle can I still say that I Believe there could be a red wave but there is that going to be\n\nAnd I just believe that anybody telling you that is doing you a real disservice\nBecause they're not giving you the truth\nAnd then you're going to be surprised and you're going to be disappointed come election day when\nThere is a blue wave how big don't know but there is a blue wave and you wonder how that happened\nSo what's the answer [noise]\nWell the answer is if you want to watch Fox News watch Fox

interacting archer right in the middle of all the coverage of the world here and grab\nA bite out every single democratic senator and first off I call them at the er I dropped a nurse or something that most people when I was very nice very polite very Christian to vote\nFor Kavanaugh I mean I hate 'em like they were like really everything yeah I Want to ask you what it is an election I Know here in Illinois I hear like as far as Republican yeah upstate\nYeah Hey Greg thanks thanks for your question and that that should be the question right now uh again I'm Sorry anything could happen but it looks like it's over and it does look like Brett Kavanaugh is going to be on the Supreme Court so what does that mean politically\nAh right we've got a big mid term election in thirty three days what does it mean here's my sense\nIt's got a big mid term election and thirty three days what does it mean here's my sense I think that Brett Kavanaugh getting confirmed for the Supreme Court\nMakes it much more likely that the Republicans will hang on to the United States Senate and I think it probably makes it much more likely that the Republicans will lose control of the United States House\nNow why do I say that well it ... and again I don't just point to one polling please do me a favor don't anybody just point to one poll and say see but in all the polling that I've seen in the last few days maybe the last\nWeek it makes clear that this Kavanaugh saying\nHas energized Republican voters it's energize the base it's made a conservatives more enthusiastic about the midterms and its energized women primarily suburban women against Republicans\nShow you're going to see I think the Republican vote in states like Tennessee\nOr North Dakota Indiana maybe Arizona in some of the states where we've got big races for the Senate I think you're going to see the Republican vote increase their for their by helping us keep the Senate\nBut I got to be honest because I can only be honest I got real concerns because it's not just Republican base to people who are fired up because of this cabinet thing\nA suburban women are fired up and don't forget this his firing Democrats up I mean Kavanaugh is going to be on the Supreme Court come Saturday show we when the Democrats lose\nI mean that's just going to piss them off more\nThat's going to anger them more imagine how you feel how angry you'd be if Kavanaugh was voted down\nAnd I think it just intuitively makes sense that whichever side loses this weekend loses this drawn out of ... should know battle\nIs going to be even angrier than they are now\nSo I I think both sides get fired up and I think that hurts us in the house I think it helps us in the Senate\nThat's just my read\nI'm In Missouri as well or Republicans have closed the gap and some of the Senate races but in a number of these house races especially in the suburbs\n[laughter] um it has it increased the league for a number of the Democrats that shit I mean that's just my take look both sides get fired up saying fully because our side needed something to get fired up\nAnd I just hope and pray again that after the weekend after Kevin ... is put on the Supreme Court that our side but doesn't get complacent\nWe want let me go to wane hey Wayne\nHi Joe how it is a good enough for me I have to beg to differ with you I did with housewife every day in the suburbs and lotion leaning porridge they're they're married and Democrats what they did because that was just\nShocked terrible what they did this and they're all on a side a cabinet and there'll be ...
