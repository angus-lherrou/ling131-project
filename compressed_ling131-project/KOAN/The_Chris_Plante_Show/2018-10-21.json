you definitely don't want that going on All right let's go to a myth you he's got a comment on the humidity issues Matthew welcome\nThank you um yeah\nThe humidity issue that I heard a couple before I'm having trouble locating a source of immunity issues um lived in the house\nFor years the first year was no problems at all mhm and then um maybe in the past year year and a half\nStarted having some immediate issues about the sensors lock you were talking about oh shoot them around the house so me to even get one just got a centrist I just sort of tell me what they are and they ... to\n... um but\nBut I tell me what they are and they ... to ...\nUm but I keep getting hot immunity and all around the chocolate or trails in different rooms especially clouded shorter no air movement right\nWhat kind of all the levels are you running\n[noise] and right now right before I left the house now I'm I'm fifty three percent\nOkay not to April was probably been higher than that the mold\nOh yeah yeah yeah but I I mean\nI we just got a cold front come through and I can see where where I'm at we you know I mean I I got a big commercial being made a fire up out there on in the house in the summertime\nThe myth of fair\nOK humidifier big of a big commercial what I like I said about um during the summertime in the summertime it gets however it gets over sixty nine ... ah you know over ... people that stay all over the the it's my understanding that anything ever stick ...\nWell yeah and if it becomes uncomfortable yeah you wanna you wanna like I said you wanted fifty or below in the summertime you'd like David around forty below in the wintertime so that those are your benchmark numbers when you say\nUm you know you don't know where the humidity's coming from my gosh you know it's water vapor so it can be coming from just about anywhere it could be coming from across space if you got to crawl space there it could become just from a\nYou know showers and using the dish washer and dryer and people in the house if you got a tightly sealed home and you're not using ventilation fans you could get sixty percent easily\nUh I I guess I guess my biggest thing was is\nI don't understand how they told me how the around nearby how come they don't have as I said\nWell no well the difference would be like and I use a very simplistic not saying this is what's going on in your house but let's say in your house you had three teenage daughters\nAnd teenage daughters take showers for forty minutes right and it's usually ... and let's say they don't turn on the fan you then have a huge humidity problem but if your neighbors don't have teenage daughter's not just picking on teenage daughters but maybe there's one or two people in the house\nAnd they're real careful but always having the ventilation fan on\nA for a half hour after the showers and they turned to fans on with their cooking and drivers vent it out and\nTheir houses and really a real super whether tight they don't have a humidity issue they may have a few little issue but generally have humidity issue\nUm I guess you know if you're ... if you're cross basis not conditioned when they mean by that remember the other guy was saying he had this whole uh crawl space and kept saluted the plastic underground posted it on the walls that said that the ants were closed up\nOkay if you're home didn't have that and your neighbors did you get the emitted issue so there's things you can do to control and knock down the potential for having humidity issues\nAgainst you\nAnd I would start with the simple once again I don't know what your status on across bases but see if that is in caps late sea of\nYou know you can eliminate any ground moisture coming up and then I'd ... really concentrate on ventilation fans within the house again\nEverybody and not everybody but most people turn on their fan um when they shared but then they turn it off it really should run about half hour after the shower for all half hour afterwards as far as the closets and stuff maybe the doors to try to the carpet\nMaybe we need to get some ventilation in nearby either putting event in the door or shorten the door by half and so we can get some air ventilation and air if that closet a war zone\nAnd outside wall maybe it's a wood house and we get some uh ... moisture can come in that way too [noise] so he just got the process of elimination is the best way to tackle that issue [noise] alright coming up next we're going to have our friends in from middle sake we're going to restore those kitchen

and the things right now how about sharing me some of the one of the craziest things you found in your home\nIn other words if you bought an older home and you've been living there for a while and then one day you found something in that home that you never knew was there\nA I'd like to hear about it because I got a couple stories wanna miss my own home\nAnd I built a whole and it was Nineteen years ago you built it or someone else to someone else bill a friend of mine actually I've got the you just build a couple of times a year and so we kinda did it in culture so um\nI had a a Fifteen Years this which went bad waltz which I went to replace it and I pulled the ball switch out and it's a three way we'll switch\nAnd that means there's two switches working one light\nAnd I'm going there is no three way wall switch on this there's not another switch there's only one switch that works those lights\nWhat in the world's going on so I call a buddy of mine who was an electrician and I said listen there is just one switch at work she's lights but it's a three way switch in there and I can't remember now whether there's two words it was it was it was odd situation was odd\nAnd I said what what do I do and he said scope by a three way switching words that 'cause it's word but there is no other sweat you just do it at work is okay so I go home drop the power I'd do it\nAnd I'll like it was set up and I um put it in and it worked forgot all about it there is no second switch\nWell\nFour years later a K this summer I'm uh putting the TV above the fireplace mental on the wall out from the cabinet kind of you know you see it in the homes all the time now\nAnd I have got to take off the kitten adores that I got turned those into shelves and measuring the shelves on the other side and underneath one of the shelves in the cabinet\nIs the switch that works the lights on the ceiling that has been there for Nineteen years and never knew it was there\nIt's never been used so that was a fine in my house that surprised me and uh I don't know if that's ever happened to you and if so maybe you could share it with us again it's eight hundred a two three to five but um then Karl Rove\nAt it about twenty minutes after the top of their you're at home with Gary self and taking those home improvement questions in stories about weird things you found\nIn your home talked about the way up to thirty eight years living in the house uncovered the night like a built in I live in the wall that's kinda cool and then we'll get some questions about the taking care of business around the home let's get to Donald Donald welcome\nTo class with like coastal woodworker ... built a\nGhost embarrassed for female lawyer wanted leather\nAnd she was always trying to find stuff and so after all built a couple of years later she's still a cup of coffee on her and she hired someone else reflects what other on there that make the liberated white all male or female or you know\n[laughter] what what was he was he contacted yesterday was re wouldn't know it right\nWell what are the parts were found that he um he reflects leather told you so much about\nThat's classic so he felt better [laughter] after he wrote that he felt much better [laughter] good story Donald thank you appreciate it that'd be great [laughter] that'd be great All right let's get to a Sheri Sheri welcome\nGarry hello I got a question\nAbout um insulating um I heard a I'm going to take up a a carpet in a bedroom at ... very cold air collider air movement underneath a house\nAnd taught hardwood floor but I heard of an interesting pain here now what's that\nYeah it's more of a rather than an insulating pain it's more like a radiant barrier pain\nSo it minimizes um solar heat gain and also reduces a kind of keeps the heat in the room it's usually a ceramic based paint\nA reflective I'm so there's so there's some marginal benefit to it um I'm not saying it's but it's not really an insult later it's it's more of them a\nSecond ... it's like you're kind of creating of sermons bottles you will\nRight right okay Hi what's underneath that wood floor\nUm it's\nAn open space storage like a basement\nOr is it a basement or is it across space and that they spent\nIt is okay so just the tip here is just be cautious of uh what take humidity level was in the basement LA Times basement crawl spaces tend to be a little bit more damage than the rest of the how it uh-huh so get nobody\nAround it okay to do very very good All right okay thanks Gary\nAll right Jerry thanks for the call ... ... ... ... in ah Mike welcome your story force\nI actually to now because we just made a commercial you and I sometimes go it's your own Williams about back pain the ants waiting thing oh okay oh by God\nBut this story about a house a friend of mine bought a long time ago an interstate challenges for junk\nThat one room in the basement and he happened to notice all the sticker things getting ready to get rid of it and he couldn't imagine why they had these little Sacred Heart stickers on all of this pictures you can and everything they started open them and everyone was still with silver certificate no yeah y'all must pay for his whole house\nNo yeah it was that way which are typically gets its silver certificates were really valuable because now I don't think they are as valuable as they were maybe twenty five years ago\nThis has been every bit of thirty thirty\nFive year oh my gosh and how many boxes of these scams the fine\n... a ball he found thousands of dollars worth an actual money yeah and and so and at the house was in bad shape so I mean the house with a low cost but he he\n... I was gonna say he's got a bigger remodeling budget now [laughter] yeah a great story Mike thanks very very good how 'bout that [laughter] Martin welcome Gary ...\nGot a disturbing story here about a find a that happened here in our local area ... doctor and have been accused of abusing children ...\nAnd no evidence I mean there were many complaints I think he was even cried never convicted as far as I remember this was quite a few years ago mhm he passed away his house who sold\nAnd [noise] I forget how many times to how to clean hands and finally somebody decided to remodel the basement and same thing there appear to be a whole fall though boy they cut into it and I'll\nCall all the evidence from the all the pick her up like why\nIs that right yeah yeah and he was long gone with long he was already paying the price you know a good story there's a lot of\nThere's already paying the price you\nKnow a good story there's a lot of things that uh I think are hitting it a lot of homes in some homes I told the story about just a crazy light switch story of my home which I still can't get over that we never knew that switch was there and we were involved in building a house but uh yeah secrets or certainly stored in homes and when you\nBuy a home and you start moving in a home uh people do find\nSome odd things that we are going on or maybe just the things that you didn't expect to find\nSo if you get a story like that shared it's eight hundred eight two three eight to five five\nYou got a question regarding your home sure you can calls also at eight hundred to three to five but not a bad time either to be thinking we ... we started off the show we were talking about ... was lighting\nAnd then we went into we started talking about are all kinds of things for your home chimneys chimney repair also not a bad idea\nSometime in the next week or to get up in that daddy\nTake a look at your insulation\nOr just do a quick attic inspection maybe if you get a furnace up in the addict an air handler but when that guy comes to take care of that problem are kind of give it its annual maintenance\nGiven a yardstick and just say around there just just double checking them much inflation I have up there and again you can find with the department of energy a recommends for every inch it insulation that usually like in our three and be as being very general but if the department of energy saying in our forty two\nNow you might find that you get to work you need to do to make that home as efficient as you can but that's one of the things you can put on your list\nOr to get done and again as I speak about often if there's no vapor barrier and other words there is a vapor beyond the bottom base in the living quarters which is what's supposed to happen but if there's no ... on the top which there should not be\nA double blind insulation with a vapor berry you don't want to have vapor barrier in the middle of the insulation\nThat's important\nThat's how you can trap water in the ... and we don't want to do that so if you have um fiberglass insulation with a vapor barrier vapor barrier facing down the house of course I get asked often is can I add right on top of that the answer is absolutely you can blow it in you can buy bats\nAre just don't put any vapor barrier in between the two um pieces of insulation that's where you get in trouble and don't cover up all that soften vending around your house\nOr maybe even get baffles if you don't have them where you can keep that insulation from blowing over uh the suffered vent so that's a little tip for you and not a bad time of year to inspect and see what's going on along with\nJust seeing what kind of shape all your ah weather stripping in All right we're going to take a break in a bubble put you on hold we'll give you\nThe phone number is eight hundred eight two three eight to five five you can also send us a question on our Facebook page Gary solving public figure they'll say visitor

you've experienced none of that my guess is if you ... if you double vapor barrier and insulated wall and you don't extend beyond three inches of insulation you're not going to have a problem\nSo I guess as you probably go you know two three inches of insulation you up at our paper it's not cause we're on the issue at all you gotta you gotta be per barrier on the outside part of that so there's probably no vapor getting in between in any way\nWell here's the other thing that have been written on and when I bought it carpet had been down they tore the carpet up I had the floors rate than east

and [noise] sometimes called science or\nDo you talk to gain popularity that juicing as a term that refers to combining fruits and or vegetables in a juice or or juicing machine and you grind that's double up into something you could actually during\nWhile juicing may help you get the five to nine recommended servings of fruits and vegetables each day that alone is not a balanced diet and I don't think that that even really counts as we'll talk about that here to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of juicing and I should say a lot of other topics as well as male clergy dietitian Kate threats gay welcome back to the program Kate\nI don't I'm I'm unless someone truly thinks they have a sensitivity to certain foods like any I you know we want to respect that and we would want to be kind of systematic about our approach to removing foods from one's diet but you know what a sensitivity to elect and is like\nI truly haven't had many people come to me and say that they have elected and sensitivity and I think it it would prevent probably like most other GI symptoms or there might be some\nUm discomfort loading and maybe some bowel issues with them you know along with it um that said I think um it's a it's maybe not as much of a concern as it's made out to be because ... most foods that are higher and let them like\nBeans um I generally cooked\nAnd when they're cooked that leptin is broken down\nSo it's really not in an issue um and truly than the benefits to eating beans as it is known and in quite good friends so I Would I Would recommend people to eat beans\nFor there are a lot of people do who think the electrons are a problem\nAnd there is a or a best selling book on uh I saw it on Amazon I looked it up when you started talking about when I knew we were going to talk about like them because I'd never heard of them [laughter] and it's called the plant the paradox the hidden dangers in healthy foods that cause disease in weight gain some\nUs by a cardio vascular surgeon okay um and he says you got to avoid these like to read\nIt and doing this to sell a book and the rebels ever said that simple and daunting fact is elections are everywhere thankfully Dr ... offers simple hacks we easily can employ to avoid them\nIncluding peculiar veggies oh ...\nYou ever heard of that I Would recommend not doing it if you don't have to\nShop for a prudent season I guess that makes sense because he says that a group when it's not a completely ripe can that contains a more electrons and you want to avoid those and swap you're brown rice for your white rice so I guess that's probably okay well\nAnd if I Would say if someone surely doesn't think they have an issue our sensitivity to ... again which I don't know that we can quantify if anyone would um in fact having ... having a whole grain would actually be preferred unless you have a reason um and hopefully medical reason not to\nTo have that so we get in unless indicated otherwise I Would say people should have their whole grains I'm so I Would prefer that people would eat their brown rice over their white rice most of the time you can buy this but\nNo I didn't but there's all sorts of cookbooks too that will avoid like your diet it sounds I actually like it's impossible but\nAvoid like your diet the cells are actually like it's impossible but they're out there [laughter] and that's Kelly Clarkson says I read this book in his shoe singer right [laughter] she said my auto immune disease is gone and I am thirty seven pounds lighter\nBecause if she's been on this low intellect and\nIt's another fad I type of fat diets that if you limit some foods that you we are going to lose weight\nRight and I think if if you are to look at the computer to look this up and looking at it like many fad diets it is restrictive in nature and so there are many foods that are eliminated and so when you start eliminating many foods\nThe likelihood of someone losing weight is you know ... is probable and unlikely to happen and oftentimes when people lose weight and their their body responds differently they do feel better or so\nThat said a lot of the foods that are suggested that be eliminated in this election free diet are very healthy nutritious food and actually our foods that\nAre thought to be anti inflammatory and and that it's kind of a counter argument that that they some will say they're inflammatory but there's other substances in that food that are actually known to be anti inflammatory triplets or bad I I Would say it's a fad\nOr do you do think there's any good evidence to suggest that you ought to be on a low locked and loaded left and I\nKnow I don't think anyone should be on a a low ... diet absolutely because I I don't I don't think it's possible\nTo eliminate license because they're in all plants and we want people to eat plants now within the plant family there are certain types of plants that people may have sensitivities to and I think if that's the case again we'd probably want to take a systematic approach to looking at one's diet and and trying to eliminate foods\nI'm In a way that doesn't eliminate all and so and they would be a re introduction of it's because we don't want people to be an overly restricted diet\nUm because that's not um an easy way to live life now and in terms of a long term healthy diet and so we want people latest is many healthy foods as they can and to avoid the ones that truly give them problems and it to for some people it you know just in terms of food sensitivities it might just be\nHow it it might be how it's cooked it might be the dos and the amount that you eat at any one time so often times there's there's ways around to include foods but maybe just within a reasonable way of doing it\nAll right so now we have to talk about probiotics in her last few minutes because as long as we're dispelling ... afraid that she's going to die because of all the probiotics for what she heard on the news this morning and so again when you're talking about fads but circling back around that probiotics are bad or is that what the message messages\nWell and I think that the messages that it's an emerging science and I think as well as more and more research is done in this area where we're seeing maybe a study that is showing benefits and then we may see a a study that shows the opposite and and and does not show those benefits and so I think\nThere's much to be learned um about ah the gut microbiomes that's the the bacteria that naturally live\nWithin us and and its role um in our health and disease states mhm so I think more to calm um that said when we talk about probiotics as being a dietitian\nI Will bring the conversation back to food here and in your ear and yogurt and there's this foods that may be naturally have some robotics and then there's foods that are considered pre by addicts that may\nOr how the set up the environment within your got\n'em to be healthier place to maybe promote a gut Flora that may be healthy healthier beneficial\nSo the story that your friend her this morning and um that were referring to there's taking the capsules pills that are labeled as probiotics that's one thing and then there's eating a serving of ... or sauerkraut and isn't that line getting blurred\nRight and I think when we step into that arena of taking a ... a probiotic or even having a drink\nRecognizing that this is an unregulated industry and so you can say that you have\nThis strain of of bacteria or this much of this bacteria but quite honestly\nWe don't know that that's absolutely true and we can't say with certainty that that's the best thing or that's going to be an NSA you and I again we've just I don't think we have that science yet and so I think it comes back to\nBuyer beware um and there are some people that report that they feel very well when they take a probiotic capsule or that they may have a drink that contains a pro buyout it\nNow whether that's a true a factor is that the placebo effect we don't know um I think if it if they're an otherwise healthy person they can they could they can probably practice that safely but that's not to say that that's the case for everyone\nAll right well let me tell our listeners what we're referring to hundreds to report that came out recently in the journal cell which is a peer reviewed journal by the way\nAnd it says quote a cast further doubt on the benefits of the highly commercialized probiotic products\nBecause they are marketed as dietary supplements not drugs wrote a buyout extra not need to be approved by the FDA for claims that they would prevent or treat any health conditions are basically these two studies said they did nothing\nMost of the patients who took them they all were like what in one and then came out the other [laughter] and the other was a concern that your friend referred to was the fact that if you have taken an antibiotic it may actually take your got longer recovery if you dig ... robotics\nA versus loving Mother Nature are overweight and do it that way\nAnd I do that for instance back to food yeah and I think that's exactly right and and eating nutritious foods like fruits and vegetables and whole grains\nAllow your body to have the ... the proper environment and it can play with the ph or how the foods you know the fibers and and how things

much for being with\nThank you feel like I'm On a Mayo Clinic radio to learn more about poly cystic kidney disease and later on in the program common diseases of the hair [noise] do you have a health related question you'd like to answer\nOr so if you're on it for Twenty years it's probably an extra four or five years or there's not a big a long long studies because it's a chronic disease that leaves many years to study but so far this is kind of expectation that's how it's gonna it's gonna nearly\nThat this loud fantastic [laughter] so how do most patients find out that they have this disease and if you ever seen a case where there wasn't a family history\nOr so mostly are the majority of the patients will have someone in the family that has been cities and they've been so familiar with that usually we diagnose by screening with an ultrasound\nOr so you actually look at the kidneys and see this is exactly so we look at the ... and we have kind of criteria is on how many sewers and depending on the age because\nThe ... the older you are the more says you'd have\nA so to diagnose first we do the screening buyouts for sound and then we can do a C. D. scan or am I to look more at that kind of the the kidney says and how big is the kidney and then we can ... um give a prognosis or how the patient would do depending on how this is our and if\nThe patient wasn't aware that they had a family history of poly cystic disease what might be their first symptoms what might lead them to come in and to you yeah there's about five to ten percent of the patients that\nDon't have a family history so that could be either a new patient so new defecting to gene that just happened in these patients and usually the first sign of either high blood pressure or they get a a some kind of bleeding from the ... so they see blood and urine and they get pain in the ... and they're back\nOr or sometimes an infection induce this and they get a fever and then the pain and then uh they get the imaging and that you are probably and then they got a CAT scan or some kind of image and they see the ... and they were diagnosed\nHim with do high blood pressure or blood in the yard for uh people who have poly cystic kidney disease or there's a whole family history and um what is the takeaway what are those patients need to know\nSo it's really an exciting news for all these stations for example yesterday I offered the treatment for one of the patients who ... who kind of told me the story that even in the Eighteen hundreds they know that they have some kind of ... or some kind of can you disease and actually when she knew that there's an FDA approved drug\nShe started crying actually for several minutes it was very exciting so for these patients first they need to make sure that they're getting good health care so\nUh in terms of blood pressure and then see if they are eligible for this medication\nOr so not all the patients would need to be treated in fact so some are slow progress or so\nThere are some small enough and small number that they don't need to be on any treatment except just being healthy and hype treat the blood pressure but some patients with progressed very fast and they wouldn't need or the house of in their forties fifties and these fission would benefit most from the treatment so it's important for these patients to be checked\nTo know where they kind of are\nAre they slower fast progressing and then uh probably screen their kids as well now that there's a treatment we're recommending that we checked for for this disease because there's something to do about it in the drug widely available\nIt's very unusual just got approved in may there's many logistics around this medication it's regulated by the FDA and we need a lot of luck testing every month for the first year and a half it is available it's kind of expensive drugs so probably is some new and how the insurance would cover and\nSo forth but we're working with all the patients who are asking about it and we're kind of uh doing something where in us to kind of these patients come to their uh can you doctors be checked and also check their kids and what's next in the research\nA lot of things are exciting actually a male so we have well great may be kidney center and we do a lot of translation of research in a way that we do\nA research in the lab and try to translate it to the patience to to get new treatments so we have a new targets actually we're very excited about and a couple of drugs or medications that could be effective so

very favorite dermatologist for male clinic with us to discuss hair issues is there a real show topic on just a hair\nThere is in fact I think we can talk about hair from multiple shows and still not be finished well I suppose if you throw the scalp and they're with it too right and so the issue with the hair is that it comes from the scalp and so there are two different things that can go wrong to give you a hair disorder one you can have an issue with the actual here shaft which is what we call hair\nThe dead protein that comes in a long chain that comes out of our scalp or you can have issues with the scalp itself but then causes the heritage not grow and so I think the lay public is very aware that as you age you can have\nThinning of the hair what people would call male pattern baldness and I think that people are becoming more aware that women can have male pattern baldness we just call it entered genetic ... and it can either have a male pattern\nOr can have a female pattern because men and women lose their hair differently\nFrom um male pattern baldness if you will the other thing is is that I think people know that after a stressful event because hair is mostly cosmetic\nAnd is there to uh protect ourselves a little scallops a little bit and also retain a little bit of heat but from a body standpoint other than that it's purely cosmetic\nThat if you have a stressful about like delivering a baby or having a surgery or getting a divorce that you can shed your hair out of stress and it will grow back we call that the legitimate flu being\nDirected against ... ... is the shedding hair phase we'll grow and shed our hair and cycles otherwise we'd be like a snake or reptile and we'd grow and shed skin all at once\nI'm In a flu being means robustly so essentially if all your hair cycles from a traditional growth rest and shed phase that kind of happens at\nRegular or irregular intervals so we don't grow in shed all at once and it cycles into more shedding due to a stressful event everything kind of gets upset the apple cart gets turned over people shed way more of their hair than they usually should and it takes about nine to twelve months for
