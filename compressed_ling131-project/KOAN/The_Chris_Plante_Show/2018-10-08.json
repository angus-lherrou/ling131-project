this is an accidental college Southern California\nAnd and they had been on a twenty four hour drinking beer niche and and this this girl dodges her friends so she can hook up with this guy and they're texting back and forth beforehand and as you said one of the things she Texas okay do you have a condo\nAnd he replies yes and she text back good give me two minutes since so you know the inevitable silos and then after the fact she apparently changes her mind for whatever reasons and now claims that this guy raped her I mean it's just unbelievable\nAnd not only did she said you have a condom and again any guy who's asked if he has a condom is going to assume you're willing partner right before she left her dorm room to go down to her trips with this con demise guy\nUh she sent a message to her friends saying I'm going to have sex now so any time that receives these messages it's going to perfectly rationally an accurately assume that he has\nAffirmative consent from his partner and yet occidental college she was under enormous pressure from the Obama administration that want it to rack up as many male scouts as possible in its feminist crusade to basically right males out of out of western civilization uh\nOccidental expelled the guy he's now he sued the school of that case is yet to be heard but the text message trail is is completely a vindicate shame and exonerate Sam\n[noise] yeah yeah there's another one you're talking about um where I'm after the encounter which again long after the fact is re characterize as being as being raped\nA she texts to the to the boy how old were I'm sure the boy checks to her how do I compare with your boyfriend since she replies your grades [laughter] and then of course after the fact she says I changed my mind I think I think it was rape\nYeah well you know these are not just isolated\nAnecdotes as I describe in my book there the very first campus rape survey the one that gave rise to this epidemic of of false claims and that is hysterical\nIt's completely counterfactual belief that there's this epidemic of sexual assaults on college campuses the first survey that was published in Nineteen eighty five at its magazine\nA forty three percent of the females\nHomes they rape researcher classified as rape victims went on to have sex again with their alleged assailants now John I submit to you that that is they have you with that is\nCompletely in on think of all if you have actually been raped you are that is the most as I say the most terrifying experience you can come through you feel nothing but repugnant for from this violent criminals you do not go on to voluntarily have next again and and\nThe the key to this whole whole\nHope is that the numbers that we have on alleged campus rape are generated by the researchers themselves the same survey from Nineteen eighty five that was published in this magazine\nWhen the researcher asks the girls who she classified as rape victims whether they had been raped Seventy three percent said they had not so the ... the phony campus rape epidemic a conceit depends on\n... violating won the primary norms of feminism which we're seeing it play now with the cabinet hearing which is you always take the female at her word except if she says she has been raped in which case you know better than she does and you declare that she has [noise]\nYou know whether this this is what will couple of things going on here what is that the left has just redefined the word rape right I mean they've got an ideologically motivated definition that allows them to vastly expand what any normal person would consider to be uh to to be rape\nBut and then that they combine that with this with this idea they try to ram down our throats we saw McCammon on hearing that any woman who is complaining must be believe you know you you can scrutinize restore you can't ask for their matches up with the known facts you can't cross examined her in question are you you just have to believe\nAnd and as you may know whether I spent forty years and the court room okay and and I can I can attest from from forty years of experience that women sometimes why you know uh most witnesses or don't lie in almost all witnesses would prefer not to lie\nBut but some witnesses do and I would say that women lie in roughly the same proportion as man and for the same reasons\nAnd this year the allergy that somehow women are are you know kept you know are always telling the truth is ridiculous\nSo again let's let's go to remember where the ... coming from it is coming from the campus is and it's part of a much broader assault on on western civilization it is based on the idea that that America\nIn general and college campuses in particular are places of in damage racism and sexism\nThat the world is divided into permanent victim classes and oppressor classes and it's a very highly competitive\nWorld the victim world it is a ruthlessly competitive totem pole that is constantly being rearrange we thought that maybe gauge where at the top now trans people are at the top but they\nThey're put decision marriage is is tenuous there's going to be some new victim group I guarantee you in the next year or two that it's going to get claim top dog victims status\nBut females you know we started there early on and and they claimed that they are victims of rate of sexism\nPreposterous it is it is for postures particularly on college campuses which are open to everybody where females are encouraged\nFrom from the time a girl is five years old today on where she is the in\nIncessant recipient of messages to six feet you know women in stem girls to code ah encourage them it right and left from mainstream foundations from the education establishment it's boys who are an afterthought\nWho are bombarded with a message that they're ... they're the perpetrators of massive oppression you know college campuses give seminars and toxic masculinity at some point\nThe campuses give seminars and toxic masculinity at some point males are just going to check out entirely because\nWe are now a culture that is sending nothing but negative messages that them\nUh and you know why why bother in a world where everything that you've accomplished is it the values but if you say the court room you know the reason that we the western tradition developed these truths finding mechanisms like cross examination\nWas with the understanding\nThat human memory is fallible even if the person in tends to be accurate it's very hard to remember things there's a plant that memory syndrome that we know about you know we don't know what this Christine for\nWhat her therapist was doing to her ... therapists these days are very left wing who knows you know one\n\nClosely the phenomena that you describe Heather on college campuses because a burst into public view here with the accusations against a judge Kavanaugh a but this is the kind of thing that has been going on as you say at our universities for quite a while\nYeah people have to pay attention if if you've got a child going off to college [noise] you'd be well advised to read my book or just educate yourself\nAnd and the rest of us have to realize don't give money to your college anymore unless you've done due diligence and you can be sure that it is not perpetuating the victim ideology\nOr it's not just about the Democratic party although at the Democratic party has now been overtaken by campus identity politics that has poisoned for civil society it's teaching students hate to hate each other and hate the greatest works what civilization\nUh and they're sharing that animosity into the world at large that's what we're seeing today you know it's great that cap and not get on the Supreme Court because his wealthier record of jurisprudence shows that he's a careful ...\nThat does everything it can to follow the law without putting his own personal opinions first at

round\nYeah I don't know whether the deal Jay is conducting any kind of investigation or any any enforcement action brought by the department of justice would have to\nInvolve a violation of federal law obviously it would have to be some kind of a wide ranging a look at you know who's financing and stuff and some kind of you know interstate a conspiracy to violate various laws\nAnd I think they could do that but but I I Would suggest something a whole lot simpler I mean if you're the chief of police in Seattle and you've got and teeth sides\nA rioting in your city smashing store front you know breaking up a\nPlaces of business are hitting people over the head of baseball bats and um and the two by fours\nAnd and setting cars on fire you don't have to wait for ah for for a sessions or the department of justice prosecute him arrest them put them in jail and if you're the the district attorney in Seattle throw the book at him you know these people deserve law in jail terms\nA big part of what's happening here is that these urban prosecutors are all Democrats\nAnd the Democrats generally view antifa as part of their movement you know they're the\nKind of like the provisional wing of the IRA back in the old days you know that's that's the activist wing of the militant wing of the Democratic party they don't want to prosecute and they don't want to put them in jail\nAnd ah so I think that's where that's where the enforcement really needs to be again is that the state and local level where the crimes are taking place let's go to Cheryl in Illinois on line to Sheryl welcome to the program\nHi thank you um do you remember what happened to have an eleven in Wisconsin with a newly elected Governor Scott Walker he proposed a bill to give the union members that choice public union member choice in paying is\nDo you remember the hundred thousand protesters by is on ... or the country over the capital it was terrible\nYeah they actually camping\nYeah they actually kept inside the state capital ah they've threatened a Republican legislators um they came to buses were sent to the home of Scott Walker outside Milwaukee he was at the capital but it scared you know grandma and the two teenage sons\nA Republican legislators taking a bus to the parking lot and it was an attempt to overthrow them at any rate he wrote a book about it Governor Scott Walker he was ... Republican\nFitzgerald brothers who control the state Senate and state assembly stood strong the governor is strong\nAnd the book is called and intimidated and everything you're saying now happened in Wisconsin but the people were so appalled even Special Olympics were disrupted had nothing to do with politics but I guess the governor with there\nAnd the people just a Wisconsin ... there was that attempt to recall Governor Walker that failed all kinds of recounts lawsuit everything you're saying now\nUh happened in two thousand eleven against a successful Republican Governor Walker and by the way they did balance their budgets in Wisconsin I'm calling from Illinois where we have a failed state bankrupt\nAh Illinois as you know the Democratic legislators ran and hid so that there wouldn't be a quorum remember that\nRight man right they hit out\nAnd of course the Tea Party expose where they were hiding in northern Illinois in a hotel it was just you know you couldn't carrying out a legislative session without people screaming and disrupting the whole process and by the way organizing for America\nThe Wisconsin branch was a busy there that was Obama's group ... thousand eleven act had a hell wow\nAnyway I assure you may you make a great point I mean we we've seen this show before they previewed it in Wisconsin and a good news is a walk or one and and they made a tremendous progress tremendous reforms in Wisconsin let's go to our Roland in North Carolina line sex a welcome to the program\nJohn I no longer that thanks for taking my call I'm sixty eight years old I haven't drank anything thirty some years but when I was in like things in my twenties when I was in the U.S in the navy\nWe drank as much as we could possibly drink and you cannot blackout granting American beer\nAnd the last few or a I have a health issue so [laughter] I don't want nobody ever brought that up\n[laughter] that's very ...

need them and to ah to grow their business and how they see fit is a is really a transformative across the board\nIt really is you know I I checked the Rasmussen survey this morning a President Trump has been rising in that in that poll which is the only one that's done on a daily tracking basis are currently and it shows a President Trump with fifty one percent approval forty seven percent\nAnd I chose a President Trump with fifty one percent approval forty seven percent disapproval which is which is a one of the best ratings that he's had 'em and and a strong approval Rasmussen causes the approval index the difference between strong approval and strong disapproval\nThere are now just as many voters who strongly approve of Trump is there are who strongly disapprove of him meaning that his approval index is\nRight now at zero that doesn't sound great if you don't know about the history here but at the same point in in the Obama administration Brock Obama's approval index was minus eleven\nSo Trump's at at this moment is a eleven points better so we're seeing people across the country they're responding to something a ... what do you think ... are they responding to the economy or they responded to the the outrageous conduct of the Democrats in relation to the cabinet appointment or is it some of each\nYeah you know I think it's a it's all the above it both the things that have been happening but I think the more that you think about what could happen in the future\nUh it it really is a stark discrepancy between the two futures that are are in front of us are right now that are left just literally campaigning on the slogan repeal Trump tax cuts and and what that what that means that you're at the Heritage Foundation with actually calculated what it needs but the average\nA taxpayer in America and and with a combination of the tax cuts that they would\nAct last year and the economic growth projected over over the future the tax cuts are are repealed and the next year or two that could be twenty six twenty seven thousand dollars in lost take home pay that that that sort of typical American and expected that the\nThat that that that should be scary to to most Americans that that all of this prosperity could be a could be reversed with the ah with by simply repealing somebody's big pieces at the house and the president ... at ... through\nYou know it's interesting just an hour or so ago the president was about to leave the White House on a helicopter he's on the White House lawn and he walked past all these all these reporters and they start yelling questions at him he stops to answer their questions\nAnd there's a bunch of questions about the Kavanaugh nomination and and and there were questions about some other things but at one point he talked about Venezuela\nAnd he said yeah if the Democrats get their way are all these socialist they're popping up now that they want us to be like Venezuela\nAnd I was really glad to hear him say that because you know it's amazing to me that that rather than recognizing the successes that the free market policies of this administration have enjoyed the Democrats just\nBlindly deny those successes in instead one after another they're coming out as socialists\nAnd when you look at what happened in any socialist country around the world most recently in Venezuela you know you can tell when you're reaching the later stages of socialism because there are no more pets in the country the pets have all been eaten I mean it's unbelievable to me that the Democrats really want to go there\n[noise] you know the the the record of socialism and something like eighty six and zero it that way it's been tried more time and it should have been at each and every time it's a it's it's crumbled and and left misery and destruction at wake and\nSo I mean that's the that at a very high level that those are the two that your direction we can shoot\nThe promise of the tax cut the promise of of putting more money in people's pockets is it simply allowing Americans to decide how their money in that rather than sending it to the bureaucracy in Washington and letting it sort of lost around like people's pockets and then\nA park that getting bad back out elsewhere that ... that are just not a recipe for a strong and vibrant economy American un American businesses though how best to spend and invest\nTheir resources and that's what we're seeing the power of of individual action rather than government action\nAnd we're also seeing success for for the average American or you know under socialism some people always do very very well so Hugo Chavez's daughter left the country reportedly with about four billion dollars in Swiss bank accounts\nAnd his finance minister I think made off with even more than that so if you're part of the ruling click or you're a part of the end the socialist in crowd yeah you could do very very well but uh the rest of the people are trying to catch rats so they can fry him up for dinner and that's that socialism whereas what we're seeing\nCurrently in the Trump Administration is real progress being made all up and down the economic ladder but especially\nToward the bottom of the economic ladder with with new entrance into the labor force in the labor force actually being able to get a pretty good paying jobs that are Michelle thank you

judge Brett Kavanaugh was for him to the Supreme Court on a fifty to forty eight\nVotes or the vote itself was something of an anti climax it was clear there for at least a couple of days that he's going to be a way to be confirmed that he was immediately sworn in and he'll be on the bench or I think not tomorrow I think they're off today but I think tomorrow we'll be seeing\nJustice Brett

finally won or happy that that the Saturday eventually got\nTo the right result and outstanding I'm a conservative justice was confirmed and the other hand I think all of us are\nBut of a justice was

a tactical genius [laughter] you know usually that's not true [noise]\nUh and um I I I think Mitch McConnell knows how to work the set it as well as anybody but um when the filibuster is in play ah the majority leader is often a rather I'm paralyzed\nThe filibuster is not in play here of course\nAnd we'll we'll a debt of gratitude to Harry Reid for a busting the filibuster has to judicial nominees now it was in effect only for a short time the Democrats\nPut the filibuster into effect for judicial nominees sometime in the nineties or the two thousands so it was very brief and then they decided to take it away and uh that made things a little bit easier for the Republicans this time around so Mitch McConnell was a hero he he steadfastly I'm\nA work the nomination through the Senate he leaned hard on his um his colleagues uh he got the vote scheduled when he knew he had the votes to to confirm a judge Kavanaugh [noise]\nAnd so kudos to Mitch McConnell Donald Trump Donald Trump

that I think if he had not a guide Neal if you if he'd been you know well and present than voting I I think you would have supported a cabinet or [noise]\nBut um the problem with McCain of course as he was always this big question mark you you never knew when he was going to go rogue and abandoned his party I thought he was bigger than his party\nOr a ... and that and that can be dangerous so so after after running three or four times on a platform of abolishing Obamacare\nEvil or to keep it and and apparently he did that just out of spiked a because of his anger at a at President Trump\nSo he was a loose cannon uh in a lot of ways and I think over over his time in the Senate he became more and more of a loose cannon\nAnd uh I I think I think the the the person with respect to what is your theory might have the strongest basis is Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham was always the junior maverick er he was always a he was always John McCain's way man and and um and uh with McCain are gone\nAnd then maybe we'll find that Lindsey Graham ah won't be so prone to I'm asserting is a contrarian impulse as at precisely the worst moment a thanks for that call re if I if if you want to be

I'm going to talk a little bit about about that posted about some of the things that I that I said there\nAnd um and and and we're I think we're at what I think the landscape looks like a in the wake of a judge Kavanaugh's confirmation\nAnd lewd conduct the the abhorrent conduct that we saw from the Democratic\nParty over the last few months and then I think the the implications are significant that I think that this episode is going to be with us for a long time to come I started this post that where do we go from here or by saying this\nBrett Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court tomorrow bringing to a close one of the most appalling episodes in American political history the Democrats shameful treatment of Robert Bork in Nineteen eighty seven has distorted our politics not just the politics of the Supreme Court\nFor the last Thirty years but the slander the Democratic party directed toward Kavanaugh were if anything even more disgraceful\nAnd I think that's I think that's right I paused there for a moment at the smears they directed against judge Bork were outrageous a Ted Kennedy of course leading the charge there but many Democrats participating\nBut at least they were they were a geared toward his judicial philosophy which they massively distorted and lied about but they but they did at least purport to relate to things you might do as a judge here we have the Democrats are trying to claim that Brett Kavanaugh total Boy Scout\nOr was involved in in gang rapes as a high school students believable or the smears that the the slander as they they directed against ah against judge Kavanaugh\nSo I continued uh but the slander as the Democratic party directed toward Kavanaugh were if anything even more disgraceful\nWe will feel the impact for many years to come and I laid out various areas in which I think I which I think that's true where I think we will be seeing that in fact we're going to go to a break and when we return we'll

that list but I have not the slightest I doubt that if I Am in that list that it will overwhelmingly due to the left and that's more comment I think on the state of affairs in the legal academy than it is state of affairs about Brett Kavanaugh's temperament\nYeah I think that's exactly right and I would add that I think the tide turned now Lindsey Graham obviously help too but I think the tide\nTurned in that in that follow up here and when when a cabinet or Kevin came out a blazing you know and and strongly denouncing these I think ridiculous or accusations against him I think he needed to do that not to show people he he was he was sincere and I and I pocket that that's what happened\nI absolutely agree with you I remember I sat and I I was riveted it with my colleagues watching all of this and\nWhatever you want to say about you know Christine Blasey Ford she was emotional during her testimony and came across as a reasonably compelling\nYou know person you may or may not think that she did that Kavanaugh had done something to her but clearly something had happened to this woman at some point in her life to closer to be this emotional and I think that of Brett Kavanaugh had come out and said OK I'm here now asked me questions and I'll be happy to answer them\nHe would have been in deep trouble I think the fact that he came out\nExactly as strongly as she did and said you are now trying to destroy a reputation over a lifetime ... also by the way trying to destroy the judiciary by casting doubt about its credibility in the integrity of people who served as judges and I'm not going to play along with this\nI I think that he he very much\nHelp his uh his claws and had he come out and being at a flat aspect or when he would he would have gone down to defeat in terms of you know the his nomination\nWe're talking to Jon Malcolm of the Heritage Foundation John let's look forward a little bit and talk about some of the things that I'm\nI'm the Democrats frankly are trying to do what one one thing that they're doing is they're talking about the authority of the Supreme Court here are being undermined and and they're saying that uh decisions in which judge Kavanaugh participates or maybe don't need to be respected if they're close\nThey're talking about if they take the house which everyone seems to think they will I don't know but that's the reduction or they'll they'll start impeachment proceedings against against judge Kavanaugh what what what do you make of all this [noise]\nWell I have several things to say I think it is terrible but they are in fact trying to tear down the integrity of the court by making Eighteen\nOr that it's just another political branch of government the Supreme Court hasn't helped self in that regard because it has involved itself in more and more social issues frankly under the constitution ought to be left to people but you know ...\nThat is what people are trying to do I I think singling out Brett Kavanaugh I you know I understand that people are are doing that\nBut ... before the presidential election you had with Peter Ginsburg\nComing out and basically saying how awful she fought Donald Trump was and other than a few people grumbling when she actually came around to decide cases over the last two terms involving ... called policies\nNobody was filing ... motion to get her a to draw away and nobody expressed the kind of outrage towards her ... her some outrage but not nearly the level of outrage at your hearing each ... beach west towards Brett Kavanaugh\nWho all after all only challenge the tactics of senators on the Democratic side judiciary a committee you know I teach me is to some degree\nA political process I think that this will certainly let people know that are the stakes are high in terms of who they vote for and whether they vote in the mid term election I think if the Democrats do take control\nOf the house it is possible they might impeach but kept up and be very clear impeachment is just leveling of charges and it only requires a majority in the house of representatives after he would be impeached\nThen it would move to the Senate justices said when the house impeach Bill Clinton and then there is a mini trial and it requires a two thirds vote in the Senate before somebody is actually thrown out of office and there was no way that would ever happened to Brett Kavanaugh so the Democrats might\nDo this they might even filed charges against them if they take control of the house but there is no way that Brett Kavanaugh would be thrown off the bench\nNo that's right when we looked at the at the crazed behavior not just of the Democratic senators but as the\nThe Democrats who showed up to him as a mob in Washington DC and invaded senators' offices and and and all the things that they did attach Rand Paul the airport I may go on and on\nBut I asked myself why are they so cranes to I mean it's really strange and I think at least part of the answer has to do is roe versus Wade I I I assume that that that at least part of their thinking is that\nThere with with Kevin O's confirmation are now potentially is a ... vote majority on the court\nTo um undo what what many of us continue to regard as one of the worst blunders in Supreme Court history what do you think about that do you think there is a serious chance of of roe v Wade actually being a overturn\n[laughter] LA step back I I certainly think that there are many on the left who are crazed and they have been crazed uh ever since the election night when when you know Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton\nSince the election night when when you know Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton\nSo I think you would get a large amount of this regardless roe versus Wade is certainly the touchstone a lightning rod if you will\nUh for folks are on the left it to predict the demise\nOf roe versus Wade with every Republican nominee to the Supreme Court\nAh starting with Sandra Day O'Connor in Nineteen eighty one and that Susan Collins pointed out three people who voted to farm wrote the opinion that reaffirmed the basics of roe versus Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey we're Sandra Day O'Connor David Souter really at the Kennedy all Republican appointees\nI don't know of course with the with the current court\nOr would do would roe versus Wade a chief justice Roberts tends to proceed very very cautiously only one current Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has outright called for roe versus Wade decision overturned\nMy prediction if I had to had to make one is that it's less likely that roe versus Wade will be out like overturned\nThan it will be that more restrictions placed on\nUh the right to have an abortion will be more likely to be upheld that's how cases that tend to come to court over the last few years when Kennedy was there you have states it would have more restrictions or fuel restrictions with respect to abortion rights and the Supreme Court will weigh in on those but in terms of it\nIs full frontal assault on roe versus Wade\nI don't know whether that's going to happen anytime soon and frankly with the chief justice Roberts on the court I Know exactly what the outcome would be even if the other quote unquote conservative sweat along with overturning roe\nJohn Malcolm thank you very much for being on the program
