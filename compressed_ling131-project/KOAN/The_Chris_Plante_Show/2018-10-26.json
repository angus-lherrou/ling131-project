conversation uh yesterday with a a Russia expert who who did tell me he did not think\nDid not think that the FSB the Russian foreign intelligence service was involved in this he did nevertheless say but on the other hand there is strong evidence to indicate\nThat those are ... you know the cameraman and his brother up as your car up in Boston that they may very well have been trained in influenced by the Russians\nThat they are all sorts of weird things that were going on with their radicalization and and that the way that they built this they're bomb the pressure cooker bomb is not something that would have been readily available on the Internet and so that that I found fascinating\nThere is a real benefits\nAre real benefit a continuing benefit to a lot of foreign powers or by this continued a discontent in a in the United states affect somebody tweeted it I don't have it in front of me you know or that the Russians would very much like Democrats in power that's true to an

Democrats haven't had something good but they don't have anything to talk about we should be focusing on the fact that we have the bad economy we've had in generation no yeah the lowest them than\nEver and if people don't see that they I I just can't put my arms around it but I Believe the Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters are toxic to this country\nThey are toxic they're all about the

in the news this fake bombs story\nA and and we now have a a GPA of three point five percent of the third quarter\nA President Obama when he was an office said we were never gonna see GDP above two percent\nOf the Trump a communist turning that around obviously this is very important to other folks you're talking to the see this in terms of jobs and more money in their pockets are how are they on those sort of uh the Trump tax and regulatory agenda one of those same to you about that\nOnly all love more money in our pockets of Trump you know tax agenda is positive it's up to Congress to get tax judo path we need to ensure that small businesses and the middle class\nGet permanent tax relief absolutely paramount we have to do that that is that's going to be a huge focus on going into

the world's best\nNegotiator let's demand do his job\nYou don't regulate and they got\nNo no go ahead go ahead please reducing regulations\nAnd anything ... Gillette businesses thrive is what we need to do I mean we ... government the fundamental belief and I'll get Senator Tom Davis and the state of South Carolina credit because he told it to me and it's been part of my ... a\nDemocrat fundamentally believe government is to set up problem and Republican believe government is the problem\nAnd that is what Trump is doing the government's the problem is getting rid of it finally we got Congress working with him on that and we have to keep the momentum going at paramount as my what like far\nAs my colleague at the Competitive Enterprise Institute Wayne Cruz says you don't have to teach the grass how to grow you just have to remove the rocks from their lawns and and he's already been ... that sort of my one of my other barely works is is the is this issue regulations\nBut but you know it's and it's interesting because you talk about this issue of negotiation and and and Trump [noise]\nUm I I have a I had formulated a theory on what I called Trump's rules of acquisition I'm a star trek Duke uh this is a for a new thing for any rules that I was ... and rule number one is always be willing to walk away from the table\nRight rule number two is sometimes in order to demonstrate your opponent\nBut you're willing to walk away from the table you have to walk away from the table and will number three is don't pre negotiate with yourself I mean this is this is the great folly\nOf a of a you know democratic negotiators trade negotiators over the years is that they've always pre negotiated an eventually inevitably sold out American interests\nAnd so yeah I understand probably Boeing is unhappy about a tariff on let's say aluminum or steal or what have you but nevertheless it is in go shooting tactic to take the strongest

in common with a tarp a there is well you know so I mean I'm not going to speculate were fairly we're all sort of sitting here we\nWe um we noticed that there may have been positive Trump stickers on this van that's being taken in so so we we have to we have to sort of take all of that listen here's\nWhat I Know I Know that up until they zoomed in on the stickers on the truck remember MSNBC been saying a person detained for questioning as soon as they did on the stickers and there was some indication that the person may be a conservative or maybe a Trump supporter that's what MSNBC change their\nTheir uh their their peace or they're at the bottom a man in his fifties arrested in connection with the bomb probe\nIn any case we're talking about this are taking your phone calls here or let's go to a rough in Arizona Russ welcome to the warring from show\nThat you're adult you're doing a great job or talk to you about the\n... so called caravan ways and I think I have a you know the answer for President Trump who's been but moaning the disgraceful laws which the Democrats passed which is tied his hands the answer is in ...\nThat's passed which is tied his hands the answer is in plain sight all you have to do is they got your dictionary and your constitution and uh [noise] because words mean\nThe absolutely of course and\nOur every definition of the word invasion this is an invasion ...\nAbsolutely I Believe me I've I've seen those dictionary definitions I wasn't there is a force of large numbers coming to try to cross the border illegally believe me I I get that was the rest of them have to let you go because I I I Want to get John on before the break\nOff because he's calling in an answer to my earlier question John you're a former postal worker you can help a elucidate us on this uh these issues\nDid you say John or Sean I said John haunted or worse yeah average it's the same I I I was\nI worked for the postal service as a clerk tonight filling postmaster for ten and a half years after my uh twenty seven years of air force service anyway\nThis is not better unusual when you consider the characteristics of these packages [noise] um I don't I have received things from the Mayo personally that are the things that are more into a calculator or something with\nStamps on there that have not been cancelled wow what reason or knock Andrews because those are called SP ours which stands for small parcels and rules that can't go through the processing machine sure when you get a letter that goes through the machine\nA machine just spray the cancellation on there for efficiency of speed\nIt doesn't do that with those types of packages had those packages had a pipe and they're not a PVC pipe of actual lead pipe or something that could do damage yes it would have waited too much\nAnd it would've alerted people that there's something wrong with this so that's not a gone through clerk clerk at the counter will look at it ask them questions and care for over ... stamp\nShore so\nFor the fact that they're not canceled there's not that unusual\nWell let me ask you this and ... who are running short on time here but real quick so it without it being cancelled how would they be able to track them back from New York to Florida\nWell I think that's probably a they're basing it on the fact that one of them was male and then ended up with a ... being returned to Florida I'm I'm I'm not exactly sure how they got FBI is a lot more clever than I Will say well\nThis is what some of those I appreciate that that is that is incredibly helpful information and then the end right I mean we can speculate I can offer my opinion I can offer my perspective but we're also in the business of providing fast so Sean thank you so very much for giving us those facts you have a a great weekend right\nYes I'm no expert but I think I Know enough from working with it\nYou know just enough to be dangerous to make us all more dangerous than to Sean I appreciate that was when we when we come back\nWe're going to be talking more about these issues were going to be joined by Steve court as we're going to turn our attention to the caravan we're going to be continuing to take your phone calls a at a a five five forty Laura also your tweets I'm Andrew longer sitting in for Ingram here on the ...\n\n[noise]\n\n\nHave you ever taken your car for

do their\nPart well this is part of it we have leverage on them particularly a trade\nAnd what happened I'm Sorry I don't know but this is what's happening in Europe I mean let's not forget that a lot of our friends in Europe are struggling to sort of the same issues of mass migration and you have a situation in which you'll have migrants refugees in the middle east coming in arriving in Greece and they will be facilitated in crossing ...\nDid you see in the middle east coming in arriving in Greece and they will be facilitated in crossing certain countries so that those countries can get them out of their their continuous ... ... it's interesting you talk about this\nHe talked about the issues of national security\nAnd I've been down to the southern border and I urge anybody in every one if you've never been down to the border go down to the border in in uh in Arizona and California\nAnd watch you know there's highways that that travel right along the border I Wanna say five five I don't remember notes on I think that that goes north south I think it's I tend interstate ten goes right along the border there\nAnd I've watched people cross the border it is a scary prospect even if people are not coming you know into commit harm but the idea that some simply walk across this patch of land and and my great that that is a frightening prospect to me again I think he was he was relative\nThough of course and by the way you know people want to make us seem like we're a phobic a you know paranoid people because we talk about uh the the danger of a lawless for of course border here's the reality the president wasn't far off by the way when he said that you know there could be middle Easterners\nOr for example we had no idea it was causing here's what we do know and this is a conspiracy theory nonsense citizen from so far right you know ... the Laredo station at the border patrol tells us that this year they have already arrested six hundred and Bangladeshis\nAre crossing illegally now why do I mentioned that because obviously Mexico's a very long way from what\nI'm saying that that also happens to be a country that has a real problem with Islamic terrorists or so there are reasons for us to to fully that anyone coming here\nFrom Bangladesh you know even coming legally but the fact that they're coming illegally through Mexico I think is very I sure and tells us you know that we don't know who's going to be caught six hundred how many have we not caught\nUm so it doesn't make sense for economic security it doesn't make sense for national security it's not fair to legal immigrants there are just so many reasons why we have to stop it and I think we need to get Mexico to do their part we need to use trade as the leverage and say we're going to start trade restrictions and by the way that doesn't work\nIf it comes to it we will seal the border there will be no trade from Mexico I Hope we don't have to get better Kony and but I think that option has at least be on the table so that we don't have the crisis of them actually crossing the border walking across as happens too often as you mentioned\nAnd by the way the interstate that I was looking for the interstate eight is south of interstate panic goes right along the border in in Arizona and California and my guest is Steve Cortez and we're talking about this it it's funny because I I come back to ... you said the thing about being a phobia and I I Want also make it very clear I've said this a little bit earlier on in the show\nBut the one of the one of the great things about America the thing that makes America the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth is affected anybody can come to America and become an American\nRight that that is that is an essential element of who we are it's a wonderful thing it's something you can't find anywhere else so you go just about anywhere else do you go in the world but I can move to France today\nI could live in ... in France for another Thirty years I Will never be considered French Japan and the same thing Korea the same thing\nBut anybody can come to America and and become an American it's the beauty of who we are we're just saying that you have to do it within the process you have to do it legally you and you cannot expect if you're going to come up here on moss\nAnd and do something about it so the president's talking about deploying troops down to the southern border um there is a lot of discussion as to whether or not this violates posse ... I don't believe that it does having read the various statutes that are out there where do you come down on this\nRight now I don't think so because it's it's a clear danger to our borders external danger so you know I don't think it done by the way I'm so glad you made that point two of you know look the mainstream media you played that Joe Scarborough and he was just\nRidiculous morning yes totally insulting to America trying to make this a racial issue they often do that by the way when they don't want to talk policy what do they do they just call this race of course and and try to dismiss us\nBut here's here's the reality of America's not a race or you know as you point out right and if you believe in our values and our constitution\nAnd if you're going to bring work ethic and skills that we need a than we want you to become an illegal immigrant and you're so right the second you are you're an American no questions asked that doesn't happen in the rest of the world so this is not about race remotely a it is about citizenship\nAnd it is about borders and it's largely by the way I pointed out to the Joe Scarborough is largely about protecting American citizens many of whom happened to be minorities\nAre black and Hispanic Americans I Believe soccer more than anyone from tolerating illegal immigration or why because many of them are working class people who have to compete in the labor market against illegal immigrant labor so it actually harms black and brown Americans perhaps the most of all the tolerate porous border\nYou know my ... my my my colleagues see motley and less government dot dot org has talked to a great deal of about that issue about sort of the economics of this as well in the end for me it comes down to issues of national security it comes down to issues of sovereignty if we don't control who is migrating here\nOn them in any nation any nation that doesn't control who is coming in is pretty soon finds itself without a nation and we certainly don't want that seat Cortez how do we find out more about what you were up to\nYou know I'm On CNN most nights beyond their anger that tonight and on Twitter ... court as the C O R G E S C\nWill listen I appreciate that will put up links on the underlying or show page I'm sure we have links up in the ... thank you so much for joining us today\nThanks for having me ... and it's interesting 'cause he was talking about the issues of of people of color in America a and one of the things that I wanted to get to today I really didn't get a chance to get to was this issue of\nUh the president speaking tonight at a gathering of conservative African Americans are they're going to be posted at the White House today and then they are doing a gala event tonight here in Washington DC uh you know president is really doing what he can because\n... right it it's funny or the American dream is about everybody is about every but it's about bringing everybody in and the only way you can do that is by creating the conditions whereby everybody can succeed\nWe've talked about this about sort of a good economic news today uh the uh we have the GDP out or GDP is it a third quarter GDP a three point five percent of of a\nTenth of a percentage point above a where it was expected that as a immeasurably good news and yet and yet we're not talking about this by the way I Am taking your tweets I did get them as I said I Do read the critical tweets here\nKevin tweets and Andrew\nPlease I'm saying ah every two seconds of what I get excited to fix up eight when I get excited I I tend to speak over myself and I get a little closer to my speech be when I'm looking at breaking news on the TV sometimes I get a little distracted by that so I Do apologize\nSometimes I Do try to work very hard on my on my verbal textbook Kevin thank you so very much for listening so intently to that\n[noise] ah Patty writes in on Twitter by the way you can tweet at me at angel underscore Langer\nPatty writes I found you a good job of filling in for Laura we need evidence confirm if this is a liberal sending the bombs I it must be what idiot we keep sending the bombs with so much attention didn't Brennan have rice in ... to him I got to go back and look at that I don't remember a friend and got it I Know a bunch of conservatives did certainly it was sent the folks\nAt the Pentagon a Bible certainly double check on that was we got a couple of more minutes\nBecause at the Pentagon a Bible certainly double check on that we got a couple more minutes here on the show\nBefore we close out for the day I'll continue to take your tweets and Andrew underscore Langer continue to take your phone calls\nEight five five forty ... is the number eight five four zero L.

the Russians are going to have to retaliate they're going to start targeting those countries\nAnd that's a that's a very direct threat at the same time us backed forces and us equipment is being used to kill Russian or or to kill a Russian soldiers on the ground\nIn Syria the Russians are not happy about this\nAnd so to me given what the Russians have been willing to do\nIt is not beyond the pale and it wasn't remember the Russians were literally killing people in Great Britain or trying to kill people in Great Britain I should say\nLiterally trying to kill people in Great Britain we know this\nSo it it to me it's not it's not beyond the realm of possibility\nThat they would turn around and send bombs that were not that we're not real bombs fake bombs dummy bombs through the post office to a bunch of democratic targets in order to turn the left and right against each other even further that is what Vladimir Putin wants\nAnd I think it makes a heck of a lot more sense than either a right wing or or left wing or sending fake bombs through the mail\nIn any case when we come back we're going to be joined by Todd would former air force pilot editor in chief ... dot com

hundred for a zero fifty two there are things that go to Jenny dot com that's ... dot com\nWell it is possible I mean what they just sprayed nerve gas all over the u._k. yeah feel several people or one person and so it is possible however I think it would be incredibly reckless and literally an act of war targeting you know former political leaders\nFor you know the vice president's et cetera uh of the United states I don't think the Kremlin is that reckless at this point now that's just my point you know I have reporters\nAll over the ... former Soviet Union and I just don't believe that they would do that at this\nPoint in time well let me ask you this because getting getting back to this high enough treaty and you've written about him I agree with you wholeheartedly the time has come for America to pull out of it\nUm but ... has now turned around and said that that if the U.S starts placing intermediate range missiles in central Europe he's going to target and I don't know what do you mean by targeting maybe you can lose it us on that but what you know that he's going to target these countries I talk so what does it what does that mean\nAnd and how ... what does what does it mean that he's going to target and how seriously should the u._s. be taking various threats by ... on the IMF treaty pullout\nWell that's exactly what you would think he would say I mean what else is going to do except threaten you know the U.S in countries where we may deploy intermediate range nuclear missiles\nJust like we did a you know in the eighties under Ronald Reagan with that person to is against the says twenties et cetera that were deployed throughout the Warsaw Pact against western nations and so when he means by targeting is is really just putting the court and sort of Warsaw or you know hungry or whatever in the in the uh targeting\nPart time out of that carry this\nTime and this is so you're literally he literally means targeting like like when when I'm a Michael Moore went to Russia to try to find the nuclear missiles that were targeted at a at Detroit is literally he's talking about about changing target coordinates\nOh for sure he he I mean what could I mean my point of that article is that we've seen this all the Ford and this is how we bankrupted the Soviet Union there is no way that Russia\nCan keep up with us economically especially under the Trump economy which\nIn two years maybe pushing seven percent growth there is just absolutely no way they can keep up and he's trying to Boston and then I noticed he went to the United nations and the you know tried to drum up support there to force us to not withdraw from the treaty but this is classic Trump negotiations that you know threaten to try to keep them in the treaty to begin with and had them stop violating what they're doing\nMy guess is Todd more he's a former U.S air force pilot or he is a national security columnist for the Washington Times this piece in the Washington Times an arms race with Russia bring it on I think it will go up on on more as a a Web site certainly will go up on the Andrew my anger show page\nOn Facebook so go and check that out there explained it was a little bit about what ... dot com is because that's that's fascinating to me\nYeah well I Know I have a long history or in Russia studied it in the air force academy that language I learned about the Soviet Union are flying for the air force I traded emerging market down on Wall street for almost Twenty years\nFocusing on Eastern Europe and other countries and so I Know a lot about the region and I just really realized that the west especially Americans in you know middle America or don't know anything really about what's going on over here so\nI have built a team of reporters and we're growing rapidly the traffic is growing and and we're really just trying to bring news analysis culture opinion as to what's happening here\nWell and the important point in and you and I own a lot of talk more about this because I was I was a Soviet Studies major in college myself and so and I also learn the language are you at the very least I Need to rush up on my Russian so I I'm always looking for people to talk to us but the show dog to how to show\nSo I felt my but my my question a lot of sleep people what they don't understand is it is that this is really it's not for food and it's not about\nReestablishing the Soviet Union but it really is about reestablishing the trappings of the Russian Empire and and\nYou're exactly right until the end of things like me\nWell thank you but you got ... [laughter] as I Do not see them all sure claim that a little bit explain explained what that means in the modern context of what a modern Russian Empire looks like\n\nWell I don't know what a modern Russian Empire looks like but I'll tell you what the ultimate looked like it stretched from Poland and people don't notice all the way into San Francisco there's a port roost you can go to in San Francisco yeah exist today as a monument\nAnd so bizarre empire was huge Russia before the Soviet Union was one of the most productive successful countries they said do you are really half the world with their economy and their agriculture and\nAdjust now a hundred years later got back to that point and so that tells you what the Soviet Union did to them it destroyed them economically destroyed them politically culturally I mean what Russia last with the Soviet I'm a you know the full civic revolution is just astounding and I would I Would I don't want that happening here so we had a lot about\nThat but I mean this is this is why this this changing stance visa V. Russia is so important I mean the the idiotic Russian reset that's then secretary of State Hillary Clinton was talking about was completely ineffectual the the the you know it's not just that the Russians only understand strengths it's not quite that\nBut the Russians have to respect your ability to push back and and to know that you're serious about what you're doing I mean don't I mean that's what makes what we're doing now so different than what the Obama administration tried to doing that right\nOf course and if you want collusion early in the Bahamas or they're up their entire administration on down we're the ones that colluded with Russia and still probably are in some ways uh\nAnd we're the ones that clue to do with Russia and still probably are in some ways uh you you look at the uranium so you know those sales you look at what's going on with the Trump dossier cetera I mean there was an intricate interaction with the Russian security services by the bomb in his administration against a political candidate and and so\nIt's just amazing to me that people don't get that still or they don't want to be\nTaught how to folks have folks find out more about what you're up to the good work you're doing it was it how do I get in touch with what I Want to talk Russian whether you're\nA well I can always go to ... dot com T.
