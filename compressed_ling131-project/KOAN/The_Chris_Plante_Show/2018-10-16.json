make the final weeks of the election a referendum on hardline immigration policy hard time\nUh breaking through with that message in a big way is not been the defining issue of the mid term elections and so there is this sense and you see it with hardliners as a sort of regular feature of American politics now that they feel like they were more outrageous if we do something that is more offensive or controversial maybe that will create a rat that\nAirtime [noise]\nAh because he really is in touch with people on immigration right it's not a big issue let me give you some facts here before we get to our guests are the Gallup\nPoll the latest a big poll on the top issue for us\nVoters was back in July or twenty two percent of Americans in July said immigration is the top problem for the United states is up from fourteen percent in June and is the highest percentage naming at issue in Gallup history\nAnd asking the most important or when they asked the most important problem question\nUh again mentioned immigration as the nation's most important problem have averaged only you know five percent of the last Seventeen years the Gallup as an asking the question on generally a monthly basis immigration is the top issue in the United states slightly edging out the economy okay\nAnd it goes on and on about this or a Reuters poll found that Fifteen Percent of registered voters said said immigration and their biggest concern topping economic performance and health care immigration and the writers ... was the top issue for voters in the election\nOr that number is higher of course among Republicans with twenty six percent of the G O P voters citing immigration as their major concern just seven percent of Democrats said the same uh but listen to this\nForty five percent of black voters and forty four percent of Hispanic voters each said that immigration has had a negative impact on their community\nNow why isn't that the CBS you go Paul why is that because\nOf course they live in the areas where immigration has a profound effect on the public schools the healthcare system or in some cases crime a housing the list goes on and on\nThese are the facts Donald Trump is more in touch with the American people on immigration that pretty much any politician alive today he understands that\nJoining us now I'm delighted or he is with US Congressman Tom Garrett Republican from Virginia ... congressional district\nOr he's going to give us a the latest because he sits on the all important House Homeland Security Committee as we see these caravans up and running again with the mass migration from Central America coming into this country because they know there'll be caught in alternately released Congress\nMen I can tell you my listeners are infuriated by this they want Congress to act they want these loopholes closed what can you tell us about what Congress could do in short order to prevent this nonsense off from continuing\nWell every time we passed novelist bill or something massive funding stopgap measure will yank the rug out from underneath the president who wants to keep its promises of securing the border your lead and bumper\nWhere the gentleman that I use that term loosely talked about hardliners on immigration is symptomatic of the fact that the left as co opted the lexicon changed the meaning of words that I'd like for something to do explained to me when\nDefending your national borders and sovereignty became a hard line stance because essentially what they've done is said if you don't want to open borders but you're mean\nAnd the American voting public needs to think hard enough to understand the very ridiculous underlying assumptions that I Am all or a robust unhealthy legal\nImmigration system is I think you are but it is\nAnd help the legal immigration system is I think you are but at what point did securing the worst become\nControversial and and and and why is it that Republicans cut the rug out from underneath the president as a relates to keep his promises on security our borders I Can't figure it out um and and that\nYou well let me tell you about something that happened Congress men is is is very concerning again to my listeners and viewers on Fox\nAh this was a earlier this year when we had the opportunity terrain and these ever broadening asylum categories meaning domestic abuse and fear of gangs or what have been included in the credible fear\nA categories as as affecting social groups in a particular country so a bad effect on certain social groups Jeff Sessions comes along as attorney general and says ... no no no no no\nA domestic domestic abuse and gang membership that's that's not part of what constitutes credible fear\nCongress sadly David Yoder a congressman from Kansas and a ah his ... a democratic ah in ah North Carolina both acted to remove that\nFrom the ongoing congressional action on that so that was gutted by Congress that's the kind of thing that is going to make it more difficult to hold the house of representatives Republicans it's insane that they took they they decided to got what Jeff Sessions wanted to do their\nWell look Kevin Yoder and Kansas has got himself in a tough fight and Republicans always think moderating on the message that got him elected in the first place is some sort of magical formula for reelection\nI disagree dance with the one who Rania um and and so you find yourself in a terrible catch twenty two nobody's listening right that's a joke I'm but I'm I'm a ... if we lose the house maybe will actually get up off our butts during the lame duck session and keep some of the promises we made three or two and a half three years ago\nI got to the upside you know\nThat the Republicans might act like Republicans\nWell I think again this is the most important issue for most Americans are who are answering these polls immigration and the their number one number two and these caravans come into the country if Republicans lose the house it'll get worse not going to get better it's going to get worse uh but\nWhen I said maybe we'll get some some courage right you see you see leader McCarthy now talking about border security and I'm ... I'm Glad he is but I mean why now\nI fear that there's a political motivation what you're saying\nWell again I I'm not I'm not understanding really why Paul Ryan is still in its speaker of the house I think if you're going to retire or they think Paul Ryan is going to turn out to voters and in twenty Eighteen I mean God Bless par and I like um a lot but I you know there's going to turn out to voters the guy who's flying all over the country right now Donald Trump\nAnger and Congress I'm telling you Congress\nIs going to rue the day that that didn't get the money for this law they did an appropriate it and they didn't change the stupid asylum laws that allow people to be gaming the system and then caught\nAnd ultimately released because we do not have the facilities to house them seven hundred thousand people and immigration backlog now ... court backlog claiming credible fear another client that's absurd\nWhoa that's prosecuted for the better part of a decade and domestic violence as a scourge upon any nation but it's hard to prove domestically it's it's real hard to prove when the Clinton emanates from El Salvador\nOh that are saying here\nI can feared alien abduction but that doesn't mean that it's actually happening\nYou know well again I think that's you and you seemed you understand this congressman Garrett but the American people or you know like we we got cities with with the homeless a villages pen villages we got a bitter veterans on the street we have people who never were able to get back on their feet after the great recession or our opioid addicted\nWe need help for those people we cannot we cannot be the saviors of the entire world we can do our best\nBut at some point ... we've got to say you know we're here to focus on the American people and I hope that\nYou take this message back to your colleagues in Congress because I'm telling you people are ... are are a light with if with rage about the situation\nA congressman thank you so much for joining us would definitely do on TV than will take a break a lot more to get too including an outspoken advocate uh against affirmative action don't go to\n\nBill O'Riley here my new book

in federal government money they're literally taking your heart or tax money and using it to discriminate against you\nWell I Am so they take all this money they have billions in an endowment I mean they they could basically get free tuition to almost every student and still be a be swimming and money ah\nBut this would mean the federal government is subsidizing racism a title racism\nOr you know uh affirmative in a more but it's it's not just Harvard more than a hundred universities publicly endorsed racial discrimination in the Supreme Court's Fisher decision or you know\nAffirmative action is a nationwide system of government funded state sponsored racism um and it it shows a huge impact on missions\nSo what what do you um what do you think is going to happen in this court decision I mean the the the\nBelief that diversity is the founding principal of America or is I mean I bet if you pull people in colleges and universities pulled the students most would would cite diversity at the founding American principle of course America's founded on liberty\nNot founded on diversity is founded on liberty but they they think that's sacrosanct the colleges always\nList that as a compelling interest and there are a lot in their defense these lawsuits are that diversity should be a consideration I think the court has said it can be one consideration but it can't be a Supreme Court and the Michigan affirmative action case but it can't be the only consideration correct\nOr you're you're absolutely right\nBut you know I I kind of this is the point I Want to one of the points I made when I spoke at the rally was I I had the opportunity to go to UCLA after I got into medical school and dropped out you see all the the school that doesn't practice affirmative action in admissions and\nI learned that it was possible to have a diverse class of African Americans Hispanics Asian Americans had whites\nWithout practicing racial discrimination is missions so I don't want anyone to believe that affirmative action is essential for a great quality of education you can have a great education just let people in\nBased on merit because there are smart people of all races religions color and creates\nWell the uh the opposition um to your point of view and say that you know you're merely your your\nGoals would merely penalize those who have been systematically subjected to racism so there's historical racism in the United states\nA vast we must give a leg up or special consideration to those who come from that class of Americans so that it is fair then because\nHistorically they were subjected to this type of a systemic racism\nOr I Would argue in many ways it is the ultimate form of racism to assume that blacks and Hispanics and Native Americans on my dad\nCan't compete ah based purely on racial grounds I think that all races can compete on a fair playing field and UCLA and UC Berkeley and uh the University of Michigan and other schools across the country which don't use affirmative action or living proof of that\nYeah well ah this genie park who's Harvard Asian American alliance president was on MSNBC and made this point\nI'm laughing is not about protecting Asian American brought by an anti civil rights act and then had were well white rights activists who was trying to bring down marrying someone writes actions in American society town and ultimately about his goal to bring down some of the\nMission that is actually designed to increase their angry African name increasing the make education better for everyone which is good for Asian Americans found\nA your response to that [noise]\nAh affirmative action is racial discrimination against Asian Americans all of the statistical evidence shows that it is much harder to get into college graduate school as an Asian American for every student who graduated from Harvard costs like her who is a harsh shoot at Harvard\nOr who was an Asian American there was an equally qualified Asian American student somewhere in America who got rejected because of the schools racially discriminatory affirmative action policies those Spiegel spoke at the Asian American coalition\nOffer education's Raleigh a just a couple of days ago so they're speaking for the few who got in ... there is a massive number who are victims of racial discrimination from schools like Harvard\nHow do you think this is going to turn out this court decision and then you can never guess depends on the judge you get depends on a lot of different factors but how do you think this was going to come down\nUh it it it comes down to a ... it it comes down to ... for the first time in our nation's history we have an anti affirmative action majority in the Supreme Court\nAh we have a Justice Department who was on our side who sees this as racism or a President Trump has been our greatest ally\nOur fight to end racial discrimination against Asian Americans and whites in the form of affirmative action or so because we have this powerful la ... who is a champion for equal access to education for Asian Americans and white people uh I think that India and we may prevail\nOr going to be that this is probably going to go on for some time on the federal district court level then to a court of appeals and ah if they determine a circuit split on this to the Supreme Court\nUm VJ this is fascinating ah we've got to get you on TV you got to come on TV with us soon a v J in them now his book almost black the true story of how I got into medical school by pretending to be black\nOr what do you think about this the ... it's racial bean counting and the words of some it's contrary to what we hope that we would achieve a colorblind society\nA and does it encourage more resentment among various a minority groups and others I instead of just respect for talent and individual merit aid five five forty Laura your reaction to this and a lot more coming up [noise]\n\n\nWhether or not you're for or
