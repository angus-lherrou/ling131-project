I'm a physician and I watched the testimony and my comment was it was pretty clear that Dr Ford is a troubled person and I think anybody who watch the testimony or comes up to that conclusion and she admitted that she has had psychological issues\nI said that in a in a in a interview and I was accused of saying I said that she couldn't be trusted now\nI didn't say that but that's the that's what the media water portray\nThey have an agenda and and that's that's what's so different now than from Thirty years ago the agenda is so obvious is so parents\nAre for many many members of the media this president thank goodness is speaking out against it uh you know calling calling it on its face and uh that has that had to be gone and of course he gets criticized where he goes out to\nA congressman Harris thank you so much for that update you're listening to Laura Ingraham show eight five five forty Laura we'll get to all your calls in\nA more information on this uh Monica McLean\nAre here we go she was a friend of she has a friend of a Ford's a so Ford was in ... beach Delaware on July twenty six twenty Eighteen\nAnd her lifelong friend ... Monica McClain who worked as an attorney or for a P. O. Y. which is I'm In the D. O.

McLean anyone who is ... it was talking to her at the time including anyone from Feinstein's office\nOf that needs to be out\nAll of it\nDo you agree with me that you cannot allow people to get away

demeanor and said oh I don't remember I don't remember what I did when I was in high school I Would have really the story but I didn't believe it\nI didn't believe her allegations from the gecko just

correct thing to say it's like saying Santa Claus exists\nI I think anybody that looks at her testimony objectively would say it wasn't credible and\nMr Trump President Trump is willing to hope that

a five five forty Laura uh this is going to go down as one of the hardest fought confirmations and Supreme Court history if not the most difficult\nAh but in the end I think it's worth it you know why you can't reward people who make false charges you can't reward people who make allegations after the process has gone through with no contemporaneous cooperation who have\nSome type of axe to grind can't do it and same goes with these people showing up in the Senate and cornering people in elevators none of this should be allowed it's a game of intimidation they're playing it\nWe know people who

one\nThis is Corey Booker please get up in the face of some congresspeople representative Maxine Waters they're not going to be able to go to a restaurant go to a gas station go to shop at a department store their\nAbsolute get up and absolutely harass them Nancy Pelosi I don't know why they aren't uprising all over the country I mean it goes on to tell me again while we shouldn't confront Republicans were they eat where they sleep where they work until they stop being complicit\nThis is outrageous law and if it if it doesn't do anything else that should serve to wake us up you're exactly right Democrats had been playing office for the last hundred years this time for Republicans to stop being a minority party in ... and and grow and grow up and\nYou don't have to grow up and become a you know stop playing defense this is this is the time right now\nA senator Purdue uh there's so much a that it's happening a which is positive\nOr in this administration the news has

know didn't took actually work to do this like Nineteen months of work I and and you must hear nothing out of this huge lower milestone for this administration\nIt's huge but it's part of it is part of what's going on this this economy is growing at twice the rate it did under President Obama we have a new free trade agreement with South Korea were about how wall with Mexico and Canada Europe is talking about zero terrorists we have China paying stepping up and paying attention to us now we have a nuclear\nConversation going on with North Korea to to end up in the ... of North Korea this presents agendas working at all we talk about is what the Democrats want us to talk about that is what you're saying is that we need to be on the op is talking about what's working in this gender before we get into these elections in a few weeks\nI I can tell you the senator no one's going to want to try to stop me moving in a public street or try to harassment or restaurant okay this is a new I tolerate that anyone comes up in my family and my kids they they they better be they'd been it'd be really ready because this is a ... I'm not intimidated\nBy some rich kid who lives at home with his parents than in his free time you know jumps on the move on dot org website to get his marching orders okay like go home to rich parents and and and who pay for your your three square meals a day and you're you're you know your your activism on the side I mean I just it just doesn't impress me I call these people right after their faces\nLaw that's what we're going to be under the this week and a storage right here in the United states at people who are supporting this actively encouraging inciting it we have a state representative that actually was involved in our altercation on Monday a state representative\nFrom Arizona okay of all places here and watch these are not genuine people were asked her about oh Dr Ford or anything else they are paid activists this is a George Soros conspiracy and it's time we wake up expose them in stand up and fight for our country because that's what's at stake here\nYou think we have enough Republican money bags types to counter the effort is dire and Soros because they're just pumping tens of millions of dollars in Baltimore into voter registration and two are educating people in these training session\nAnd to voter registration and two are educating people in these training sessions on how to approach new voters\nUh this is you know they're going to the ... the new a Puerto Rican voters and in Florida and and land on line on them like oh\nTrump aides you and you had to throw the Republicans out in Georgia you see this tight governor's race which is really disturbing to Stacey Abrams Abrams who's they lost\nWeight or Georgia could elect a left wing Stacey Abrams to be governor great state of Georgia\nThis is what you were saying earlier one of the one of the good byproducts of this is I think it's awakened the Republican base\nA was a little pass it particularly in Georgia maybe this year but I'll tell you this\nUm that race in Georgia has drawn thirty million dollars from a a Mike Bloomberg and ... and two other California investors what they're doing is they're California investors and New York donors are trying to sneak into Georgia instill that governor's race because they believe that's the way to the presidency and twenty twenty to get those electoral votes down there\nAnd it's just not going to happen we're not going to let that happen Laura\nI'm David Perdue a hearing the learning them show\nA Jeff Flake yesterday seemed to kind of shift the goalposts a little on Kavanaugh or maybe it was just commenting on his overall demeanor with the committee let's listen\nI was very troubled by the the tone of the of the remarks or the initial a defense that a judge ... capital I gave a ... was something I Hope that I Would sound that indignant if I were a if I felt that I was unjustly\nMaligned but then it went on and the interaction with the members were sharp and partisan and that concerns me\nA year reaction was concerning to you Kevin ... face of a old club at your\nFloor he did exactly what I Would have expected them to do he was in ... and he should have been listening to what these guys are saying Chris Coons says if judge Kavanaugh seeking a lifetime appointment this Marine Corps\nAnd who I think now bears the bears the burden of this proving these allegations the presumption of innocence has been a trashed in this whole process it gets not convenient for the Democrat\nI mean they talk about him being Cory Booker again cause him evil\nOr the other one said a Yale alum said people will die I mean the vernacular here has risen to a level that we haven't seen in decades Laura and it's dangerous Republicans had better not be asleep at this because these people are now mobilized they're funded\nAnd quite frankly this is just the ... the tip of the spear of what their ... activity I actually\nA Center for do in Georgia just going back briefly to this very tight governor's race\nUh what is your sense what are the people need to know I'm again this was this poll by landmark pretty decent polling outfit I likely voters um and it was basically a forty five forty five dead heat or the governorship is very important for so many reasons the state of Georgia\nA and the growth the economic growth and George has been very strong ah but what could a left wing governor due to that grows\nWell here's what they what she's saying she wants to single payer and she won't always give away programs that would cause a state taxes to be tripled this is the most extreme liberal progressive candidate that Georgia has ever had and she's getting funded by all these outside donors not donors in Georgia by the way\nAnd so what's happening is all of this conversation about war women everything else has confused issue Georgia right now is rated the best state in the country and which to do business and she wants to tear that that\nWe have a great Republican candidate Brian Kemp is going to make a great governor and Republican so they get the vote out we will win that election\nI think that the people of Georgia and maybe they've gotten a little a little bit of an awakened awakening during the entire cabinet ideal I think camp should make this a huge issue down there and push and push this uh this Stacey Stacey Abrams enough just come out on the cabinet thing\nThat I Would push a right to the wall and on nothing I mean it in the figurative way not literal way so don't start talking about if you didn't say anything anymore everyone's in every little word you say like slice and dice buddies left wing groups again funded by George Soros hateful little people in their basements\nUm but I I Hope they continue to press the issue because I think can't imagine that people in Georgia like what they say", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Chris Plante Show", "city": "Anchorage", "day": "03"}
