pick up the phone and call trinity just let them put together a program and see how affordable\nBut I think we all ought to set an example of civility and so for US Senator to say get in their face for congresswoman like her to say get in your face\nAnd then what happens is uh the president's press secretaries and Senator Cruz or pushed out of restaurants that are surely\nThat is encouraged by what are these congresswoman and senators are saying and it's wrong\nUh I Believe in a freedom of association freedom of speech freedom to demonstrate\nBut it ought to be peaceful and you shouldn't do anything that's going to encourage violence because even if or a congresswoman doesn't in Ghana violence there's some people that are going to take it one step further than she intended and she needed to back off about ... steps and a and not\nSurely not be in your face if you're going to have a democratic and representative government function properly\nUh I got to be a ... you know a few feet away we got to have a a discussion a dialogue I got to have respect for people that disagree with me and she ought to respect for people that disagree with our\nBut in your face is in a way to do it\nWell she said a year\nAgo that she was going to take Donald Trump out\nAnd what does that mean let me see that this I'm lesbian or gay algae Beatty dinner and she goes into them and take him out\nThat she wasn't saying take 'em out for dinner and she's like take him out and telling people that get harassed in restaurants and it seems like that that message really has terminated the permanent protest a\nMentality in the Democrat Party senator and and my concern is that someone's going to end up getting hurt we already had Steve ... shot you would have thought that the that the Democrats would have calmed everyone down after that but when you have Susan Collins been cornered in an elevator\nIt's one thing when Jeff Flake is cornered an elevator but then you pour all Susan Collins yeah people being ... screen data centimeter from their face while they're trying to walk down a hallway I mean\nWhat can be done about this\nWell ah obviously for those of us that are in public office and in in public places and we're confronted with that and they're doing it under what they think is First Amendment rights the only thing you can count on as a police protection we have\nBut then you can have police protection for four or five hundred and thirty five members of Congress every place they are spread throughout the United states even relying upon local police or you can't do that as well so are are are\nI've come to the conclusion and this repetitive of whatever kind of already said to you but are a democracy will be a stronger a whiz respectful political discourse as opposed to what is happening or when you a quote unquote get in their face\nWell what what senator what responsibility does something like a Dianne Feinstein or Cory Booker or Kamala Harris have to to speak against this type of harassment and intimidation isn't just carrying assigning and chanting some things this is cornering women in elevators this this is something and we have\nWe have people threatening to kill Kavanaugh teachers in Minnesota I mean people are taking this all the hard if you if you say someone's like a combination of not seeing a sexual predator enough time\nSome whack a doodle is going to you know take take matters into his or her own hands got help it so what responsibility does the Democrat leadership had here\nUh I don't think they're going to exercise it but they gotta they gotta responsibilities ...\nOh I Would I Would I'm waiting for that ah I'm waiting for that undergrad there\nGo ahead you wait a long time I think all we drive [laughter] Senator Grassley are\nThe lessons learned from this cabin on saga of many of us thought that in the beginning when we had to put up the hearing and and kicking off from the Thursday vote initially kick it off to Monday and then it got delayed because of the Ford allegations\nAny thoughts to solidifying the rules so you can't extend hearings pass the close of the original hearing date so these kind of anonymous allegations can't drop and make a difference again\nWell I've read your\nTweets when you took me to tears called me for ... for not calling for a whole bunch of but you can't you can't you know if I'd call the vote today you on we went along we we will tend to tend to eleven so you got to have some respect for people that are on the job here are you doing it\nAnd so we we waited until we had the votes\nYeah no I corrected myself after that I didn't delete the tweet because I set it on but I corrected myself and and you and you and McConnell both\nHindered handled this master fleet in the face of incredibly difficult and I think I'm a I'm\nHighly emotional highly charged atmosphere and when people say that Dr Ford was disrespected which is a guest on my show said last night she was disrespected I said oh my gosh Senator Grassley said what if you need something repeated or you know if you are you okay do you need anything I mean you couldn't have been more ...\nYeah or you know if you are you okay do you need anything I mean you couldn't have been more so lifted its of Dr Ford I I Can't imagine how you could have been frankly\nGo well it reminds me of how I was confronted by Iowans because uh in the Thomas hearings because I was filming torn either ill and I never ask a single question but I was sitting beside specter that did are questioning and everybody thought I was factor [laughter]\n\nOh my goodness I'm Senator Grassley a there was another moment that\nI have to get you to react to um this is Heidi Heitkamp of course Democrat North Dakota undecided divide vote against Kavanaugh a lot of people have talked about whether the\nCourt remains legitimate you heard Hillary say that it's a shame that things happen as they happen because the court always was respected and this is what senator hide camps then\nYou're obviously in the midst of a very tough reelection fight and I know you you feel voting the way you did was the right way do you worry are you concerned that may have cost you your sentences\nAt the end of the day you'll have to look at yourself in the mirror and think about what your future holds if you compromise something like this based on politics and I I Believe the yes vote would have compromised um my true belief that um this person's um did not have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court\nThey're still repeating that the temperament issues Senator Grassley\nHe listened this gets back to what our already told you you got twelve successful years on the DC circuit the second most important\nA court in the land he's been college all or even people like Garland a said that he had that sort of a approach to judging\nAnd that means judicial temperament and not only are you have a personality that is a temperate you also leave your personal views out of\nOut of a decision making you look at the law and look at the uh uh get facts of the gays and just to use those two things to go by so consequently a it what what she said surrender hiking said plus your question brings me\nTo a history of Thomas\nOr is it going to hurt the Supreme Court I listen to the same thing\nTwenty eight years ago and then I look at twenty eight years record of Thomas on the court and I've never seen any retribution on his part towards anything that was set against him at that time and he was mad when he said he was going through our high tech\nIn Shanghai ... or something like ...\nYeah so so uh you know after twenty eight years or less the same thing about Thomas not seeing it I think that I got great confidence that Kavanaugh's going to bring\nGreat press stage and knowledge and academic background and more importantly his work on the second highest court ...\nCourt and it's all positive\nNo it's it's ... he's the one in the most qualified people period of time to sit on the court a Senator Grassley the uh the Susan Collins hum situation in main course all these leftist billionaires promising a to flood\nOr the her opponent whoever that ends up being a with lots of money you want to raise three million dollars for Susan Collins and I know Mitch McConnell has said the same thing how was that looking\nWell we're just getting started at that but a conservative even though a lot of times they disagree\nWith Susan Collins they gotta look at her as a senator of great principal\nAnd we need to respect that and I said three million it's going to take a lot more than three million director but they raised ... million against her so our goal is three million dollars right now and everybody that artery specter and want cabin on on the porch onto a\nGo along that line and I opened a rallying cry\nFor Republicans over the next twenty eight days between now and the
