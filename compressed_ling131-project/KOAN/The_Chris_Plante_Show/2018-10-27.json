I I'm Sorry I'm not going to call it that we step back I don't mean that in what I mean is that you have Democrats who will\nPerpetrate these kinds of crimes\nAs a way of raising the stink you know I'm a there was a of feminist activist in Wyoming or who had claimed that she was being threatened it turned out she was standing threatening emails to herself or the same thing happened just recently with another democratic activist a on a college campus up you know at this issue of\nFolks who claimed to put up I'm the founder of anti Semitic graffiti are only to a racist graffiti only to find out that it was in fact done by the people who they claimed it was all we've seen this happen before [noise]\nThat's why I tend to discount of these things are let's go to a let's go to Mike in Texas Mike welcome to the lower income show\nThank you a question that should be at the one that we heard many times over and they got five weeks ago by liberal under our during the cabin on hearing or not wise

asked\nIf it's a lot and it's a lot and questioned in in in in the law cui bono who who who to whom is there a benefit to this and I think you are you are correct in that regard I mean this is the again if it fits in with ... razor here\nI'm a you know the the simplest explanation is usually the correct one and I know I I've said that a couple of different times they don't want to make sure that a hammer that point home so that we talk about these things um but that's also why I I Do think that we cannot discounts\nWe cannot discount or that the Russians might be involved here in some way shape or form such as you want to have this conversation or a yesterday with a a Russia expert who who did tell me he did not think\nDid not think that the FSB the Russian foreign intelligence service was involved in this he did nevertheless say but on the other hand there is strong evidence to indicate\nThat those are ... you know the camera when and his brother up as your car up in Boston that they may very well have been trained in influenced by the Russians\nThat they are all sorts of weird things that were going on with their radicalization and and that the way that they built this they're bomb there pressure cooker bomb is not something that would have been readily available on the Internet and so uh that that I found fascinating there is a real benefits\nAre real benefit a continuing benefit to a lot of foreign powers or by this continued a discontent in a in the United states affect somebody tweeted it I don't have it in front of me you know or that the Russians would very much like Democrats in power that's true to an extent\nBut what the Russians are really wants is they want chaos or my thank you very much for the call listen when we come back\n'cause I didn't want to talk a little bit about the primaries in a couple of folks have asked me to talk about the caravan and the chairman situation we are going to talk about that in the last hour the show are going to be joined by Steve Cortez a because it it all fits into what's going on here\nAbout we're going to be joined by state representative Katie Arrington uh she's from South Carolina she's running in the south Carolina's first congressional district I Want to talk a little bit about what I call the fly over effect\nOr how we cannot discount what is happening on the ground in these states in a

our power how would the Democrats and it's just ridiculous\nSo my opponent Joe Cunningham rough the mayor of Los Angeles Garcetti\nHere to campaign wow do I need to go any further\nDo you really you really don't I mean that that seems that you know it's one of those things I often talk about you know when you do public speaking you have to know who your audience is I Can't imagine that a guard city from LA played well in the first congressional district of South Carolina\n[noise] it just it because it let's be brutally honest with everybody on on the right you know\nDemocrats don't have a platform this year not to say in the past Democrats haven't had something good but they don't have anything to talk about we should be focusing on the fact that we had the best economy we have had in generation no yeah the lowest them wind that amber\nAnd if people don't see that they I I just can't put my arms around it but I Believe that Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters are toxic to this country they are toxic they're all about the rhetoric is all about the negativity they embody the exact opposite of what an American should be\nWe should stand proud and strong to gather as a country\nMy ... my ... South Carolina state representative to the Arrington choose the Republican candidate for Congress in the first congressional district on and on that point you know nobody ... obviously off the front pages today\nBut this was we got a the the third quarter GDP a measurements today we knew we were going to be getting those obviously nobody is talking about them or because of um ah ah because of the other things that are in the news the suffix bomb story\nOr and and we now have a a GPA of three point five percent of the third quarter\nA President Obama when he was an office said we were never gonna see\nGDP above two percent of the Trump McConnell is turning that around obviously this is very important to other folks you're talking to the see this in terms of jobs and more money in their pockets are how are they on those sort of uh the Trump tax and regulatory agenda one of those same to you about that\nWell they all love more money in our pockets Trump the you know tax agenda is positive it's up to Congress to get tax judo path we need to ensure that small businesses and the middle class\nGet permanent tax relief absolutely paramount we have to do that that is that's going to be a huge focus on going into session but other than that when you know we're looking at the regulatory you know I have some big manufacturers in my area of bowling being one of them shore and they just four hundred new people\nThe terrorists no one likes to tear up no one likes to tear\nBut President Trump is standing firm and putting America First and that it's imperative we need to remember that this is dumb the world's best negotiator let the man do his job you don't regulate it got\nNo no go ahead go ahead please reducing regulations\nAnd think well I get ... to let businesses thrive is what we need to do I mean we government the fundamental belief and I'll get Senator Tom Davis and the state of South Carolina credit because he told it to me and it's been part of my ...\nDemocrat fundamentally believe government is set up problem and Republican believe government is the problem and that is what Trump is doing the government's the problem is getting rid of it\nFinally got Congress working within on that and we have to keep the momentum going it is paramount as my what like far\nAs my colleague at the Competitive Enterprise Institute Wayne Cruz says you don't have to teach the grass how to grow you just have to remove the rocks from their lawn and he's already been ... that sort of my one of my other barely works is is the is this issue regulations\nBut but you know it's and it's interesting because you talk about this issue of negotiation and and and Trump [noise]\nUm I I have a I had formulated a theory on what I call Trump's rules of acquisition I'm a star trek Duke\nThis is a for a new thing for a new rules that I was ... and ... number one is always be willing to walk away from the table\nRight we're number two is sometimes in order to demonstrate your opponent\nYou're willing to walk away from the table you have to walk away from the table and rule number three is don't pre negotiate with yourself I mean this is this is the great folly\nOf a of a you know democratic negotiators trade negotiators over the years is that they've always ... and then eventually inevitably sold out American interests\nAnd so we are you understand probably Boeing is unhappy about a tariff on let's say aluminum or steal or what have you but nevertheless it is in go shooting to to to take the strongest positions don't you think\nOh absolutely and we need to remind ourselves that that you know I look at what we're going through right now it's like a child getting inoculated we know they're going to have a fever for a day is going to be a little bit cranky for a minute they're going to live a lifetime and never get sick\nYou have to prepare ourselves I mean this is it it it really is our country group you are the greatest nation on this

going to stand tall again\nI just you know I was going to ask you about about how your constituencies are looking at this this bomb plots thing but I really want to focus more on substance here\nI I

undo all of the great games here what how does he proposed to how's he proposed the ... the economy jumpstart it\nNot that smart [laughter] the only thing he's\nDone the only thing he runs on is watching it and he says I'm for offshore drilling in South Carolina well yeah no one is because there's no oil out there [laughter]\nOnly thing he he is\nRunning on a platform of I'm going to stop offshore drilling from South Carolina wow and I said yes and well number one he doesn't understand the job of\nThat's not their job that the president ... put that aside and then he comes out what he's the only one who's had bipartisan experience well the only thing he has experience in doing is lying to some people about offshore oil getting them to endorse him otherwise there's no one\nHe has nothing I debated him was it ever get to a point in your your you know in an argument with somebody and you're down and there's just no response from them\nThat with mine debate with this guy boil

out there I Need help sharing in that time on any support Republicans wherever you live in this country the port can candidates we need to stand strong together and now it's\nYou know and I don't even

into a calculator or something with\nStamps on there that have not been cancelled wow what reason or not and Andrew is because those are called SP ours which stands for small parcels and rules that can't go through the processing machine\nSure when you get a letter that goes through the machine a machine just spray it the cancellation on there for efficiency of speed it doesn't do that with those types of packages had those packages had a\nPipe and they're not a PVC pipe but their actual lead pipe or something that could do damage\nYes it would have way too much and it would've alerted people that there's something wrong with this so that's not a gone through a clerk clerk at the counter well what kind of ask them questions and cancel ... stamp\nShore so for the fact that they're not canceled there's not that unusual\nLet me ask you this and ... who are running short on time here but real quick so it without it being cancelled how would they be able to track them back from New York to Florida\nWell I think that's probably a a they're basing it on the fact that one of them was male and then ended up with a with being returned to Florida I'm\nI'm I'm not exactly sure how they

certain countries so that those countries can get them out of their their continuous ... ... it's interesting you talk about this\nHe talked about the issues of national security\nAnd I've been down to the southern border and I urge anybody in every one if you've never been down to the border go down to the border in in uh in Arizona and California\nAnd watch you know there's highways that that travel right along the border I Wanna say five five I don't remember notes on I think that that goes north south I think it's I attend interstate ten goes right along the border there\nAnd I've watched people cross the border it is a scary prospect even if people are not coming you know into commit harm but the idea of similar kinds of plea walk across this patch of land and and my great that that is a frightening prospect to me then I'm thinking as he was relative\nOf course and by the way you know people want to make us seem like we're a xenophobic a you know paranoid people because we talk about uh the the danger of course border here's the reality the president was far off by the way when he said that you know there could be middle Easterners or for example we had no idea it was causing here's what we do know\nAnd this is a conspiracy theory nonsense citizen from some far right you know ... the Laredo station at the border patrol tells us that this year they have already arrested six hundred Bangladeshis\nAre crossing illegally now why do I mentioned that because obviously Mexico's a very long way from what I'm saying that that also happens to be a country that has a real problem with Islamic terrorists or so there are reasons for us to to fully that anyone coming here\nFrom Bangladesh even coming legally but the fact that they're coming illegally to Mexico I think it's very I sure and tells us you know that we don't know who's kind would be caught six hundred how many have we not caught\nUm so it doesn't make sense for economic security it doesn't make sense for national security\nIt's not fair to legal immigrants there are just so many reasons why we have to stop it and I think we need to get Mexico to do their part when you use trade as the leverage and say we're going to start trade restrictions and by the way that doesn't work\nIf it comes to do it we will see all this border there will be no trade from Mexico I Hope we don't have to get that Kony and but I think that option has to at least be on the table so that we don't have the crisis of them actually crossing the border walking across as happens too often as you mentioned\nAnd by the way the interstate that I was looking for the interstate eight is south of interstate panic goes right along the border in in Arizona and California and my guest is Steve Cortez and we're talking about this it it's funny because I come back to you set a thing about being a phobia and I I Want to also make it very clear I've said this a little bit earlier on on the show\nBut one of the one of the great things about America the thing that makes America the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth is affected anybody can come to America and become an American\nRight that that is that is in a central element of who we are it's a wonderful thing it's something you can't find anywhere else so you go just about anywhere else do you go in the world but I can move to France today\nI could live in ... in France for another Thirty years I Will never be considered French Japan in the same thing Korea the same thing\nBut anybody can come to America and and become an American it's the beauty of who we are we're just saying that you have to do it within the process you have to do it legally you and you cannot expect if you're going to come up here on moss\nAnd and do something about it so the president's talking about deploying troops down to the southern border\nUm there is a lot of discussion as to whether or not this violates ... I don't believe that it does having read the various statutes that are out there where do you come down on this\nRight now I don't think so because it's a clear danger to our orders external dangerous so you know I don't think it done by the way I'm so glad you made that point two of you know look the mainstream media you played that Joe Scarborough and he was just\nRidiculous morning yes totally insulting to America trying to make this a racial issue they often do that by the way when they don't want to talk policy what do they do they just call this race of course and and tried to dismiss us but here's here's the reality\nAh America's not a race or you know as you point out right and if you believe in our values and our constitution\nAnd if you're going to bring work ethic and skills that we need a than we want you to become illegal immigrant and you're so right the second you are you're an American no questions asked that doesn't happen in the rest of the world so this is not about race remotely a it is about citizenship\nAnd it is about borders and it's largely by the way I pointed out to the Joe Scarborough is largely about protecting\nAmerican citizens many of whom happen to be minorities a black and Hispanic American I Believe soccer more than anyone\nFrom tolerating illegal immigration or why because many of them are working class people who have to compete in the labor market against illegal immigrant labor so it actually harms black and brown Americans perhaps the most of all to tolerate porous border\nYou know my my my my colleagues see motley and less government dot dot org has talked to a great deal of about that issue about the sort of the economics of this as well in the end for me it comes down to issues of national security it comes down to issues of sovereignty\nI if we don't control who is migrating here uh them in any nation any nation that doesn't control who's coming in is pretty soon finds itself without a nation and we certainly don't want that sea of Cortez how do we find out more about what you were up to\nYou know I'm On CNN most nights be on there and we're not tonight and on Twitter at court as the C O R G E S C\nWill listen I appreciate that will put up ... show page I'm sure we have links up in ... thank you so much for joining us today\nThanks for having me free ... and it's interesting 'cause he was talking about the issues of of people of color in America\nA and one of the things that I wanted to get to today I really didn't get a chance to get to was this issue of\nUh the president speaking tonight at a gathering of conservative African Americans are they're going to be posted at the White House today and then they're doing the gala event tonight here in Washington DC uh you know the president is really doing what he can because\n... right it's funny or the American dream is about everybody it is about every but it's about bringing everybody in and the only way you can do that is by creating the conditions whereby everybody can succeed\nWe've talked about this about sort of good economic news today uh the the we have the GDP out a GDP is that a third quarter GDP a three point five percent a\nTenth of a percentage point above a where it was expected that as a immeasurably good news and yet and yet we're not talking about this by the way I Am taking your tweets I I did get them I've as I said I Do read the critical tweets here\nKevin tweets and Andrew\nPlease stop saying ah every two seconds when I get excited to fix up eight when I get excited I I tend to speak over myself and I get a little closer to my speech be when I'm looking at breaking news on the TV sometimes I get a little distracted by that so I Do apologize\nSometimes I Do try to work very hard on my on my verbal textbook Kevin thank you so very much for listening so intimately to that\nA Patty writes in on Twitter by the way you can tweet at me and Andrew underscores anger\nPatty rides I found you good job filling in for Laura we need evidence confirmed if this is a liberal sending the bombs uh it must be what idiot we keep sending the bombs with so much attention didn't Brennan have rights than confirm sent to him I got to go back and look at that I don't remember a friend and got it I Know a bunch of conservatives did certainly it was sent to folks\nAt the Pentagon a Bible certainly double\nServices did certainly was sent to folks at the Pentagon a Bible certainly double check on that we got a couple of more minutes here on the show\nBefore recalls out for the day I'll continue to take your tweets at Andrew underscore Langer continue to take your phone calls\nEight five five forty Laurie is the number eight five five four zero L.

estimator built rocket five hundred expensive\nFrom him in a mall\nWelcome back to the Mayo Clinic radio I'm Dr time shy and I'm tracing McCray\nFor best token about women and heart health with Mayo Clinic carts expert art specialist I crochet I have\nWe talked about pregnancy and heart but what about heart diseases women age especially after medical laws\nWhich leads us to where I met her a matter of fact more than one in three adult women has some form of cardiovascular disease Dr Hayes is that a matter of fact it would be a fact oh boy we price for women when you talk about this absolutely yeah and\nIn that in that statistic we do include hypertension which is a on the rise and increases with the each year of age particularly and women after menopause was it that a great segue\nHa ha [laughter] ... just one of those things that again like we said with childbirth or I didn't really consider what heart health white impact that might have on my pregnancy I wouldn't think about it about a menopause relation but of course it is well it is in probably it's\nKnown honestly because we have as women age they they have gotten this boost perhaps a protection but compared to men of about ten years they get about a ten year grace they present with high blood pressure and heart attacks on average about ten years later than men\nNow there are some exceptions to that because women who are are diabetic actually it eliminates all of that advantage but um for instance women's blood pressure tends to be lower than men up until about the age of menopause around age fifty and then women's\nBlood pressure starts going up man's stays high but it leveled off\nSo it is a time in life that is both a change related to changes in hormones but I think pointing out it's not an abrupt change an abrupt uptick but think about other things that happened to women around\nNot an abrupt change an abrupt uptick but think about other things that happened to women around the er at age fifty fifty one which is the average age of medical us\nOff and they become empty nesters they have changes in jobs changes in physical activity they get a bomb near plant or ... and they get less active there a lot of things that come around that time that can confound and worse and an increased risk for cardiovascular disease has a special time\nIs a is a free and go and I just feel sorry [laughter]\nDoes estrogen help protect the hurt\n[noise] so complicated question\nUm we believe so um the endogenous or the estrogen that is in our bodies in during the pre menopausal state we think that that is because they're estrogen receptors on every blood vessel when the body and it keeps women's blood vessels um elastic and healthier\nIt's more complicated though in terms of and I don't want any of the listeners to hear that yes oh that means I should add estrogen back to protect my heart after menopause so the women's health initiative showed that at least in older women who are a few years past menopause adding estrogen back\nDidn't help them didn't help their heart\nIt may be and this is the the the question that continuing it at a low dose if you're already healthy heart I'm early after menopause might be something but the general rule is we don't recommend adding estrogen back after menopause laws to protect the heart at this point\nSo let's talk about the distribute the risk factors are going to do the same for for men and women and they're the same risk factors essentially for erectile dysfunction Alzheimer's disease interestingly but show diabetes obesity\nHigh blood pressure smoking smoking a sedentary lifestyle lack of a activity cholesterol\nYeah cholesterol triglycerides and women so lip it's as holes in it um the standard total cholesterol we've kind of moved away from and just saying well over two hundred you have ... high cholesterol because you can have other factors and you're a cholesterol that puts you at higher risk\nUm particularly for women elevated triglycerides um which is another fat in the blood that is more influenced by dietary sugars 'em and carbohydrates as opposed to fats and genetics [noise]\nThe other is where you put on your fat and so on this planet [laughter]\nSo you can be normal weight but if you have a ... distribution that his mainly in your middle\nAnd your waistline as opposed and your hips and buys for women and for men that conveys an increased risk and so when you start gaining weight I'm even going from normal weight to higher weight which often happens as we get older I'm puts women it even higher risk\nHow important do the activity uh especially postman\nApplause so when people ask me what's the most important thing I can do to prevent heart disease if there are smoker that's number one number two is physical activity and the reason I say that is there's such\nA deep and broad strong evidence that it makes an impact not only for cardiovascular disease but for Alzheimer's and for bones and for osteoporosis and for preventing falls and being strong\nSo physical activity is great [noise] the other part is it's never too late to start physical activity we actually have scientific studies that say that women who start out and walking program over the age of sixty five actually reduced their risk of heart disease from the nurses how study so it's free\nIt's not sexy however and it's a hard habit to adopt if you hate exercise as some of my patients do you feel like your patients are getting that message and are trying to become more active in mid life\nSo I think women are so busy and one of the things so the the answer is yes but ... but I think getting back to why I'm women don't take time to take care of themselves\nWomen are raised in a culture rate it to be caregivers their moms they are you know they're the group's leaders there often even if they're in the workforce there the moms at work and and so often when we ask women even who had a heart attack why don't you make this change or eat healthy or exercise\nI don't have time because I'm driving my kids um my husband wouldn't eat that healthy food so I'm just going to make it\nAnd so flipping it so that they know that if they can do those things they will accomplish those other goals I eat caregiving and making an altruistic thing which can be very helpful and that's been my biggest success in helping people frame it when I don't have time because none of us have enough time to do this thing's its priorities\nWe've talked about uh the the major risk factors and how important it is to keep all of those under control and exercise is extremely important let me ask you about a couple of other things with regard to heart disease prevention or there's been some recent controversy a baby aspirin a day\nWhat's your feeling about that in women who don't have a history of heart disease\nSo that's an important distinction to make because nothing has changed in terms of our recommendations if you've had a heart attack a stent or have a have had cardiovascular disease you should be on a baby aspirin unless your doctor tells you otherwise [noise]\nFor individuals male and female particularly older individuals who are otherwise healthy don't have diabetes don't have other things\nThe risk of taking aspirin and people don't think about that they just because it's non prescription or actually grader or outweigh or at least are equal to any benefits at one time\nVery much stomach bleeding mainly a\nStomach and other types of bleeding because it it irritates the stomach but also you can get bleeding into your brain and women and everything we do and every medication and every intervention and cardiology women bleed more so if it's a risk for men it's a bigger risk for women or it to show\nA fish or it was very popular I'm a five or six years ago until we started actually having data from randomized clinical trials\nSo I I asked if I have somebody come into my office in their own fish will ask why you're taking them because there are other reasons than heart disease you might take fish oil\nBut I tell him to stop it is yeah because it's really not been shown to have any primary prevention benefit or really even secondary prevention would if they don't like fish and they think I don't like fish so I'll just take visual tablets so probably doesn't help okay so that recommendations is eat fish a couple of times a week\nIt's not harmful but people who are also on blood thinners it ... if you take high dose fish oil it actually can then your blood more than I Am a less is more I go through every patient list I say why are taking it while you're taking it while you're taking it and they say I don't know I said then asked the doctor who prescribed it for why are you buying it and spending your money out of his over the counter\n[noise] All right we've been talking about heart health and women's votes during the reproductive beers and after ... with US Marshal is hardly a cardiologist Dr Sherman surgeries and it's from a tree with\nAbility or a colleague however can then rate for if it's developed one so that's when we start to entertain intervention a small portion of patients who've had bill Eric colic will go on to develop more serious complications of totally just status we're paying for this\nLike all butter is very inflamed and removing it is I'm less selective in March and\nSo I Want to ask you about the risk factors for developing a gallstones when I was in medical school it was a female that forty and fertile yeah I don't know whether you can still say that maybe they have changed their words but is that still true\nThat still true women developed gallstones twice as often as men because of their millions estrogen and project and in the bloodstream we know that a certain ethnic groups developed a gallstones\nMuch more often American Indians Native Americans or the probably the highest prevalence of gallstones Hispanic populations fairly high book Asians below that then and African Americans are less than that even so I'm uh ethnicity is important family history is very important probably a\nTwofold are threefold increase in likelihood of farming stones\nAre overweight states especially has to be a mind over thirty the risk of cell phones is quite a bit higher um and multiple others that are gradually less important fertility either the fertile part a having a pregnancy is a high risk factor for developing\nStones or gold butter sludge a precursor to stones a sludge often resolved after a pregnancy and stones tend to stick around so if someone had multiple pregnancies their likelihood of stone's is much higher\nHe's is mostly diagnosed because there's pain present that would bring patients and\nSo most gallstones probably go undiagnosed um but the ... of\nPatients have a variety of symptoms that may or may not be related to stones and then they usually fairly easily diagnosed by ultrasound so identification of stone's is generally straightforward except a small proportion of a tiny tiny stones\nUm but then the attribution of symptoms to the stones is sometimes a much more difficult issue\nI can tell you that there are outliers and I am one of them the mail that forty and fertile and none of them and I had my gallbladder out and that's the pain is extreme\nI in fact I was in the emergency room three times with the same similar pain and since I don't fit the bill for ever go bladder diseases took 'em a while to figure that out\nBut the good thing is you can take it out through the laparoscopic and relatively simple straightforward surgery or in what overnight and really I didn't have to change my diet at all so that the surgery has absolutely remarkable are there other treatment options decide surgery\n[noise] [laughter] well other options have been developed over many many years but with the advent of laparoscopic approaches to surgery\nOr many of the other options became less realistic less cost effective in less than they are less effective uh themselves so college just act to me is really the only realistic option for the patient who can undergo surgery is a surgical candidate\nAll right Dr ... and ... just talking about gall bladder disease thanks so much for being with us All right like if\nWe're going to take a short break when we come back we'll learn about preventing a common problem comes to a patient you're listening to Mayo Clinic radio and the Mayo Clinic [noise]\nPolicy they see it by Americans in a life insurance company Houston, Texas had available and all the details and I think\nThat if you're young and healthy you don't need life insurance right yeah that's what I think to until my brother died at thirty eight\nJoe left his wife with two kids a mortgage and stack of bills she couldn't pay\nMary had to sell the house and move everybody into this tiny two bedroom apartment just to make ends meet I never want to do that to my wife\nSo I got life insurance I called A.
