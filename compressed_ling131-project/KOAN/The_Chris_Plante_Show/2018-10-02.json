was twenty five years out of date I mean there was no Internet price we have cell phones the size of hats when this thing went into effect and people would suggest don't upgrade it is a crazy and then in addition to change and the economy we had very large deficits\nAnd we were witnessing literally the loss of our of our automobile industry parts and companies\nAre to Mexico and other places so the people who say we shouldn't have to have um we shouldn't have renegotiated this thing or just that you know engaging in self deception I might I might know that both the secretary Clinton and President Obama both when they ran for president\nPromised that would renegotiate it they just didn't do it in the final analysis but they both acknowledged that it needed to be arraigned done so\nWhat the president did which I think was terrific is we have we have by far the biggest trade bloc in in history at one point two trillion dollars and we've not rewritten the rules in ways that are that are better quite frankly for all three countries particularly better for America that's who have to pay my bills and do I care about\nAnd better in a whole variety of ways it's the the auto rules of origin are extremely important in terms of making sure that manufacturing moved back to America and stays in America\nThe there is a a sunset provision that there's going to make sure we review this on a periodic basis we call it a review provision their labor rights which should never been like this ever in an agreement before there's\nAccess on agriculture there is there's a hole and then you move into the next step of things like digital trade middle actual property protection financial services all these\nThese ah twenty first century economy kinds of things there were no adequate rules and that we have um there's even very good rules are\nOn the environment in which you're beyond anything we've negotiated before which I'm I'm proud of there's there's very strong and enforceable rules on currency which we've never had an a trade agreement before there there are limitations on data local is Asian which is an important thing for the digital trade people we have limitations on how state owned enterprises\nWhich is you think China can subsidize so there's\nThere's a whole variety of things in various pockets of the extremely important to Graham it better than than anything in the states as everybody goes she had it before it's going to make a real difference for working men and women in this country now some businesses and some Wall Street guys left to figure out another way to make a fortune\nBut in terms of working men and women and farmers and ranchers it's going to make a big difference and it's going to be\nIs the that the President Trump trade a um prototype and we're going to use it going forward with countries around the world so it's really really an important day\nWe're talking about Lighthizer us trade rap or one of the chiefs of course negotiators and getting us to this new U.S Mexico Canada agreement a Bob one of the things that were wondering how this works any still Republican majority Congress\nCould this mean what's the mechanism for this passing where there's there are some Republicans supporting it some probably won't but more Democrats would support this than Republicans correct\nWell I Would not say that I think you're going to find a Republicans and Democrats both supported uh hopefully strongly that there are a few Republicans who will probably oppose it because they don't like the fact that we're going to bring manufacturing back and they think that that ah\nOutsourcing is not a problem there are some Democrats little oppose it in in part because it's just something that the president wants and they're against that or the thinking doesn't go far enough [noise]\nBut but I think uh the vast majority of fair minded members in both parties\nWill support this now one of the criticisms you have which is sort of an odd one in the wall Street Journal is they have this view that well we never should have talked to labor unions and Democrats when we put it together and then they draw the conclusion that for that it's worse for us\nWell if the Democrats should\nUh take over and of course the exact opposite is true we we we designed this to be bipartisan\nFor working men and women and farmers and ranchers it's not something I I Believe it's going to end up being purely partisan and if it is a kind of thing that can only be pass with Republican votes if that's what we had to go she added\nThat I Would agree with the with the people who say it would have trouble passing but that's not how it was designed and it's not what we did\nThis is what I'm John Harwood um CNBC than specifically regarding autos let's listen\nThere are some elements of manage trained in it that are less free that is to say the provisions for the auto industry if those provisions work\nMeans our cars will get more expensive for us consumers but there's also a chance that they are complicated enough that they will be worth it for automakers to comply which means that the president's statement about a new dawn for the auto industry that is almost certainly not correct your\nI guess my I had to make one word it would be nonsense [noise] uh you wonder about people who make statements like that they're they're so palpable crazy and you wonder what else there thing that is also crazy so just to give you an idea all\nThe ... the major auto companies\nGeneral Motors Ford SCA was used to be Chrysler Honda and Toyota have all said this is fine they can work with this they've all said it's going to move more jobs back to America\nBut that's not a bad thing yeah that's a good thing they've all set is workable they've all endorsed it so that the kind of people who don't know very much about what's going on and make those kind of wild statements\nI Would just take him to sort of sit down and boosting their belt and they're tired and breathe ten times and then just read something about it\nAnd they'll realize how they don't know what they're talking about this is going to be really very very important for um for American manufacturing it's going to bring a lot of jobs back\nWe at the end by the way it's not bad for for Mexico or for Canada either it'll it'll help them to\nThe biggest single thing we do let me just give you an idea what the biggest thing we do or what the two biggest things we do one is we increase the content of cars that are sold in America and Mexico and Canada but sold in America\nThat the the the content that is made in this region is increasing right now we say it's sixty two percent and it's really more like about fifty because of loopholes and all this special interest stuff\nWe're going to raise it up to Seventy five percent\nHow was that a bad thing under under the ... the person who is going to lose out on this is China and places like that under the TPP that these people all endorsed half the car can be made in China and sold in American duty free it's completely lunacy the people don't talk about the other thing is we're requiring that a certain percent of the car\nThe the people don't talk about the other thing is we're requiring that a certain percent of the car [noise] be made in a high wage area that is to say in America now it could be Canada also but in America for the most part\nThat's not a bad thing at all why shouldn't we say if we're going to give you the benefit of selling cars indoor market with no duties better than we treat anyone else in the world why shouldn't we say that a certain amount of those car should be made in America by American labor\nNow I think what President Trump promised honest on the campaign trail he promised he delivered Bob Lighthizer us TR what's next I mean are you guys gonna get a deal done with Europe some of the European countries ... deals with Switzerland and some of these other\nSmaller countries I Know they've had a Swiss they're anxious to do a deal with the guys I Know that first hand\n[noise] yeah no we have a variety of things that we're we're talking to the Japanese were talking to the Europeans [noise] we have a lot of things that were due on a small deal dot com singles doubles that people don't even know about where talked I won't go through but there's a bunch of other countries do it and then of course\nThe big the big elephant in the room just China\nAnd one of the funny things I'll tell you there's one last time on the wall Street Journal editorial because you brought it up they kind of show a graph of the American S. and P. and then they mark certain things to sort of say oh look at this was bad for the U.S in the what they don't mark\nWhen when the president announced history has thrill one which was like in March since then the market's gone straight up when the president put on tariffs on China intellectual property and into it for intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer the market's gone straight up from them I was kind of laughing this was like\nWhat it is one of these things what you've got you've got ten data points less drop out the fire to prove the opposite it and then the other ones are you should look at it I ask any of your your list or to look at the thing if they happen to have the hopefully\nLooking I'm actually looking at it now yeah gender back in March eighth but July and August when he's yeah\nYeah I just look at the ports put at the bottom just show where the where the that the China actions are the markets like straight up from\nTheir right I mean this whole area is right as well I'm\nGlad today that I I Know without prompting what the thrill one means like how many how many people know that other than you ... and I shouldn't careful\nI I should be careful I I used we used yet we all sort of\nJargon to the shore dance and whatnot but I mean we have a statute

I I don't even have words for that it's outrageous but I don't think this goes over well in middle America I don't think it goes over well in most places outside of Cambridge, Massachusetts or\nMaybe it on to college campuses speaking of the college campuses vis a Georgetown professor we're going to be\nDelving into more of this a Republican senators should die miserably be said to pigs for supporting cabinet and she has had a history of nasty comments about Trump supporters\nUh and calling them all sorts of names and Raymond made the good point that\nCan you imagine if a professor\nWho was that even even modestly a Republican\nSaid anything\nResembling of it at the vitriolic nature of what this professor Christine fair at Georgetown said\nWhat that would that slightly Republican professor survive that professor would\nBe run off campus not that there are many Republican professors anyway would be run off campus\nThat that's that's that's a that's hostility you're expressing your expressing male aggression or if it's a\nWell we already had one ... a male professor have to apologize for making a simple comment simple comment about credibility and Christine Ford get into more of this but the double standard is just unbelievable\nThe views of faculty members expressed in their private capacities or their own and not the views of the university does that mean if someone

and\nGeared toward thoughtful respectful dialogue\nWell when you go to go on that rate your professor website um some interesting reviews of this particular professor teaching style come up\nA namely that she's frequently rants against conservative how is that unbiased but again Georgetown would not tolerate this in a conservative wouldn't it would never happen\nThere is no discussion questioning or did they in her class simply sit and listen to her opinions which are frequently incoherent and disjointed worst or lectures or never supported just presented his unvarnished dogma this is not with Georgetown is about says the latest rate my professor\nRating [noise] so this is um this is where we are in American academia if this if this were a Republican professor\nIn his private capacity

... how you behave in college and just always the presumption of\nGuilt going forward and in every way that they\nHave questioned him and it's it's completely dangerous inappropriate\nNow describe if you don't mind your thoughts on ah Christine forward given your\nIf you don't mind your thoughts on on Christine forward given your a knowledge of her as an undergraduate right\nI I was a classmate of hers I wasn't in her\n... friendship share of it I was in her circles and yeah I Know the environment that she was saying that we were all in\nEspecially our freshman and sophomore year we were partying there was going out there as you know part of the sorority culture back then was was definitely a party culture and my point and bringing it up\nIs not to blame her for her you know if she if she had been sexually assaulted that because you behave this way you deserve to get raped but my point is if you only have he said she said\nIf you don't have any corroborating evidence then you need to look at the character of both people you need to look at what they were doing in college and I know what we were doing in college and you know we should be ... you\nKnow if you're gonna grill ... have not about this she also needs to be looked at as well because she's bringing these accusations without any kind of corroborating evidence and you can't forget that weight\nShe also mentioned college you mentioned that she didn't do well in college two years after she alleged that she had the sexual thought she said she didn't do well in college because of that yes she did well in high school you know really what was going on during that period sheltered change the timeframe from being\nIn the mid eighties or early eighties she kept switching back and forth with it happening college or that happened in high school you know really flush out exactly what her story as much she will understand the lawyer would grill her about this they would grow or about the details of hurt continent but somehow we have to hold her with kids was right and\nAgain feminists were supposed to be about equal treatment I thought that women are strong enough to stand on their own they're not a bunch a damsel in distress and yet\nOh you're exactly right on the incremental last night um the entire angle the opening monologue was devoted to the a credibility gap ah for moves forward in relation to the entire matter and extensively relying on\nAnd on an unbiased prosecutor who was a six month prosecutor who not political figure who said look changing narratives\nChanging story of a memory of even recent events she seems to change or is unclear a not a case that would be brought even under a preponderance of evidence standard not a I'm not a beyond a reasonable doubt but a preponderance standard\nSo no probable cause even to undertake an investigation given the lack of cooperating information but in a in a culture where you're writing DC we're feeling Trump's facts\nThen you know it's always going to be how you how she makes you feel in her testimony\nBut and that's exactly right it's about how she made people feel because\nI didn't even find her feelings credible to be honest I'm and she didn't she didn't vote like someone who was just now bringing charges about this horrible thing but so Trump traumatized her for four years to thirty six years in fact in her college years and her marriage and everything else and redecorating and you know we had\nHe had no emotion that corresponded with what she was saying her PATS the trauma and horrors of it all was there would have been more anger there were more\nAnd passion and more directed\nA she would detach she her anytime she ever talked about the assault she was very detached and her description of it and and I don't mean innocent people can disassociate associate when they're raped and stuff but she wasn't right and this is thirty six years later and she said she has PATS the which means that you're heightened awareness of what happened and so\nShe just did not she was not ... on feelings or fact uh but\nAt the end of the day we need to look at the facts and the fact that measure up she lives in the ... and in high school that was very hearty environment that carried over to a degree in college you think she got off campus after that and and things calm down\nBut you know again not to blame the victim but we need to look at the entire circumstance of her life and his life if we're going to bring this kind of thing up at the last minute Laura last we had to bring up with a context to this right before Supreme Court nomination that would be changing abortion possibly\nThere's a reason for that you know we've got to really we need to protect our country and protect presumption of innocence and this isn't just about Ford or Kavanaugh\nIt's about our liberty principles and about our democracy about our society and and what are we going to hold his values going forward but at the principle that we're going to hold to to keep us all secure and free and personally responsible\nRight we're basically now a incentivizing unsubstantiated claims and incentivizing this type of intimidating menacing behavior of\nYou know attacking people in public restaurants or elevators or\nYou know that these are the people who are always worried about safe spaces DC and triggers and all are the ones who are the first to get in your face first ones\nBecause they are driven by irrationality they've banned in fact\nAbandoned objectivity so they can't have a discussion on this level\nAll they have their subject is kneeling and power and if you're not going to come to reason together if you have no basis of a ... objective truth in order to have dialogue than the most powerful the biggest bully in the room it's going to win and that's what we have going on than the feminist movement is a bunch of bully\nThey're bullying everyone in order to advance their power and it's important that students ... there's always the struggle between men and women that there's always been a threat and if you're always the victim then you always have power over those who are\nTrying to use you and you know so this is what's been going on in our culture it's been going on in different kinds of fears now what's going on and and the tight relationship scare of men and women and its ripping our country apart\nAnd you know if we if this means that we have to let little rapist go free because we can't prove that it's better to stay presumption of innocence to save the innocent than it is to round up all the guilty\nOh I'm actually the Mac that's just real life that's that's what it's about being a grownup world\nYeah well I think again we see that these activists Soros folks who are costing flake who lived up to his last name I mean the the their perpetual adolescence\nLook at me look at me look at me watch me watch me you must listen to me don't you dare look away from me this is like a kid like an eighth grader this is not as serious adult with a serious way of\nUh of discussing issues they they mean to terrorize people you say bully I say terrorists with the type of political and emotional extortion they're playing this game and it it has to be exposed and resist it at all costs and in they have to feel\nThey have to feel the heat right back on them as as a journalist and I say this in a in a in a way meaningless journalists don't like to demonize is fake news and so forth would imagine of journalists were finding themselves surrounded in an elevator\nWhere where citizens are one inch from their face screaming at them and it I think that would be the first ones to say wait a second year intimidating the press but what about intimidating a ah a citizen in a in a in a restaurant or at a gas station as as Maxine Waters urge people to go after them\nYou know does that count at all not you\nKnow and and but we like he said we need to fight back we we just can't sit back and take it which we've done for years and look where we are and that's one of my reasons for challenging ah Christine Ford about\nAnd that is one of my reasons for challenging\nCooking for about you know her own behaviors I don't I'm not accusing or anything I don't know what she didn't detailed day to day when she was in high school or college but I Know the environment with then and again if we're going to prosecute him our question him prosecuting and then we need to ask her the same kind of question\nAnd you know you can't answer if you can't show what kind of character you are\nUm you know when you're bringing these accusations up in the political sphere then why should we ... we are not obligated to believe you just because you make allegations we're not obligated to power she just because you're allowed in bowling yelling at us and and the restaurants\nYou know we're we're not we're not want to have to take it for you know\nWe have a right to speak as well and I think more people need to speak out I think that's what the Trump election with all about that you\nI think uh it's about people having just about enough of those bad policies bad economic policies bad foreign policy and twisted a political correctness and identity politics I think he called BS and all of it\nAnd he said look I'm Out of it I've done all this thing but I just it's just ridiculous and I what before we let you go real quick do you do you think that this could actually boomerang against the Democrats in the midterms\nOh absolutely and I hope so and we
