I think there are some industry is lagging Steve and um I thank you and appreciate the call I ... and here's the thing that I Would say\nAnd you're right now is the time for the president to back off the the bruise or if you will and start being the the the salesman Trump and selling the great things he's delivered on and that are already under way\nOr we do have great economic news the the industrial output the manufacturing output the the the unemployment but at the same time Steve there are people like you who aren't feeling the full effect of this\nAnd need to know that the a he's doing everything he can be the president is not a wizard or a magician\nHe doesn't fix everybody every aspect of every life\nThe only things as I mentioned to Pat Buchanan the two things that the people want from a precedent\nOur security and prosperity and prosperity is best gained by\nHaving an even playing field where you're not only recently tax to regulate it out of business and where you can you can grow a business and grow a family that's what the president should be about and I think that is what he's about but that's a very limited his powers are limited and I think the media and everybody else\nI mean why are we focusing on a journalist that may have been brutalized by Saudi Arabia now I understand he wrote for the post up but\nWe can't control Saudi Arabia there are rogue regimes all over the damn world Cuba China North Korea or some of our allies including Saudi Arabia when you get into the middle east it is a crap shoot and let me tell you they don't they don't you're talking about due process\nThen no due process their due process is well let's see what side do you want to be roasted all\nWell and from my understanding as well as the the journalist wasn't even a U.S citizen of course he was resigning here but yeah he's or domestic Saudi Arabia in politics problems that you know would be best advised the U.S does not have any interest in million these ...\nYeah well it's interesting that it's beyond the president's ah capabilities and frankly beyond his purview he did what he could and what he did was he sent Mike Pompeo to question them we should be concerned and I had been concerned about four years about human rights religious rights abroad\nWe have to protect those and use the might of America to push these regimes toward greater freedom and liberty for their people but that said we're not we don't have dominion over those countries all you can do is suggest push agitate and that's what the president did enough\nEnough but I the media I can prove it to\nMSNBC and CNN all last night and the night before ran on this or a ... story okay the journalist that may have been mutilated\nDismembered in a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey okay we've got two problems here turkey and Saudi Arabia\nOkay neither of them have particularly great human rights records in fact they don't but we can only call them out MSNBC and CNN lead with this for two nights they lost the ratings by double digits Fox had more viewers than both of them combined\nNo one is interested in the story and it doesn't change one American Life and it doesn't affect our policy with presidents the in the least and it'll have no impact on the midterms so\nTo push that narrative and to drive it to try to hit Trump it's stupid it doesn't work we're going to

college football it rarely saw well you're the fighting Irish and we're the pansies I think they have little\nViolets divide the bobcat but I think they were they had bobcat but all the all the posters at NYU there were all these little these little violence ... violence so we we did recently call them the pansies anyway\nUm tell me where we stand in these midterms Matt\nUh when you look at the polling data a real clear politics has the the generic ballot Republicans down seven points does that mean anything when we're this close at this late date\nYeah it does rain if it's a great question um you know basically that generic ballot has been as high as fourteen Fifteen points a CNN poll\nTen days ago or ... or so that showed that why what you're seeing is that it almost all the polling that theory that's a that's a common thread that a generic ballots start off very bad for Republicans because there are a lot of big cities and quite frankly they're calling a lot of people who aren't at work which don't tend to be Republican\nOr an ... get close election they got a better idea of actually in a boat or never raking in mid term it's like you know roughly twenty five percent of the people vote so determined he actually going to vote if that's the real tricky question\nYup well here's here's the thing I'm there is this other CBS battleground poll that has Democrats up three in the toss up\nDistricts now if you're only up three and a toss up districts that's within the margin of error and in the Trump total era I I I have to look at that and say this could go anyway this this is yeah I like to call right\nI was in Florida for a speech this week I had a one or two about to be in the lobby the hotel I've noticed as a clean story don't worry as you said um she said\nHey I I just want you to do I never voted in the mid term I'm so bad about the ... street capping off I'm voting for the first time it it it it ... this is this this is the silent voter not going to get picked up and all\nI think it's absolutely a dynamic that's Eighteen similar to how it was it two thousand sixteen there's a lot of Democrats who are looking at their own already\nYou know a Gallup poll came out rented that fifty seven percent Democrats are comfortable with the idea of being a socialist party the Democratic party shifting becoming much more radicalized and that means that in the swing districts that you're talking about\nThat um you know the the the whole question about what the socialists people like or cause you\nSo the the that this whole question about electing socialists people like Ocasio Cortez et cetera uh it's really wake you a lot of people at a normal folks countries say maybe I'll vote\nYeah and I I also think when you see these explosions as we just played from uh NYU last night attacking a of a a statesman like Henry Kissinger he's Ninety five years old\nAnd when you see people you know that's what I thought you were going to tell me about the woman who came up to you in Florida Man I thought she was accused of being or coming up you know when you see that kind of crazy explosive behavior toward people\nThat's a big turtles in middle America and really anywhere in America I think I think it's a huge journal tell me about the Trump effect he is he is dumping all over the country including in Arizona tonight we're going to be covering that live at ten pm on Fox\nUm what is the Trump effect has he nationalized what was a local race a few weeks ago\nWell first of all its historic better president would stand by a nominee like Kavanaugh end its historic that our president\nWould basically go all over the country it's aggressively in a nonstop fashion to campaign for all these candidates and I do agree with you I think it's national I think in the ...\nEverything is about Trump even if they try to make it about truck he's too big of a personality he's too big of a player in our politics so yes it's about chocolate Republicans run from it because they don't like a portion of what he does or making a mistake\nTo voters that difference that down separate don't want a guy they don't think that every Republican his truck they know how ... and I don't know why some of these Republicans have so much trouble just be yourself be who you are authenticity is on the rise of politics and that's a good thing\nIs is the reality the Democrats don't have any stars with Trump's magnitude they really can't\nCompete and there's no leader and there's no articulated governing vision that's the other problem with these people um what are your concerns though Matt should the Democrats wrest control of the house what will that look like\nWell they're gonna start persecuting people like my wife worked out so they're going to go after every White House staffer they can\nThey're going to try to bring down to their age this whole idea of the op ed in Tallahassee that take it over the Democratic party will turn to gavel power house and it'll all be about trying to get air quotes corruption corruption is everybody that associates that solves Trump they're going to try the same strategy\nHillary track which Donald Trump is agenda is so obnoxious a toxic that we have to destroy anybody associated with it and it's going to be a very\nVery harmful and long two years for the country I feel like we're at our website already I Do not know what's gonna happen if the Democrats dispatch which they will have to choose because it's just that there is no which at the\nOther than stopped trucks that is that\nWhat it what is your got tell you Matt where does this end come election day what do you think happens\nI got tells me that we're going to have a fantastic night the Senate I keep things to be picked up in the Senate from fifty one I actually can be higher than that I actually many of these races like Claire McCaskill in Montana West Virginia what Joe mansion I think the Democrats\nAre totally vulnerable I think the Republicans have a great chance to pick up the seat I think in the house of the coin flip\nOn I think I think Republicans still having a chance to hold onto the house\nBut it's\n\nA tension you could be paying too much for your health insurance new two thousand Eighteen health insurance laws have lower costs dramatically you may be significantly over paying open enrollment is now and it's the best time to maximize your savings you may be able to save as much as forty percent\nLike John ... fifty two year old in Florida was being two Ninety a month from now only a hundred and Seventy four months or we uh thirty two year old woman was paying one fifty now being only Seventy nine dollars a month\nNew low cost health insurance plans are now available with zero Kobe's or zero deductibles top quality health insurance at the lowest prices anywhere call now and ask about dental plans under a hundred dollars a year for the entire family\nIf you're uninsured or unhappy with what you're currently paying make this important call now a special fall open enrollment hotline is now accepting calls golly hundreds you'd only five sixty six forty nine that's eight hundred to nine five sixty six forty nine sponsored by I Can't benefits group\nTrump has beaten expectations in the past David South Carolina you wanted to say but\nFor reasons I'm voting Republican Maxine Waters polo see Feinstein and Schumer I'm a registered Democrat and let me tell you I've never been more embarrassed for the hatred that comes out of their mouths\nAnd I'm not alone down here in South Carolina there are a lot of people because of those poor people and the vitriol that comes out of their mouths were voting for Republican down here\nOr people and the vitriol that comes out of their mouths were voting for Republican down here\n[laughter]\nFascinating thank you David that's that's insightful and I'm going to be down in Texas in Houston on Monday with a camera crew for Fox and um we're\nGoing to be chronicling what people there are saying\nAbout these midterm elections I think there are there are veins running through this election that uh I think the the polling is not picking up on and certainly\nThe people reporting news have no concept though I live in New Orleans I sit and coffee houses I go to lunch spots and let me tell you that is a swath of America\n... where in New Orleans we're kinda shoulder to shoulder with everybody we don't have these lily white enclaves or old black enclaves are all Hispanic enclaves like I found in northern Virginia and we lived here frankly\nYou there are parts of places you you you know I I ... you could go and never see a black person never see Hispanic face in some of these restaurants\nThat it it ... northern Virginia for whatever reason it carbs up that way it it it's a very wealthy place and people are very divided lives separate life not in New Orleans we are side by side was your music we share food we enjoy each other's company would drink together we have fun together Mardi Gras together\nUm and you hear a lot when you were in places like that because the voices you're hearing on all sides are not your own not an echo chamber and let me tell you I think there's a lot of disgruntled men out there with not only the mob stuff but\nThe tone and the lack of results from Democrats Democrats should have it\nSeems to me come up with a governing agenda I don't know why they didn't take Newt Gingrich's playbook and run with it they should have had their own contract with America saying look\nThe Trump years we can't stand what he's doing but we're going to do X Y and Z they didn't do that they have no what are you going to do you're going to run against joblessness\nYou gonna run against high wages you're going to run against high benefits business is growing small businesses regulations coming all what are you going to do well I'll tell you what Kamala Harris was announcing a five hundred dollar tax credit\nShe called Trump's fever\nSo when Democrats are coming around who your way of thinking even though they try to dress it up you once you've won and that's why I think Trump is nationalizing this election and trying to keep his agenda and his voice at the center of it Terry Alabama does that work for you and what are you focus on\nDuring these midterms\n... exactly right I think that Democrats are not like they're evil\nYou look at what they can't I Can't do a train wreck capping off a bridge right Kevin White because they don't get that they\nWere both in that group and we can go back that your state for a while and it [laughter]\nOh we lost you there I think we're losing your there Terry but I got a point and I think you know to to to too many the Supreme Court has become the holy of holidays you just almost a high church too to some on the left\nWhere they see that as the ultimate instrument of control and social change\nAnd deprived of it they feel they somehow lost something that's era treatable so this was a major blow even though a Brett Kavanaugh is a down the middle of the road straight down the middle jurists she's not a radical he's not he's not\nThe next battle is going to be the battle royale you want to see blood on the floor come to Washington for the next round of confirmation hearings when Ruth Bader Ginsburg gives up her seat\nAnd from a points maybe a woman a conservative woman to that seat or more a ridge restrictive jurist one who reads the law and interprets that appropriately and doesn't make it up\nIf you get a let's say Amy Coney Barrett\nGod help us all I'm leaving I'm going back to New Orleans\nI mean it it it it will be what we saw from Kavanaugh will be a cheap warm up\nFor what awaits that nominee thanks for the call Terry or we're going to take a very quick break we'll be back in moments Laura Ingraham show continues what are you focused on this mid term and and\nJust do these mob tactics started all you

drink while juicing may help you get the five to nine recommended servings of fruits and vegetables each day that alone is not a balanced diet and I don't think that that even really counts we'll talk about that\nHere to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of juicing and I should say a lot of other topics as well as Mayo Clinic dietitian Kate threat will come back to the program Kate thanks for having us\nI don't I'm I'm unless someone truly thinks they have a sensitivity to certain foods like any I you know we want to respect that and we would want to be kind of systematic about our approach to removing foods from one's diet do you know what a sensitivity to elect in ... is like\nI truly haven't had many people come to me and say that they have elected in sensitivity and I think it it would present probably like most other GI symptoms or there might be some\nUm discomfort loading and maybe some bowel issues with them you know along with it um\nThat said I think um it's a it's maybe\nNot as much of a concern as it's made out to be because most foods that are hiring like\nBeans um I generally cooked and when they're cooked that left in is broken down and so it's really not in an issue um and truly them the benefits to eating beans is is\nIs known and in quite good for us so I Would I Would recommend people to eat beans\nAre there are a lot of people do who think the electrons are a problem and there is a or a best selling book on uh I saw it on Amazon I looked it up when he started talking about when I knew we were going to talk about elections because I'd never heard of them and it's called the plant paradox the hidden dangers in healthy foods is cause disease in weight gain\nBy a cardio vascular surgeon okay um and he says you got to avoid these like they're they're bad\nIn it and doing this or sell a book and the rumors about our ages and simple and daunting factor is elections are everywhere thankfully Dr ... offers simple\nHacks we easily can employ to avoid them\nIncluding peel your veggies oh ... you ever heard of that\nI Would recommend not doing it if you don't have to\nParade shop for prudent season I guess that makes sense because he says that a fruit when it's not a completely ripe can that contains a more elections and you want to avoid those and swap you're brown rice for your white rice I guess that's probably okay\nSo well and if I Would say if someone surely doesn't think they have an issue our sensitivity to my name's again which I don't know that we can quantify if anyone would and\nIn fact having brown rice having a whole grain would actually be preferred unless you have a reason um and hopefully medical reason not to\nTo have that so we were in unless indicated otherwise I Would say people should have their whole grains I'm so I Would prefer that people would eat their brown rice over their light right most of the time\nYou can buy this book you know I didn't but there's all sorts of cookbooks too that will avoid like where is your diet well it sounds I actually like it's impossible but they're out there\nUnlike your diet that sounds a actually like it's impossible but they're out there [laughter] and that's Kelly Clarkson says I read this show up here [laughter] there's this huge singer right [laughter]\nShe said my auto immune disease is gone and I am thirty seven pounds lighter ... because if she's been on this lower the left\nOr him die it's another fad I type of fat diets that if you limit some foods that you we're going to lose weight\nRight and I think if if you are to look at the computer to look this up and looking at it like many fad diets it is restrictive in nature and so there are many foods that are eliminated and so when you start eliminating many foods\nThe likelihood of someone losing weight is you know ... is probable and unlikely to happen and oftentimes when people lose weight and their their body responds differently they do feel better or so\nThat said a lot of the foods that are suggested that be eliminated in this liked in free diet are very healthy nutritious food than actually our foods that\nAre thought to be anti inflammatory and in that it's kind of a counter argument that that they some will say they're inflammatory but there's other substances in that food that are actually known to be anti inflammatory truthfully it's a bad I I Would say it's a fascinating\nYou don't think there's any good evidence to suggest that you are to be on a lower locked and loaded left and I\nKnow I don't think anyone should be on a a low ... diet absolutely because I don't I don't think it's possible to eliminate license because they're in all plants and we want people to eat plants\nNow within the plant family there are certain types of plants that people may have sensitivities to and I think if that's the case again we'd probably want to take a systematic approach to looking at one's diet and and trying to eliminate foods\nI'm In a way that doesn't eliminate all and so and they would be a re introduction of it's because we don't want people to be an overly restricted diet\nUm because that's not um an easy way to live life and I and in terms of a long term healthy diet and so we want people latest is many healthy foods as they can and to avoid the ones that truly give them problems and it to for some people it you know just in terms of food sensitivities it might just be\nHow it it might be how it's cooked it might be the dos and the amount that you eat any one time so often times there's there's a wage around to include foods but maybe just within a reasonable way of doing it\nAll right so now we have to talk about probiotics that our last few minutes because as long as we're just throwing that you have a variety of afraid that she's going to die because of all the probiotics for what she heard on the news this morning and so again when you're talking about fads let's circling back around that probiotics are bad or is that what the message messages\nWell and I think that the messages that it's an emerging science and I think as as more and more research is done in this area where we're seeing maybe a study that is showing benefits and then we may see a a study that shows the opposite end and and does not show those benefits and so I think\nThere's much to be learned um about ah the got micro biome that's the the bacteria that naturally live\nWithin us and and its role um in our health and disease states and so I think more to calm\nUm that said when we talk about probiotics as being a dietitian I Will bring the conversation back to food yeah and in your ear and yogurt isn't there is this thing that made me naturally have some ... robotics and then there's foods that are considered pre by addicts that may\nOr helped the set up the environment within your got\n'em to be healthier place to maybe promote a gut Flora that may be healthy healthier beneficial\nSo the story that your friend her this morning and um that were referring to there's taking the capsules pills that are labeled as probiotics that's one thing and then there's eating a serving of come outta or sauerkraut and isn't that line getting blurred\nRight and I think when we step into that arena of taking a probe a probiotic or even having a drink\nRecognizing that this is an unregulated industry and so you can say that you have\nThis strain of bacteria or this much of this bacteria but quite honestly\nWe don't know that that's absolutely true and we can't say with certainty that that's the best thing or that's going to be an NSA you and I again we just I don't think we have that science yet and so I think it comes back to\nBuyer beware um and there are some people that report that they feel very well when they take a probiotic capsule or that they may have a drink that contains a pro buyout it\nNow whether that's a true a factor if that the placebo effect we don't know um I think if it if they're an otherwise healthy person they can they could they can probably practice that safely but that's not to say that that's the case for everyone\nAll right well let me tell our listeners what we're referring to and it's to report that came out recently in the journal cell which is a peer reviewed journal by the way in which is called a cast further doubt on the benefits of the highly commercialized probiotic products\nBecause they are marketed as dietary supplements not drugs brought a buyout ex do not need to be approved by the FDA for claims that they prevent or treat any health conditions are basically these two studies said they did nothing\nMost of the patients who took them they all were like what in one and then came out the other [laughter] and the other was a concern that your friend referred to was the fact that if you have taken an antibiotic\nIt may actually take your got longer recovery if you take ... robotics a versus loving Mother Nature have her way to do it that way\nAnd it'll bring this back to food yeah yeah I think that's exactly right and and eating nutritious foods like fruits and vegetables and whole grains\nAllow your body to have the ... the proper environment it and it can play with the ph or how the foods you know the fibers and and how things are digested there to set up an environment that's going to promote maybe a healthcare Flora\nAre juicing as good will decide to do with religion [laughter]\nSome of them are good or wherever they're seldom is about probiotics are certainly some question about whether the ah the claims are true and like there's probably not to worry about having to wear their lessons in your diet Cajun recipe but ... says so much for being with thank you [noise]\nFeel like I'm On Mayo Clinic radio will learn more about poly cystic kidney disease and later on in the program common diseases of the hair [noise] do you have a health related question you'd like to answer for a topic you'd like to cover [noise] you can tweet us at any time it has said Mayo Clinic radio or send an email to\nOr so if you're on it for Twenty years it's probably an extra four or five years uh there's not a big a long long studies because it's a chronic disease that means many years to study but so far this is kind of expectation that's how it's gonna it's gonna believe that\nThis loud fantastic [laughter] so how do most patients find out that they have this disease and have you ever seen a case where there wasn't a family history\n[noise] ah so mostly are the majority of the patients would have someone in the family that has these and they've been so familiar with that usually we diagnosed by screening with an ultrasound\nOr so you actually look at the kidneys and see this is exactly so we look at the ... and we have kind of criteria is and how many sewers and depending on the age because the ... the older you are the more ... you'd have\nA so to diagnose first we do the screening by ultrasound and then we can do as the
