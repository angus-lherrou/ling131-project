D will bear found one and I found it on Amazon\nOr it's not a gee it's a luck on brand you X o when\nAnd it's half chrome light bulb just as I spoke with on the old incandescents half of the bald from the top all the way over the top is chrome it is ... and it's an L. E. D.\nSilver minted vintage bald\nUm so it has a mere effect it's L. E. D. it is a standard base to it or runs about twelve bucks Thirteen bucks and uh it's on Amazon\nAnd it's made by like I said look on the hill you XO when so for those that are searching we've had two options now for reading or actually three I I I talked about the one option which was the real bright G. E. ball called reveal\nAnd then we had the tubular ball which was LAPD which is about five six inches long about an inch in diameter and now we have the looks on half chrome light bulb which is called her readers bald\nSo there's a multiple options for you there\nRight eight hundred eighty two three eight to five five that's our number Anna welcome\nTonight how good\nThe reason why I'm calling is I just moved into a price uh finally have my own home and odd that the place is a much older place and and desperate need of some level\nFresh and I got a um ... it's a ... ... what I'm wanting to do and the kitchen and all of the cabinet are very sitting or designed it looks like they may have actually been identical or a\nComplementary and design but over the years for homeowners some of them are state one color and another color and from the\nVery heinous paint and I wanted to what I Want to do is I Want to make them uniform again and cover by um stripping them down with some things that I can\nPay down I'm basically a black black current law [laughter]\nAnd I and I need to know what can I Do to our ... used to be able to strip all the smoke Greece residue and then Sandy and everything so that I can paint and not have to worry about it peeling the\nHit well preparation certainly key in you said the ... the wonderful word and I called paint because paint makes your job a lot easier um because when you have paint you're covering up you're not putting that pigment into the woods so\nYeah no I Know I I I Want a uniform look and I figured that hate it when it went even out it would give us the nest and a uniform texture throughout all the different cap and trade that I\nI don't think I'd be able to have to pay\nThroughout all the time you can trace her that I\nI don't think I'd be able to have the patience for stone [laughter]\nSo well and it's a lot of work if you're going to try and bring them all back so what I Know we we we can't find you have like a garage where you could take a may be the candidate doors to\nYeah yeah that's that's what I'm planning on doing okay for the jak Greg and Greg Grant and and\nPlay it all out on on on a pilot or whatever\nThat I can work at Wal ventilated area yeah\nSo the first thing I Would do is I Would take all my handles off and different things along those lines um I Would start the whole process by\nYou know simply cleaning the cabinets um just to remove even wiping it down like with a paint dinner or something along those lines which will remove a lot of the cooking Greece and different things at that point\nA ... and then I Would likely sand you don't have to knock yourself out there but just lightly saying scratch up\nThe surface if there's any clear protect it like a ... year thing um you would you would create a good ... surface so cleaning with mineral spirits\nComing back to lightly sanding and then I Would just use a good primer and oil base primer and probably in\nIt you did recognize isn't\nIt go either or you could go either or so you don't have to use your\nGrandmother's trying to tell me and now that that the and now all I did it\nWell then it wasn't prepared properly that that that is just not the effect\nThat I Want right it wasn't prepared properly paint peels there's\nTwo things going on you either didn't prepared properly to create good binding to the surface or a there's moisture involved\nUm so you do like I said you wipe it down with a mineral spirits you come back and you will lightly saying that's so all the surfaces a scratched up and you know ready to go then you use a good\nInterior a enamel over that and it doesn't have to be an oil base they Benjamin Moore has a wonderful renewable that can be used inside that is a water base\nIn fact if I'm not mistaken it's a combination of a water in oil which I Can't even explain how that works and then they have a matching primer for it so preparation is the key clean sand\nPrime in pain now when you paint you said you wanted a real ... leak you know kind of a loss look why\nI I I think a lot of that would be affected by the than they\nCan make sure the doors by where the handles are um they obviously are dirty hands clean the hand whatever and then the scribe ... at job peeled off the varnish and their their what their ... and that's\nFine but again they are the worst thing is to take off the handles\nThen clean then saying in prime and if you get the handles up and you get a good bond the surface you're ready to go this secret though is if you have him clean you got your crime or you got a good interior enamel than the secret is to get a really good brush\nAnd I'm not talking about three dollar nylon brush if you get oil based paint you want a pure bristle brush if you get a water base in a water base combination water oil base\nEnamel then you want a good polyester brush\nAnd following those steps I'm telling you you'll get a good finished but do not cheat on the preparation and that's the cleaning and that's the same thing and that's the primary that's the key to success of your projects will continue your at home\n\nYour home is just a click away that

get to a Chuck Chuck\nWelcome Hi Gary no sir\nI listen to your show and it seems like sometime the past year told me into the audience about all I heard that the themes are are began to split or turn there's there's a way to treat\nThose sure sure is a paper check or is it a little vinyl\nA bigger have over the boat I got a free room are doing it\nOkay um so so it's been on for a while\nYeah yeah what\nAbout Twenty years okay yeah so what happens over time is like everything else in our homes you know absorbs moisture dries out absorbs moisture dries out in the weakest part is the scene and all like paper when it gets old it dries out it begins to curl\nSo there isn't it he's a cold seem it he said wallpaper seem at ease with which will blew it down but we have to re hydrate the paper so what you do is get a um\nA even a dish ragged cotton rag uh put warm water on it\nA ring it out so it's your day up in just if it's vital you're gonna have to get on the part that curling up because it's not going to allow the water to go through the bottle so the underneath part it it'll absorb so that moisture and\nIt'll hydrate it to a point where it becomes pliable paper you can just lay it right on the top so after we hydrated in that paper becomes pliable we can run the seem adhesives\nOr on the wall not much depends on how much it's girl but really doesn't take much and then again you'll take that warm damp cloth\nAnd you'll pool that paperback down they give it to lay flat you're probably going to hit the hold it there for a while and then allow that seem and he's a to dry and grab\nBut that's how it's repaired and the secret is hydrate in the paper so that it lies down\nOkay and the same in the name brand\nThat that is the name of the product yeah I don't even know who makes it to be honest with you but if you asked for wallpaper seem of the symptoms it'll to smells like ... glue in for all I Know it might be a ... blue\n[noise]\nTime let's get back to work twenty

doing good\nHappy or almost all day there you go the er here I asked that question today Gary All right we are pulling\nThe trigger on all our appliances and I'm saying I Am my situation is the is might granite\nCountertop okay and when they install the dishwasher fab cab where they would screw man that something and they exist thing one you can't screw in the granite right I don't I don't think so I said before I hire somebody the box stores of liver um\nAnd they will install it for a few the dish worst the other things are not a problem but aren't concerned with specifically the dishwasher and and the granite and how they secured in there I I don't know I've been called former yet\nYou know we had this question I'm not a dishwasher guy ran I had a question I couldn't answer somebody called but the answer and\nI Can't remember what the answer and there are there are tabs on the side do are there not\nI'm not sure I wind up buying a brand new on you and I asked this conversation like two and a half years ago where we could go through all through the job and go through the cabinet right right right but like a a washer or whatever rubber washers or whatever and\nGo through the the cabinet own and share it that way but before I pull the trigger I figured I got a call Gary\n... is is this is the dishwasher is there any lead way in the dishwasher right now I'm actually move mine really yeah not much but like a half inch or so\nWell with the way it you know we're getting a new one right and very pale as or the cabs are like the tabs on the top ... they want that the way they design them they screw up into\nA whatever right you know usually it's it's it's whatever it is there's ... or something that can screw into and this is directly into the granite away it fits in there now I don't know what you just asked is a really good question I don't know if there's\nRoom I think there is no I think there's tabs on the side is that\nReal yeah I think there's tabs on the side I've also seen some of the tabs on the top underneath granted where there is a piece of wood but you're saying you you see it Snuggie against the granite\nYeah leading where the cabs are on this existing ahah which it was a it was a former\nModel my wife by you know after the fact after they already had you know the the granite you know\nIt and going back to my question there's no movement on that unit at all correct no sir I check the side check the sides see if we can find anything there\nOkay Hi guys that that kind of serious to do that right before I pull the trigger on it right right why I think I guess that was my question it's been far too long since I talk to you and God Bless you Gary [laughter] yeah yeah you're still hanging in there making us all

Clinic and we've been hearing about is deep brain stimulation\nTechniques including the patients that had the problem playing the violin but can do it now even better than anybody else [laughter] great story actually\nNow I Want to ask you we need to update on would like it up to eight or on the stimulation of the spinal cord and patients who have been been paralyzed and potentially a can get some returned to function\nYes you know this is another technology that we've been working on here at the Mayo Clinic for about four years now I Would have been growing this ... program slowly and I'm I'm very happy to report that this is another technology that is emerging to be very powerful\nIn addition it is also allowing us some interesting understanding of how religion of control of movement happens that what that means is\nHow does the brain control our limbs voluntarily so this is the finding that was just reported in nature medicine yes that that that's correct so maybe I can tell you a little bit of background on this so\nAbout four years ago Dr Reggie accurate ten and I try to see how come I had 'em published a paper very interesting paper where they implanted patients at that time about four patients where\nAre they implanted patients at that time about four patients where at the ... the Malaysian below the level of the spinal cord injury could cause voluntary movement back in the lower extremities\nSaturday epidural means uh above the door or soda so didn't injure as the outer coating around despite all\nThat is correct yeah so this is technology that is essentially the same as\nWhat we use for our pain patients under the skin but outside of the spinal cord outside of the spinal cord but just outside of the covering up the spy okay okay so these are actually surgical implants and what's been demonstrated with these devices and pain patients\nIs that they can help with pain so this is already approved by the FDA for pain now what that for a ... and ... group did was to now apply this technology and spinal cord injured patients who've been paralyzed for example with a ...\nUm child has level complete motor and sense re meaning they can't move their legs or sense there is no sensation\nSo when that paper came out that you can get movement we weren't very excited about it because this really changes our whole view of what we can do for our spinal cord injured patients mhm\nSo we'd teamed up with Dr Reggie ... group and decided can we replicate those studies and so initially the all of this study which is male either be approved investigation all of review board approved as well as the U.S FDA to do this study\nAnd so we've implanted now true patience under this study and this paper that has um ... being reported in nature medicine\nDemonstrates that indeed what was found was true but we actually went beyond that replication\nSo the replication portion of it we actually already published and Mayo Clinic proceedings last year and this was really exciting because our results come from the findings of diapers Suzie how come on and rich you had written\nSo that was exciting about what we discovered is that we could actually go beyond that finding and in this paper what with demonstrators that the patient it now is able to stand\nAnd take independence steps now he's still requires a Walker because he has no sensation still but he is strong enough now to to control his legs and make movements are stepping movements\n... that is an incredible story no when the word gets out as an every paraplegic in the country going to want this well\nYou know this is still very early stage research like I said this is only one patient that we have reported in nature and medicine and so what I Would say is this one study really challenges what we used to think what is possible\nFor treatment of patients with spinal cord injury\nBut you know as a neurosurgeon I often see these patients and emergency room after the trauma\nAnd you can imagine how devastating such an injury is but I think what our study shows is that there is this tremendous hope and being able to regain some of that function [laughter] so you you're regaining function but you're not able to cure\nOr fix the fact that they are paraplegic\nYes now what is really interesting about this study is that the patient is actually able to control his legs again\nWow and that's why this is such a powerful study and I believe why the reviewers and nature medicine which is one of the top journals in medicine I'm accepted this publication\nSo let me ask you if if someone comes into the emergency room and they have cut an or in the armor their leg we can show it back together and they get at least some return of function why is it that the spinal cord seems to have no ability whatever to repair\nSo you know that's an excellent question and we believe the reason is because while the nerves those are peripheral nerves and we know that those performing arts can wreak world but the spinal cord is our central nervous system and unfortunately what central nervous system when that system has caught the those nerves to not ...\nWhat we believe in this case though is that the question then is how does the information from the brain that wants to move the leg\nRegained that function mhm we do not believe that the nurse has grown I we do not think that's how this works but rather that during the trauma there's probably enough connections that are not functioning enough\nBut that epidural stimulation allows the south that's dormant\nTo be able to once again we gain its ability to get the command from the brain\nIncredible ... do you hope and suspect that some day people who are paraplegic or even quadrupled don't skip a paraplegic right now the lower extremities paralyzed will someday be able to walk\nThat's precisely what this patient did that we have reported in um in nature medicine\nWhere his research headed you know I I think now this is opening up a whole new direction and research for spinal cord injury you know before\nThere's been tremendous amount of research out for and funding that went into trying to re grow those axons now what I think will happen is that the research will be in these type of new devices how do we now take this finding\nWhich used a device that wasn't even intended for this purpose\nNow all of the things that we have discovered in this study how then can we take that take a step back and re engineered the device specifically for this purpose of memory animation in spinal cord injured patients\nDoes there have to be a different type of approval by the FDA for this\nAbsolutely and the ... and that's why I think we are indeed very early infant stages of this technology\nIncredible stories already dark skinned Ali he is a neurosurgeon and director of Mayo collects neural engineering laboratory\nThanks so much for being with us thank you citing exciting stuff thanks a lot still\nTo come a Mayo Clinic radio will learn more about the spinal cord injury research from the rehabilitation point of view\nAnd later on in the program we'll hear about the important role volunteers boy had Mayo Clinic\nOnce you hear and see more male clinic radio subscribed to the Mayo Clinic radio podcast on iTunes or your favorite podcast provider for check out the more than two hundred Mayo Clinic radio segments on video now available on you to\nHave a health related question do you like it was the answer or a topic you'd like to cover you can tweet us at a time and hashtags Mayo Clinic radio or send us an email at Mayo Clinic news network at Mayo diabetes\nTo you but you can put the implant it in but that it won't do any good if you don't have this era\nWe that's our theory that has yet to be proven as well but um are we know physical therapy itself wasn't cancer so we had the implant and we added that therapy in the nation together and we got these miraculous result\nUm what goes on from here a little tricky\nBecause number one like I said this is not the standard of care for someone who has a completely I'm a severe spinal cord injury so to be able to send this individual out to the clinic now without the standard of care will be tricky because our clinicians don't know how to manage to save me later in conjunction with a therapy which we feel is really really valuable\nSo we're at that point with this trial where we're really trying to integrate the home exercise program by identifying activity that have been really proven safe impossible for the individual to do on their own at home with some minimal assisted devices\nAnd then let them do that stuff at home on their own um and then and then it it's our job to figure out you know who is this appropriate when is it appropriate if it is appropriate and how to be implemented into standard of care\nSo how many patients have had the simulator now are are presently going through the therapy and ... what are the things that they're actually able to do that they couldn't do before\nSo we're on our second subject right now are patients so even wrote to 'em we have some research funding to hopefully continue into a new protocol that will be very similar but will allow us to enroll additional subjects\nI'm right now the subject I'm the first subject is able to um [noise] you know stand alone for a long period of time he's able to um in wheelchair bound before yes\nUm he's able to walk 'em or independently stepped on a treadmill and also over ground with a Walker\nSo he has some assistance obviously to help him you know their weight on his legs but he's able to um\nAs Megan described volition only move his legs when he wants so on command so that's really the exciting part is\nIs where where we can go from here now that would improve bladder and ball function for him we've had some anecdotal\nImprovements although um we didn't measured those things directly so\nI'm at this point um our next studies were going to do more um data collections which we hope will help inform whether there's actual return of of bowing bladder um but they do report I'm kind of a shorter bowel on time so that's a good thing\nAnd we just don't have evidence yet you were working with a second patient is it's very similar to what the first patient was or no to patients the same [laughter] you know to patients on his [laughter]\nSo how do we go from one or two individuals to millions because we know there are somewhere between five and six million people out there who have spinal cord injuries may be a complete partial ... out of wherever we go from here how can we get this technology moves to\nMarry for five million yes [laughter] so I think\nMegan alluded to this earlier and we've probably both looted too you know one thing we need is obviously\nTo gain additional research support money to do this work and you keep this team moving forward I think one of the other critical questions is you know which patients will respond to this therapy and which ones will not so can we come up with a way\nSaying you know out of the millions of patients you know the these people were were spawn in these won't so that we don't try to deliver a therapy that's not going to be\nA successful finally do you believe that someday paralysis won't be permanent
