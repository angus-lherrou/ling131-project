Republican base is motivated by a legal immigration and I've been saying for weeks now that the cabinet confirmation hearing all weekend and and\nYeah and I've been saying for weeks now that the cabinet confirmation hearing awake in an angry silent majority that the left is not anticipating\nHe's not wrong but at what cost president of the United states has using immigrant families fleeing violence and pain than she is not fair among his base would cost to basic human decency [noise]\n\nOnly in a kind of liberal la la land when they think immigration is just a Republican issue it affects the poor disproportionately in the United states that affects middle income earners disproportionately in the United states the rich people don't get affected by it [noise]\nThey enforce their borders believe me they enforce their their uh parameters and they have cameras they have their sensors they have their alerts\nOn their phones if the if a deer walking walks into their property they get an alert on their phone so it does affect them at all but it is a big issue for the rest of the country you're listening to the lower income show eight five five forty Laura remember the facts we brought you a\nLast week about how black\nVoters and Hispanic voters in the last CBS a Hugo poll on this which was in June kind of at the height of the family crossings family separation issue\nOf the workers that were poll by the CBS poll forty five percent of black voters and forty four percent of Hispanic voters each said that immigration has had a negative impact on their community\nFifty five fifty eight percent of white voters said the same thing sixty seven percent of Republicans sixty one percent of independents\nSay that immigration has changed their area for the worse fifty one percent of voters a said they want their congressional candidates to talk about immigration\nA lot that's fascinating\n\nLess than ten percent of voters support current levels of immigration and to the United states as opposed to eighty one percent of voters who support curbing immigration levels\nThat is a Harvard Harris Poll that was done at the beginning of this year a stunning thirty five percent said the level should be fewer than two hundred and fifty thousand a year that's a quarter\nOf what we allow in legally now\n\nNineteen percent said it should be two hundred and fifty thousand five hundred thousand combined that make them a majority at least fifty percent or they want to cut of oh at least fifty percent to current annual levels of immigration\nJust Nineteen percent of respondents said they want an increase over the current one million people they allow into the country legally see most people just don't know most people you know in the country doing other things maybe they're not listening to the show they're not they're not on these topics but suddenly they say why things seem to be changing around here\nI mean now you have to let you have to know Spanish to get certain jobs in certain industries by the way one of the guys they interviewed on the ah the thing I tweeted out last night I think in the LA Times article that that's in the LA Times today one of the guys interview said well I ... I expect to be getting a job and construction very soon\nOf course why an strict unscrupulous builders hire people come into the United states who claim they have a skill and who are then brought into a pool of other illegal immigrants who also do these jobs\nBut you think you're getting like this great these great artists and so we are coming in and doing like the craftsman building oh please\nGive me a break um we're not calling in a caravan any longer a book but Bob Bob ball let's\nGo to Mike line to Mike real quick ten seconds\nOr you know um when you just talked about on the African American conservative\nBut when you're just talking about the African Americans are ... or ... illegal immigrants these jobs are African Americans used to do our cricket oval by legal immigrants and and as we look for the Trump\nWell good ... spread the word Mike spread the word in your community we have a lot more to get you coming up Marsha Blackburn going to join us\nIn\n\nThe ... but a real life story from trinity debt management and\nI had a lot of credit card debt and I couldn't pay my bills I was feeling so bad I got to a point where I needed some help so I reached out and contacted trinity\nIf you're in depth and you need help cold trinity of one eight hundred seven mine for over four three something to talk to a certified culture where\nThey were able to take all of my different payments and put them altogether\nTrinity will consolidate your accounts to one easy to manage monthly payment put a stop to late season over limit charges reduce your interest and possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands\nAnd they were actually able to work with my creditors or being able to pay off close to Fifteen thousand dollars in Alaska Eighteen months\nThis is not something that you know people entering by force is not something that we should view as being an acceptable process\nWell this is what your opponent said about you and immigration let's listen\nTo opponents whose first moved to this um you know take no prisoners very Persian way of looking at the world ... good at it and I just tell people which one I'm not for God you know\nJoyce I'm uses you want to move things forward makes you compromise is trying to get some shoes for racial healthcare and all these big issues with one of them will be real pleased rivers and people were more\nOh had eight years of Obama motivated and most of our healthcare system and we did catch and release so what is he talking about\nWell you know just this this is going to be language that you hear from liberals\nWhen they don't want to stand on constitutional principles and we hear it over and over I have one of the most bipartisan record of accomplishment of anyone in the house\nAnd I continued to stand on constitutional principles I Believe in those first principles and I'm going to continue to fight for\nFace family freedom posts an opportunity I Do it every single day and one of the things that we ought to be doing is protecting our nation's sovereignty and protecting our borders securing the southern border\nWas in my opponent said he sought building a wall along the southern border was political theater when he was governor he gave valid state issue taxpayer paid for driving certificates to sixty one thousand illegal aliens he they tend to see a hate crime\nFor illegal aliens in our general was simply stepped in and stopped that policy\nAnd got rid of it but this is the difference I Believe in building a wall he thinks it's political theater\nI fought against when I was in the state Senate giving any kind of valid state issue id to illegal aliens he gave them does certificates and I believe we need to end all sanctuary city policy I think we need to end chain migration I think we need to end\nThis diversity lottery and I think Phil Bredesen somebody there at the border welcoming damage giving them\nA state issued id and of course we know the Washington Democrats are the ones that want to abolish eyes open up our borders so\nI'd say life stand firm on this end is what to make certain that these caravans now they cannot just come walking into our country and receiving benefits Tennessee and want to see us to deal with the gangs with drug traffickers sex traffickers human draft traffickers and secure the border\nWell again we're getting reports from rural Virginia I'm this is you know rural Virginia down south West Virginia or illegal immigrants there uh\nAgain demanding services go off and getting paid cash\nA and this undermines us a worker of all backgrounds legal immigration\nLegal immigrants and and the like and I think people are beyond set up with us and how it has to stop a your wrist one Blackburn what what would you\nAh in in the Senate demand of Mitch McConnell what should be done because Republicans have had two years to get this thing\nSquared away and didn't do anything which I'm personally livid about but there's there's no reason this mobile mob should be making their way through Mexico if we had handled this asylum issue properly and close these loopholes and funded this wall\nNo you're exactly right and of course my DACA legislation has passed twice in the house but we couldn't get the Senate to take that up\nAnd that is a good place to start and to remind people is that is and executive memos program that is not something that was passed by Congress and passed into law\nSo it dealing with those issues funding the wall I Am so for putting that money on the timetable and developing a timetable for securing that southern border you know large realized walls work anybody doubts that go talk to Israel\nLong work and what we're trying to do is to keep people out of our country\nThat ought not to be here to keep these gangs out to our country I'm that would say an angel on the other day and Upper East Tennessee and our heart is broken her thirty seven year old daughter was killed by an illegal alien who had had several run ins with law enforcement\nAnd of course her daughter is she did she is rearing his grandson and debt illegal alien went back to Mexico\nAnd this is not it's it's not right and for the families they want to see justice they want to make certain that we do you verify that employers are held responsible\nFor those that are illegal in the country and are working in West Tennessee I talked to a guy who has a a brick and mortar say a business and\nHe was talking about his masonry business and how difficult it is for him his son to get work now because they're being under bid to buy those that are coming in the country illegally and do the job and many times it is an inferior\nRough totally and\nYeah and then he and his sons go in and do it\nRight but he said you know he needs these big jobs for he and his sons to keep them they simply business in in the or to keep it growing again and so\nThese are real issues and what I Will tell you this I think when people look at the immigration issue they do see it as a security issue not having the borders secured\nEvery challenge the border to them every state supporter state and it's one of the fraternal order of police has endorsed me and my race on tough on crime tough on trafficking truck on tough on the\nDrug issues the immigration issue and\nPeople see it as a security issue they see it as an economic issue if they see it as an issue that affects them in their community and to law enforcement personnel that are working to keep their community shame\nOn again uh we're talking to Marsha Blackburn here on the floor and groom show we hit the issue of immigration and now\nYou're on the Laura Ingraham show we've hit the issue of immigration and now the issue of the economy the Republicans are leading by a record Fifteen ... percentage points against the Democrats in his mid term cycle\nOr that is music to my ears President Trump promised he was going to do certain things and he's done them including on trade and all the Republican establishment was against what he was doing on trade\nHe they have a ... I think they have one of the largest gap in history also on trade meaning people are embracing what the Republicans are doing this is the new NBC Wall Street Journal poll a congresswoman Blackburn and and it it's bearing fruit we're seeing the the results of sticking with this more American focused\nTax cuts take on China get more manufacturing it home and it's working\nWell it is working again I'm not a fan of tariffs are like free and fair trade and in West Tennessee where I Am right now or our farmers our sleeping farmers are incredibly concerned about what he's going to end up happening with China\nBut here's the thing China Chinese trade war on us for decades\nCongress about how do you expect to win the trade war with China without terrorists because if we had been able to do that we would have done that by Twenty years ago right\nThat's right and so\nWhat they will say it is we're in a war we got to be sure we win this war and that is what they want to do and they want to make certain that the price that that is tough on China than stealing our intellectual property take them reverse engineering drawing her\nIn cooking American Jobs and I worked owners will say\nOkay we ... about we've got some great leaflets they sure when this trade war and that we open up markets today are encouraged by the U.S and said why they are encouraged to ease structuring their agreement on a patrol boat with talks now\nAnd they want to see more lateral\nTrade agreements that are going to open more market for Tennessee poor\nPeople got to hold on a didn't they didn't happen yeah I don't doubt I'm Sorry I was in but it just didn't happen overnight\nAnd if I mean and I know you represent a state that has a lot of rural interest I understand that completely\nUm but you know I think for most Americans if it's if it's a choice between\nSoybean farmers having a having a a tougher time or us technology and our military interests being compromised\nPeople are going to go for the security and heavy manufacturing ah any day and we're going to have what I mean if it goes away it's going to go China will ultimately just be buying the soy soybean field so it you know what will really matter in the end if China ends up being the dominant power so we've gotta we've gotta do something I'm Congress someone I think you're going to win\nReserve is all rooms and were never charged for no other bills you're\nFrom ...\n... and buddy bought one advantage I Am sorry\nVicky marching through Mexico I'm Dave Anthony Fox News a caravan of seven thousand Central American migrants try to get

everybody everybody is a member of Congress swore the oath to protect the United states gets all enemies foreign and domestic\nRight from the president I doubt every member of Congress they are a duty bound to protect this country against all enemies foreign and domestic and up these these are illegal so that they cross the border than their enemies that's all there is to it and if they're not and they should resign your office\nI think again the fact that we are not\nAll hands on deck to stop this right and that ...\nI mean the president is apparently the only person willing to really hold is what it is\nWe don't violate the immigration laws of Guatemala Mexico you ignore the rule of law in are about to do it in this country right what what are you better than the old or they're not criminals well the well [laughter] they have no respect for country's sovereignty or borders period\nWhich makes them criminals that de facto makes them criminals and that's why a gotta stop treating this as a PR disaster this is\nYou know for a political standpoint this is this is ... from heaven for people like yourself myself others who are concerned about the sovereignty of this country now we've got that was sort of a trick or them ... you know sneaky over the cover of darkness or climbing fences or whatever now got an open massive out in the daily invasion if this does it\nScare the bejesus out of middle America the nothing will\nAgain we want we want people to come to our country who respected enough to ... do not violate law the first chance again or game the system that is in\nYou know is the game the system as it's as it exists anyway well the system right now is if you want to claim asylum you come here you go to a port of entry and you say I claim asylum then we have to process them into the country then we don't really bad for them so we really some most of them don't show up that's it but\nI I Would but I but I wouldn't I I don't like the word asylum because to me means somebody\nIn the United states because of political oppression\nIs that these people are not politically oppressed this there's no such thing as economic asylum only political asylum and so if you come here for the goodies for the free stuff for the handouts for the welfare for the food stamps is that you're not coming here for asylum you're just coming here to to\nYou know to you know to you know pond yourself up on society without giving anything back with these people are were water to their own country anyway but the fact is is that they need to go back\nWell and again uh the president\nSeems to have the pulse of the people again better than any other American politician on\nUs yeah I mean I'm Talking I was I was a shopping with the kids over the weekend\n[noise] and you know I'm In my my\nMom soccer clothes and my son got his on so nobody knows what nobody knows who I Am and my ... with my uh with my camouflage baseball cap on [laughter] and uh I'm listening to people's conversations about this people are outraged I Am outraged about this\nThe same or I look to is is that we're we're grocery stores we can listen to people everybody's talking about this ... outrage about this nobody is no reason for this except for the elites but the funny thing is it that\nSo rich you about this nobody is no reason for this except for the elites but the funny thing is that at least never let these illegals into the neighborhoods anyway\nNow at a bingo well they want they they don't want their classrooms filled with people who speak multiple languages don't speak English or ...\nYou know they don't want their backyards yes there are private private schools\nAnd there's nothing to do with skin color where you come from a ... has everything to do with the fact\nThat this becomes a burden on the system if you don't have an orderly process of immigration period right in and it's it's just absurd let's let's I Wonder\nIf that's the thing Trump needs to ram home and the Republican Party and anybody concern about the rule laws every one of these people in this movable mob of illegals could apply for citizenship all they have to do is go through the process\nNo they don't want to do that but some of them I don't have time it's too dangerous my home country but that's not you know that is not a justification for asylum because your country is corrupt well welcome to most of the world\nYeah precisely then go back and change your government\nNo no one wants to go back and change of government they want to just you know get on and get into the\nMovable mob I liked that mobile mob\nA mobile mob it's a mobile moms mobile\nMob is even better or none of this is what they want you run a caravan of kind of a fun\nAs rollicking group of cloud who wouldn't want to ... I mean we all want to ... sounds like a lot of fun you know let's caravan to the football game that means you've got three cars we're also following each other you know their tailgate ah yeah that's a David in North Carolina with Craig surely hear David go ahead\nI I'm Laura we need to Scott and the rhetoric or the laughter and calling for a pair of air yeah your ear and in Beijing\nYeah I think look that's occurred just said and I'm going to start doing that going for it's not going to be a caravan this is a mobile mob\nA crack I Want to play something from your dear friend John ...\nWho has moved so far left now that he's on a regular panelist on MSNBC this is what he said about the Democrats' chances of a massive blue waves wave now slipping away\nBecause of cabin on probably this immigration and the great numbers on the economy that came out today with Trump's approval Republicans approval way way up I'm much less than\nTrump is not a wholly new force in American politics he's but he is the most vivid manifestation of many of our worst characteristics\nYou know the constitution was written for moments like this it assumed that we we're sinful and driven by ambition and appetite and greed is why they made it so hard for us to get anything done\nThey basically bad that we would get things wrong more often than we get them right and we're proven them correct uh with with ... regularity reaction to that\nBut I I agree with his analysis of the constitution but to what end to what point I don't understand the point he was making is is that what is Trump done to violate the constitution sounds like Trump is supporting the constitution that's the liberals were were were were opposing the constitution so I don't understand I don't understand his point\nNo I I again it's we're sinful because we elected Trump that's it that's why we're sinful and not one of the because of of all this other stuff that happened and criminality and pornography and all the other things that we've embrace were simple because we elected Trump\nBy the way just a racket I think the ah the blue wave is going to turn out to be a a leaky faucet\nBut [laughter]\nI I just there's nothing I sense out the law there's no you remember Ninety four you could feel I mean I felt that there was an upheaval calming against Clinton and the elites are just everywhere as the Republicans were dominating\nA the debate and winning the debate and know the Democrats were left just defending bill and Hillary who want to do that anyway especially since I got\nForty three percent of the two years before is that is as clumsy is Trump is he still talking about issues that are people's minds with is the economy with its border with ISIS all those things are on people's minds is that with the Democrats are not talking about anything and you know from politics is that\nYou can't beat something with nothing right now the Democrats nothing except opposition to Trump and that's just not going to cut it outside of San Francisco and New York and", "show_name": "The Chris Plante Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Anchorage", "day": "22"}
