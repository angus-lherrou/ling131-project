can come forward and tell\nOnly take about forty seven seconds Josh and and I see more show you know edit it down to the nuggets of hate and bitterness and envy\nAnd ... and the things they despise so much on the other shows I think they've reached the point where so few people are watching but they're paying attention playing it elsewhere a show exactly how hateful they are and how out of touch their ratings are lower than a certain network\nLike tiny are reaching in our church and they're bitter angry about it and it's it's quite a mate\nTiny are reaching an inch\nAnd they're bitter and angry about it and it's it's quite amazing\nYeah no that that there there is reality there there is truth there um I thank you for the call but there there's no doubt I mean you look at the ratings CNN is just\nIt's tragic I mean it's really tragic and on big night for like during the cabinet battle and things that they were they were really hurting I mean in comparison to Fox Fox was having four six million people watching and CNN had half a million people\nVery interesting what's happening out there but again it's that runs been exactly to what I was saying a moment ago\nThese elites think they will tell the public what they want and if they keep doing it the public will have nowhere to go but to them the public will eventually get the genius and keep watching it doesn't work that way\nProgramming no longer works that way and there are no longer three networks that hold the monopoly on oil eyeballs in the country\nAnd whether it's the people programming ABC with this Roseanne rebuild or the folks at CNN shoving Don Lemon down people's throats I just don't think it works if it doesn't matter what I think it doesn't work it demonstrably probably does not work Chris New Jersey wanted to say what\nI call it a little Democrat who looked at the low but doesn't agree with their train of thought on the look on the\nOn the on the young or ... or whatever I\nSay I don't know how to do that in a way that a certain way and then you're looking at is how you know the poets who got like a bottle I don't\nKnow though is that like all the media ... and he\nSaid oh that's all they got a\nGreat point great point Chris and it's great and important that you are thinking for yourself thinking outside of whatever identity a shtick you're supposed to be exemplify because of your race or your sexuality or whatever\n... we all should be thinking for ourselves we all should be free to move to the right or left but ... to to come script\nA whole race of people because of the color of their skin I'm Sorry that wasn't Martin Luther king's dream that shouldn't be the aspiration of people a free people\nI I and and frankly listening to the hatred the racist hatred coming from even members of Kanye West west own race it's appalling what Don Lemon said yesterday and I'm In a play it for you um\nHe invoked ... mother which I thought it was particularly egregious listen\nWe need to take the cameras away from Tanya a and from a lot of this craziness that happens in the White House because it is not normal this was an embarrassment ... mother is rolling over in her grave she would be terribly disturbed by the Congress has not been the same since his mother died\nThank you Dr now he's a psychiatrist now you can plumbed the depths of Kanye West's mind and heart and his grief apparently Wendy Georgia you wanted to comment on this your reaction\nYeah yeah even more so to me than the dead mother thing there is another town down limits comment and it was take the cameras away from ... and the White House that 'cause I Believe what happened yesterday was so powerful to build upon what dominates ... and other people\nThey have started to pull back the curtain and twenty five minutes yesterday 'cause I watch the whole thing I wanted to know exactly what went down and twenty five minutes\nKind of thing that cartoon about twenty five more fake\nMhm well that's the danger here and I do think\nHe was he was being very vulnerable in front of all those cameras and ... to ... Don lemons point CNN was running the event live to just like everybody else they were desperate for every moment they were not going to miss Kanye West meeting with Donald Trump\nIt was a big moment it was a big moment\nSo to say take the cameras away spare me okay thank you you go back to talking about you know the trade surplus in Indonesia on CNN International and we'll watch ratings continue to create or lower than they are now\nBut I you know I see I Want more cameras I Want to see more I Want to see the other side of crazy I Want to see the cameras on Capitol Hill and the lobbyist shaping our our our every bill and pushing legislation that the American people don't want let's see that\nYou want to public service let's show that crazy\nSee we ... we hype but we also hyper focus I think all things like this this is important to the African American vote as a bloc it's very important because a major influential a agent of influence in the middle of that community\nHas decided to come out and say you know what I think differently from what I'm supposed to think I'm going to right outside the lines here and that is dangerous tall dangerous wrong but beneath that was something else there was a cultural critique about\nSomething happening in the black community about father listening about what it means to be a man and not only in the black community in the wider community as well thank you for that call um I Know I wanted to talk to a cat in Kansas my cat you're in the mid west\nOr the Roseanne show was originally designed to appeal to people like you and that is where the heart of\nThe viewership for that show came from and I think returned when it re booted some of the highest ratings of last year without Roseanne will you watch the Connors and why not\nFor now I Will not I I Can't say that daughter ours um I like John that way and I don't mind her sister but I Will that Roseanne she was the center of the whole show without her that show was laughing\nAnd I felt bad for jobs that men just stand there I feel like he is kind of a\nWhole life so there are I I Will I Will watch it basically because of how they read it throws in and they I don't I Can't stand ... daughter first\n[laughter] [laughter] well I think you know John Goodman in in um\nSaid you know I think my character is going to spend most of the season moping around or you know feeling sorry because he lost his wife and I think that's probably right\nThat look there's no reason for the show to go on without Roseanne that's the reality\nThe only reason it ABC was already out of pocket so they were either going to do some show would these people or they were just going to be right paychecks of these folks to go off and have a vacation\nBut they were on the hook so that's why the Conner says going forward but is it going to die you bet I think it will be canceled after a few shows\nThat's my prediction will see bank your cat for the call mark Florida you wanted to say what then we'll go to a break in a moment\nBack your cat for the call mark Florida you wanted to say what then we'll go to a break in a moment\n[noise] yeah right I mean if you recall back er during Katrina Tanya way Tony west spoke out against Trump or I'm Sorry that so that a ... black people and uh now this amazing apartment to the media now that he's a\nFor crop of a sudden I got a mental illness and Saddam believable\nNo no well this is again that because as as one of the caller said earlier it's almost like stromboli in in ... when the puppet is doing what you want it to do yes yes this is great when the puppet cuts the strings then it's a problem\nLook I ... and this is why I'm not saying Kanye West is you know a a ... this is he's not Lincoln here let's not get ahead of ourselves\nI think there are people on the right who want to suddenly crown Kanye West is the leader of you know African Americans in in Republican circles well look to somebody like Clarence Thomas or a ... you know Walter Williams is somebody who really has a\nFull flashed philosophy on politics\nAnd race that is informed impassioned and thoughtful I think that's where you look for that kind of leadership so let's not get ahead of our skis here an annoying Kanye West is somehow the sum total of a black conservative call\nAt the same time he shouldn't be ridiculed now\nFor saying something that the media considers crazier outlandish because he's going to meet with Donald Trump\nWhen the other day something crazy an outlandish that he said was considered brilliant because he was attacking a Republican president so it's a it's an interesting double standard we're going to take a break we'll be right back the marine Corp she'll continue in moments take the Laura Ingraham

and he went he went on basically a ten minute monologue it was quite something to behold [noise]\nAnd [noise] he as you heard he he basically is calling the Democrat out on there blanketing blank for taking the black vote for granted and also for demanding that black people think\nA certain way this has been something that we've talked about since I launched this radio show in two thousand one and

that we heard that question raised\nSo it goes to the Confederate flag Robert release statues none of that creates a one job for African Americans\nNot one job but they beat that drum why why do they beat that drum you're listening\nTo your health a radio addiction your reaction to Trump flipping the script will it actually result in more African American votes for Republicans or at least get them to look twice at the Republican Party\nEight five five forty or I Want to hear your reaction OK so cognac continues after he talks about the the fact that he didn't have a lot of it was basically saying you didn't have a real ... male role model at home and then he continued\nEveryone but the campaign\nDidn't make me feel that the guy they can get to see my dad all the time like a guy\nWas it was something about when I put his hat off and make you feel like Superman made a Superman that was the favorite superhero and you made a Superman case for me\nSo Donald Trump or as someone who defied the odds to win the presidency that is what Kanye West is is referencing there I Believe like anything's possible in America\nThey all said you couldn't do it they all said you your campaign would flame out they said you would get transferred by Jeb Bush they said that ah the Hillary was then going to destroy you and it was going to be a member of the all the predictions that Trump would lose in a massive landslide you remember that I Do we played them every night and every day\nWell all of that was false and Trump became president and Kanye West I think is a man who you know he didn't have a lot of male role models Donald Trump has been a friend for a long time it doesn't mean Donald Trump gets everything right personally we know he hasn't none of us do\nBut I think that there was something profound and what he said there the ... the Hillary campaign slogan was I'm with her and for African American men they love their moms of course a lot of these women are heroic are trying to raise kids on their own it's not easy\nAnd but they he's saying and it's it's probably in today's day and age not politically correct but he doesn't care to I I wanted a male role model to follow and I'm someone who\nIs going to bring male energy to the office of the presidency Hillary slogan didn't speak to him it's just his personal opinion\nI mean you can disagree with it you can say it's well it's kind of off off base Hillary was just really smart and she would have been a bit better president how we obviously no that's not true\nBut you do you notice that Don Lemon et cetera did not actually speak about any of the substance that comedy I brought up let's keep listening to Kanye West listening\nCan use a lot of other need someone to help him and if the guy them I mean he's a hug more than anything calling you back away from the cameras\nDo get some help and then come back and make your case nobody if you want to be conservative if you want to support Donald Trump that is your business as you're doing it have some sense with it make sense educate yourself\nOh wait a second so Jay Z and Beyonce who were at the president's side and on speed dial I think they joke they're big policy experts and George Clooney because he testified before Congress he used to be all and end all and human rights in in Africa I mean I guess\nI I Will go okay he knows more than all the diplomat and all the people have devoted their lives for this well I mean you could raise a question about that right but no one ever did they never raised questions about any of these folks and how about Miley Cyrus running from dorm room to dorm room\nKaty Perry running around college campuses it's trying to explain domestic policy to students okay these people wouldn't know a domestic policy of a bit I'm In the back side\nWill take a break John Cornyn coming up your calls eight five five forty ... we'll get to all your calls Kanye West helps Trump and the Republicans\nFlip the script this is a unconventional move\nAnd we'll see if it pays off it certainly is interesting don't go with\n\n\nMe\nThis is Michael ... and here with Mike stole from health markets helping folks find the right Medicare coverage the news reports say that the rates might be going down the cost of\nMany Medicare plans are decreasing this year so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best rate health markets offers a free service with access to thousands of Medicare plans plans I can eliminate you're out of pocket cost plans with zero dollar premiums and even plant that pay you back\nWhat is that people need to keep in mind with so many new options it can be confusing you can get objective help to find a plan that may cost less and cover more with what we're co pay more choices like dental vision and prescription drug coverage\nAnd the freedom to see the doctors huge you don't miss out on savings you deserve our help markets Medicare assistance is free\nJustified of this best but you know at some point it it gets to the level of incitement we're not talking about free speech we're talking about inciting people to violence like Eric Holder did which is a dangerous and I don't think ah I don't think we ought to reward that at all\nNow and it seems to me that the more successful Senator Cornyn this administration is the more Congress unites with the president on issues such as this statement actually in United\nIt's almost like it's driving the last ... into a uncontrolled frenzy and they can't stand it the better America is doing they are there more and more angry\n[laughter] well as you know or the holy grail for the left as the Supreme Court\nAnd they can't stay on the idea that a President Trump has now point to two outstanding nominees to the Supreme Court as well as\nOur confirming a number a larger number probably the largest at this point the president's see I'm a court of appeals judges and a district judges and this is the driving them I think to\nUh to the uh unattractive uh to say the least I'm sort of activism which frankly I mean do we want to turn the government over to these people after the midterm elections I don't think so\nThere was an interview with a colleague Ted Cruz's challenge or the other day Beto O'Rourke about on the confirmation of Kevin I'm going to play it and get your reaction let's listen let me get you on the record on on judge Kavanaugh would you voted\nTo confirm him I Would not have we the Supreme Court justice who believes in voting rights\nA justice who believes in a woman's right to make her own decision about her own body and have access to the health care than ensures that she can he fails more on each and every single one of those tests so the next justice to be nominated can only be confirmed if she were importantly she can meet those qualifications\nYour reaction to that\nBait do ah I Know they do pretty well and he's a he's a he's a nice enough guy but clearly he's not running for the United States Senate from Texas\nI'm he's out of step with the with Texas values and and this and every other important area my only suspicion laws he's running for the Democratic nomination for president in twenty twenty because he's appealing to the national Democrats and the hard left\nOr who are who are we're seeing a or create these the sort of mob rule\nAnd then it or what is your best take right now on the Republicans in the mid terms mean you've heard ... are very confident that the Democrats are going to swamp the Republicans in the house and Senate but how does things really look we'll start with the cruise seat\n... and that's in good shape the latest Quinnipiac poll shows him nine points up but as you know this was all about turnout we know the left as angry the people that are still angry that Trump won and twenty sixteen\nAnd mid term elections we usually see a down dip in turnout but\nUh I think the Kavanaugh hearings shoved energized our our base and um we've seen people like governor ... in Tennessee said well he would have voted for a cab and all but I'm the truth is\nIf you were what the Democrat this mid term then we're going to jeopardize our ability to confirmed more federal judges\nAnd a Chuck turn of the Senate over to Chuck Schumer and uh I just don't think ah ah the country is ready for that\nNo well I certainly I certainly hope not speaking and just back on the ... issue for a moment I devoted a lot of time on my show senator to be discussing what next when the president if the president gets another Supreme Court pick\nThe incentive to me seems to be still\nThere for that type of circus we saw\nFor Kavanaugh in namely there's no there's no repercussions for leaving a FBI report\nOr or a or a letter or anything confidential that's not supposed to be public there are no repercussions\nSo given the fact that there were no repercussions silly now there hasn't been yet do you think it's appropriate for the president or would you recommend that the president authorizes an FBI investigation into how this information about Dr Ford ended up leaking out to the press [noise]\nSo I have pretty good suspicion about how it leaked out to the press has you know after Senator Feinstein sat on the SAT on the letter and then leaked that set it to the FBI after the initial um the initial hearing\nThan it was returned by the FBI to the judiciary committee's background investigation file where it was available to every senator on the Judiciary Committee\nSo much suspicion is that uh one of the one of the Democratic senators or their staff are the ones ultimately responsible for leaking\nThe letter or I'm\nMost cats or a doctor forge warrior although she certainly didn't serve Dr Ford interest very well in the way she handled all of this but yet we're gonna\nWe're gonna get to the bottom of this or are they ... they'll probably be an ethics committee investigation and my hope is the Judiciary Committee will get to the bottom of this because this is simply unacceptable\nAnd thank goodness we didn't reward this with a\nA success and killing the nomination of of cabinet or this would be the new normal\nYeah I I agree with you senator\nOf of cabinet or this would be the new normal\nYeah I I agree with you senator I I just think it's so important for the country going forward that names when we need to know names we need to know who did this and we need to know the extent of the a collaboration\nWith outside groups many of them funded by the political ... of the Republicans and how that coordination occurred that means people have to preserve their emails and their tax messages I I just think you know getting involved the ethics an ethics investigation is fine\nBut there's nothing like an FBI investigation really trace what happened who did it\nAnd someone is lying someone dying here\nWell I guess what we need to do is identify the what are the jurisdiction of federal district whether a federal crime was committed here uh I I hadn't really thought that much about it but perhaps there isn't that would provide the hook for an FBI investigation and if there has been\nA federal crime committed I wholeheartedly support that investigation by the FBI\nOr Senator John Cornyn uh here in the lower income show senator or for the next uh you know three and a half weeks on this is going to be a sprint to the finish for Republicans I have the sense that the Republican Party is more unified than it's been\nI don't know since when I mean it just it seems like all hands on deck people are working together they're not back biting each other as much and Jeff Flake is is not a fan of the president's he wants a primary challenge but Marco Rubio said\nThe president will win reelection you haven't had Nikki Haley thinks she's going to campaign for the president twenty twenty\nOr what is your sense of the Republican unity right now\nA lot more optimistic that I've been in a long time for the record of accomplishment with the Republican majorities in the house the Senate is pretty darn impressive I Know\nThe mainstream media doesn't cover a lot of the success that we've had here but\nReally this focus on the judiciary and the fact that uh the Democratic candidates for the Senate are not going to support President Trump's nominees this has become the crucible and which I think\nThat it has United all all Republicans and people all across the political spectrum from the center right uh to the right and so I'm I'm very optimistic but we just have to keep that energy up but the fact of the matter is people like John tester who doesn't support either Gorsuch or\nA or a cabinet or some of the other Democrats on the ballot Catskill McCaskill exactly in Missouri\nDid not support President Trump's nominees and that I think is going to be the issue that's going to pick up seats force in the mid term\nSenator your reaction to the Kanye West to parents in the oval office yesterday\n[noise] I just think it's hilarious that are that the mainstream media is hyperventilating over that uh we all know that President Obama had rappers and other\nCelebrities in the oval office during his time but there is a double standard as we all know uh for this president and I just thought it was a I thought it was pretty hilarious\nYeah I mean Michelle Obama invited that profane rapper common to the White House to read poetry his his his stuff is filled with every expletive on earth but he was up there reading poetry so and now with everything that's great we're reaching out with this wonderful it's authentic and meanwhile Trump has is that near west in there\nYou have to admit Senator Cornyn truck makes things pretty ... pretty unconventional and in in kind of holds up a mirror to the Democrats does he not I\nI think so well it's it is just drive he makes their heads explode and they act and all sorts of or Russian irrational ways and\nAnd uh we've seen that the the judicial confirmation but we saw again yesterday on on TV and uh I think this we just need to get this midterm election behind us we need to keep the house in the ... so we can continue making progress for the American people including the adding more federal judges to the bench\nOh my gosh is it the judicial branch coal equal branch of our government article three judges we need more Trump nominees on the bench and many declare those are cleared those through Senator Cornyn again thanks so much for all you did a confirmation battle over Kavanaugh's Iraq", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Chris Plante Show", "city": "Anchorage", "day": "12"}
