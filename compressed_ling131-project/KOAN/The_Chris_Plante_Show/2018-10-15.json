[laughter] I'm Sorry this is funny now Donald Trump was asked about\nThis or on a on the south lawn of the White House before he took off for Florida let's listen to\nDo I\nTo hear\nReaders yes or no no no he went on to say he hope she's running for president he hope she's running for president he went on and on about that that was the least interesting part of the uh the White House blonde but nevertheless he was he was like well I Hope she does Ron because this will be an easy way out for me\nYeah I Hope she ends up being the nominee I mean what Democrats are putting forward now the progressive left Democrats\nWill change our country and and we did a video actually recently talking about what socialism actually means and the cost of it\nBecause Democrats keeps saying free health care free that's free everything and they're not saying this well quadruple your taxes it will destroy our country go look at Venezuela get educated on this if you like the country that we live in today with a with economic opportunity with prosperity with wages coming up\nAt Democrats are not that people you want to vote for\n'em and I have to ask you about what the house looks like I Know it's hard to predict every races is different but\nDid anyone predict at this point that the Republicans would be frankly making a comeback it looks like in this midterm election cycle\nWith the Kavanaugh a win for Donald Trump and he turns around and I think he fights for for Kavanaugh unlike anyone else and now the people are like the skin the he's the best clothes or we have this could actually help in the house races\nIt could it is helping we're seeing that in our data obviously they are in the U.S put a huge ground game in place we've trained twenty five thousand field organizers that's five times more than we did\nWhen twenty sixteen to turn out our vote to educate voters to talk about the results I there's a lot of house races in the balance there's about thirty so the house is going to be neck and neck I think until election day I think that every counts\nTo determine the majority and then the Senate is breaking our way\nUh in North Dakota and Missouri\nI was in Indiana this weekend with my run I mean the energy and the Senate sides great we could definitely pick up seats which is unprecedented in mid term of a first term president so I feel good about where we are Kavanaugh has definitely energized our base and I've seen that in our mail I'm seeing it in our fundraising all across the board it has\nPut a good choice in front of our voters do we really want with the Democrats are offering obstruct resist the smear campaign\nThe the search and destroy it all costs or do we really want a party that's putting forward results that are helping average American families\nAre run on before we let you go the ah the word that in reporting that there is yet another care of on their caravan or two or three caravan\nOf migrants are coming from Guatemala and Honduras making their way through Mexico to the U.S southern border um my listeners are enraged by this they want to stop they want this Congress to make\nA make it clear that we can do a media turned back some new legislation at the border stopping the application of asylum at border entry points instead of doing it in your home country\nOf what what are you asking the Republican Party to do to stop this this madness I mean we don't have a wall and now we have more people just flooding into the country\nWhile the president has let on S. and you've you've heard signals from the Senate and the house it they're going to look at funding for the wall during a the ... or during the time between this election in January they should I mean I think about what these kids are going through these poor children are being\nDragged across Mexico to our border they're being put in very dangerous situations oftentimes when they come into the United states there last\nWe have a human trafficking problem this is something that Democrats should be working with the president to solve they don't um and it's going to take Republican leadership to step up and solve this immigration problem we have a serious problem at our borders and we have to resolve it\nKnow we have to resolve it and of course everyone's heart breaks for the children who are as you said put in danger by taking this long track\nA but the American children the American people homeless veterans inner city America they need the attention of our lawmakers first and foremost have to take care of our own people\nWho opioids

violence of people in the lift up and they laughed and said it was hyperbole no it's not now it's on\nAnd as a patriot prayer group\nThat was holding their rally and they had one a couple of months ago an anthem for did the same damn thing they showed up prepared\nFor battle they start fights they like conflict and like I said a the police are there to\nKeep the peace not let this stuff happened not been but don't break those are failed strategies\nAnd until they make it clear with a answer for that their antics are not going to be allowed to go on under the guise of protests because this is not protests and I'll tell you what what irks me as well as when a commentators I'm not talking about you but there are commentators\nAre on the right who continued to refer to what ... and some of this other political violence is when they're shouting down\nA and intimidating people in a restaurant they keep calling it protests it's not protest\nIt is insurgency answer for calls for the\nKilling of police officers they call for the down fall of the United states lawfully in to the government\nNow and I know anyone who calls that legitimate protests doesn't know what they're talking about it it's it's intimidation uh it's it's a type of\nOf political extortion too when they do it to the senators and in the elevators I keep saying sheriff Clarke why is this even allowed in the halls of the U.S Senate why should why should people be able to to get within a centimeter from someone else's face and scream at them\nIn the in the in the halls of the uh the capital that should be allowed\nRight and but see these groups they realize that not much is going to be done about it and I write you know senators and another congressman congresswoman too you know keep their decorum but then some of this is happening to private citizens for instance at Trump rallies for instance just this rally held by the\nPatriot prayer group a in Portland, Oregon and I've been saying for a long time to that we have to have more effective counter measures and people say well what does it look like and I can tell people what I Would do and I don't advocate for what anybody else to do but I tell them you're going to think about this now you have to have a plan because they view\nToward any other cheek taking the high road walking away they view that as a sign of weakness in like you said Laurie you hit the nail right on this this is designed to intimidate and incite fear and people to get them to alter their their votes they're public policy that's why I'm calling this\nPolitical violence it's gone on for too long it's gone on\nToo far and and the more that you let this go on the worst is get I mean we should have learned this from the sixties which is the\nThe anarchist movement that I study to know what they're up to to know what their antics are and also know that what they learned out of the sixties law enforcement meaning of what they learned was that those sauce masters just lead to more people getting hurt\nMore people getting killed more property damage and they we I Would like to think that we learn that that doesn't work but we are committing the same mistakes or in law enforce\nI agree and I think we're seeing the same results and we'll get into this and just a moment sheriff Clarke at the border with this new caravan caravans approaching the border or so we'll get to that in mind but I Want to play something for you this is from Don in Brazil on ABC's This week and and it was on a panel with Chris Christie and others\nResistance that about ... about people who do not want the health care about women who want to be heard and listen to when they feel that it's time to talk about their problem of sexual assault there isn't that about mob\nYou're running it maybe that's what it would be about but when we listen to what the Democrats were coming on TV you're talking about is talking about in painting Brett Kavanaugh for reading painting Donald Trump I and the [laughter] the deal I agree with Rick Silva mob\nIowa reaction to that\nPolicy Montana ... you know myth on Brazil\nI'm not too long and we had a great conversation and she told me the true she said the stuff happening on the left is wrong she knows it's wrong but see they don't have the courage to call it up when I hear of people like her and I hear others not denounce\nThis violence it is a mob and she ought to just admit it but like I said she doesn't have the courage she saw the backlash when she came out with her book\nThat really took the or the DNC the Democratic party to task and she saw the filter blowback realized she better scurry back on the plantation and that's what she did at the end of her her a book tour but I think that's what she's up to again she needs to exhibit leadership people in the Senate\nYou're not going to get it from Maxine Waters with others in the Senate\nLeaders exhibits leadership we call this crap all for what it is to tell these people to knock it off but what they do lawyers you know or their tacit approval is comes from the silence and if they do see anything like they try to make that well it's not a mob it's really about health care no it's not just trying to to frame of narrative\nAnd a ... everybody knows what she's up too but they do it with a wink and a nod when when they tried to uh when they're forced I should say to say that answer for and some of these other goons this I'm a feminist movement was pulling their crap\nYou know they do with a wink and a nod when they go well yeah maybe a little bit but you know their their silence give tacit approval to this political violence\nOr insure Clark before we let you go ah the Democrat Stacey Abrams in other she's running for governor in Georgia saying that they represent both documented and undocumented\nUm people in this country and left a whole bunch of other groups they claim to represent a and now we have this\nIs mad a crush about to happen again in the southwest border with more caravans of people showing up because you know we basically are just now releasing people who are coming over with a with children\nBy this is dangerous to continue they meaning the left they continue to push the envelope on this stuff she doesn't represent undocumented anybody citizenship is you know means something in this country they're diluting the meaning of citizenship and what citizenship means is that all the rights of privileges that are in the constitution\nOr belong to the United states citizens not non citizens so they're actually taking the citizens of Georgia what she's doing\nThe the residents of the state of Georgia and she's making them second class citizens\nWell and again on this Congress must work with the president both on the wall\nAnd of course allowing for immediate turned back at the border sheriff Clarke otherwise we're just going to keep this this keep happening\nAnd it's going to be an entire a migration of people from Central America into this country I completely illegal not wanted by this country not why by the people but just because they can and they know if they cross the border there ... there are no one's going to make 'em leave\nWell they're gonna have to be turned back but I think there's going to be a moment of truth that really is\nA in terms of this administration I support the president's policies on immigration or illegal immigration and you know it is you're you're right it's the Congress who has not moved on this shame on the geo pecan Congress I think they squandered an opportunity here who knows what's going to happen in November but they squandered an opportunity to straighten out\nThis an elite is broken or immigration system to\nFinally seal the border that's the first thing that has to be done everything else that that people are proposing follows sealing the border because of you\nIt has to be done everything else that the people are proposing follows stealing the border because if you don't steal the border we just saw last week we're still a guy committed some heinous act against the United states citizen a beating has been deported six\nTimes lore six we heard stories of people who've been caught that have been deported\nThirty times it's not a made up number but the ... the borders is so poor or easily or they can easily get back in Seoul no it's a matter of\nUm you know the eleventh hour and and I don't know we're going to maintain the house I I I Hope when I say we the Jill ... I Hope they can but if they don't all this stuff is off the table but Democrats are not going to allow that wall to be built they're not going to fix the immigration system they're going to give citizenship\nThrough some measure to illegal aliens amnesty I'm Talking about and you know of course we have a president that will put a block on that the Senate will but at the same time we shouldn't be fighting the battle right now we squandered a GOP Senate and house squandered\nTwo years for heaven's sakes with a very a strong\nPresident ... arms of stealing the border and immigration a broken
