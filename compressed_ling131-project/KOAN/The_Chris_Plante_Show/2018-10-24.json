and that one had the damage at six and then the one before that another Democrat or happy down three so it is going really well we are getting throughout the state and meeting a green talk and\nHad a big debate the other night uh only state wide televised debate and my opponent I chose not to show up the only Democrat who didn't show up for the debate well\nHow how would that be even possible I mean the Democrats have made some fairly significant headway in in\nAh both the Senate seat since Norm Coleman and uh since uh you know we've lost the governorship\nPlenty and then he tried to run again and he he got a defeated obviously I'm In his bid for the Senate ah but where where are we now and trying to\nAnd trying to rebuild the Republican Party in that state Minnesota's economy has been doing so well and the Trump era of just two years we've seen a massive ah uptick\nIn the states productivity this is all positive why would people want to vote against that now\n[noise] worldly doubt out we have a or Minnesota is turning Red Cross the whole state people are stealing it they're happy with the way the economy is going\nAnd I think Tina Smith didn't show up to the debate the other night because she didn't have any answers to this and where she stands on the issue she's so far left and so extreme and and part of the resistance and obstructing everything good that is happening on the ground a and then she's also\nA for open borders and she wants to Minnesota to be a sanctuary state and she is directly tied to Keith Ellison still continuing to campaign with him\nYet uh being hypocritical as as they are she's again you know wanting to impeach uh Brett Kavanaugh justice cabin on call for another investigation so\nMinnesotans are are some of the most well educated people when they go to the polls we don't have to register Democrat or Republican were free to move without the cabin when we go vote and they do their research and and uh we have some of the ... we have the highest turn out\nIn the country when it comes to voting and so we go educated so it was really disappointing that Tina Smith did want to debate nay or at least tell the people of Minnesota where she stands on thing because she knows that's not what's resonating on the ground\nWell a Speaker Ryan Paul Ryan was in Minnesota uh yesterday and warned or the day before yesterday was warning of a green wave\nOf democratic fund raising in a visit to drum up support for uh some of the house candidates Erik Paulsen and Jason Lewis\nAnd there are there are two of the more vulnerable in our house candidates I'm but Brian said as a normal amount of Democrat money flooding the state\nOf last week Gabby Giffords came and did a a star turn there for some of the Democratic congressional candidates a and they they believe that if they can fully turn Minnesota blue then that will be another blockade for a Trump and twenty twenty\n[noise] uh and and it's not happening I'm not feeling it anywhere even in the primary what happened to your ... so you go before it happened we could have told you what was going to happen\nUm Minnesota is definitely turning red we flipped our state house in two thousand and fourteen to Republican our state Senate in two thousand and sixteen or we've got up on the iron range which has voted Democrat for more than sixty years\nNow going to flip Republican we've got a great candidate up there and he's plus Fifteen ... all of the rural areas are farmers are really on board with what the president is doing finally somebody is fighting for our farmers including their issues at the forefront of a campaign so\nIt's all it's all the the uh of fake media and their rhetoric and talking about the blue wave and it's I'm not feeling it anyway and that's just me not just me as a candidate I really am not when I'm traveling throughout the state there's a lot of energy behind the president and and even when he came for the two rallies he's already done to rally\nCycle here in Minnesota there's a lot of excitement for my campaign and for the rest of the candidates throughout the state\nOur current housley it is a fantastic to have you on a ... everybody needs to get out there and vote because the woman who was appointed Tina Smith\nIs even worse than Al Franken if you can believe that and she you know she uh obviously you know thinks that she'll be able to just snuck or the\nMinnesotan voters for more liberal policies in open borders forget it ... the last thing the Minnesotans need our politicians in the state or in a a senators representing the state who believe that they need more regulations on\nThe small business owners and more problems for the medical device manufacturers who have done such a great job to route to reinvigorate the Minnesota economy after the uh the great recession so care current housley has got to win the seat that would be phenomenal news\nAs we march or even after this election toward twenty twenty I think Donald Trump can win twenty twenty and twenty twenty Minnesota He he he didn't win it last time around but he made a Mitt valiant attempt at the very end to try to pull out a victory a car and thank you so much best of luck\nIn that race or for that Senate seat a that was vacated by um the group or Al Franken All right we'll take a break a five five forty Laura we have a lot more to get to\nA this Andrew Gillum Rhonda Santas debate tonight is going to be critical of by the way oh by the way there's a story I forgot to I was going to mention the current Mexican man
