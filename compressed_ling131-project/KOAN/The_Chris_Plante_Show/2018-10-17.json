Michel says the cronies guys on multiple luxury flights to the Caribbean with a wealthy donor pal Salman ... Melgen on taxpayer these on a dime\nIt will he was only convicted of sixty seven sell these ...

application along with her sisters received reconsideration an instant approval after the big donor and friend of mine end as promised to fix it by reaching out to Sen Menendez\nSaid this is just\nKind of stuff that just gross it's\nAs close to one more thing I tell you though you know we started this campaign I think the number was something like less than thirty percent or around the less than a third of the jerseys even knew that senator Menendez was indicted by the Obama Justice department\nAnd when the media talks about um this is old news NATO this came out in twenty Fifteen way after his last elections FBI affidavit and and the and hasn't been covered something like only a small number of people who even know what this issue of what he's gone to the FBI effort David

detain these families so that their cases would be hurt quickly so that the good cases can be separated that circa ... cases could eat that night and those folks can be returned to the United states\nThey could also uh you know change the asylum laws so that if you pass through countries where they granted asylum like Guatemala like Mexico\nThat you would be expected to apply for asylum in those countries before you come to the United states and again you keep hearing that some of these you know individuals have legitimate claims\nIf they do they should be applying for asylum Guatemala they should be applying for asylum let's hope but there are in addition ah the ah the administration is taking steps to end the floor as a rule where are the company daily in a ... have to be released after twenty days\nUm Congress can you know step in and they can end the floor as a\nSettlement agreement or if they'd like but again\nThere are free or judges right they're afraid of being called mean spirited that's what they're ... and it doesn't matter if how many instances of hideous you know criminal acts had been committed by illegal aliens even DACA kids which we've also documented on the show\nDoesn't matter for them it doesn't matter it's it it's a it's an emotional manipulation game and they want to they want to pull the heartstrings and America and put these Republicans\nBack on their heels says okay you want to put babies in cages you want to put babies how many times that we hear kids in cages kids in cages we heard that phrase over and over and over again\nIn ... we do separate children from adults very briefly a U.S citizenship or a U.S customs and border protection does that\nIn order to protect the children but then we move them very quickly into the best facilities that we have available coverage can provide more money for that but here's really what it comes down to the trip that these people take to the United states is so horrendous rapes robberies murders\nUnder the Obama administration when they had similar uh programs we saw NPR run articles about this we saw National Geographic of all things\nAre run an article about this but you don't actually hear about that anymore all these little girl at a tipping shirt standing next to her mother crying is border patrol agent\nMake sure that her mother doesn't have any kind of bend the child travel through the night without food how in the world any parents can subject their child but this horrendous drone that states is beyond\nA when you when you see these four thousand people now just grows and grows and grows this caravan\nWho is paying for this I think there is no way when you have a per capita income of\nYou know two thousand five hundred dollars in Honduras each individual can pay the seven thousand dollars up to ten thousand dollars a cost to get to the United states so someone's footing the bill here who is it do you think\nI I I Wish I knew I Wish I had some idea and quite frankly I expect the administration to be looking into that a lot of these people though are you know doing this because they believe that the that the amount of money that they have to borrow or get from somebody or that they are given\nA they can pay back once they work in the United states who are very brief period of time and unfortunately the economics probably work in their favor this is another incentive again went back you verify the people can't work they will come\nAnd if they can't pay back their smugglers are definitely not going to run the risk of being smuggled to the United states\nWe need mandatory e verify that's the key is the kingdom but until we get to that point we need to change that we need more immigration judges to hear these cases as quickly as possible so do a good cases can come in but the vast majority of the bad cases are can be returned\nTo eighty percent or eighty eight percent some I guess some cases by some measures of those who apply for asylum from Central America are denied yet only five percent of those who are denied actually are you know ever going to leave the country is not the case is that is that a proximity right\nThat's approximately correct we are talking to you know upwards of nine hundred thousand my God\nIn the United states under ... they've received their due process or it's not like they're waiting for their their their hearing everything that they had coming than they've had but they remain in the United states we continue to work here again we have no ... no way to verify that there are leading in\nIce chips lacks the resources to go out and find\nTerrified that there are leading in\nIce just lack of resources to go out and find ones and twos these people\nPlus you you put on top of that the sanctuary laws places like California and localities where you know people under ... orders of removal you know are apprehended by the police it shows up on the ref sheet that they're under a puddle order removal\nAnd yet they get released a back into society and they're not return to their home countries but everybody needs to work together in order to make the system work with any one part of it breaks down the entire system breaks down and that's what leads to a human tragedy that we see along the border\nMark Krikorian ah your colleagues on a with me last night art and he said that the folks in a Guatemala who are being interviewed by the you know the MSNBC traveling reporter traveled with the migrants\nHadn't been coached yet so all he said well look I Want to work in the United states and they're just no jobs here and\nNever mentioned anything about persecution and mark said well that's because he hasn't gotten to Mexico where all the court coaching really occurs that's where you get do you know the paragraph that you have to say no matter what when when when authorities interview so the script for everybody man woman and child seems to be\nThe same and I fear for a fair for my family I'm going to be killed by the gangs which is why sessions wants to remove domestic abuse and gang concern correct from the asylum a consideration\nHe already has done that through a\nHomeland security bill I think it was attached to that bill\nYeah it but you know here's the other problem or this is the next year that's going to drop\nAbout Seventy five percent of all people who claim credible fear ... have credible here even though the asylum numbers or a ... as you mentioned before the problem is that if people allege that they have suffered or fear or something then uh they get referred over for torture convention claim back\nIn Nineteen Ninety nine the Reno a Justice Department gave authority over a planes into the convention against torture to immigration judges even though it might be years before an individual's removed from the United states da\nChest needs to give that authority back to ... or ah the Justice Department needs to get that authority back to ... so that they can make the determination whether someone's going to be tortured white before that person will leave the United states because that's really the critical core\nWell and also a as its here someone else made the point when someone claimed domestic abuse there's no way for us to verify that even if that was a legitimate reason I'm horrible thing\nBut think about the people were going to be bringing into the country from all over the world if it's well it's domestic abuse I'm afraid of domestic abuse well it hasn't even been investigated in their home country how are people to investigate\nA local domestic violence concerns from an immigration proceeding in or review in Texas or Arizona just ludicrous\nIt's even worse than that because there's a regulation and plays but actually prevents the United states government for best a gated whether or not that claimed took place in the home country nothing that's contained asylum application can be disclosed to anyone outside of that asylum proceed with only very limited exceptions none of which would apply in those cases\nAre in the turned back at the border and that's the other thing we have to be able to expedite which means even to non contiguous countries or if you're from Guatemala we need to change the law doing not so we can do immediate border turned backs like we can with Mexicans\nYes and a under a the TV puree the trafficking victims protection that we have actually a handover on accompanied alien minors to ha chess and Asians a department of the United states government that really doesn't\nDo this for a for a living\nAnd yet you know Congress back in two thousand and sue decided that ha ha I should have this responsibility and they don't do it very well its history a show so yeah we need to change the rule for people from contiguous countries Mexico or Canada we don't get that many meetings", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Chris Plante Show", "city": "Anchorage",
