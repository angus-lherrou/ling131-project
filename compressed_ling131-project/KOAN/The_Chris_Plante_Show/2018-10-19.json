I think there are some industries lagging Steve and um I thank you and appreciate the call I ... here's the thing that I Would say\nAnd if you are right now is the time for the president to back off the the bruise or if you will and start being the the the salesmen Trump and selling the great things he's delivered on and that are already under way\nOr we do have great economic news the the industrial output the manufacturing output the the the unemployment but at the same time Steve there are people like you who aren't feeling the full effects of this\nAnd need to know that the aid he's doing everything he can be the president is not a wizard or a magician\nHe doesn't fix everybody every aspect of every life\nThe only things as I mentioned a pet can and the two things that that people want from a precedent our security\nAnd prosperity and prosperity is best gained\nBy having an even playing field where you're not only recently tax to regulate it out of business and where you can you can grow a business and grow a family that's what the president should be about and I think that is what he's about but that's a very limited he's powers are limited\nAnd I think the media and everybody else I mean why are we focusing on a journalist that may have been brutalized by Saudi Arabia now I understand he wrote for the post\nUp but\nWe can't control Saudi Arabia there are rogue regimes all over the damn morals Cuba China North Korea or some of our allies including Saudi Arabia when you get into the middle east it is a crap shoot and let me tell you they don't they don't you're talking about due process\nThen no due process as they're due process is we'll let you see what side do you want to be roasted all well and from my understanding\nAs well as the the journalist wasn't even a U.S citizen of course he was resigning here but yeah he's our domestic Saudi Arabia politics problems that you know would be best advised us that has not have any interest in million these ...\nYeah well it certainly there that's beyond the president's ah of capabilities and frankly beyond its purview he did what he could and what he did was he sent Mike Pompeo to question them we should be concerned and I had been concerned about four years about human rights religious rights abroad we have to\nProtect those and use the might of America to push these regimes toward greater freedom and liberty for their people but that said we're not we don't have dominion over those countries all you can do suggest push agitate and that's what the president did enough\nEnough but I the media I can prove it to you\nThat MSNBC and CNN all last night and the night before ran on this or a ... story okay the journalist that may have been mutilated dismembered in a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey okay we've got two problems here turkey and Saudi Arabia\nOkay neither of them have particularly great human rights records in fact they don't\nBut we can only call them out MSNBC and CNN lead with this for two nights they lost the ratings by double digits Fox had more viewers than both of them combined\nNo one is interested in this story and it doesn't change one American Life and it doesn't affect our policy would presidency in the least and it'll have no impact on the midterms so\nTo push that narrative and to drive it to try to hit Trump it's stupid it doesn't work we're going

work on them up you know when you see that kind of crazy explosive behavior toward people\nThat's a big turtles in middle America and really anywhere in America I think I think it's a huge journal tell me about the Trump effect he\nIs he is dumping all over the country including in Arizona tonight we're going to be covering that live at ten pm on Fox\nUm what is the Trump effect has he nationalized what was a local race a few weeks ago\nWell first of all its historic better president would stand by a nominee like Kavanaugh end its historic that our president\nWould basically go all over the country it's aggressively in a nonstop fashion to campaign for all these candidates and I do agree with you I think it's nationalize that they can the air from\nEverything is about Trump even if they try to make it about Trump he's too big of a personality he's too big of a player in our politics so yes it's about something that Republicans run from it because they don't like a portion of what he does or making a mistake\nBut voters the difference that down so it was the one guy they don't think that every Republican his truck they know how Trump is and I don't know why some of these Republicans have so much trouble just be yourself be who you are authenticity is on the rise in politics and that's a good thing\nIs the reality the Democrats don't have any stars with Trump's magnitude they really can't compete and there's no leader and there's no articulated governing vision that's the other problem with these people um\nWhat are your concerns though Matt should the Democrats wrest control of the house what will that look like\nWell they're going to start persecuting people like my wife worked for Donald Trump they're going to go after every White House staffer they can\nThey're going to try to bring people down to their age this whole idea of the opposite allergy that take it over the Democratic party will try to dabble in power in the house and it'll all be about trying to get air quotes corruption corruption and everybody that those cells were trumped they're going to try the same strategy\nHillary truck which Donald Trump is agenda is so obnoxious and toxic that we have to destroy anybody associated with it and it's going to be a very\nVery harmful and long two years for the country I feel like we're at our wits end already I don't know what's gonna happen if the Democrats dispatch which they will have to choose because it's just that there is no with the\nOther than stop trucks that is the agenda\nWhat ... what is your gut tell you Matt where does this end collection I did I what do you think happens\nI got tells me that we're going to have a fantastic Bennett I keep things to be picked up in the Senate from fifty one I actually can be higher than that I actually many of these races like Claire McCaskill in Montana West Virginia which um answer I think the Democrats\nAre totally vulnerable I think the Republicans have a great chance at picking up the seat I think in the house of the coin flip\nOn I think I think Republicans still having a chance to hold onto the house\nBut it's\n\nA tension you could be paying too much for your health insurance new two thousand Eighteen health insurance laws have lowered costs dramatically you may be significantly over paying open enrollment is now and it's the best time to maximize your savings you may be able to save as much as forty percent\nLike John ... the two year old in Florida was named to Ninety a month from now only a hundred and Seventy four months where\nWe are

make this important call now a special fall open enrollment hotline is now accepting calls colleague hundreds ... sixty six forty nine that's eight hundred to nine five sixty six forty nine sponsored by I can benefit group\nTrump has beaten expectations in the past David South Carolina you wanted to say well\nFor reasons I'm voting Republican Maxine Waters Pelosi Feinstein and Schumer I'm a registered Democrat and let me tell you I've never been more embarrassed for the hatred that comes out of their mouths\nAnd I'm not alone down here in South Carolina there are a lot of people because of those poor people and the vitriol that comes out of their mouths\nThe people because of those poor people and the vitriol that comes out of their mouths were voting for Republican down here\n[laughter]\nFascinating thank you David that's that's insightful and I'm going to be down in Texas in Houston on Monday with a camera crew for Fox and um we're going to be chronicling what people there are saying\nAbout these midterm elections I think there are there are veins running through this election that uh I think the the polling is not picking up on and certainly\nThe people reporting news have no concept of I live in New Orleans I sit and coffee houses I go to lunch spots and let me tell you that is a swath of America\n... where in New Orleans we're kinda shoulder to shoulder with everybody we don't have these lily white enclaves or old black enclaves they're all Hispanic enclaves like I found in northern Virginia when we lived here Frank like you're there are parts of places you you you know I I ... you could go and never see a black\nPerson never see Hispanic face in some of these restaurants that it it ... northern Virginia for whatever reason it carbs up that way\nIt it it's a very wealthy place and people are very divided live separate life not in New Orleans we are side by side we share a music we share food we enjoy each other's company we drink together we have fun together with Mardi Gras together um\nAnd you hear a lot when you're in places like that because the voices you're hearing on all sides are not your own not an echo chamber and let me tell you\nI think there's a lot of the disgruntled men out there with not only the mob stuff but the tone\nAnd the lack of results from Democrats Democrats should have it seems to me come up with a governing agenda\nI don't know why they didn't take Newt Gingrich's playbook and run with it they should have had their own contract with America saying look the Trump years we can't stand what he's doing but we're going to do X Y and Z they didn't do that they have no what are you going to do you're gonna run against joblessness\nYou're gonna run against high wages you're going to run against high benefits business is growing small businesses regulations coming all what are you going to do well I'll tell you with Kamala Harris is announcing a five hundred dollar tax credit\nShe's caught some fever so when Democrats are coming around who your way of thinking even though they try to dress it up you once\nYou've won and that's why I think Trump is nationalizing this election and trying to keep his agenda and his voice at the center of it Terry Alabama does that work for you and what are you focus on during these midterms\n... exactly right I think the Democrats are not like they're evil\nYou look at what they can't I Can't do a train wreck capping off right now because of health care that they\nWere both in that group and we can go back that your state for a while and it [laughter]\nOh we lost you there I think we're losing your there Terry but I got a point and I think you know to to to too many ... the Supreme Court has become the holy of holidays you just almost a high church too to some on the left\nWhere they see that as the ultimate instrument of control and social change\nAnd deprived of it they feel they've somehow lost something that's era treatable so this was a major blow even though a Brett Kavanaugh as it down the middle of the road straight down the middle jurists she's not a radical he's not he's not\nThe next battle is going to be the battle royale you want to see blood on the floor come to Washington for the next round of confirmation hearings when Ruth Bader Ginsburg gives up her seat\nAnd from a points maybe a woman a conservative woman to that seat or more a a a rich restrictive jurist one who reads the law and interprets that appropriately and doesn't make it up\nIf you get a let's say Amy Coney Barrett\nGod help us all I'm leaving I'm going back to New Orleans\nI mean it it it it will be what we saw from Kavanaugh will be a cheap warm up\nFor what awaits that nominee thanks for the call Terry or we're going to take it

mean\nJohn ... and also took this life I Want to see if this resonates with you at all you see I think well I Will share my theory with you in a moment this is John Burma reacting to the same by you just heard President Trump's thing I loved when this guy mark who's running for Congress in I'm In Montana\nOr I Love any body slam that reporter and yeah he was charged your body so I guess a reporter came up to them was abused will be four bodies flying guy taught Trump was tickled\nBy it and said Joe on the stump John Berman said there's\nNothing like making a joke out of body slamming reporter what another journalist was dismembered his fingers cut off three weeks ago and the administration has been dealing with that damage control and trying to provide cover for the Saudis frankly that very day\nAnd that night the president's impulses to joke about an unprovoked attack on a reporter sent Jacobs by the Scottish\n... he's talking about Greg ... a ... G ... GM forte who's running for ah for Congress out there in Montana um does this Walsh with you\nDoes this negate the mobs somehow out there a swarming Capitol Hill in your community in marches and rallies breaking windows antifa\nThat whole ah explosion of violence and hate we're seeing\nThe congressmen in a disagreement with a reporter who slams them down equate with these mobs were saying by the way that happened back months and months ago\nAnd is Trump's side comment I I think it's just a joke I and and to add to this\nNot unlike Lesley Stahl which we we decompose ... or ... or a demystify that interview written decompose we broke it down for you last week earlier in the show and\nLesley Stahl unwittingly I Believe no was really used by the president as as a stand in for the rest of the media\nAnd I think when when the media begins its echo and they stop having original thoughts but begin to echo one another the public utterly tunes them out in fact this is why I Believe so many Democrats gave the president a second look\nBecause they said wait a minute wait if all these people are against him and they're all saying the same thing what is this guy really doing and they looked closely\nThat may be what's happening now as we approach these midterms I see some of these polls everything tightening up that naturally happens in the mid term\nOr will there be a Trump effect let's go to cliff New Jersey what do you think clear what moved do you what is moving due to the polls what's the issue\nWhat is in reach loophole is that the Democrats are equally or behind this march\nTo drink at all you talking heads should find out who's paying for their parents range ... treat him coming north and you're going to find those Democrats and the publisher that total change\nMhm you're talking about the caravan which we're going to get into in a moment Pat Buchanan joining us uh yeah that caravan as moving up and look I'm there is certainly\nA an\nEcosystem let's put it that way there is an ecosystem of support for this character individuals who fund the housing the food the legal services for members of this carbon and not only the Caribbean but more I I don't know if you saw the story\nThe other day Lutheran refugee services as well as a Catholic migration refugees services came up with a statement demanding that we'd be more welcoming to not only these ... but anyone seeking to come to the United states of course they get\nHundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants every year that had been stymied by the Trump policies you see as his contract that the number of refugees allowed into the country their coffers of emptied\nSo they have a material financial interest in this and\nIt's hard to think that these dramatic displays of people\nCrowding the border and that's what's happening now by the way apart from the Caribbean we're seeing a surge of the border and it's not individuals' it's families because they know that their ticket in you have a kid it's a ticket into the country and they can't refuse and I can't separate you\nSo you have a catch and release policy happening where they're coming across the border we're taking their names of releasing them into mainland America\nYour thoughts on that is that a concern at all\nWill get into all of that with Pat Buchanan cliff thank you very much for the call out will also share some other uh reports with you hear how the Republicans might be able to hang on to the house it's close but it's a possibility Raymond ... sitting in for Ingram we're right back stay

making every American safer from the effect of R D served as a tall order but that's my goal so here's a tip the best thing you can do to help protect yourself from ramps and we're just a buck up your computer often\nThat the Democrats are trying to use in these midterms might not be effective given the difficult tenants out there\nWell I think my ... in my view\nThe Democrats have no agenda mainly economy isn't very good shape extremely good shape unemployment under four percent and but when the economy is good the economy is usually not the issue something else becomes issue\nA and I think that the that the Democrats are really they're pushing this ... thing\nAnd and the the murder of him and this tremendously literate tale of murder and the consulate in Turkey I think too you know they're they they have no agenda and they're seizing upon this and tried to attach it to to Trump but is it is or what exactly for him and\nHis the Democratic party's great agenda what is their contract with America what are they going to do more than they are going to do since the only house they can get I Believe is the one house of representatives what is their agenda they don't have one the big issue in this campaign has tromp\nRight no that's all they have I mean this is the he is he is the centerpiece and\nUh now you're seeing some pollsters saying by internal polls are the president's approval ratings are are surging\nAnd that the Republicans could squeak out just enough seats to hold onto the majority if that doesn't happen if the Democrats take control of the house even by slim majority what do you think happens what will the next year locally withdrawal [laughter]\nI'm sure did hell [laughter]\nBut now you've variation as far as the eye can see anything\nThat can enact anything they can't you know we revise Obamacare and send it over to Republican Senate then sent it down through President Trump at the White House so they can do anything so they're going to investigate everything they will be looking into his tax returns it got to be looking into\nAny financial connections with Saudi Arabia that got to get the Boulder report\nW looking into alleged\nYou know alleged a obstruction of justice and the Russia investigation all of these things and New York\nThe southern district of New York will be investigating and the grand jury here in DC so I think that's all that they've got going for the you know but they don't want to raise the real issue you've wondered if you ask him deeply what you believe it ought to be they would say you know the goal here is impeach Trump and lock him up\nBut you go ahead and announced that is your goal\nAnd you shrink your base your democratic base down to it's hard core which is insufficient to win the house of representatives to the degree that you rally those folks in the Democratic party on that issue\nYou don't get the broad based sort of the ballot and you live over in northern Virginia you know they've got a fighting chance on this congressional district here right if you did something like that it would kill it\n... that I Want to play something you you just mentioned the impeachment the I word impeachment uh last night ... go to bed all three games a NATO Rourke um who is Ted Cruz's challenger in Texas did a town hall meeting and he had this to say [laughter]\nAnd you said in July that you would as a member of the house right now vote to impeach have you changed your mind I haven't according to the constitution that mean that the president has committed the crime that tree than primer bribery or a high crime and misdemeanor which one of those do you think the president had committed\nI wouldn't like in an impeachment to an indictment there there is enough there to proceed with a trial for a full vetting of the facts and to make the best informed decision in the interests of this country and our future\nYour reaction to that that does that help him and helped democratic candidates across the gun it\nStill didn't hear the charge was\nHe exactly he dodge that\nDoes that help it doesn't help that are over ... and it was in a and veterans got his own problems he's nine or ten voyage down was sixty two billion in the bank outside mhm but I you know no I don't take it helps him I think\nWhat federal work it seems to me he's running short of heart left or very far left for Texas a course in parliament for the Democratic party I'm beginning to wonder if he doesn't see himself as Abe Lincoln who lost the Senate race in Eighteen fifty eight and came back to win the presidency and and uh Eighteen shifting\nYeah well aside from height to there's very little commonality there that I think yeah I I don't remember honest Abe on a skateboard but maybe I missed that chapter a you you'll find a lot about it I don't know what I'm going to put him in a corner you and put you on the record year\nDo you think the Republicans hold the house and Senate going into these midterms where do you think the populace is right now you know the the the the people out there who are elected Trump\nI think the I think over all that you would have to say that the
