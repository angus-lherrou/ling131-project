B. I.\nThe Atlantic has a piece out um here's why white women are abandoning the G O P A new evidence suggests that many of the women may now agree\nUh and they were made some joke about Tina Fey um who took white limited task after the Trump election who helped him get elected providing him with\nFifty two percent of their support face to face focused her remarks on college educated white women forty four percent home of whom voted for Trump\nSaying chastising them for wanting to go back to watching HGTV and forget about the election you can't look away she said well now a it looks like some women are taking that to heart a morning console political poll found that President Trump net support\nAmong Republican women had dropped by Nineteen points\nWell that's a huge drop if that's if that translates into people voting for the Democrat Party that could be a disaster for the geo pay\nWell I think that is the the biggest but both change in the electorate concern for the Republicans and victory points to the Democrats so far which is that the closet what I Would say the closet conservatives in the country are actually independent suburban women who voted twenty points for Romney's who voted\nProbably Thirteen fourteen points for uh for for President Trump\nA and they've been up for grabs I think the Democrats than making very good kind of momentum with them I don't think\nThis cabinet nominations never help that I always thought that a woman nominee who even a woman nominees for what might have been more conservative [noise] what would actually have been the right strategic choice here\nI I think the Republicans have held on to the working class voters Trump took but those are the voters are up for grabs and I don't see anything coming out of the Republicans to women back\nYeah well the again you would think the economy which is of course on fire women care about prosperity and security and\nAll those issues that Trump has focused on 'em but nevertheless ah twenty September twenty six\nUs see or LA Times poll counted twenty per ... or ... percent point advantage for Democrats among all women a twenty eight percent advantage\nAmong married white college educated woman women a group along tied to the G O P the Republicans now lead by only five points they had a much bigger\nA much bigger lead among that group of women before but now those are low as well um this is a ... this is a substantial block or the married college educated\nWomen and that's a substantial block but among all women I mean I I think a lot of it might be tone you know Trump's tone women like things calm and they like things to be calm down and I think that they they sense that things are chaotic and\nThey seem to be blaming the Republicans for that maybe this stuff for the last couple of weeks might change that I don't know\nBut they're also more skeptical about the economic progress if you look men are like wow this economy is through the roof\nWomen who've as you're right we point out typically are even more concerned about the economy and its effect on them and their family or less understanding of an improved economy and that's another area\nWhere the Republicans have really failed to drive their message what every day every day that the the national question is is she\nA rapist or not\nThis is a day that nobody's focusing on the economy I mean you've seen the last day or two incredible job numbers or come out and the focus is primarily you know in the cabinet issue and it's going to stay that way at least through you know middle of next week probably\nYeah and that's um I think that's why Mitch McConnell wants this vote to happen as soon as possible this is what my barnacles said this morning on MSNBC let's listen\nA lot of Republicans have come home and the state of Florida and the Gillum racing was comfortably ahead you can go to other states and show\nAgain the races are tightening in do you think that perhaps Donald Trump is the data that shows that this is driving conservative and conservative voting base up back home of course the the Joe\n... exactly to Donald Trump strength for one thing he is an expert in is resentments and specifically in this case white male resentment\nMale resentment um I think the white privilege discussion is driving even more men though to the Republican Party I think people are really getting tired of this identity politics a mark I I think that that Democrats have\nGone way too far in a\n... ... as you do a for a long time I I've been against both class warfare an identity politics\nAs a as a moderate Democrat you know I've always been against those two in favor of current or the right kind of you know social policies and balance I think what's really happening here is that\nThe Democrats were completely energize\nThey were looking for an opportunity to vote against Trump and the Republicans without a leader without a particular message we're incredibly disorganized\nAnd I do think this thing has awakened the Republican base you know in a in a way that it's backfiring on the Democrats unfortunately uh [noise] I think they still have an edge but I think they probably could have had a wipe out the way this thing was heading\nAnd and now I think you can see it kind of a balance among turn out here\nBecause the stakes of this election have been just raised you know so high now\nYeah and I I Do think that again you see what the Republicans are capable of when they stand United with the exception of the three I'm more liberal Republicans who you know are are\nDragging their feet on the on the nomination or the\nParty when it's United it's pretty formidable I mean even a bunch of older white it's a pretty formidable and that never seen Mitch McConnell so you know it's so good as he's been in the last week just as a political matter\nWell but see that's ironic thing that I did you pick you see this in the Senate races and I think you see a lot of the Senate races\nTighten up because the Republicans are coming home and there's no question that this Kevin ... is a highly partisan ice vote and if you're in a state that voted forty points for Trump you know there's no question that there's going to be a large percentage\nMore way above a majority that would want to see you confirm it in the Senate this has done a lot I think\nFor the Republicans you know in the house you know not so much you know Ryan quit\nHis job and I didn't leave there's no leadership there's no message we're we're McConnell\nThere's no leadership there's no message we're we're McConnell or as you say has stepped up maybe some people think we're leaving some people you know what I think too harshly but as you said you stepped up you've got the message leading in the house there's nothing\nYeah I have to run or less\nIt's right or left and it's a Paul Ryan should've left if he's going to retire should've left to let this thing it'd be taken over by somebody wants to fight for these issues Paul Ryan's basically not even a factor right now a Mark Penn thank you so much for joining us that's always great to talk to you on radio and on the angle will take a break\nA five five forty Laura do you believe that this uh the politics of rage that we're seeing right now I think it people said Trump was\nEmbodied the politics of rage\nUh but now it seems like the Democrats have taken on that role at least during this cabin I issue\nHow does that translate in November are you voting have you vote are some people have already voted you voting early encouraging others to vote or you got to spread the good news if you believe in going forward in this economy and you believe in his basic principle of fairness and would as mark said if you really shy away from

man or a woman\nOn unsubstantiated allegations and just because someone a man or woman makes an allegation\nDoesn't mean it is true doesn't mean that is certainly we've seen big cases that the media celebrated over from the Duke lacrosse case to UVA rape case and they were false and everybody had egg on their faces Jennifer and Indiana line too\nHigh I was calling because I I'm a white woman here in Indiana and I'm I'm just tired of being categorize I'm tired of white women I listen to your show and the polls they've been giving I think the pollsters are dead wrong and I think they're going to

parody of themselves they said they wanted the FBI investigation that was never about\nKavanaugh's character is about his judicial philosophy they don't want any originalist on there they want somebody who will preserve their judicial manufactured right to an abortion so\nThat they become a parity that they demand more time they never were going to accepting like pre announce that they would reject the innocent\nThe man more time they never were going to accepting they pre announce that they would reject him and it's despicable I'm sick about\nOur side or some people on our side accommodating them and falling for it and flaking out so I'm hoping this'll\nPut the nail to the coughing on this thing and get Kavanaugh confirmed because as you said he's one of the most qualified and and and one one of those things is worried people sign judicial temperament that we've ever seen nominated\nWell I think again this could be a very big gift for the Republicans going forward David because that they're Democrats or the party of\nResistance and intimidation rabble rousing in chaos and meanwhile Trump\nIs slowly but surely delivering on these promises he made he still you know we don't have the wall which is it Congress this fall\nBut we did read it NAFTA he's getting the NATO nations to pay more of their fair share he got that tax reform through again not everything we wanted the economy is humming he's gotten a I think now he has more than a seventh of all federal judges are Trump\nAppointees uh and obviously if Kavanaugh gets confirmed and I think he will be confirmed that means they'll have to ... amazing justices on the court which will of course they will live long past Trump's administration and have a profound effect on the judiciary going forward\nYeah and and some people say uh well the reason you guys want Trump is just because a gorgeous well\nNo it's not just because of him is because all the other judicial appointments his foreign policy is the economy it's taxes\nAnd its regulations it's better trade deals and say it's standing up to the left and\nFinally we have a warrior in there to fight with the same relentless this has left us fighting and we don't have to be dirty like they are we just have to fight with the same intensity and realize that we're in a in a serious battle to preserve our values and our freedoms so I'm I'm feeling really good about what's going on I don't know where Jeff Flake is\nAnd where mccaskey and all the others are college but I'm hoping\nWith this FBI favorable report and we're hearing it's favorable that they won't have the\nThe audacity to vote against him at this point\nUh David you have immerse yourself in religious history and the history of the Christian Church\nYour new book a Jesus has risen Paul in the early church continues um\nUh you're you're writing and you're you're you're you're really ... ... ...\n... and in many ways newly are emerging as a thinker on the religious underpinnings of our society but it's really important for people to understand how the early church was formed\nHow unlikely it was that these followers early followers of Christ or we're going to you know basically drop everything and develop their entire lives and and give their lives or to this ah this new phenomenon and Jesus Christ a tell us about why\nThis book was you know it was so important for you to write at this point in your own life\nAh well I I'm going through the New Testament when I when I became a Christian I was on fire for the Bible because I realize for the first time in my life it was the word of God I was holding in my hands and I started inhaling everything I could about learning about it wishing that I had something\nSome some books some guys in ... that would help me understand it better and be less intimidated so as I've studied this for Twenty years I wanted to give back\nAnd start writing books that would help explain the Bible and so the last book I wrote was about the gospels and move put it paraphrased and and stayed at most of the versus the gospels in chronological order and also running commentary and this book\nJesus has risen is about the book of acts the history of the early church or which follows the gospels and then six of false Thirteen of pistols their letters that he wrote to the early churches that he formed the planet and they were they were dissipating from the\nThe true gospel they were following falls teachers and he would write letters and they're very heartfelt human and personal letters\nUrging them back to the true faith and they were experiencing the same kind of of\nAdversity and opposition and secular influences corn and it was a hotbed of sexual immorality and I'd olive tree with the ... the pagan influences and Paul would say don't follow those people don't mix\nAnd sinker ties their religion with our religion Jesus Christ as the son of God to follow him and come back and we see the same kinds of things occurring in our society today they're happening in the Catholic Church and the Protestant Church there's there's\nThe conflict in adversity from within trying to dilute the gospel which has faith in Jesus Christ alone to salvation and we see people mixing that up and mixing that message to the detriment of all potential converts and so\nWe want to hew to the truth and and encourage people to understand what the Bible really says some might the goal in my book was to help people\nUnderstand what the Bible is about and encourage them ultimately to read it for themselves\nTell us about the most unlikely of Christ disciples Paul\nYes Paul was a a an observant Jew and and he was steeped in the Jewish law the mosaic law\nAnd when he was a great persecuted Christians because he didn't just believe that the Christians were new competing religion\nBut that they were perverting the religion of God and and it was Judy as well as a religion of God's ... and ... there's nothing a false about that but Paul was outraged that they were doing this Jesus can't possibly be the messiah because they expected the Jews expected a military\nOur political uh deliver from the the forces that the authorities at the time\nAnd they didn't expect someone to be humiliated and die on the cross anybody who was\nA hung on a tree was a curse according to the Old Testament law Jesus not only didn't deliver them victory he didn't even raise a hand in his own defense and he was killed on the cross\nAnd so he can't meet on the side and then so he's in St Paul's going around ... rounding Christians up and in fact he was on his way to Damascus and under authorities are saying he returned to pick up Christians and bring them back to to punish them and when Christ encountered him on the Damascus wrote blind them with light and converted him\nTo from the ... the greatest persecute or to the greatest evangelist So Paul\nThen long story short went around throughout the Roman empire Asia Minor all around and that in that periphery of the Roman empire and established churches and they were as if they were his new\nBorn babies he wanted to nurture them and write them letters and make sure they stay true to the faith as I mentioned a minute ago but he was the least likely person to become the greatest evangelist because he was the greatest persecuted but God\nPicked him in the Bible says before he created the universe\nAnd I think he did it because he had those qualities he veers intellectual and relentless\nAnd determined and ultimately a follower of got\nThe part I think this is Mike around two fifty seven in your book um\nWhere you talk about how the apostle Paul corrected\nObviously in the letters Corinthian church um and it the way he did it was not with condemned the Tory language or [noise] you know railing at the end pointing us things that you're going to turn ...\nWhich or no railing at the end pointing a thing as they are going to turn all damnation but it was with with love and respect and you talk about how that is a great lesson and I think I Need to take that less than\nSomething that we all do um because it's easy to get you know upset or demoralized or even angry at people when they don't see what you see but that's not really the way to change minds\nNo and he can't argue people into the kingdom when we got to be a little different than we are in politics that that you know you you don't want to be too strident and\nHe what he said he he will be all things to all people not meaning he would be a hypocrite and compromises values he would never dilute the gospel message but he would not sweat the small stuff so when he was around Jews you would\nAdopt their practices ... as long as they didn't violate his basic core principles is around Greg see what do what they did he was talking with invoke Greek poetry to get into their minds and at the relate to them and then he was present\nThe troop God of the universe and the gospel of salvation through Jesus Christ\nAnd it's kind of reminds me of one of my favorite apologist today Ravi Zacharias he says when we approach\nPeople in a van july's and tell them about the fate we want to understand the question or as much as the question they asked meet them where they are understand where they are because you're not going to the right somebody in the kingdom you have to tell them about the good news and do it in a win some way and and that will hopefully lead to the best response\nAnd again\nTrying to advance allies and in the world today

I think they're just a ... they don't know what to do at this point they thought one of these things is going to pan out I mean they the stall ...\nI think it's good news for Republicans I really do I think now Republicans\nAre more United than they've been since the day after the election maybe even more United and they'd been since nine eleven that's what I said last night and that's what I really believe or let's go to a JC Florida on line one Jaycee\nLaura I'm I just wanted to say like most on the right I'm really happy and grateful Lindsey Graham said what he said and continues to call up a left but\nWe've grown accustomed to our representatives not really doing their jobs and pushing back not fighting left on a consistent basis so when one of them simply does their job and says what needs to be said all of a sudden we're treating them like a hero you know this shouldn't be the norm and not the exception\nSo this is Lindsey and the others were sent to Washington to two and world wedding ourselves with excitement because someone did what they were hired to do and that's a shame that sound older than ...\nThat's a great point you know I think you know when I when I think of that when people tweet around things like work a man helps an old lady across the street [laughter] you know or look ... look a uh uh uh someone helps than autistic kid in the in the\nSeven eleven video of helping him stock things which it's nice but that's what we should do right that's humanity that humanity that that that is what we all should be doing\nSo I guess it's better to celebrate that than just keep saying negative things people so that it is nice but it's kind of an all I'm saying is it's kind of sad that we have to we have to note that when someone is doing the right thing instead of as our caller said that's just what you should be no trouble\nSadly like there's so many representatives and senators they don't reflect the will of the people so when they do it you have your job on ... and Lindsey Graham the other day he walked through a Fox out of the green room\nPeople who are applauding us he's walking down the hall and hands shaking him like he just came back from war but he made a speech and the committee defending the nominee that's what he did\nBy the way the Durban letter just quickly it says no where there's a Dick Durban to ... a Senator Grassley\nNowhere in any of these six Kevin ... FBI reports which the committee has reviewed on a bipartisan basis was there ever a whiff of any issue at all related in any way to inappropriate sexual behavior or alcohol abuse he wants some of that\nReleased he thinks that the tweets that Grassley has been sending out miss characterize what's in these FBI find\nIt so it's it's casting a poll that there might be more information about sex

how many more interviews you can come up with people day after day after day that have something negative to to\nAllegedly offer ... and only to delay or looking at a a vote\nI think this is a ... it's going to be voted on I Believe by the end of the week\nThe um the complaint is that they did not looking to judge Kavanaugh's drinking when he was in college and law school or high school that that wasn't adequately investigate\nIt and the supplemental what was your response to that bear\nOut and they know that if they haven't read it how do they know what's in the supplemental\nYou know they they don't know what questions are asked who was interviewed they might very well have interviewed a couple of guys that are the judge has some beers with or who should yeah I had beers with them and nothing ever happened to you know they don't know that they just surprising that or they just want to keep the pot stir it up\nIn order to the you know continue that the alleged doubt\nA contrived out I look at it as by those that are opposed to the\n... we have an update here the bill bill a question for you Ronan Farrow in the New Yorkers are reporting that\nOr the FBI prove ignored testimony from former classmates have Kavanaugh these are people that went to Yale with him and are they the the ... they're trying to\nRonan Farrow claims that these are primary eyewitnesses are witnesses to the Deborah Ramirez allegations the problem is as you read into the story you realize these are all here say witnesses who claim somebody told them that somebody told them that this happened\nSo would the FBI pro those people are they just seen as not credible witness is\nProbably not credible witnesses and and bottom line first of all is coming from Ronan a secondly I'm a these if they're if they're not I witnesses after that\nThey not permitted on the stand and a quarter law never mind are doing this and if you have to make that cut off someplace into what is ... you know calm and what does make sense to do\nAnd none of these people make sense and if anybody can come up with some sort of a story I heard from a friend of a friend that doesn't carry any weight with anybody mhm\nWell again people think that the FBI is conducting some global investigation into any allegation no matter how remote\nAnd interviewing people on a hearsay basis where people have just hearsay recollections of things that happened Thirty years ago it make sense\nMakes no sense floor and that's not happening\nI think the problem that exists here are the bureau's gonna get sucked on the one way or the other if it comes out the way\nIt appears it's going to come out in the ... the the democratic side of the houses are going to say they're all from Trump bands from the bureau if it if for instance something comes out that that does give everybody a pause and ... and it's credible uh then you know the beer is going to take a black guy from the other side of that was\nI just think it's a it's a very tough way to go but it's an investigation that um was demanded\nAnd done and let's get the vote\nI think again in the end people want to have\nPeople have faith in our in our institutions of government especially like the FBI and\nYou you don't want to believe that the FBI is acting in a political manner ever and I think that the media do an enormous disservice went on an issue like this with no you know with with no corroborating contemporary contemporaneous witnesses\nTo expect field agents or the FBI to be doing these types of you know broad ranging ... is this kind of broad ranging slew thing into the background\nOf some and this is not what is what the FBI does and people don't either get that or the media has been so remiss\nIn not reporting properly what they're all the FBI is\nBut you see the ignorance it's the willful ignorance of the media and then the the poor people who don't know any better or who don't have time to delve into these issues like wait why are they keeping the secret outrageous this shouldn't be secret this is our Supreme Court you know that's going to happen\nOf course it's going to happen we write is a combination of everything that you said or bottom line is the some of these people\nTruly don't believe um that there's anything going on that's wrong here it's because of who they support they have to say while I Believe that does\nThat a judge Kavanaugh is guilty that you can't look at the facts and come out with that conclusion but they do\nHere on the lower Ingram show bell thanks so much\nBut they do ... haven't here
