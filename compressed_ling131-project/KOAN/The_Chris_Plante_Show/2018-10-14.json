air\nLeaving the furnace going into the Duckworth the pipes how do we know that gets the everywhere in that house maybe you've got some upstairs bedrooms that are really cold\nMaybe the duck works all leaky we got to talk about how to rectify that problem money and take a call or two\nIn the meantime let's get back to the phones cliff welcome car yes\nYes there were down in Georgia and we just bought a a modular home which is on the ... mobile home built in Nineteen eighty and we had some problem wherever I replace them\nAnd you know that'll a particle borders the floor and tried to fry it up\nIs just a piece of the size of your hand it just breaks or is there a better way to take that up the\nMs so you're just talking about removing the particle board removing the roaring correct how have you removed it at this point\nA frog bar and hammer and every time we go to proud of the face of break off the size of your hand and you have to move to the small face\nYou know I don't know of an easier way I mean you're just that's you know that sounds like that particle board is to a point where it's no longer solid and you got to get it off the uh the bracing if you will and you know the board has been compromised I don't know an easier way to get it off\nOh yeah the floors are real soft origin we're moving along going back with a full backing\nYeah and that's just it's terrible\nYeah I was all that is a ... yeah\nI don't know of an easier way to do it the most you um you know in between the support beams if you took a sledgehammer ... broken down that way and then concentrated on lifting with a sledgehammer the pieces that are left on the support\nWell underneath the flow to us or that they have that insulation that sealed off from the bottom of your budget with a sledgehammer UK inflation\nYeah well I I don't know of an easier way to get it off it's just I mean it's a it's a problem it it's a problem because that that board has been compromised so I mean no matter what you do it's going to end up on the insulation correct\nWell no I mean some of the small small stuff but the new tech shot back shot by that out\nAbout getting a jerk but I can you get a circular so I mean I I Can't see exactly you know what it looks like can you get like a circular saw and set adept gauge inning caught it and\n... and between a four door so yeah ... ... try and lifted that way\nA way try some of that but the uh you wind up some of the flow of joy to have a a like a a sham peace like I'm On the face of the particle board\nGlued in stripe up to the top of it mhm and you get into that then you ruin the uh you know have the level of a flaw\nWhen they uh you know how the level of the floor [noise]\nMhm so in effect really what you're kind of asking me is how do I get it up as a solid piece and my answer cliff is it sounds like you're not because it's already brought it to a point where it's just not going to come off\nUm is going to come off in pieces which is the way you're lifting it off and I don't know any easier way to make that happen because that's the composition\nOf that sub floor so I you know if you can't cut sections of it and you don't want to crush it down because of the insulation I think you're kind of back to where you were\nAll right appreciate the call twenty four minutes after the top of the Arabs get to Tim Tim welcome\nYes thank you for taking my call what I wanted to ask about something you talked\n... mentioned on a day without eating your houses\nAnd their common a year most people\nTrying to take that that she'll out of your house and over the years people do all kinds of small local Wal Mart hater it some people than lows and Home Depot shelled the kerosene heaters\nMhm and I don't or different styles ... um how long do those normally last year there and uh\nUh I don't know do you do maintenance just off on them but with other college at all for that use them and and mention oh what do you think\nWell actually in some communities they're not allowed to be used um some communities are allowed to be used so um you know first you got to check if it's OK to use them the secret is and the quality of the kerosene that's being burned a you've got to use grey\nDay one otherwise the residue will accumulate on that wick and it will smoke I'm also Tim I can tell you from a precaution standpoint I Would definitely have a a\nA carbon monoxide detector inside the home\nUm because again you're not venting that out and there will be an odor and there will be some a carbon monoxide whether it's unacceptable level or not depends on how ventilated your home is\nYou start doing that in a whole house encapsulated home you're going to have problems I Would not use it I'm OK though the wick needs to be changed periodically um\nI Can't remember how ... how long you know how many how many hours of burn that has to be changed but the wick does have to be change fairly regularly\nThe great age out do they get to a point where a daycare senior and it just gets old and he's just\nWell everything everything ages out um when you say how long something like that last I I don't know I'd say ten years later I mean you know it's how much maintenance is done the maintenance is all about\nThe wick and they can be a little bit challenging putting those into um if you want my own opinion I wouldn't use one of my home\nAnd some people that him and they're going to let our Gary it's the best seat in the world but you know I personally wouldn't use one of my own\n... which you are far\nWell to try that I just\nThink that the chill off ... ...\n... ... 'cause it's not really thirty five you know thirty two degrees outside but just pick the chill off mhm while you're just sit and watch a football game or something like\nYeah yeah um well there's there's actually a couple of things some of those with the um the I forget the name of those things that the the ah infrared light heaters\nOkay what those do is just don't take the chill out of the year but they warm the person they're very cool now they're probably three hundred bucks\nBombs got a ten thousand years or ten thousand hours worth of life but I Would take a look at\nThat or even those cubes ceramic heaters there's so much safer more economical less work [noise]\nAlright and hope that helps them coming up next we'll have arrows steel and we'll talk about saving money and\nKeep it in the heat and air in your room where you want it\nThat's next year at home with Gary Solis [noise]\nHave a list of things to do around the house Gary will find something for you one eight hundred to three calls and your head home theories element\n\nHave\nYou tried blaster new P.

walk around and find evidence that oh gosh I could have what kind of evidence they find\nWell uh one of the easiest of course you mentioned it right when we began this the segment here in it and a lot of people think it's normal\nFor her that that far room to be colder than the rest of the\nHow it is normal it's Ninety five percent I Believe we keep [laughter] formal Zach\nRight right but um but if you're ... system is designed properly and working the way it's supposed to and you've got a good working piece of equipment for and that's not supposed to happen ... you'd have nice even temperatures throughout your how there's urine telltale sign and dust and\nA ... you know the big one that's where I knew it\nYeah on the grill or the registers maintenance I before I before I Lived in this industry I thought that was just a normal thing but that signs of what we call infiltration meaning that can actually be pulling air more like a vacuum exactly elected right into the halls of the joints right right and I don't want to read that in mind that game I don't know about you yeah so\nThen they say but I got a filter on my furnace it's all after the filter that's right that's right so it's kind of sucking in distributing that insulation all over your house\nThat's right okay and then I think the other big telltale sign that you you also mentioned is that a lot of homeowners will by higher efficiency\nFurnaces are a fees and expect to be a big energy savings and but then they really don't I really don't get that benefit they don't see it and then you know what's happening ran I not getting the the ... and it's probably because there's some kind of efficiency drain like Lincoln\nYeah and I I'll tell you in ... maybe you agree with me maybe you will but if you just give you a basement in your home\nAnd you just kind of look at the duck worked in the basement in between the Joyce\nAnd you see gaps I mean you kind of see what kind of duck work system you have because you remember him for the most part the duck work we can see is in the advocates in the walls in some places we can't get too but the basement you can see it and when I started looking into it myself before a cold\nOr checked into the air seal um I started looking at this duck work is a mess\nAnd I'm getting up there with silicon I'm getting there with aluminum tape and I started taping all these up and a and one that I had this aha\nMoment and said\nThis is just a basement wonder what's going on inside of why I Can't see what's inside the wall\nExactly I lately agree with you and you're you're right a with a click examination of the part that you can see right it can be representative of oh my gosh what's behind the walls and the adequate the right you're right\nSo I had a company come out and they did the test with the air I think they stopped a closed the registers put little\nWhatever they put over shut 'em off shut them down and they tested the pressure so I had a four time air conditioner in front of sport and they were able to measure how much air I was getting through that duct work\nWhat most people get you know I mean I I knew what my status was but is it twenty five percent fifty percent on average\nYeah on average in it it's probably going to be in that twenty five to forty percent rain\nMine was twenty five so it was a fork than you think about these folks there's four tons and I was losing one time heir\nAmazing yeah you're not getting which paid for yeah I mean that's amazing yeah only five percent a lot yeah so it was like I really have a two and three ton you so was too small for the house I mean you could look at it that way\nYet when they were finished\nIt was one six teams of a tone I was missing because one area I Can't remember what the issue was one ... of a ton\nAnd they were in both from the testing in the application it was a three quarters of the day after day I Can't remember what the full day at ... and that's how\nIt and so tell me what they use an error I I I ... it's almost like an aerosol and it\nYeah so uh you know the fancy chemical naming the vinyl appetites telling her but that nobody knows what the heck that as writes in a non toxic components at the same company you're gonna find and things like chewing gum a baby pacifier that it's completely safe and it's a liquid to begin with our system he turns it into an\nAerosol and then\nJust like the guys that at your house no block off all the register so that that that system is as close on it and it can be ... the aerosol through the duck to them and I described before it'll find a little hole or where the air and leaking out feeling not from the outside and move on down the trunk line them up until they're all sealed\n... now so we knew what some of the benefits are going to be we'll talk about him but I'm sure everybody listening is like a cost and I know that's probably over all over the board but gee you know what the return on investment as you recoup that in two years three years five years or\n[noise] yeah and and again that that does very for sure uh across the country but um most homeowners are done at the return within about three years\nThree years yeah were you you return to comfort immediately ... that is true of America to the other way to look at it is\nIn some respect your already spending that money ... right to

vanity vanity you you put your amount of water in the bowl you got you got to plug in it but the amount of water near put the foreign ... is a dream about and just let it sit there for like ten minutes\nThen open up the drain and all that remember there's a culture bacteria in there that's actually going to eat through the blockage read through the scum of the pipes and so once that facility is has set for a while and created enzymes that's when you're sending it down the drain\nOkay here or one court not at all\nNot at all so you would ... if you're going to do it in a container do kind of pretty much the same thing you mix it up into container and you just flip that container sit for ten minutes\nNow if you're going to ask because let's sit overnight before pouring down I'm going to say I don't know but uh if you if you make that you take that concentrate and take the water and mix it in let it stand for ten minutes and then pour down the drain you're good to go\nOkay okay okay

goes being overweight increases your risk of developing breast cancer is that a mess or a fact\nThat is indeed a fact a ... a weight is one off our breast cancer risk factors and so\nThe more we can do to keep a weight down the better it is so actual management off that is eating healthy with regular and regular exercise when we were eating healthy it's actually a cutting down on fat intake I Would definitely be a risk factor reduction and regular exercise\nUm the other things that will help but is I'm watching the alcohol intake um because excess alcohol intake is a risk factor for breast cancer also\nSo we we have the obesity family history obviously age related older you're more likely to get breast cancer alcohol sedentary lifestyle their mission to me\nSounds like what a lot of our expert guess tell us [laughter] or or get her a lot of it yes I was like all\nRight let's talk about the different types of breast cancer 'cause I Know there are several different ones for the outlet for\nSure the breast cancer marker is kind of help us identify what kind of cancers these are so um we have what is based on the location of the abnormality we can call it breast cancer can be ... or ... cancers [noise]\nAh but in general what we're finding is that the biology matters and that tumors that are estrogen receptor positive\nEstrogen a project strong receptor positive or hurt too positive or negative for each of these markets\nKind of identifies what type of tumor this is so an estrogen positive project on positive hurt too negative breast cancer differ from her too positive breast cancer and as different also from what is called the triple negative breast cancer\nAnd the treatment for those is different and how you really look forward to board and\nThat's exactly right because now biology is what drives cancer treatment so it's very individualized to the type of cancer the person has so if a woman has an estrogen positive cancer there are medications that go after the estrogen receptor\nThe patient has a hurt too positive breast cancer we have targeted therapy for the hurt too positive to see\nWhat ... what are ways that has come I mean I'm not a breast cancer survivor but I Will meet women who are thirty or forty or cancer survivors and back then there was like one treatment and that was it is that race\nThat is exactly right I mean initially it was women with breast cancer had the option of mastectomy removal of our lymph nodes\nAnd when chemo came into being everybody got to have chemotherapy but now thanks to again the breast cancer researchers um who have really advanced to understand number one is that what is the biology of these cancers and then based on the biology try to find targeted treatments that work well\nAnd so even conditions such as triple negative breast cancer at one point these with diseases which were hard to treat\nAnd now we're coming up with new or therapies um managed by our our special oncologist who come and\nCreate a treatment that is very specific for the patient you know what I forgot\nWhat are the risk factors what he's a little bit ... radio show which includes you because you had lymphoma when you were a kid\nVery much so yeah that's why I bypass all those are the things that goes straight to the um All right\nThat's right I mean these kind of exposure to radiation therapy to the breast region does increase when future risk of breast cancer usually we say about eight years out from the radiation the woman should be you're having a screening mammography and MRIs\nAlright genetic testing and abusing subject what tests are available and who are there be genetically\nTested so when we talk about women with a family history of breast cancer\nAnd you're always trying to understand anybody who has a family history with trying to understand based on the family history is there evidence to suggest that this family maybe a family of carrying a gene genetic abnormality that puts them at increased risk\nWhat we used to know really it was ... one NBRC two two genes associated with very high risk of breast and ovarian cancer\nAs information has evolved as gene testing has become more available and knowledge has increased we have found that there are other genes also that maybe associated with breast cancer\nSo what does a woman do typically what we say is that if you have a family history discuss with your physician lets a clinician let them know that this is what a family history is and it's not only breast cancer if you have a family history of breast ovarian colon cancer males with prostate cancer melanoma\nI'm an even pancreatic cancer these me all be linked in really any cancer ... seek help from your commission so that then we can say does this patient qualify to be sent for gene testing now usually what we prefer is that when there is a family history like that\nWhich they meet with a genetics counselor seek the expert opinion and then they can guide us through what is your likelihood of carrying a gene mutation that\nGuides what kind of testing to be done\nAnd depending on how you test and you can give a woman advice about what you ought to do with a frequently she ought to be tested at cetera\nThat's exactly right there are very clear guidelines that a woman who carries a beer or see one or two gene mutation would benefit from MRI in addition to mammography and the timing of initiating the treatment generally we start MRI at age twenty five foot bracket carriers\nAnd then at age thirty we add them wrong graffiti for these ... carriers then at some point when they're finished their child bearing earlier that is some around thirty five to forty years usually close to forty we start talking about risk producing surgery so again a very important for these patients to be in touch with experts\nAre rated as breast cancer awareness month what's the most important thing you want women do though [noise]\nBe aware be familiar with your breast seek medical attention if you notice any changes [noise]\nAsk your doctor about going in for a mammogram via an advocate\nFor yourself like Theresa [laughter]\nBecause they go through the breast cancer expert at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota record or if they can be very thank you it's time to strike it was still to come a Mayo Clinic radio we'll discuss treatment for low back pain and later odor to ...\nNo we we uh we depend on extrapolating from a joint problems are joint injuries such as sprained ankles where we theoretically believe that we not theoretically I'll say we believe that\nThat uh if we put ice on it to reduce inflammation from an injury well that's not necessarily going to help the low back because the the cold from the ice doesn't get deep enough to affect the physiology\nDown around this fine and the same way with the heat the heat doesn't get down there far enough\nAnd so it's probably affecting the nerves in the muscles that that can penetrate more than anything else in affecting the pain that way certainly ice or heat can reduce or some pain and it can help with muscle spasm of you're having spasm\nBut I Can't tell you that there's a write in a wrong application of ice and heat in that situation if it's a cute I Would go with the ice first I'd anyway at first\nAnd when you say ... what do you mean by rescue domain laid out her bet\nNo rest is relative rest and we know that if you lay in bed for three days it's going to be more damaging than helpful or when we lay down we lose muscle mass will leave lose bone density and it doesn't take very long and not being active before those things can become measurable\nShow rest is reducing your activities to the point that you're not making yourself miserable as the way I explained it to my patients it's not likely you're going to do additional damage unless you have like pain numb to some tingling down your leg where you probably have a pinched nerve if it's back pain I Would\nDo whatever I can reasonably do without making myself miserable and I would expect things get better over a course of a week or maybe two weeks sometimes treatment might be my favorite massage but what else there is evidence for many types of treatment for back pain\nNone of the evidence is strong ...\nWhether it be a the anti inflammatory medicines or spinal manipulation such as a chiropractor physical therapist might provide her massage or acupuncture or tai chi or yoga there's some evidence for most of these things but the evidence is not strong for any of it\nAnd that's why we have so many different treatments that people get to choose from\nOf one of my my friend's got a hold them in a wrote an article a few years ago and they described it like going through the back pain supermarket you can just pick things off the shelves that you wanted to try and\nThat's because none of them work wonderfully show as far as what is best in your case I Would say what's worked in the past ... what do you tolerate what are you willing to do but not only can you do those past things you have to do smack things you have to keep moving with relative risk\nStore right now how about prevention of you are hearing about that and then we don't have to worry about all those options\nNow that would be wonderful if we can prevent all this from a half from occurring to begin with a again we don't have good studies that tell us that we can prevent back pain we know that we can prevent episodes of back pain at times and the only thing it has strong events are is exercise\nNone of the rest of the treatments are we to\nCan really prevent pain\nAnd ah there are certain factors do risk factors are that we can alter if you smoke stop smoking because smoking nicotine effects the blood supply to the desk that outside of the desk\nAnd uh the small poor is to go in and out of the disc from the the bone and it can increase just a generation if you're overweight if you lose weight it's probably going to help\nOr if you don't exercise that's a risk factor being sedentary is a risk factor in were more sedentary now in our society than we've probably ever been in the past\nAnd that's probably one of the run of the reasons that there's so many people who suffer from back pain yeah obesity problem yeah how many evidence are thirty pounds overweight\nYou know carry a thirty pound backpack around and see what the difference makes the movie the courage to a slow we don't think of it over time but if it occurs quickly then you become very aware that\nThis is a stress in my
