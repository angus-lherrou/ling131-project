we're going to bring your attention to critical races across the country one of them is Pennsylvania seventh congressional district where Marty no Stein is running to replace the retiring never Trump or a Charlie Dent\nA thank God he's being replaced and Marty is in a tight race against Democrat lefty Susan Wild and this has been redistricted but\nI'm telling you something Marty as the person you all have to get out and vote for in Pennsylvania seven he joins us now and also is an avid cyclist was in the two thousand\nUh Olympics as attract cyclists there's a lot of ah incredible stuff for his community and it's going to support the president's agenda on the economy immigration trade all the rest of Marty it's great to have you on tell us what you're finding out there what issues to the people care about most as you're approaching the all important midterm fight\nLower first of all thanks for having me yeah you know covering every corner this district which is now a new district pencil in the seventh district uh it's has everything from the urban core of Allentown ... from the east and to the\nCause of farming communities in the northern tier work district called asleep built a region now ... what we're seeing and what I'm hearing is that people are happy people are happy with the economy they're happy with what our president's been able to\nI'm hearing is that people are happy people are happy with this economy they were happy with what our president's been able to accomplish\nWe're seeing there's a lot of jobs out there people are making more money and we have a you know as a rather nice buzzing economy right here in this district and people want to see that continue\nThey don't want to see this come to to a screeching halt so I think right now a lot of voters are getting very very much engaged and they realize what is at stake if they flip the house on a ... in in Congress\nWhat what uh when when you see the redistricting that but obviously a it is is being done in many cases to add\nA urban voters to what is traditionally a blue collar or a more conservative district it makes the Republicans jobs in in in a way more difficult to are trying to run for Congress for the first time or run for reelection\nBut on the issue of for instance immigration where we see a thousands of people now are being funded clearly to rush up to the border or even in rural districts where you know they do need some agricultural workers and so forth people don't like this chaos and lawlessness are you finding that as well given the news on this new crush at the border\nYeah I think that's really on a lot of people's minds is just that the radical\nA resistance we're seeing from the left a rash of people to the border again we we we we read this chapter book for we've seen it happen um most people I'm Talking to I Would say the majority of the people I'm Talking to understand that securing our borders a first step towards a workable immigration platform\nUh we need to secure our southern border and there's no question about that and everyone I've been talking to was supportive that\nI'm so immigration up here in ... valley in ... seven district although we're not a border state uh it is something that's it's a on people's minds\nA and Marty Susan Wild\nIs they they ... they hope that she's part of the what they are going to call the year the woman or because of the me too movement the woman's march and so forth are so ... what would\nThey tried to pass or off as a moderate a Democrat in in your district\nWell that's what they're trying to do but that's not who he is a she ran in her primary or somebody on the ... are left now she's trying to move\nTo the center but a result speak for themselves or\nYou know she she's she's for radicalism she's from a welfare she's for no borders and sanctuary cities she's for bankruptcy and bureaucracy\nNo for an pitching the president teaching Kavanaugh but she won't say that in any commercial she won't say that any public forums but at the end of the day that's what she ran on in the primary and I'm sure that's what she's going to govern as if she's elected which we cannot let happen\nMarty when I see the uh the amazing economic growth that has been made possible by this president's focused uniquely on the American worker the American people\nIt's hard to imagine that people would want to halt that or go backward\nI I've been watching some of your campaign commercials in advance on line\nAnd the people in your district they're smart people they want to go forward they don't want to go back they don't they want they want happiness and calm they don't want chaos in the streets and\nPeople were in black masks and smashing car windows and in a in raising the flags of other countries in America they want America to be a safe prosperous nation where security\nIs paramount in our our virtuous freedom a is always you know upheld and raised high and I\nThink it's jobs not mobs we want jobs we don't want mobs I think it's as simple as that\nI think it's as simple as that and you're right a lot of voters in my district agree with you a hundred percent now the other side it's got a small little motivated base of folks we've seen that\nResults we've seen in the primaries they're very vocal uh you're right they show up in March uh we uh we announced a campaign uh our our\nBrand opening of arcane campaign headquarters the night before they threw rocks to our windows uh you know so this is the type of stuff we're seeing even locally here in the seventh district which in my opinion I was\nBorn and raised here my family's been here five generations I've always called at home I never saw it like this before in my life I'm a relatively young man I'm forty seven years old but what you're seeing right now the resistance from the other side is is is it's it's really quite alarming\nAnd funded funded Marty by socialist billionaires who don't like the fact that America standing strong for national national economic growth and so forth Marty no stain or might Marty Nothstein I Can't wait to see you in Congress\n\nThe following is not an actor but a real life story from trinity dead management\nMy story begins with that and a lot of debt credit card debt and I heard a commercial for trinity I gave them a call if you're in\nDepth and you need him called trinity one eight hundred seven nine for ... for three something when\nI first called I was a little embarrassed and kind of a shame and I look at the numbers and I saw how quickly that astronomical that that was in my life\nWould go way community will consolidate doing accounts into one easy to manage monthly payment reduce your interest and possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands would I Would tell other people please pick up the\nPhone and call trinity just let them put together a program and see how affordable and easy and has to pay off your debt\nIf she loses I saw something on TV say I guess it was Charlie hurt yesterday on the Fox special report panel it'll be the last time we ever have a Republican Congress person in this Fairfax County district which is right\nNear DC so this is now been transformed because of the immigration illegal and otherwise and liberal policies follow always liberal policies always follow wear a mask crush of illegal immigration has moved into a community that's why the\nAh African Americans and Latinos in poll after poll will tell us that immigration is adversely affected their communities\nBecause it has I'll give you that a stat just a moment a doctor my Christian\nIs with us or he is the director of the global faith Institute former Muslim Sunni\nWho converted from Islam to Christianity\nAnd he's been following the media and their use the manipulation of this story from turkey wearing a Saturday council that Saudi journalist or who wrote for the Washington Post\nOr is or was murdered and apparently it's all Donald Trump falls Dr Christian good to have you with us or what how do we need to look at this story mid term voters I don't think they're focused on this this is not something that they're you know it affects their daily lives but the media are using this story to do what\nCigarettes for having me every day for the ship the local community and and you're right when you have a party that is run by by then and uh uh you know those old ah guards it's it looks like they are profiting from inside\nWhen I I think actually this um you know story about a ... a reporter and everything else is going to have an impact on\nThe election if we're not going to get the truth out and and the reason of that has this when you know many people actually don't understand you know that so she shouldn't between the United states and Saudi Arabia and try to a point out that the Trump is a you know he's a cozy to um you know the Saudis and that'd be killed and\nAnd also to dictators and so forth which is far from too if you listen to Trump in his last quarter on his before this incident broke out\nEmbarrassed at the Saudi Government publicly at least four times and that was a huge big a media thing going on in the whole Middle East\nSo uh when we look at this incident I think people need to understand that Trump is not\nI'm backing up the Saudis because he loves loves the dictates of his old for personal gain because this is nonsense [noise] he's doing this because of the Saudi Government the government does the government is doing the good work that helps them not states and he's in America first\nUn American interest a president which is different from bite and then Obama and all of those previous president without states\nAnd why I'm saying that because you when you look at what the current um gum prince and the south the government is doing their head thinking many fronts the number one is the head thing by defending the Islamic movement by\nLooking in house arrest more than five hundred moms in Saudi Arabia and all\nThey are fighting the Muslim Brotherhood in the country and even in other countries they are helping the states um when they are fighting Iran and its aggression in the middle east there hunting big time they get on a the Iranian sanctions are and how an on Trump is putting goes on\nBy living oil prices and and the un all the stuff also the current administration will kind of leadership in um a Saudi Arabia is hurting usher in a peace treaty that never ever be imagined before and Donald Trump is about to announce that are very very soon\nWhat is going to be involved in Saudi Arabia and and but it's an Egypt and Israel which is going to be eliminating the danger of this conflict has been going on for seven years\nSo Donald Trump is supporting\nUm you know the gun on\nA leadership in Saudi Arabia because of those reasons and those reasons unknown and all of those\nHead for the United states not that dictatorship on ... plus adding to all of this we believe in this country that everybody is innocent until until proven otherwise so when we are dealing with this issue as when we have to\nFollow the due process to go to the investigation and find out what's going on and you know I I tend to believe that I Am American inside out since I'm a great in the states but stimulate which is all part of that and my ... in my home rule which\nYou know nothing happens by coincidence when uh the president of turkey is very much over the place about this you have to understand that this happened at the same time\nAfter the Trump Administration embarrassed in public and the whole Muslim world by arresting a the the the faster and the release of the pasture happened right here at the same time all of this incident going taking place\nExcellent point\nWell I think again mark America in ... and the American voters if they're given the proper information and not the talking points to the left the which again it's it's the\nIt's so sad and it's so predictable they always go to racism they always go to a phobia they this is all they have it's it's women\nAre oppressed in the United states or every minority group is a pressing the United states the president loves autocrats the president ...\nI mean it's so predictable that it's almost boring to talk about the meanwhile the Democrats are giving the big thumbs up to thousands of people who are about to cross into America unless we do something about the styles and thousands of people\nMany of them this is an adult men for young military age men who are have joined this caravan in or being supported by someone or some organization\nTo storm into this country to try to change this country electorally\nThat is the goal here the goal is to replace the American voters who elected Donald Trump with a new class of voters who have no background or understanding of the American story that's what's happening and it's outrageous and Americans have just can't stand against it total lawlessness\nA dire emergency and what are your what are your thoughts on the immigration issue I think the Democrats have made a big mistake thinking this is going to help them in the midterms\nWhen the Democrats and the left and the media that supports the left is a crazy and they have gotten ideas which is why the oil is go to this year's men and all the kinds of ideas that they talk about that means absolutely nothing\nBut when I pay attention to the media and what's going on number one is in the last two days they start talking about how the Hispanic votes are not going for the Democrats but goes for Donald Trump and an historic on way and then right after that they start talking about the curve and marching\nTo the board that of the United states and what they are trying to do is to try to do wired and to try to uh make the Hispanic votes jump into the vote a boost and try to vote for them so this is a very well organized\nA by the media and I have no idea how they do it but I have no doubt that\nUh by the media and I have no idea how they do it\nBut I have no doubt that everything is a guide you pay attention to the ... you talk about it for three days how the Hispanic is holding Fort Drum in a historical way and then all of a sudden\nWe have an ... you know a problem on the on the all that and then we have to figure this out\nAnd do not drunks days we're not going to let that happen and I think Hispanic votes water and Americans can see it through this because I trust it that when you come to this nation and you believe in it and we understand that ... that you have you're not going to see the by the uh the Biddy filthy\nWorks of the last and what they are trying to do every day or two American the American fabric\nA mark Christian um you're such a treasure we really appreciate your voice speaking up for truth and freedom and religious liberty and a common sense pragmatic foreign policy\nOr where we have to make alliances with people in or been in countries that now you know we don't agree with on a lot but for the better betterment of the American people sometimes we have to do that\nAnd don't keep your eye on the ball people because what marks that is exactly right this is calculated and and it's actually so transparent it's pathetic\nA doctor my Christian here on the lower income show will take a break get your calls do you agree that this is a calculated strategy\nGet Donald Trump out there on this immigration issue and think that because he talks about it Hispanic voters will start

at the same time\nCourt one hell of a wall dollar\nOf another interesting idea well our our callers have more interesting ideas and most Republican or Democrat congressman or Democrats just want an open border open borders open markets don't go watch\n\n\n\nThe ... but a real life story from trinity debt management and\nI had a lot of credit card debt and I couldn't pay my bills I was feeling so bad I got to a point where I needed some help so I reached out and contacted trinity\n... and you need help cold trinity one eight hundred seven mine for over four three something to talk to a certified ...\nThey were able to take all of my different payments and put them altogether\nTrinity will consolidate your accounts to do one easy to manage monthly payment put a stop to late season over limit charges and reduce your interest and possibly improve your credit score you'll save thousands\nAnd they were actually able to work with my creditors I've been able to pay off to Fifteen thousand dollars in Alaska Eighteen months\nIt is and I got to tell you I saw that Chris Cuomo a prime time last night Steve Cortez as a warrior ... for the president he really is you know he he's a Latino and his president is a is parents\nCame here legally and he indoors so much defending the president's policies including his immigration policies on CNN it's just amazing to me you know I appear on CNN often as well but I what Steve as a model he I Know when I get off CNN after defending the president\nI get so many threats some of the death threats I'm certain ... gets the same kind of feedback from CNN viewers and yet he goes on every day swing them for the times is I'm so proud of him and your um but uh the ... the Democrats signed up for this and I think they're going to pay for it\nI think that again people who work hard for a living trying to take care of the kids just you know they don't have the money to send their kids to than the private schools\nThey're just out in the country and they're working and they'd like to take a vacation every now and then and they see that the economy has improved so much under the president's leadership and then on the other side they see\nChaos identity politics\nConstant cries of racism or an embrace of illegality and and now open borders which is you know it's been a case for some time but now it's literally they want open borders its it's beyond clear\nAnd I think it I think this blows up in the Democrats faces morning noon and night if the Republicans do the right thing here and hold on to this issue in actually pass legislation to stop this this is an emergency what's happening to this country\nTo see now with that girl named coming toward the border and I think the president is standing tall you know\nI I've been in politics since the Reagan Era and do you have to we first met in Washington back during the Reagan years and you know I worked for Jack Kemp and\nIt was people like Jack Kemp and Ronald Reagan stood up for this country and and had backbone and unfortunately over the years we really haven't had a president like Donald Trump and have backbone\nWould never have stood up to these caravans coming up against the border would never have stood up for justice Brett Kavanaugh and you saw what happened when the president just said simply nope I'm not looking at another another nominee you're going to have that are approved\nAnd confirmed a Brett Kavanaugh we saw spines grow and senators we didn't even think adamant you mean Lindsey Graham was a hero\nOf chairman Grassley a hero Susan Collins\nA hero in all emanates from the strength in the White House and\nThe immigration issue you know he has not backed down you remember when he came down that stairway in Trump Tower and then his speech which shocked everyone he promised threats to the word and they tried to conflate like you mentioned a a an illegal immigration with immigration and they've tried to do that\nOver and over and over again and they're still doing it today\nBut it's not working because the average man and woman working every day in America you know taking their lunch buckets of work you know dropping their kids off at school they understand the difference between somebody who jumps the border fence and somebody who comes here and stand in line and does it legally\nAh you're listening to your health a radio addiction eight five five forty Laura every poll that's been done in the last few years on immigration a shows that most people want legal immigration either to remain the same and that's a million people here it's a lot\nOr or to be decreased so it was like thirty seven percent want it to remain as saying that the Gallup poll from June I'm thirty seven percent want the level to remain the same I'm Talking legal immigration twenty nine percent want it decreased okay\nTwenty eight percent wanted increased now that's legal immigration\nAnd that those are the convenience factor the inconvenient fact that people like Chris ... they don't want to do it because when you live in a you know a doorman building in New York you don't have to worry about illegal immigration is it doesn't affecting your life\nYour kids go to the best schools your kids or you know probably driven to work or in a different school excuse me but you don't have to deal with illegal immigration and you don't have to call in with a a legal immigrants for\nFor a job and find that wait a second they're doing the IT work I used to do for thirty\nPercent less so you know people don't want this\nRight I live out in western New York where it's a it's a very blue collar area and ah in recent year a year or so we've seen\nYou know truckloads of illegal or legal immigrant arrested or the seven eleven\nOn their way back from a construction site where the or were they were working we've seen a chain of Mexican restaurants in and uh and west in Buffalo or wherever they pulled out of a whole load of workers where\nThe owner of the restaurant was housing them and paying them in cash on he just got a found guilty the other day\nOf this kind of crackdown needs to continue because I'll tell ya in western New York in Buffalo where we used to be a strong steel worker town\nWere not anymore we're we're starting to come back to the leadership of president Donald Trump\nBut men and women here me these jobs me these jobs and and the they know who's taken the\nIn jobs need these jobs and and the they know who's taken the job they know what illegal immigration is all about and the Democrats and the mainstream media spend their time trying to gas light them on this issue talking about how important\nA ... an immigration is to the United states when they're really the issue that they're they're they're conflate against illegal immigration the president is against immigration\nIs against illegal immigration\nAnd I think the American people see through you know my wife\nAn immigrant we went through the whole citizenship process the first the immigration process and then the citizenship process\nDifficult it takes time and if you got to hire a lawyer it's expensive but my wife will tell you it's really worth it you know and the problem she sees is it the surrounded by people who are all surrounded by people who are here illegally some of them are now over ... etc\nIt since it's infuriating [noise] and again I say this repeatedly you ... if you can't even blame you can't blame the people who are trying to get here because they've been given a green light probably from their own governments and in one way shape or form a and they've been told you can come and stay\nSo people who are just want to come here and work I don't even blame them but they ... it can't happen because because without a border you're not a country Reagan said that he was completely right border exist to help you maintain your sovereignty and to protect your own people\nAn orderly process of immigration is what we need but look the chaos at the at the border is is not dissimilar\nI'm Michael to the chaos that we've seen in the streets and the ... and the aftermath of Kavanaugh are and the Democrats prefer that because if this chaos you need more government government grows government gets bigger and the Democrats are never happier than when the government is growing and growing and growing that's what they want\nIt's true and if your listeners white what they saw during the month long confirmation process of justice Brett Kavanaugh the screaming in the hearings but the other people running down the uh the always based out of the United states Capitol screaming at senators\nBut the people trapping senators in an elevator illegally and screaming at them for the cameras\nThe mobs of people outside the capital and after he was confirmed that people trying to literally ... their fingernails through the metal doors of the United States Supreme court building if they like that\nThey're going to love twenty Nineteen if the Democrats take over the house of representatives and you know or if the election were held today\nWe would lose the house the Republicans wouldn't lose the house\nBecause a lot of people who were not measured well by the polls and twenty sixteen they call is deplorable right that people who hadn't voted in recent elections because of their frustration with issues like illegal immigration making up their vote didn't matter at all\nThey found a champion in Donald Trump someone they fought a non politician could make change for them\nAnd you know in in a midterm election\nThose kinds of folks to tend to think well I got my guy and I'm going to go ahead and sit this one out and they don't take their lunch break to go vote they don't drop their kids off early at school so they can go vote on the way to work or they don't you know a a skip the for the birthday party after work to go vote\nOn it and and that this time around they better do it because they think the part of the president's not on the ballot gee is\nOn ... you know and that's an excellent point and Michael what's happening in the twenty seventh congressional district in New York Congressman Chris Collins what's happening there\nWell Collins as of some of your listeners might know or was charged with insider trading yup I'm a recently after it was too late to get them off the ballot um you know he declares his innocence and you know we believe the presumption of innocence but New York twenty seven as an hour plus eleven district ... was a safe seat\nAnd they have a pretty strong Democrat running against them kind of leads toward the Democratic socialist type of thing really hates Donald Trump has said he's open to impeachment", "show_name": "The
