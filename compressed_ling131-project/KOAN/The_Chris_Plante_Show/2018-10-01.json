shot a gun on where you are how all of those disputes when they even then when they don't reach a level of criminal\nA status nevertheless their educated on the spirit of the constitution and these guys said the constitution doesn't really matter\nAnymore in matters of sexual so\nWell when we when we see the\nFew moments of honesty from the Democrats [noise] ah when they really talk I'm candidly\nIt's about the fifth vote in the corner it's not about whether Brett did dance and whether there but none of that's really what's going on it's about the fifth vote in the court and then Jeff Flake last night on sixty minutes said admitted that if you were running for reelection he never would have\nA you never would have asked for a delay in this a confirmation vote\nFor I mean yeah it is about the fifth vote but there isn't a symmetry there and that sense that\nWhen the Republicans are worried about a ... a swing vote or they don't do this I mean they didn't go after\nWhen ... said I Believe that a wise Latina mixed better decisions than a white male they didn't go scholar and say you're a racist and we're going to\nStop your they didn't go after Elena Kagan's so early college years and they they just don't do that I mean they disagree Merrick Garland and they try to use political use majority status but they don't do do it in the same way so it is about a fifth vote but it's about a fifth vote\nOr it's going to be conservative and therefore has an asymmetrical response if this was a fifth liberal vote they would be very angry and they would try to go over all the liberals opinions and say you know this guy's taking us\nDown the road to perdition and all that but I don't think they'd go after the person's high school a teenage years on the way they went out that's that's a progressive idea of it the noble and justify any means necessary to get there\nYou know what's also interesting I I think is how this has taken on a racial component even though of course both candidate on foreign are white ah but listen to this um tower of intellect Donny Deutsch today on MSNBC picture let's listen\nNow for an entire generation women going forward they will not be able to look at the Supreme Court the same way particularly post that capital of the forms that as a man I was embarrassed fan who is both of them a display of all white title met\nThe man who made his money or in part by opening up you know PR NPR from selling selling snake oil to people and also\nYou know hanging out at strip clubs by the way in ...\nWell I think what's happening in the Democratic progressive movement is that\nThey've created this Frankenstein monster and the doctors who created are afraid of being devoured you see it with Diane Feinstein here in California if you believe that how we appear adjudicate who we are that is race class not class excuse me race or gender then\nYou have to live by that and Dianne Feinstein is a multi millionaire a white woman who's been who's running against like Kevin daily on a person quote unquote of color and the same thing is true\nOf Chuck Schumer and the same things through Coons\nThere's a lot of old white guys on the Democratic side Richard Blumenthal in the white guy but they seem to think that that rule doesn't apply to them because they're liberal and they're joining this new wave but they're also doing it out of fear\nBecause they know that the logical ramifications of their own ideology comes right back boomerang right back at them\nSo you get a guy like Donny door a sure you get all these other people say or white guy old white guy old white guy even one\nDay and they're all like they're all old white guys it's back to the end of the progressive idea that you\nAt what Andrew McCabe said you'd get insurance you try to protest so loud\nThat you're going to get some medieval dispensation that exemption to from what you're saying about other people it's back to Mark Zuckerberg lecturing everybody on the walls where you have this huge wall around all of his house\nAnd all these old white guys have privilege if you really believed on the door and she would say you know Donna you've had a good run on TV let's get a young person of color and give give them the same type of opportunities and well the ...\n[laughter] a lot of that that would make me very happy very happy and he'd never happens don't expect\nIt now ah the we have to touch on this Jerry Brown signing into law this idea that women have to be represented on public boards in uh in California there has to be female representation on public toys\nAt which point at which point I treated out none of the Pacific islanders all Latino isn't\nA black people they should all be up in arms here I mean where do they get to go they go to get their own representation on boards\nYeah I think that's a coded for a lot of very affluent women in the bay area who want to be on a lot of these words when there and that's where all of the decisions are made and so they want a mandate or inclusion but again\nYou're seeing a fault line because you you hit it on the head and that is once you go down the idea that how we look\nWill be a Jew will Judy Kate who we are and we have to do it in tribal fashion and\nIndeed and percentage fashion of the population than there are so many different tribes with claims\nOf victimization and reparation that's almost impossible to include them all so you're gonna have you're going to see a woman say well I I Want to be in that board because I'm not just a woman but I'm black or Latino you're a woman but you're only white therefore I have\nI have greater credibility as being a person who deserves you know a set aside on the sport I we're going down there and I don't know what the ultimate trajectory is but either people are going to say you know what it's getting chaotic when we go to stop this and go back to the melting pot\nJust look at people by the content of their character not the color of their skin or their gender or we're going to we're going to go into something like the Balkans\nYeah well I think again it it says all identity politics at its worst I mean it's never good practice identity politics that you see that's even in in the entertainment industry where we have an African American hip hop or\nBy Kanye West he he's the guy who has some God I mean I don't really agree with us than I don't like his music and I I'm not here not my not my cup of tea but talking about grade\nGoing out on stage on ... ... s Saturday Night live the bastion of left

make America great again hat he got food you got ... got harassed backstage he said for a for actually having a hat on and supporting Trump Saddam left will not tolerate any dissent Victor\nYeah I think there's two things going on one is that this Trump idea that\nYou close the borders to only legal immigration and then you try to get the economy up at four percent GDP low unemployment means that people who are Americans and I've been over look like a lot of people in the inner city suddenly they have leverage and they have worth\nAnd that's the kind of a revolutionary message at West and others are starting to see and that's a lot better for interests that are people that will be patronize wide government title of the other thing that kind of reminds us that we want to get hung up on identity politics we always have to have the after\nIts identity politics but it's all progressive so if you're west\nIt doesn't really matter you're black anymore because you have the wrong ideas and if you're ... you know Keith Ellison 'em and you're charged with sexual assault well\nIt doesn't really matter because you have the right ideas so ideology actually Trump's\nMost cases or gender or your race you have to have the proper raised a proper gender but you also have to have the proper ideology\nAnd they were my time but how how do conservatives stand up to this with with education being what it is today and they in group same thing all the arrangement how do we as citizens forget you know I have a platform but how do they have a regular people stand up to the\nWell I think people look to people like yourself or anybody has a platform because\nThey they live quiet lives of does live live quite desperation they're just looking around is there anybody who believe like I Do

is is is have somebody claim that just stepped over the line once and that's it [noise]\nSo now they're actually they have some people on the record saying well\nWe saw him at Yale we saw him a ... a drunk and she got belligerent a few\nTimes and so he doesn't have the temperament so the new question judges as a former federal judge yourself\nThe idea of temperament because he was fairly aggressive in responding to the questions on Capitol Hill a last week that he doesn't have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court after having written two hundred decisions on the DC circuit he doesn't have the temperament\nBut that's a great I'm no when proposition um if he gets upset um having been accused of um a sexual assault than he doesn't have the temperament if he doesn't get upset that he's guilty so it's you know it's if he loses either what\nWell how do you think this ultimately plays out I mean that ...
