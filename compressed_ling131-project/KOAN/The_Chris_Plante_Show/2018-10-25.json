had an ability to to know that some of them didn't actually go through the post office they were hand delivered or one one initially said it was delivered by courier the stamps weren't actually stamped\nSalvo hot yeah it is odd and you would think of someone had to pay for that so they should be able to to track down who gave it to that person you know who actually delivered it trace it back to where it came from I mean\nAre there has to be some kind of accountability to to a courier service to who who you know where they picked it up where they got it and how they got it there\nNow if it's an inert powder\nAs it looks like it was again not meant to detonate um another comment that was made yesterday was that if you're going to send something\nIn in in you really wanted it to cause

bomb\nLike this through the postal service because it's too easily detected\nIs there anything to that\nWell I mean if you look or you know historical data the uh\nBombs have been used you know through the mail um\nEspecially when you have like a you know Ted Ted Kaczynski and what you did as a result the Unabomber stuff I mean\nYou can use the the post office or you can use other various means of the courier service FedEx or whatever but if you're in the day you're not going to use what they used in the last few days but you're going to use something that's not detectable\nUm look at this again refer back to the FedEx incident that we had were the devices actually went off um those were intended to all these ah these are intended to be found in my opinion but they were meant to

guess thought he could get away with lying about it I I don't\nTo me this whole thing is it's very strange with Gillum claiming that he's not under investigation how can they not be under investigation when the FBI had this ongoing operation involving him\nAnd ... with text messages now confirming that he knew he was getting theater tickets other benefits uh from someone who was ultimately the developers thinking favors\nTrying to use his brother Marcus as a shield for the past through these gifts so Andrew Gillum and finding himself in a heap of trouble and of course is

driven to a bus depot they get a bus ticket and then they're off\nSo why wouldn't all of Guatemala and El Salvador and Honduras eventually figure out a way to get to the border and come into the United states they're not going to be deported unless they commit a violent crime and even then\nThey have sanctuary states and cities who won't hold individuals once they're released so they can be picked up by ice and deported\nSo we're making it an obvious choice for people who want to come to the United states and not go through legal channels we're we're we the people of this country if we don't get leaders in place who do this job right then we're going to see our country ultimately lost\nTo illegal immigration we have now more than twenty two million people who are illegal aliens living in the United states many of them are children who have family ties here they've worked here are some of them criminals the lion share or not but they are here and they're not going anywhere\nSo the question is it true just drop all pretense of a border disappointed by it I mean you can see the art of it's just easier at this point\nThat we don't have a border okay there's no border just come in if you want I don't think most people want that there was a\nGreat piece in American greatness dot com about how illegal immigration has hurt black Americans\nMost just published yesterday and the reason for this is that most illegal\nImmigrants overwhelmingly seek work in the low skilled labor market first and because black American a labor force is so disproportionately concentrated in the same low wage sector that same urban areas where illegal immigrants flood into so there's little doubt that there are significant overlap in competition for jobs\nIn this sector of the labor market so given the inordinately high unemployment rate still for low skill black workers it's obvious that the major loser in this competition\nAre low skilled black workers'\nWages are under\nCut by people who prefer to be paid in cash or we have fake Social Security numbers and African Americans\nAre in other poor Americans are\nLeft to deal with this it's wildly unfair or Bob in Florida on line four\nAnd I will tell you this ah Rhonda ... is the only choice for Florida oh we're gonna play the sound from a last night's debate in earlier that demonstrates why Andrew Gillum\nCompletely played with the truth to put it politely about his acceptance of gifts from lobbyists and those who seek\nPolitical favors are political consideration which that should in of itself that should be disqualified and he's blaming race of course for any question about his FX so we'll play the race card or a soundbite more coming up let's go to Bob Bob welcome\n[noise] they were you know you bring it up a federal Gillum gets elected up without a leash Florida with but she'll that's that's just the first point but\nJunk case excited about all these people are going to be down there at the border walking and people will take them into his all that of all those people are called the cheese steaks and they want to be part of us without carrying flags why are they all carrying flashing their own country Sledge around they don't want to come here to be Americans do you want to come here to\nFlash in their own country Sledge around they don't want to come here to be Americans do you want to come here to take what we have looked at for us\nWell some excellent points are carrying the Honduran flag other blue flags that's a blue wave blue wave of foreign foreign flags\nOr the Democrats and others has trouble or ... why haven't authorities given us more information about what's in these packages that's a good question people are asking that Lou Dobbs tweeted about that whether they're a hoax or were actual bombs\nThey were clearly what the timing in the eyes of many at least people think they were clearly designed to influence the election talk about election meddling\nI mean a violent attempted violence attempted intimidation attempted terrorizing I'm ... I mean we we do deserve information's probably faster than we are getting it but I think they don't want to copy cats and so forth\nSo I understand that as well uh let's go to Theresa Oklahoma Theresa welcome [noise]\nI Would like to hear these who are in favor of the illegal immigration pointedly asked\nHow much of your personal time in your personal many do you spend on humanitarian causes and helping your fellow man\nI have all ideas it's not very much it's just the soundbite for them and they really have no care for those that are around them they don't have a charity in their hearts it's all about political maneuvering\nThat's a great point well I think again if you if people are willing to sponsor individuals who apply for legal of\nEntry into the United states sponsor them economically sponsor their education sponsor their learning English and be fit financially\nAccountable for them and also civil reliable if they commit crimes I don't think you'd see many people signing up\nI mean we know they enforce their their perimeter around their house with alarms and fences and gates and and servants [laughter] I mean these people have more more of a perimeter then the White House and they're complaining about our border being enforced or say it's not fair\nI don't know how many people John Case it was taken into his own um his own you know governor's mansion and Im sure you could take in a few it's pretty nice house\nIt's a great point All right you're listening to the Laura Ingraham show a very tight race\nIn Indiana and we're going to talk to Mike Braun who's challenging the Democrat incumbent Joe Donnelly its its neck and neck it's up to point down two points\nSo this is a tight race we're going to talk to Mike about Indiana as a ... it's a reliably red state meeting a conservative state so why should there be any question that the governor of that great state where Mike Pence came from of course a should also not be a Republican strong conservative\nAnd what what Indiana's think today\nExcuse me out of course ... excuse me for the Democrats are incumbents that it I think governor um so I have governor on my mind\nA so obviously Joe Joe Donnelly for the Senate race but I said that but I'm All right we're going to take a break a five five forty Laura will bring you the latest updates on the tracking of these packages the political

things have happened we brought a good campaign and we restore strict competitively in great fundraising and not a whole lot different than executing a business plan and we feel good about where we are\nA well Mike the concern today and the part of the media these packages that arrived and uh\nConcern today and the part of the media these packages that arrived and\nUh the offices and residences of Trump's critics prominent people from John Brennan to Joe Biden or in what what is your take on this the criticism of the president was almost instantly even though he condemn this of course and ask for national unity it was not good enough\nOr and they're blaming him for creating the atmosphere that resulted in these packages being sent\nOne of the president's been blamed for everything gets no knowledge rent for the main thing he's done the reason I'm running is uh I wouldn't be running if ah invent another outcome and sixteen now we've got a rare opportunity to kind of shake the system and\nFix what's broken and uh he they're still really litigating I think the two thousand sixteen race and that's why he gets a no credit for the great agenda that's out there that are exciting Hoosier Z and uh he was popular in sixteen here among conservatives and even more so\nAnd I even think the people that maybe don't love his style are going to look at the results and uh I think that's why I'm winning this race that's why Joe Donnelly has tried to become so Trump being when uh you know he never has been always with the liberal side of his party's so uh\nUm I think this is just another example of how they try to distract and ah give him absolutely no credit for all the good things happening\nMaxine Waters said today she responded to these packages saying I ain't scared on she called on the president to take responsibility for the kind of violence we're seeing for the first time in different ways well this is a year plus\nAfter Steve ... was almost killed at the hands of a rabid Trump a hater Andy Bernie Sanders supporter and everyone seems to forget what happened in fact I was astounded by the security there would have been dozens dead\n[noise] exactly I mean if it let me of um I think the real exposure to this kind of approach occurred in the cabinet hearings and all of his challenging Democrats in these red states or the amount of just absolute negative lives and distortions that\nSchumer's packs dump into George Soros than the rest of them are I think it's exposed and ugly underbelly of uh what they're about which is a lack of any message\nCompletely obstructing and trying to play down all the good things that are happening with the Trump agenda\nAnd I think voters are going to hold him accountable uh I think uh the Kavanaugh hearings for Hoosiers would have been part the point where our race changed and many others and I think enough was enough and they related back to my race and many others I sell something\nFox dead on across the board than regular advertising that just swamped\nYou on the airwaves and that's because they're afraid of their record\nWell again the Democrats don't want to debate the issues because they have absolutely gone out of the business if they ever were in the business of\nA proposal to actually advance our economy or or grow our prosperity earn force the border I mean they're just not interested in this conversation so they resort to personal attacks and even on issues where they agree on to some extent like Schumer agrees with some of the things that Trump is doing on trade\nHe won't talk about those because you can't give the president any credit for anything anytime anywhere\nNo doubt about it I'll give you a great example in my race I took on the health insurance companies about\nTen years ago to make sure you know the Affordable CARE Act the first word of it it never was and it was doomed to fail because you had big government hooked up with big healthcare is specifically insurance\nAnd I covered preexisting conditions and no cap on coverage and Lara held premiums flat for ten years and it's the absolute truth and it's kind of blown up in the sense that they can't believe a conservative\nActually might have a solution for what they you know that's their pivotal issue they think they went on and all I did was a made up consumer driven made a transparent\nThe kind of things that you'd like in free markets and a great result I go to the Senate I'll talk about that and that's why we're going to win the race that gets a guy like Joe Donnelly and it's been a career politician that's never had an original idea since he's been there\nI think that again when you when you see how absolutely nutty the left is driven by the Trump progressive results the economy\nThe fact that he's not going to be back on the heels and constantly apologizing I mean that's the that's the type of Republican they liked the best they like some of like a John ... forever back on the heels and apologizing for being a conservative and Trump's is not going to do that and that drives me crazy and he calls them out on it and and I think it's a little\nLong since pass the time we had that type of planes speaking politician\nWell I mean a thank goodness that's exactly where I'm coming from an alarm the other thing you're going to get\nAs if the gender really heals and I talk about tax reform and I do think it's a incumbent upon conservatives are business owners now that you've got more Django in your pocket share it with your employs we've gotten that by\nFurther lowering healthcare costs after keeping them flat for ten years and\nAre preached out all the time you do that I really believe that's the signature piece of legislation that they gambled would not be appreciated would that ten months\nPeople now adding up more money in their own pocket and if you get business owners like us that ... gone out there in touted tax reform we want to share the benefits with your employers\nPeople quit looking through the false hope of a federal government that the\nDemocrats believe and that hasn't delivered over the last two or three decades and really put his you know on the brink of a financial calamity if we don't get more people in there that are going to be able to solve things and not worry about the political ramifications that's why I'm going and there'll be more of us I think that jump\nOn the bandwagon stick our necks out and join the Trump train so uh we're paying for half of it\nWell we cannot wait for election day uh Mike I think you're going to win this race or the people of Indiana and we have a huge audience and Indiana\nYou got to get out there and vote get everyone you know to get get to the polls vote for in advancing economy and a an America\nThat's growing that's more confident and optimistic and do not go backward we don't want to go backwards to more identity politics more mass illegal immigration gotta deal with this or the new Congress close these loopholes\nAnd Mike Brown would be fantastic in the U.S Senate I I just can't wait for you to come to Washington I think you're going to win this Mike and I'm I'm so glad either in\nWe're going to win it and I'm looking forward to it in a lower thanks for the support and we're going to finish a part in the paper on the sex and uh can't wait to be a reinforcement for a great agenda\nWhen did you graduate from um H. B. S. by the way\nI did in Seventy eight I think right outta college a wife and I got married in Seventy six lived in Boston for two years and it was back their hometown and have been here ever since uh she got a business for forty years\nPresident back home town and have been here ever since uh she got a business for forty years and our downtown as are the only job and we raise four kids and three of the four kids work in my business with me\nA fantastic what a great story I'm Mike Brown here on the lower income show eight five five forty Laura Indiana get out and vote vote early and consider your future your children's future what kind of future do you want for them don't go away\nWe'll be talking with a leading\nMovie airing when things\nThat we can hear anybody here supporting Joe Donnelly\nSpeaks for itself in the same weight and voters hear anyone fortunate Donnelly\nHow I got has not said much the Democrats here and it's like [noise]\nI don't I don't think that like as a scientist at\nThe Laura Ingraham show [noise]\nI was such a sweet animal people want to pet him and they cannot\nGet close with my dad didn't want to touch like get the dog away from me even after we give her ... she would still stay very bad and he said some dogs or\nDoes your dog itch scratch stink worship like crazy come to a diner by for help\nAnd I'll take the fatty acids thing fails to digest it at a vital that are cut out a regular dog food\nAnd it was definitely worth trying after he started smelling normal really kind of gone sky\nAnd that sort of documentary but before you just go when we went over there for you to\nWatch one am [noise]\nTo suspicious packages somebody ...

I've had a double digit lead for quite a while on her and\nAnd I think the comparison was already resonating with with North Dakota and she just blew up with the cab nothing because again her everything she's pretended to be was revealed in one major illustration\nSo and the fair to say she was really big but also she's a former state attorney general she was a former North Dakota attorney

way and North Dakota chief among them and by the way\nSo will the soul of the states that I Would consider bad states places like California\nNorth Dakota is the second leading producer of oil in the in the country not because we produce more necessarily although we have a lot of it obviously technologies on locked it\nBut but because places like California that have lots of it has screwed it up okay they have a right to do that and and they have a right to have a a cost of living higher than than there are a ... quality of life but\nI I'd say that the thing I'd say is this trust the
