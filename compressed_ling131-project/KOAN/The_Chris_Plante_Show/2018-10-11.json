political analysts out there with all your experience and reporting over decades or what you're seeing play out now in the country is is worse than um you expected and are we approaching perhaps a Nineteen sixty eight\nStyle a type of frenzy in the streets\nBut I think we're ... or beyond that now I think it's the worst that I've seen in my forty five year journalism career yeah basically a nexus of ah the media the corrupt media I'm now a promoting embracing um whatever word you want to use the most\nRadical progressive movement\nEver seen in this country ever in the history of the country\nSo you have a guy's like and everybody knows this named George Soros but others as well with unlimited amounts of money we're basically um formed organizations\nTo attack and destroy people with whom they disagreed this is why it's different than the Tea Party or the or a hypocrites on CNN and MSNBC who you know from day to day will change their story depending on what they're told to do\nUm you have now a bevy of organizations so he saw it in a cabinet hearings that send people out these aren't mob people these are targeted\nPeople who are paid to do certain things you know to confront senators in elevators or with the CNN camera right behind them to ah prevent um Senator Cruz and his wife from having dinner these these aren't accidents are right to get Bill O'Reilly off the air\nNot an accident mhm okay so you have this and in the past\nJournalism reporters would have investigated it begins this huge money behind it\nBut they don't now instead they promote it\nThey're in business with the radical left in business with them CNN and MSNBC make money\nLots of it promoting the most radical progressive organizations in the country which will stop at nothing including violence to get political power so that's what we're looking at\nDo you think that uh the president's handling of this ah that's our and the way he's addressed it has been health law has it been illuminating\nI don't think he knows what's going on\nThe way I just laid it out to you and your listeners\nAre just don't think he knows what's going on I don't think he knows the seriousness ... whenever you have organizations\nThat are in the shadows that people never heard of I'll give you one color of change\nOur it and you've got twenty of them\nAnd they take their orders from big money he'd radical left people All right they say okay you pay us this and we'll do that the woman who confronted senator\nFlake and the elevator is paid one hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year\nBy George Soros funded foundations\nWas widely reported Laura you that\nMm no no no\nOkay and so people think it's spontaneous oh this woman just showed up to yell at a flake because she's a victim or whatever she said she is that's not what's happening and you know I I draw the correlation between what's happening in America now what happened in Germany\nIn the late Nineteen twenties and Nineteen thirties where you had a fanatical movement Nazi ism\nAccumulating power behind the scenes by violent methods are there and it was big money in it as well okay while the population was looking away wasn't interested was engaged and the media in Germany basically we're afraid of the Nazis\nAnd they wouldn't tell the truth about that\nThat was more of a fear thing than than a what we have now is that the media in America is ideologically in line with the progress ones there cause in the media is the same cause a George Soros sort of a little bit more extreme than the editors of the New York times but not much\n[noise] so this big picture that's formulated over the past I Would say ten years um I don't think President Trump understands it\nUm and I'll give you another thing if I were President Trump I Would order an FBI investigation into the cabin or debacle\nBecause I Know and I think you do to that it was no accident Dianne Feinstein held back that letter from Dr Ford for six weeks that was not an accident\nIt was no accident it was leaked against Dr for its wishes which I'm not exactly sure were sincere but let's say let's take it for face value that letter was linked putting the woman in danger and it was leaked\nBy somebody in Congress because only two people have the letter\nSo the FBI should be investigating that and should get to the bottom and I'll tell you if they start that investigation which I Would order if I were president that scandal that whole thing is going to unravel fast because that was no accident what happened a cabinet\nAnd the women were all on the one hour all lying by the way they were all line\nTwo and a couple of people are looking into this who actually knew or knew both of them now now new to them and\nWhatever it was ... I went through this I went through this myself mhm right and and I saw things leveled against me that were insane\nAnd I you know at this point in this country people are going to have to want to make a decision right the progressive left this figured out that they have the media in their pocket and they can do what they want they can do exactly what they want and they almost got cabinet they almost got him\nAnd this is kind of country why\n... is is it you're not going to get an honest take from the media they're not going to investigate things they're not going to try to find the truth except it\nAccept it because it's been in play now for quite some time so who do you depend on to get the truth the only the apparatus is the criminal justice system and I'll put forth a President Trump should really see a bigger picture\nAnd I'll put forth a President Trump should really see a bigger picture he picks everything personally any fights back effectively himself but I don't know if you see in the big picture what's happening here\nYou know once you start to a road basic rights like presumption of innocence you process which you say they don't matter as the senator from Hawaii say hey don't matter\nDon't presumption of innocence that somebody accuses you of misconduct none you're guilty because in the past some women have been abused I mean think about it\nThey're they're attacking the fundamental rights that Americans have un habitat\nAnd nothing what is what is being done nothing\nAnd I think bill you know I mean it's a division but I'm just so worried about it I Can't\nI Am ... I Am petrified of this I I I completely agree with you and I was slammed\nFor the last three weeks for saying just because someone alleges something and says this is my truth\nDoesn't mean that you can just say okay this person has to be fired this person has to be boycotted this person has to be a thrown to the to the curb denounced um put up on across crucified lose a promotion this has got to stop\nThat 'cause I got to have it anybody well and it had happened it happened to me at ... obviously things happen to you look what happened to you things yeah and it it is a brutal unfair situation and and once you're accused of something where do you do to get a regulation that waste\nAnd there isn't anybody in place to rectify it although President Trump could do it by trying to get to the bottom of this cabinet mess why do you call them closer and Bill O'Reilly dot com as it is about this issue mhm is about ... exactly about how are your truth has replaced thought truth\nOkay so and I and I take it off the University of North Carolina which now wants to honor Christine for ... and and I I I never comment on a doctor for one way or the other because I don't know what happened\nI'm

power has re Quicken Loans highest in the nation and customer satisfaction for primary mortgage rich nation and for the fifth year in a row they've also rank the highest in the nation for mortgage servicing Richfield\nDelivering these things a lot of people still believe the Democrats\nAre better managing government than the than than the Republicans are so but at the Democratic party was going to a direction but it's going and just the opposite direction they're almost virtually guaranteeing a the reelection of a of a Donald Trump in two thousand won it by making themselves so marginal so crazy so\nUh you know out there that they just are revolting to most\nYou know decent law abiding American citizens\nRevolting to most you know decent law abiding American citizens\nWell in it and you have a situation where the former attorney general\n... the ... the the chief law enforcement officer advocate violence\n... and it's disgusting\nSo he advocated violence a Hillary Clinton says you can't be civil with people who want to destroy your\nYour beliefs are so they are two fairly important people in the Democratic party you had Dianne Feinstein um claim that her office didn't leak this confidential document I don't know she lake dinner for over\nYeah yeah yeah yeah it's from the let me give you the struggle now gee if I may plays\nIs that in the late sixties the radical left was you know the colleges campuses where a flame uh the radical out being funded by the KGB and the G R U which has historically documented proof the Soviets were funding the ah anti war protests of the sixties is that they became crazier and crazier and more touchy more touch\nAnd what happened was was that they temporarily took over the Democratic party and they came up with a nominee George McGovern was a lunatic and who got creamed by Richard Nixon in Nineteen Seventy two\nAnd so so the Democrats swore that weren't going to happen again so they they took control of the party and and nominate a centrist Jimmy Carter and won the Republican the Democratic party has now spinning out of control again as it did\nIn ah sixty eight virtually assuring that they're going to nominate a very extreme left is a Marxist Democrat who Trump will have an easy time to feeding in two thousand twenty\nDo you think that because a mass immigration and social media there is more of a chance of the country embracing that left wing radical ideology than it was Nineteen Seventy two\nNo through social media is just the opposite you know we we we it is taking power this is part of the reason why\nThe leftist showing rage because they are losing power and authority of the Washington Post is a sad joke itself let's face it the New York times is sad joke CBS NBC ABC I Can't remember the last time\nI watched any programming on any of those three networks except for a football games are on a on Sundays on to the to the networks are but I don't know anybody who does is that their power is draining away too\nYou know the lowering them show and the Fox news and two of you know Newsmax and one American news and conservative talk radio and blogs and and so they become more and more and rage they become more and more marginal and they're doing just the opposite there were telling\nTheir marginal viewers Marshall readers marginal listeners and send them send them all through the Republican Party which day by day is looking more calm and placid at a reasonable just because of the craziness of the Democrats\nSo it's important than that the president himself a I think appear calm and this storm don't you agree with that and\nYeah Donald Trump's image is set for the American people you know he can't he can't really altered or change it or what but but one thing they do believe is is that he's done a pretty good job as president certainly better than bronco bomb and certainly better than\nHillary Clinton would have done he's got a chance to improve his standing as as you know people uh you know a job approval and things like that as a ... economy can do to prove North Korea ISIS other things like this\nUh but it stand is pretty well fixed but if it's in he's in better shape\nThan the Democrats are worth a are at this point in time\nSo go go back and this goes back to the historical moment in we talked about this a bit last night since you're Reagan biographer are so many great Reagan bucks how Reagan dealt with the riots and will will play a bit of town a says if you missed the show last night let's listen\nTo those people who do four days in advance that if the universities to head with that construction they were going to physically destroy the University of many negotiate what she said what is\nWhat it sees a public institution that's right but the universe its own community in the community in Berkeley that live around all\nOf it began the first time some of you know better and are old enough to know better let young people think that they have the right to choose the law they would all day as long as they were doing it in the name of social protest\nHe gets up any leads yeah yeah that point what do you know construction he was talking about\nThey were there was a there was a park there in Berkeley and they left I wanted to uh build some type of bizarre a memorial to a Vietnam Vietnam Viet Cong soldiers something that that is\nCompletely out of control it was just it was basically the left you know a stickler Feldman the I've just average rent is what it was all about\nBut what I Love about Reagan or old friend Marty Anderson who's to say that Ronald Reagan was he said warmly ruthless and if you listen to ... he says these professors somebody if you're old enough and ought to know better you know the way he just dismiss them but so smoothly and so clearly and so\nYou know a ruthlessly but it just it was the master of this type of thing\nAnd I I just I Love the fact that he he he he went right to the ... the salient point here Craig which is that if people are led to believe that there outrage or\nTheir emotions can justify any conduct their behavior then we're in big trouble\nAfter ... that it's a huge huge problem\nSure but it is situational ethics and that's the difference today between the modern Democratic Party in the modern liberal moving in modern American conservatism is is that\nYou know rule of law is one thing where is is that the rule of the mob is quite another by the way this idea that are over on CNN you can't use the word mop look up what Webster I tweeted out this morning\nWebster's Dictionary ... a just a a describes a mob as being an unruly group of people set about to cause a political upheaval but that's what they've been doing for the last several weeks is exactly that so you can call them up because you're offended by the Webster's Dictionary\n[laughter] yeah I agree with the mob one of the Tea Party when they're ... dressed in period garb yeah [laughter] that's\nWhy the left doesn't get it because they're incapable most people on the left is that they they're they don't they ... they think in a linear sense and they think well if the Tea Party at a protest and the liberal side of protest they must be one of the same no they're not one of the same id motives has everything to do with it\nNow and it's again it's feeling feeling is enough yeah\nAs long as they feel and they're on the right side then that's all you need so if you feel like well you you if you want to want to stand up for women in algae BT and all it then you then you got to go out and vote Democrat like what\nBut but that maybe I've said this before in the show and I beg your part of a hat but\nThe difference today between a moderate conservative leader learned to serve a politician and a modern liberal politician is the liberal politician goes before the voters says give me power so I can do good things for you and some voters go oh jeeze\nHit me power so I can do good things for you and some voters go oh geez I felt pretty good you know it but it but a moderate conservative and that's the most or all response because because liberals going to do with the good things for you moderate conservative politician goes before the voters just give me power\nSo I may give it back to you ... have\nTo think about it you have to go through the intellectual discipline to realize what he's talking about which is a Republican form of government conservatism federalism\nWhatever iteration it comes in is that but it's about taking power away from Washington and send it back to the states or localities and ultimately the individual or the frame or some founders intended it to be there in the first place\nWell again power to power to the people the let me try to show up that slogan but they never really earlier but that's\nThe that's the Latin basis for the Republican\nYeah power to the people stays with them not some with some big nameless faceless bureaucracies a crack I Want to play one more thing fee then we're out of time this was Jeane Kirkpatrick I think it was it the Nineteen eighty four Republican convention in Dallas yeah let's let's yeah Harry Truman\nBasic source of our spring is terrorists\nWe believe in the dignity of man\nAm not alone and noticing the San Francisco Democrats\nGod she was great but shoo wonderful old friend um I was there on the floor in Dallas that unless you get that speech she also brought down the house when she called the Democrats the blame America First crowd\nThat forgot

[noise]\nChris Matthews and [noise]\nA few of the uh mal contents on\nMSNBC but they're they're desperately trying to grasp on to something to change the narrative about the rabid left turn of not the hurricane but of their own party\nSo Donald Trump goes to a rally because tens of thousands of people were waiting and there was nothing he was going to be able to do at this moment that wasn't being done to help the people in the panhandle and as you can see from the comments from Rick Scott and Marco Rubio and Rhonda Santas\nThey were getting all the help they need it and then some and the preparedness on the part of a Florida was just it's amazing and it's and it's a horrible thing to see this flood coming in a in the aftermath of hurricane Michael could have been a lot worse but\nUh it's still bad I mean the fact that this storm actually moved in the direction that it did by twelve miles it hits the air force base didn't hit the residential area as it could have I mean this could have been\nI mean as bad as it looks this could have been a ... just heart wrenching loss of life\nSo we're going to find out more about this as a day goes on it's daylight hits the panhandle and you're able to see just how much damage was done or the strongest hurricane to hit the panhandle apparently ever\nBut again the area in which it hit was not where they thought it was initially going to hit on in Panama and Panama beach area so we thank God for that but still a huge amount of damage was done so do you think Donald Trump\nDoesn't care and that's why he went to do this rally in Pennsylvania like he didn't care\nBy the way the Democrats didn't care when when we lost in American ambassador in bend gossipy\nChristopher Stevens\nAfter the attack on an American compound and Libya

be doing to trying to take care of the president's rate so he'll get their president but I also want to see just whatever Donald Trump does he's gonna be attacked\nThese people don't like him they wake up in the morning they say I Know he's done something terrible what is it and that's kind of their approached everything right now and it makes them frankly a little bit nutty\nWell and I think that uh again the the theory and the frenzy ah has gotten to a point I knew that when I was talking to folks say yesterday who were in Washington in the Nineteen sixty eight riots after Martin Luther king and Robert Kennedy or both assassinated\nAnd they were saying that they hadn't seen anything in this angry and frenzied since then do you think that's accurate\nYeah I think I think basically you had strong ordinary intensity up through\nWatergate you had a memory at a million people surrounding the Pentagon at one point or you had soldiers who found that they couldn't go through airports are being harassed or and it was a very bitter very divisive time\nAh but I think after that uh we became sort of more normal for a while and uh now we're drifting back up because this is a genuine\nA cultural civil war I mean you know [noise] what Hillary Clinton said that it wasn't inaccurate that shot some people who she's basically right or when we're point or somebody like justice cabin on\nIts because we want to return to a constitutionally based court system that uses the American system is this model not some European or South African or other kind of system and as a result\nIf your a left wing a Democrat we we we're at the end of your world ... you know they had hope desperately\nTo change America and now the American people are responding and saying no we don't want to say we liked being Americans and I think that has become just an enormously good or blow for the uh people who who thought\nUp until election night two thousand sixteen they were ... Hillary Clinton who's gonna when they go at the two justices you've got\nAnd he'll or even ... oh my God you know they'd be so far to the left and so so unwilling to look at the American constitution that it would have really been a very dramatic difference compared to where we are now\nOr I Want to play for you I'm Larry ... who of course famously bombed in his protection for twenty sixteen but\nNevertheless has this production for the midterms\nIf there has ever been an abnormal presidency where he had it\nAnd the Trump is violated so many of the rules of politics in so many of the norms of politics a red wave ain't gonna happen it's just a question of how big the blue wave is they could be a suit on me it could be a middle sized way they can be a small way it's going to be a blue wave\nOr what is your reaction thought\nWell maybe he's right which probably isn't I'm In the first question I asked is how come we just won a you a state Senate special election\nIn Texas state Senate seats in Texas were bigger than congressional seats eight hundred thousand people along the border sixty three percent a Hispanic or and we won the first time in a hundred and thirty nine years what's his explanation\nOr how come a mix Sally the Republican nominee in Arizona's now ahead or how come that er Kramer the Republican candidate in\nNorth Dakota is ahead by maybe fourteen points uh in his in ah\nTennessee as people we have to realize that Britain is actually the Democratic actually wrote a book explaining that Obamacare didn't go far enough and explaining how you could get to a government run health system branch and starting to fall apart mhm and Tennessee is going to end up ... I'm I'm just getting a sense of\nYou know something out of self sabotage and say oh where's the where's the blue wave in the Senate I don't think it exists\nNow and of course we see these races and some of these governors races the one that I'm really watching\nIs the Andrew\nGillum versus Ron I'm\nA dissent is because for me and for\nSome many of watch the growth of Florida and how well it's been a run by Rick Scott and and to the idea of turning that state over is critical that stayed in the country electoral politics to\nA guy who is basically a socialist is just that just cannot happen in yeah he's got millions and millions of dollars nude from all the usual suspects\nCharlie Chaplin I mean you'll um is um [noise]\nThe latest great hope because you came out of nowhere as a radical Democrats uh he won an upset primary victory or he see\nThe temporarily looks very good I think you'll be fading day by day as this goes on but ... but when you say governorships remember that there's a study that just came out the ten most popular governors in states\nAre all Republican every single one of the ten highest rated governors or a Republican or the governor of Massachusetts hardly a red state is gonna win in a landslide the governor\nUh the governor of Massachusetts hardly a red state is gonna win in a landslide the governor of Maryland hardly a red state is gonna win in a landslide and the reason is exactly why we're building a majority in the country they get results\nThey don't just have resistance are they actually have things that work they don't just have fantasies and strange ideas and I think we have to be prepared to wage a campaign\nThat drives home again and again and again the difference between a the kind of left wing fantasies are not you can't afford them you can implement them a long run they're not going to work\nAnd I think that's one of our key jobs this campaign is to draw the distinction between results and resistance and certainly the attorney General Holder was a perfect example of the resistance as the alternative\nYeah I I really think and again we'll see how it translates into turn out I think those images\nOf the protesters banging on the Supreme Court doors completely out of control a I think that's I I don't\nThink people like that they might not like everything Trump tweets or they might be annoyed at some of the things he says are exaggerates crowds I what I get that but I think the frenzy people\nWant it all to calm down they just want things to calm down they want to come down on both sides and I so I think the Democrats made a really bad miscalculation on this cabinet thing and\nI think it puts them in a much more vulnerable place in a midterm cycle that they thought they you know they were going to just roll right into with you know fifty seat pickup ah so that's my sense of it in holders comments\nMaxine Waters I don't know I think all of it is it gives people a bad feeling\nAnd I think you can draw the contrast you mean here you have an economy which is booming at a level people said was impossible your jobs being created your lowest\nBlack on unemployment in history the lowest Latino unemployment in history or you have a remarkable achievers would deregulation you have solid conservative judges being appointed so every time you turn around right now you're seeing genuine results\nAnd then you have as you point out um people who seem crazed\nUh I mean is this really the America you want you really want people who come into a restaurant or harass people and drive them out when people banging on the Supreme Court doors are and I and I think in some cases of course we know the George tours and others actually pay for them or which doesn't you know does that justify him\nBut the whole system that the left has tried to create I think is in the end or not a sustainable system\nNewt I Know you're doing a lot of uh of events before the midterm elections and there's one on October Fifteen or where\nYou can register to um attend an evening with Newt Gingrich and you'll be able to hear you talk about what's in store for the country what's at stake for the country in the mid term so how do people end up uh attending this do they do and and and\nLet me let me just say also that we're we're very excited they can go to\nAn evening with Newt dot com it's great to an evening with Newt dot com Leo beep and I are going to be they're talking about our American stories and I'm going to take questions and frankly let the audience direct me I'm going to put them sort of pick what other topics we should talk about\nWell that's fantastic oh my gosh that's it'll be a lot of great an evening with new dot com so you can go there and I'm just have a lot of fun and look it's time to\nIt's time to stand up for the American way you want and I think I think Americans are they have a good you know BS detector Newt for an an artful way of saying it but I don't\nKnow what what Trump's eccentricities came amazing results I mean I eccentricity as we all have them but incredible results in ... including the handling of this hurricane I might add a and you just have to look you know Rick Scott's comments about that to find out how well he's done", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Chris Plante Show", "city": "Anchorage", "day": "11"}
