them do it to you got yourself to blame 'em by my to my mind\nWhat's happened here in Port and only in part was directed personally at Kavanaugh my my take on it is that the overarching purpose of this\nIs the interim effect that it creates for conservatives and and maybe not just conservatives but anybody who doesn't\nA toll on the line of the new empowered progressive Democrats basically they are telling you\nThat if you try to crash or party this is the kind of thing we're going to do to you and I think the only way to combat that is to fight it aggressively and make sure the people who pulled that uh have to be held to account if you if we just getting a crouch\nAnd let them keep doing it to us there won't be any us left because no good people will want to get into politics\nAnd I I really mean us it's not just someone from coming from someone who supported the president in a campaign but coming from a a lawyer and a longtime conservative like myself I really believe Trump wants the Republicans how to fight\nI mean it's not going to simple formulation but for a long time Republicans were just taking it and they were afraid they were all just like they were all like in an elevator on any longer I've never seen Mitch McConnell fight harder than he fought for this nomination\nThere well I think he's showing Trump is showing that this is what people have won at all along and look at this sometimes the ... the president I think goes way overboard and makes me cringe but if I got into my head if I have to pick\nI Want somebody who's going to fight than somebody who's not and if that means there's going to be access from time to time then you know then there's going to be accessed from time to time but\nI think he's showing that there's a hunger on our side to not just stand in a defensive crouch and keep taking the stuff with which we've been doing for years\nWell I think it's important that we have McConnell out their Lindsey Graham John Cornyn or even been vast talking about the mob mentality that we can't become a ... a country by a mob rule where people are afraid to go to restaurants\nYep [noise] yeah and I and I think Laura that if you don't raise this stuff\nAnd turn it into an issue particularly one more on the cusp of an election\nYou don't have a compelling way after the election to say that you know this was on the table for people to consider and you have a mandate now to stop it because people voted against it so I think this not only has to be fought but it has to be ... up\nA as an election issue and frankly it helps the Republicans to take it up because\nI I've seen you say this was a you know on television and heard you on the radio said a million times\nOrdinary people commonsense people do not like the stuff I mean they see these these uh Lenski I direct action tactics and they say you know if there's some parts of this\nAgenda that I may agree with but these tactics are not America and and I don't think that's the America anybody wants who sensible\nNow and again people like Feinstein who looks either liberal but she was fairly well respected until I think the last you know\nA couple of years where she's been especially last year was she's really been pushed left I mean she because of course their primary challenge and the and the\nCalifornia has become more and more or less gone more or less

just means we're going forward I'm\n... and this is not over until it's over I mean I Know people thought that finally we had this buttoned up yesterday a discipline there's been so many twists and turns to this and the other side is so rabbit about it this is not over until it's over\nAmy Coney Barrett Raymond a royal has said you better get the private jet and childcare\nReady for her

Republican National committee woman\nOf Georgia so we get a nice sampling of ladies from across the fruit at play like you all for being your capital to start with you your reaction to this what are you hearing and is this turning women all watching this play out\nWomen are very engaged conservative women are very engaged women are outraged by\nThis whole notion that believe lemon and are willing to the kid any man of sexual assault and that limited to be believed the guard lists of whether there's any ... um crap ready evident et cetera so the women that I keep hearing from my end bought my Facebook page and it's full of women saying can cabin\nAnd certainly sensitivity toward women that have been victims of sexual thought that that this has just gotten to be on the plate\nPlane that being absurd and ridiculous\nA mellow gee I Wonder are you hearing the same thing you know in West Virginia the from from conservative women there are some polls I've seen where the engagement among women and I'll share this with you uh this is a ... a poll released yesterday\nEighty three percent of Republican women claim the midterms ... the term elections are very important that is a twelve percent increase\nThe same poll conducted in July so they're up ... Seventy nine percent of a democratic women are saying that it's very important so the Republican women seem to have an edge here what are you hearing military\nOn the area a lot from our men and women as well and the women haired our state and there's also have been a couple of posed down here just recently\nThat there was one that said there were sixty four percent of West Virginians that want Kavanaugh confirmed and then there's another one that says there's fifty three percent they can all come from so overwhelmingly for cap and all of our people say that the party of JFK has turned into Marlboro and that's exactly what's happened\nPeople are really livid over this and this is really about the Democrats trying to uh go back to the twenty sixteen election and try to cancel the election of Donald Trump and it's about roe versus Wade as well\nWhere military you also have Joe mansion as your senator in West Virginia or what do you make of his coming out and voting for cloture which indicates but doesn't always mean that uh he might support the Kavanaugh's nomination\nWell let me just found that senator Manchin like this if you like to play football you see somebody that that makes a taco well Joe Manchin doesn't have enough leadership that are left courage to make the taco joke imagine how long after taco\n... that that just exactly the way he's doing this he string and everybody along\nOkay well we'll see how he votes but this is um do you ginger how would I Want to go to you you're the Republican National committee woman from Georgia\n... are women at all seeing this as we heard Amy Schumer tried to frame this as we've heard so many Democratic senators tried to frame this as\nA vote for Kavanaugh is a vote against women vote against women who suffered some kind of abuse is that what your people are telling\nThe quite the opposite my people and not just melody said it not just women that men to that name like when I have had more women come up to me and say I was in\nThe Carter that baby or the other day and the checkout lady was so upset about it when they are saying that this is not\nGoing to it that we played the politics of gender and women against men at all in the ... and\nI'm a woman and I I it's been a front can aid that we ... it it just makes me very angry that they are trying to play this game and the women that I'm Talking to the right through it\nA five hour forty lord is the number I'm a ... and\nRight through it yep eight five five forty lord is the number I'm a ... and you know gender it's not only women\nI think you know learn I just talked so often about those men and women watching this I was I live in New Orleans and I was in New Orleans the other day and they had the TV on at a lunch spot I go to and this is not you know hardly a democratic or Republican spot it's a New Orleans about everybody's there\nAnd the conversation I overheard from mothers aunts sisters about ... and and many of them said look I I I don't I was against this guy's nomination but after watching the way he was treated\nI see oh my gosh this could be my husband my son my my my nephew\nBig see they've now it seems agenda fighting personalized the um attacks\nOn on Capitol and the [noise] the immorality of empty attacks that are just pounded in with no evidence Jody Smith give me your reaction to this you're the Indiana State director for the Susan B. Anthony List what have you seen\nAll week I can just absolutely agree with what everyone else is that we've knocked over four hundred thousand doors and Indiana\nAnd overwhelmingly we have support here for judge Kavanaugh I think what you said about people finally just getting sick to death we see a lot of people saying we were going to vote Democrat but we're changing our vote we can't believe these tactics\nI think that um the uh the adage of thing and I said before proven\nUm that you have to prove you're innocent says what has sparked people to be just outraged and America we believe in the bill of rights and the constitution and that means that you are innocent until you're proven guilty or not the opposite way\nAnd that's what's really sparked people to be angry and feeling as though this man is an utterly destroyed without any proof and it's changed their mind\nYou know you you see a lot of that and and I think um the ... again I think the American people at their core are fair beyond ideology beyond anything else they are fair minded people and had these allegations panned out\nHad a witness or corroborating evidence been produced they might have taken a very different view of this but the unrelenting a salt on this guy\nIn the face of no evidence at all I think that his outrage and let me tell you learned this the other day and we are in complete agreement I think\nWe may not be seeing the year of the woman this midterm election this could be the year of the man or the backlash demand where men come flooding the the voting booth because they think my gosh this is going to be meet tomorrow we're going to be right back happy very quickly just want to ask you this the polls are tightening\nUp between ... and a cinema\nIn I'm In Arizona you're there a forty five ... forty seven cinema could this\nTo the polls for ...\nWell I I helped settle on it it's all of that turnout if those who are concerned about having a part of an ... you got to get out there in a turnout on that or I think Kelly can land so we all have to pull together\nAll right we will leave with their latest please stay with us we're going to take a quick break them we'll get to all your calls eight five five forty ... the ... show continues Raymond ... sitting in for the great lady of course incremental tonight ten pm eastern on the Fox news show they\n\n\nWeigh three hundred and twenty nine pounds I Want to talk we map it I got an or four hundred it makes me not so hungry I started noticing more energy or noticed what do you were starting shrink searching we come off some towns I went for three thirty to forty five four fifty six year old guy to lose that much weight\nIt took something rather I feel I feel like I was when I was thirty five years old\nThat was Reuben now listen to what Josh says about Andrew four hundred\nMillion rabbits that really works it was in shape for the commercials for a decade other you know what I'm going to try it my parents were like falling off it really works about suits last year for my new job they're falling off all it's the same\nGuys if you moved belly fat gain energy strength and muscle and look and feel years younger trying enroll for hungry to see natural affordable way to boost your testosterone go to Andrew four hundred dot com or called eight eighty four hundred zero for three five eight eight eight four\nWell first and foremost diamond another five children and three daughters and I certainly would be a lot more I'm also the mother of friends\nAnd I would be very concerned about uh my daughter or son I'm telling the truth and making certain that they have the right to express themselves we hold certainly no ill feelings towards\nUm towards Christine Gregoire thank God for it but at the same time we've got to know that the truth matters and in Indiana votes have consequences you know we have a very tight Senate race here as well and when people choose to initially said either\nOh and when people choose to initially say they're going to vote for somebody because they are qualified are not qualified and then\nEvery five minutes the parameters change as to what we're utilizing to determine our vote people remember that and one of the the biggest things in Indiana that we're saying is\nMothers are concerned about their children that are going to be the next generation leaders ever being willing to run for anything I've talked to so many\nMillennials boys and girls are young men and young women\nThat are saying I never want to put my family or myself in that position you know how in the world is judge Kavanaugh holding up underneath all of this especially for his own family\nSo it's really it's fascinating to me that these women are making it about race when everybody involved in this particular incident as white\nEducated and an upper income so it's a doesn't make much sense to me that that's it's become about color it's become about\nUm women it really is as much about a judge Kavanaugh having the right to um have his innocence presumed before and they've proven guilty so that's\nLike that's where a lot of Indiana I think that's where a lot of voters in Americans come down there they they feel\n... that they didn't have a real strong feeling about Brecht coming on the same way the president said a ... up until we can go to knew he was but watching this play out watching that dramatic testimony seeing the accusations and the lack of evidence I think they come down to what you just mentioned\nIt seems a presumption of guilt and something else politics politics is overwhelming all of this is this ideological blood sport\nAnd a man's reputation whose family be damned we're going to take this nomination don't becomes the marching orders no matter what adult calls\nAnd I think the American people now are about to have a referendum on that idea that you can take down the political opponents at any cost with no evidence and shame destroyed his reputation for all time\nIn public and even force of a of\nA woman who's going through some sort of distress into the open to be used as your political weapon that I think you use the Americans will get back and go man this concerns me ginger I Want to ask\nYou um you you have a a big governor's race a hotly contested one in Georgia between sushi Abramson and Brian Kemp he's up the Republican brand company two points do you believe female conservatives are going to rally there in that governors\nYes I did and I think this cabin on hearing is going to really play into that because it's making when I\nWas really upset that people are playing that the women against man card and I'm Stacey Abrams is a woman\nBut Brian count is at a conservative man who stands for our conservative principles personal responsibility limited government and lower taxes all the things that we\nAre that's our party is all about so I really do think and I think just in the last week or so across this date people are more motivated than ever now to get out get out and that and not only that but volunteer\nThat I was at the camp campaign the other day people were coming in to get yard signs and the topic of the conversation was exactly what we're talking about the Kavanaugh hearings and how we see this politics being played out and they'll they they are really playing dirty the leftist playing dirty and people don't want to see this they really are discouraged\nNo no I I you know as I look out and watches it it does have all the markings of the last presidential election where we saw a lot of drama for the cameras celebrities coming out now we've had walkouts in protests and signs in confrontations with senators and these dramatic moments\nAt the same time in coffee shops\nFactories in the school on to pick up the kids if you listen closely you're hearing something very different this same dynamic I think as we're propelled Trump into office and it was that kind of well he calls it the silent majority\nI'm my sense is working Americans\nAnd Americans are not by nature political activists they don't get out in March the working there working the privately have their views about politics that they spread over the dinner table or to their families ... occasionally to their friends but it's not something you go to war over\nAnd today in Washington I have to tell you\nI've seen friendship shattered people simply you don't talk to each other\nAnd it's all about politics it's because they they disagree politically and it's become an ugly violent thing where once was dialogue to try to convince the other person to your point of view today is slash smashing destroyed\nAnd I don't think Americans particularly women really want that now their core group I think who do and we've seen them in the street\nBut moms wives working women I I I don't think it's where they live I'm going to give a quick round Robin we're going to go through everybody again a starting with military Potter of from the Virginia Republican Party in West Virginia are your thoughts on we're we might be headed here in these midterms\n[noise] I think that are due to the situation with this nomination of a a very very qualified a judge the Supreme Court I think that the Republicans are energized to get out and vote\nA for Republicans conservative Republicans that will support President Trump's agenda and I think the Democrats were also get out and vote the right way to for people because West Virginia's counties there's fifty five of them\nAnd all fifty five went for Trump and the election\nSo that meant and twenty six so that means that we'd had Democrat vote as well\nAnd I believe that the Democrats also are or we're going to get out and vote for Republicans this time so I think that that everything's looking good and we love our country and we want to protect our country so and I'm going to spend every last minute I can a federal last breath\nTrying to stand up for what's right for our country\nOkay well I don't want you to do that for a military we now we need you in December so hang it may\nBe my last breath I'm so busy [laughter]\nWell you keep going great to talk to you junior high our last word do you um you're you're the you're in Georgia in the Republican Party in Georgia or given this enthusiasm we're seeing given the cabin all fight in the in the way it's being processed by voters what impact will end up in the midterms\nI ... I think it is energizing new voters more and I also think that people that were kind of neutral and on the fence that were energized about mid term because a lot of times people don't get excited about the terms I think we're going to see it where you've heard a lot about the blue wave I Believe the red way is going to comment and people are\nSick and tired of being bullied around and they're going to stand up for their freedom so we love our country we care about our country and those people are going to come out of the woodwork and I think it's going to be a ... it's not just going to be a way it's going to be a ... and people are going to a shot shock and awe as what I predict\n... a Judy Smith I'm I'm going to end with you you know Republicans are really bad at telling their story I always critique them so there's the the\nRepublicans are really bad at telling their story I always critique them so there's that they can't tell a story to save their life\nIn this instance the Democrats gave them a dramatic story that ended up breaking their way how we'll display the drama the intimacy and the projection I think many voters are are are engaged in as they project themselves on to a cabin on his family and what they've been through\nWhile I agree with what the other gal that sat in Indiana we love our country and we were first on the board for Trump remember that Mike Pence says it's a law in Indiana\nAnd we are here to say that we support U.S Supreme court justices supports the constitution or the United states a living breathing document and for that reason because we are so strong we also will support a senator\nThat well I'm actually beat the incumbent because he is an outsider because he is conservative and because he will stand for the values that hunters bully then\nSo we believe that we're so we're going to see a red wave a red suit in our state of voters that come out but never have before just as we saw during the Trump race where people voted for the very first time in their lives\nAnd we're looking for um these numbers to begin changing and that Donnelly will pay quite a price for his stand and saying that it could change its mind remember that he was voted the most ineffective senator in the Senate he could still change his mind and turn around but at the votes against a\nSupreme Court nomination I think that he will see that that he gave us a gift in the state of Indiana because people are going to rally to the cause\nErnes and were never charged for no other bills are accurate\nFive hundred of these revolutions\nFrom the mid ... mall\nBuddy bought one advantage I Am [noise]\nBuild up for their vote I'm Pam who sell Fox News from the Supreme Court to Capitol Hill thousands of people are protesting the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh hours before the Senate holds a final vote on his confirmation ...

stimulation\nTechniques including the patients that had the problem playing the violin but can do it now even better than anybody a great story naturally\nNow I Want to ask you when you update on with like an update or on the stimulation of the spinal cord and patients who have been been paralyzed and potentially a can get some return to function\nYes you know this is another technology that we've been working on here at the Mayo Clinic for about four years from now or within growing this ... program slowly and I'm I'm very happy to report that this is another technology that is emerging to be very powerful\nIn addition it is also allowing us some interesting understanding of how volition or control of movement happens that what that means is\nHow does the brain control our limbs voluntarily so this is a finding that was just reported in nature medicine yes that that that's correct so maybe I can tell you a little bit of background on this so\nAbout four years ago that the Reggie accurate ten antitrust who's the hockey my had 'em published a paper very interesting paper where they implanted patients at that time about for patients\nWhere they implanted patients at that time about four patients where at the ... simulation below the level of the spinal cord injury could cause voluntary movement back in the lower extremities\nChatter epidural means uh above the door or soda so then the jury is the outer coating around despite all\nThat's correct yeah so this is technology that is essentially the same as\nWhat we use for our pain patients under the skin but outside of the spinal cord outside of the spinal cord but just outside of the covering up the spoken word OK so these are actually surgical implants and what's been demonstrated with these devices and pain patients\nIs that they can help with pain so this is already approved by the FDA for pain that what that for a ... and ... group did was to now apply this technology and spinal cord injured patients who've been paralyzed for example with a thoracic were\nUm childcare has level and complete motor and censoring meaning they can't move their legs or sense there is no sensation\nSo when that paper came out that you can get movements we were very excited about it because this really changes our whole view of what we can do for our spinal cord injured patients mhm\nSo we'd teamed up with Dr ... group and decided can we replicate those studies and so initially the all of this study which is male I already approved investigation all of review board approved as well as the U.S FDA\nTo do this study and so we've implanted now true patience under this study and this paper that is um ... being reported in nature medicine\nDemonstrates that indeed what was found was true but we actually went beyond that replication\nSo the reputation portion of it we actually already published in Mayo Clinic proceedings last year and this was really exciting because our results come from the findings of that sort of Suzie how come on and rich you had written\nSo that was exciting but when we discovered is that we could actually go beyond that finding and in this paper what we demonstrated that the patient it now is able to stand\nAnd take independence steps now he's still requires a Walker because he has no sensation still but he is strong enough now to to control his legs and make movements are stepping movements\nAt is an incredible story now when the word gets out as an every paraplegic in the country going to want this\nWell you know this is still very early stage research like I said this is only one patient that we have reported in nature and medicine and so what I Would say is this one study really challenges what we used to think what is possible\nFor treatment of patients with spinal cord injury\nBut you know as a neurosurgeon I often see these patients and emergency room after the trauma\nAnd you can imagine how devastating such an injury is but I think what our study shows is that there is this tremendous hope and being able to regain some of that function so you you're regaining function which are not able to cure\nOr fix the fact that they are paraplegic\nYes now what is really interesting about this study is that the patient is actually able to control his legs again\nWow and that's why this is such a powerful study and I believe why the reviewers and nature medicine which is one of the top journals in medicine I'm accepted this publication\nSo let me ask you if if someone comes into the emergency room and they have cut an or in the armor their leg we can so it back together and they get at least some return to function why is it that the spinal cord seemed to have no ability whatever to repair so you know that's an\nExcellent question and we believe the reason is because while the nerves those are ... on the earth and we know that there was profound arch can re grow but the spinal cord is our central nervous system and unfortunately with central nervous system when that system has caught the those nerves to not re grow\nWhat we believe in this case though is that the question then is how does the information from the brain that wants to move to a leg\nRegained that function mhm we do not believe that the nurse has ... I we do not think that's how this works but rather that during the trauma there's probably enough connections that are not functioning enough\nBut that epidural stimulation allows the south that's dormant\nTo be able to once again we gain its ability to get the command from the brain\nIncredible that you hope and suspect that some day people who are paraplegic or even quadrupled don't skip a paraplegic right now the lower extremities paralyzed will someday be able to walk\nThat's precisely what this patient did\nThat we have reported in um in nature medicine where is research headed you know I I think now this is opening up a whole new direction and research for spinal cord injury you know before\nThere's been tremendous amount of research effort and funding that went into trying to re grow those axon now what I think will happen is that the research will be in these type of new devices how do we now take this finding\nWhich used a device that wasn't even intended for this purpose now all of the things that we have discovered in this study how then can we take that take a step back and re engineered the device specifically for this purpose of ... animation in spinal cord injured patients\nDoes there have to be a different type of approval by the FDA for this absolutely\nAnd the ... and that's why I think we are indeed very early infant stages of this technology incredible stories\nAlready ... he is a neurosurgeon and director of Mayo collects neural engineering laboratory thanks so much for being with us\nThank you citing exciting stuff thanks a lot\nStill to come a Mayo Clinic radio will learn more about the spinal cord injury research from the rehabilitation point of view\nAnd later on in the program we'll hear about the important role volunteers play had Mayo Clinic\nOnce you hear and see more male clinic radio subscribed to the Mayo Clinic radio podcast on iTunes or your favorite podcast provider or check out some more than two hundred Mayo Clinic radio segments on video now available on you to\nHave a health related question do you like us to answer or a topic you'd like to cover [noise] you can tweet us at a time at hashtags Mayo Clinic radio or send us an email at Mayo Clinic news network at Mayo died he\nTo you but you can put the employer it in but that it won't do any good if you don't have the therapy\nWe that's our theory that has yet to be proven as well but um and we know physical therapy itself wasn't cancer so we had the implant and we added to therapy and assimilation together and we got these miraculous results\nUm what goes on from here is a little tricky\nBecause number one like I said this is not the standard of care for someone who has a completely I'm a severe spinal cord injury so to be able to send this individual out to the clinic now without the standard of care would be tricky because our clinicians don't know how to manage just leave me later in conjunction with a therapy which we feel is really really valuable\nSo we're at the point with this trial where we're really trying to integrate the home exercise program by identifying activity that have been really proven safe impossible for the individual to do on their own at home with minimal assisted devices\nAnd then let them do that stuff at home on their own um and then and then it it's our job to figure out you know who is this appropriate when is it appropriate if it is appropriate and how to implement into standard of care\nJoe how many patients who have had to stimulate are now at our our president going through the therapy and ... what are the things that they're actually able to do that they couldn't do before\nSo we're on our second subject right now are patients so even wrote to 'em we have some\nResearch funding to hopefully continue into a new protocol that will be very similar but will allow us to enroll additional subjects\nI'm right now the subject I'm the first subject is able to um [noise] you know stand alone for a long period of time he's able to 'em and wheelchair bound before yes\nUm he's able to walk 'em or independently step on a treadmill and also over ground with a Walker\nSo he has some assistance obviously to help him you know their weight on his legs but he's able to um\nAs Megan described volition only move his legs when he wants so on command so that's really the exciting part is\nIs where where we can go from here now that improved bladder and ball function for him\nWe've had some anecdotal improvements although um we didn't measured those things directly so\nI'm at this point um our next studies were going to do more um data collections which we hope will help inform whether there's actual return of of bowing bladder um but they do report I'm kind of a shorter bowel um time so that's a good thing\nAnd we just don't have evidence yet you're working with a second patient is it's very similar to what the first patient ones are are known to patients the same [laughter] you know to me since I was saying [laughter]\nSo how do we go from one or two individuals to millions because we know they're somewhere between five and six million people out there who have spinal cord injuries maybe not complete partial ... how do we were we go from here how can we get this technology moves to\nMarry for five million you ask [laughter] so I think\nMegan alluded to this earlier and we've probably both looted too you know one thing we need is obviously to gain additional\nResearch support money to do this work and to keep this team moving forward I think one of the other critical questions is you know which patients will respond to this therapy and which ones will not so can we come up with a way\nOf saying you know out of the millions of patience you know the these people were spawn and knees won't so that we don't try to deliver a therapy that's not going to be\nA successful finally do you believe that some day paralysis won't be permanent for all patients\nWhile we're definitely making a term because we used to just talk about how do we compensate for the deficits their existing for this population and now we're talking about how to recover and how do we make narrow parts of the occur in the central nervous system so\nWe're definitely making a change in the progress of how we're managing and dealing with spinal cord injuries but there's still a lot of work to be done\nFor you made so much progress sold so far and is there are citing technology and he's also such great work and we wish you the very best of luck thank you [noise]\nWe've been talking about the final quarter stimulation the role of rehabilitation without the Christians out from the Mayo Clinic assistive and restores the technology laboratory the for profit [laughter] and I are political therapists leg and be able to tell us ring whether\nWere going to take a short break and when we come back we'll learn about the many jobs being done by male clinic volunteers [noise] you're listening to Mayo political radio and the Mayo Clinic or less what [noise]\nPolicy that you buy American General life insurance company Houston, Texas had available in
