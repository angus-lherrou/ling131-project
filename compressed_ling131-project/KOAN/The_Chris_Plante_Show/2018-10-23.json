who end of the country should be based on merit we should be selective on who comes to the country with regard to those who come across the border\nI Would say look you want to keep people together and keep families together do it do it within twenty four hours and send them back and the thing is is we have an immigration office apply to come in\nAs far as refugee status what we've done is we've taken away all the rules claim to be a refugee none of the rules apply\nSo typically if you come in here and you can legally immigrate there are some decent prohibitions on getting on welfare\nYou know and getting on government assistance\nIf you're a refugee apparently all those things go out the window so everybody knows that when you come he claimed to be a refugee so you can get on welfare and get into government housing and this is something that should change I'm fine with ... we can absorb people if they want to come and more\nEach year\nPeople that we can admitted to the country and how many we need and will make that decision each year but uh we can't allow just people just to to come across the border by the thousands\nI'm Talking to Rand Paul here on the lower income shows Senator Paul what do you think um are the most important issues facing the country today given everything that we're seeing all the great\nAdvancement we've made in the economy the Republicans are leading by a historic margin in the handling the economy Seventeen point advantage in trade and the new NBC Wall Street Journal poll a those two issues are are massive plus it's for the Republicans in in a tough midterm cycle cycle normally\nNow what do you see especially coming from the Kentucky perspective\nI think the good news is overwhelming and often obscured by the media you know he often being carried away with all the Trump range meant said grow\nThe good news is overwhelming we have an economy growing at just an amazing pays\nOver four percent annual growth unemployment at historic lows the main thing I see is I go round Kentucky when I talked to plant manager says they said we have a shortage of workers a shortage of people who are drug free with work ethic and so the answer here is this is a time before but this is a time when we should convert\nOr work programs and our welfare programs to hey there's a job down the street programs and I think if we were able to do that\nYou know we have a great future coming ahead and most of it's because this is what Republicans off in the Washington don't get they keep calling it tax reform and the president directs them no it was a tax cut a significant tax cut will return money\nTo his rightful owner leaves the money in the private marketplace and guess what the private marketplace will boom when you leave money in the private marketplace and so\nAll of that has been great and I don't think we can emphasize it enough and I think in the election if they come to fruition that not only the cabin on the side of the Republican base but there are reports that early voting in seven out of eight states that are reporting\nWhere people can uh decide how many a Republican and how many are Democrats the Republicans are are in a big upsurge with oh you're voting\nYeah which is is is you know music to my ears because Tom Styron Soros and others have really funneled an enormous amount of money into voter registrations on college campuses which are overwhelmingly I'm moving to the Democrat Party or Senator Paul why should Americans\nCare about this Saudi killing of this Jamal ... who ah was living in the United states he was or was he he was\nPreviously kind of a sympathized with the Muslim Brotherhood and he you know he was mourning the death of bin Laden although he thought bin Laden went off the wrong track and got to radicalize spent media had been tied up on this story for you know a couple of weeks now\nI Would say that ah the killing of cars showed me by the Saudis is just one more incidents of things that they do that are not good for America that's been over a hundred billion dollars over the last several decades a supporting the drop is around the world\nThat teach hatred of Christianity Judaism and Hindus they're over ten thousand ... is in Pakistan supported by them\nThe ... network which is a group of\nA bad actors in Pakistan that attack our soldiers in Afghanistan they all the leaders of it went to um to draw a funded by Saudi Arabians Saudi Arabians fund addresses in Indonesia that used to have a relatively moderate form of Islam is a big Islamic nation\nBut there there's a growing faction of of those who now believe in violence against civilians taught by the Saudis so the Saudis are bad they have been doing this for decades and we sort of turn a blind I'd say it's all Iran Iran Iran we have to support the south is\nI'm not so sure that the Saudis are less evil than the uranium to tell you the truth the war in Yemen is going to drag us into another war in the middle east thousands of civilians are being killed\nSo the killing of the journalist I Would say is just one more item of bad action by Saudi Arabia but Saudi Arabia sent arms by the hundreds of tons of it into Syria\nTo al ... an al ... they they they supported the worst and most extreme elements of the Sunni extremists in the Syrian civil war so I Can't think of a reason why we shouldn't be hopping mad about this but what I've advised as we should quit selling them arms or should quit aiding and abetting them\nIn what they're doing throughout the middle east and the world\nWell the administration and the president himself yesterday said you know they're and they're important partners of ours so in the middle east is that not the case I mean they've actually assistant American interest in the middle east is specifically obviously with Iran which still is the largest state sponsor of terrorism\n[noise] [noise] yeah but I Would call the Saudis the largest state sponsor of radical Islam you know they really teach it throughout the world the people who came attacked us on nine eleven ... Iranians they were Saudis if you really look at worldwide terrorism is the Saudis and their form of ... is that is being sent an export around the world\nSo uh as far as arms they by sort of are I'm sure but I don't think the armed our military arms are or something like any other private entity like widgets or whatever\nAre armed or something unique we paid for by the taxpayer F. sixteen is not something that we could get jobs by selling F. sixteen to China or Russia I Would still be against it because I'm not\nI don't see our arms trade as jobs program it's about our national defence and I think selling arms the Saudis\nActually puts it I said at greater risk it increases or risk that Yemen is going to devolve into chaos and like Libya before it in Syria and Iraq before that chaos is where terrorists breed so if we want to stop terrorists we need to quit aiding and abetting the Saudis and creating chaos\nOr a ... who's the Saudi foreign minister responded to your uh view on the show you down and he said this\nI find it very surprising that some of these thousand miles away from anything that happens [laughter] miles away [laughter] no access to information\nAnd these two of us in defense of miles away no access information or intelligence or this is a judgment call them the part that senator of all this is not just based on the notion Suzie some speculation\nI take a swing it that\nA lot to excited to be lectured by some autocrats from a dictatorship you know the Saudis have three thousand people in prison right now without trial so he says oh we should presumed the crown prince to be innocent until otherwise proven or like a three thousand people in your country that you get locked up in jail and you don't give a trial too\nSo I think it's pretty galling for him to take western standards our western standards of presumption of innocence and say oh you need to presume the crown prince to innocent\nIt's a dictatorship nothing happens over there without the crown prince begins all the Fifteen people that were involved with killing and disband bring this journalist apparently many of them are hench bend the travel with a crown prince when he travels\nIt goes up to two people who they are punished but now it's been being fired to chop ups or to the chopping up in the December him and other journalists\nAnd you get fired my guess is they're uh they're banished met will be in royal exile somewhere with lots of money the lower level people they will probably executed an outlet talk to anyone because they would probably implicate the crown prince and as so no I'm not too excited it'd be lectured by these people\nA Rand Paul here on the ...

everything the very well coordinated they had a coordinated message a very\nVery very few of them you're off that message because there was leadership within the group\nYou know I speak Spanish so I Know what's going on around me and and and thank God I had you know you will catch people in the light OK move this way don't talk to reporters right now we're moving forward cat that said that and I said what\nOrders right now we're moving forward chat this said that\nAnd I said well you told me a minute ago you didn't have a leader in the group but demand up ahead is actually telling you guys what do you know so I'm assuming if you're a leader oh no no no no we don't have any leaders we don't have any leaders I'd go up and talk to the gentleman no no we're just trying to keep moving forward I said well you guys have matching backpacks you had\nYou know the flag of Honduras at the front of your group nobody in the group actually looked that tired or hungry um I was told by one of the people in the groups that they did have some bussing\nThat people were in the villages and they heard it by word of mouth or is that they heard the news\nAh that they were coming to America to look for jobs\nThis is about poverty so very well coordinated effort according to the intelligence officials on the ground there are groups actually organizing this I'm In Honduras or remember there's and you know a lot about this or is there is a big battle here in a politically between the various ah conservative\nOr a government and uh the socialist government so there is some suspicion that a socialist groups in Honduras along with a you know open borders society and others there's a lot of talk about that here has been coordinating to do this march so that it would coincide with the U.S\nA elections a mid term elections and create a lot of a political fodder to the United states and here in Central America\n[noise] one thing that I I find to be very disturbing are the ah are those who are facilitating this dangerous situation\nFor children and women along the way a and these are people with flatbed trucks\nOn these groups in the United states who are sending immigration lawyers down to\nCoach these are individuals or they did that in the last caravan ah they're doing in this in this other one in and others as you pointed out on their way or if something is done to stop the civil be well they're not a Sarah\nA group of thousands every week coming into your into our borders ...\nAbsolutely ... absolutely Lori this is not stopping I mean what I was down at the border and it was a very precarious situation you know there were so many men it was it was it was it was a bit dangerous I mean there was some concern among the intelligence officials there\nOh you brought up such a great point um that the women and children that were a part of these caravans the big first wave and the second wave that were put in the front of the lines are basically for the media are in danger\nAre in danger every second that they are traveling with these groups are according to what a mall and officials apparently a child a baby I'm with trampled on when they first the first part of that second wave rushed through uh the border and the baby was killed\nNow remember their intelligence apparatus has people embedded in these caravans to to try to gather information to find out what's going on here who's coordinating this\nThey talked about this baby that died that was trampled to death when his mother was knocked down to the ground or the baby was buried apparently asked by some of those leadership within the group to take the baby away and buried the baby so that\nThe Guatemalan government wouldn't have any access to the body\nOr one of the reasons uh the government or wanted to know and obviously wanted to bring justice to the child's life with so that they could charge people that were coordinating this group with either manslaughter murder or because it's just becoming a really dangerous situation for the people that are moving forward\nAnd for the United states and our us southern border and this is extraordinarily dangerous and a big problem for us because some of the people within these groups\nAre not just regular farm workers are people for villages that are hard working people um there are good people in these groups I think they've been used and they're being used\nBy these coordinator but there are some as Thirteen gay members there is some pretty bad guys and these groups to um we know that from seeing their tattoos from talking to them while I was down on the border I'm definitely gang affiliated people so we're we're not what we're seeing here is people being abused and use\nBy these organizers by these governments\nAnd I I'm telling you there are people within the ... I'm Honduran government socialist political activists political groups that are helping with this coordination and they're presenting a huge problem or not just for for for our country but for their own people as they make their way down here I Know there's more ways that people\nReady to move forward because remember once they get this thing started once the ... yeah ... there's no way to stop it it's a snowball effect and people will just all of Eric ... going to let us into a country and they coached them my coach them a credible fear\nCredible fear this is what you need to say when you get to the border this is how you say in America\nAnd it's just a it's just a game I mean it's just you say a few lines and then you released to the piece of paper\nAnd a judge shows an old women and children separately you can't keep it keep them longer than twenty days and then they're off to the races and it's and it's pretty much over and I think a lot of these democratic socialist organizations in the United states know that once they get into the country\nThose new you know temporary you know migrants or whatever the provisional status they get\n... feel like a done of gratitude to the left and be ... Democrats if they ever get amnesty that's what they want then there's a demographic shift in the country that is you retrieve ... for Republicans in irreversible\nBecause of the sheer numbers\nYet a great point I mean it which is the reason we've seen some of those reports coming out of California at other parts of the country where we've seen that illegal to have voted right uh and and there was this shit and there's a ship and if they become citizens of course there's another shift\nA one of the interesting things I spoke with a uh somebody from immigration and Customs Enforcement of the United states and part of what they're seeing is\nIs that for example men will take young girls\nYou know the ... the the under Eighteen or children and the women will take the boys because once they reach the border\nAnd if the you know as as a mother says well I don't have the father they can't really separate the child from the mother so that they just released them into the U.S with a return to court date so we're seeing the catch and release still on going\nOh we have men who have little girls they know they can't put them in a holding facility with other men because they've got to a child they kept separate them so they release them\nSo we're still seeing the same problems that we've seen for years\nHappening right now and the president you know President Trump is\nIs very adamant about the fact like look you guys can't control your borders we're going to pull aid or the ... the complexity here is that\nOkay we understand that but our borders are being overrun too so I think the most important thing we can do\nFor the United states where the Guatemalan government even with in Honduras right now for the hundred and government that's working against some of the socialist a a aspects of their of their country a political an apparatus is to actually find out who is funding this is any us money from USAID going\nIt is to actually find out who is funding this\nIs any with money from us aid going to find these groups\nThat are coordinating the separate than we really start putting the funding and we really need to hold people accountable because what we have is a caravan of people there as well with children and women although those numbers are a lot smaller uh from what I've seen than the men that are coming across and saying\nWe're going to charge you were going to find a way to stop this we're going to pull that funding from from USAID a groups that are that are actually assisting and that's a caravan and we're going to hold people responsible for the people that guy along the track because believe me young women are being raped\nA there is a lot of concern with ... with children are being uh exposed to this type of reading us care of this walk put on the back of cars so people should actually be charged for this and held accountable if they're not\nI'm afraid that this is going to continue we really need to expose doing this and what's going on\nNow well again you follow the money\nSomeone's paying the fuel for these trucks someone's paying for the\nUh the food the accommodations not everybody's sleeping on the floor every night you don't you can't move this ... this number of people without an organization behind you you cannot just now I don't care what people like it would be the equivalent of walking from Boston to San Francisco\nWith a with a three year old child I don't think so you're getting ... you're you're getting help along the way for various organizations and people and the United states has

tutor for the country\nWell when you ah Josh look at uh the rest of America right now it seems that\nThe support for Donald Trump is growing you sent its highest point in his presidency which is stunning given how perpetually negatives\nThe press is I mean it is a negative drumbeat coming out of almost every mainstream media outlet even with that he's at forty seven percent which is higher than bronco bomber was\nA how important is the president in this race for you\nTo report you know Missouri voted for Donald Trump by almost twenty points\nOn that though that is a huge huge margin\nIn Missouri which is still a swing state and it's because people wanted what they want a strong America I mean people voted to rebuild our country that's what they were voting for much they\nWhen they voted for President Trump and his policies are rebuilding the country under good from Missouri You know we've got our lowest unemployment rate it decades and the state of Missouri job growth finally hitting new highs we've got blue collar economic growth job growth of the highest point in the\nNineteen eighties in the state rural unemployment slow so we're finally starting to get those jobs back from overseas your wages grow but here's what scared folks up a Democrat Claire McCaskill want to take all that away throw it all and reverse reversal of the games and then go back to the policy of weakness\nOverseas weakness on our border and the you know we just can't have that that's what this election is about\nJosh how has these if at all these undercover videos of Claire McCaskill Harris her and her staff is that\nResonated at all what the voters where people are are saying that work for a while we have to kind of lie to the voters we can't really say what we really mean about a various issues\nThough I think it's that usually resident and you know the people to pay to to have a politician especially lifetime politician like Claire McCaskill the one thing to their faith in the open up behind their back into the sea Claire McCaskill on tape\nSaying that she wants to take away the second amendment right now he's a constitutional rights\nBut the belong to people by virtue of our constitution to hear her talk about I was to take those away from all by citizens here her staff talk about\nFeeling the donations from Planned Parenthood and other extremist abortion groups to talk about the fact that well you know the McCaskill really agrees with Brock Obama on everything but she won't say that publicly because\nYou know Missouri voters are are so close minded I mean that's essentially what our staff was caught thing over and over and over again\nIt's it's really the condescension the contempt for everyday voter is really remarkable and people are tired of that they want somebody who believes in the state who is not ashamed of our way of life in this state and it's going to go represented\nA Josh ah when you look at the makeup of the Democrat Party today the perpetual mob mentality that seems to be encouraged and even\nCelebrated or by some of their top leaders or how does this you know I mean it seems like maybe it's just a big cities and this is happening it's not so much and\nAnd you know in in places like Missouri but it it it's covered a lot in certainly certainly at Fox and other networks is that on people's minds the president says mobs not jobs ah and it seems like people just want things to calm down in government to work for them\nYou know I think that's absolutely true in Missouri or you know I I think that what the Democrats have on offer what Claire McCaskill's offered chaos at home and weakness abroad and this this model behavior it it is chaos of it is ...\nAnd I think with folks watch mobs driving people out of restaurants screaming them down and public banging on the doors of the U.S Supreme Court and shouting obscenities I mean this is\nBanging on the doors of the U.S Supreme Court and shouting obscenity is I mean this is not the United states of America or this is not\nCivil democratic discourse I'm all for strong disagreement that's great that's the first amendment but\nTo try and shut down speech and harassed intimidating even use violence against people I mean and have Hillary Clinton as you say Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder out they're encouraging it is Claire McCaskill you don't see is he's going right along with it I mean she is happy to see these ... employed\nThat is not what the people in my state voted for that that is not who we are as Americans\nAre Josh I'm the concern I think a lot of a conservative\nReligious voters have is the\nSocial transformation of the country the\nThe idea that gender is something that is changeable and uh that you know that we should really celebrate the things in public schools and and obviously the conscience rights and the religious rights of many say that's not what we believe we love all people but that's not what we believe\nHow ... how are the social issues playing in your state this election cycle\nYou know the Missourians are leaving the constitution and they believe in the first amendment first and then the guarantees the freedom of religion\nOr to purchase to individual you know this was something wrong but the most of my career of all the politics your\n... on I Know you're doing out there\nYeah yeah but most of my career as a constitutional lawyer and as a religious liberty lawyer and your other people said they are a fair minded people\nAh they you know we don't discriminate against anybody based on their religious views but you know what we believe in the importance of value of faith and we believe that the importance of value of family and community thinks built around\nFaith in churches in our houses of worship and we want to see those protected and I think they have the again the left wing agenda which has become so hostile\nTo people of faith a so hospitals are religious liberties just like a hospital who are stuck in a minute right just like a ... a free speech I mean think about it what what the the left wing agenda really offered to\nYou know you agree with us or you shut up\nInto that it's just not what the people of ice they want people to country\nI'll tell you Josh why I think that Missourians are going to do the right thing and vote for you or met many reasons obviously substantive reasons I mean you have the right views on critical issues from crime to the economy and immigration and so forth\nBut I'll tell you why I think you're going to win is because the New York times is already writing ridiculous articles\nAbout about your office in turmoil first of all you show me an office that doesn't have personality conflicts and and ah and people moving in and out and departures and so forth\nBut it's this is the best that they can do with you that oh well we had a leader of a surprising number of ... perching departing staff from the attorney general's office\nI started reading this today and I was screaming laughing because it just like they can say that about pretty much everybody I Know his office\n[laughter] well we are definitely getting the Donald Trump treatment I Love your time from the liberal yeah the state and\nI Do I wear a badge of honor I mean you know and I by the way I'm not going to apologize but all for taking up government bureaucracy that when I came to office I was on the first Republican uh twenty five years\nOf the office needed to be shake it up it needed to be made more efficient it needed to be a ... that's what we did and you know what a great results but I don't care if the New York times likes it or not I promised I Would do this but the people with very I've done exactly what I said I Would do and that's where all the other two\nYeah mom I I just think it's I mean as someone who has been written about so much Josh I'm and you don't eat just gotten a little taste of it compared to me\nBut I read these things I read them much differently than most people I just read between the lines like oh okay uh-huh mhm yeah right now anyway I I think that is the best news this article is like the best news I read about you\nAre so now I I like you even more a Josh I'm I'm Glad you're not running in two states Illinois Missouri obviously I Know you're running from Missouri uh but uh I'm we wish you the very best I Know the president came earlier in the month", "show_name": "The Chris Plante Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Anchorage", "day": "23"}
