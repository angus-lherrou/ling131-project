a I keep thinking about the uh I guess it's an old who song right if they if you let them do it to you got yourself to blame 'em by my to my mind what's happened here in part and only in part was directed\nPersonally at Kavanaugh my my take on it is that the overarching purpose of this\nIs the into roar um effect that it creates for conservatives and and maybe not just conservatives but anybody who doesn't\nA toll on the line of the new empowered progressive Democrats basically they are telling you\nThat if you try to crash or party this is the kind of thing we're going to do to you and I think the only way to combat that is to fight it aggressively and make sure the people who pulled that uh have to be held to account if you if we just getting a crouch\nAnd let them keep doing it to us there won't be any us left because no good people will want to get into politics\nAnd I I really mean this is not just someone from ... coming from someone who supported the president in the campaign but coming from a a lawyer and a longtime conservative like myself\nI really believe Trump sought the Republican how to fight I mean it's not going to simple formulation but\nFor a long time Republicans were just taking it and they were afraid they were all just like they were all like in an elevator and on any longer I've never seen Mitch McConnell cite harder than he fought for this nomination\nIt well I think he's showing Trump is showing that this is what people have wanted all along and look at this sometimes the ... the president I think goes way overboard and makes me cringe but if I go into my head if I have to pick\nI Want somebody who's going to fight than somebody who's not and if that means is going to be access from time to time then you know then there's going to be accessed from time to time\nBut I think he's showing that there's a hunger on our side to not just stand in a defensive crouch and keep taking the step with which we've been doing for years\nWell I think it's important that we have McConnell out their Lindsey Graham John Cornyn or even been fast talking about the mob mentality that we can't become a ... a country by mob rule where people are afraid to go to restaurants\nYep [noise] yeah and I and I think Laura that if you don't raise the stuff\nAnd turn it into an issue particularly one more on the cusp of an election\nYou don't have a compelling way after the election to say that you know this was on the table for people to consider and you have a mandate now to stop it because people voted against it so I think this not only has to be fought but it has to be heat up\nA as an election issue and frankly it helps the Republicans to tear it up because\nI I've seen you say this where are you know on television and heard you on the radio said a million times\nOrdinary people commonsense people do not like the stuff I mean they see these these Olin ski I direct action tactics and they say you know there's some parts of this\nAgenda that I may agree with but these tactics are not America and and I don't think that's the America anybody wants who sensible\nNow and again people like Feinstein who looks he's a liberal but she was fairly well respected until I think the last you know\nA couple of years where she's been especially last year was she's really been pushed left I mean she because of course their primary

you know he was amazing by the way but you know then ... will be back in back right now the I'm\nGoing to ask an unpleasant question what is this nomination goes down this week and what would you advise the White House what should be the next step here a blitzkrieg very quick nomination if someone else or should they or someone suggested doubled down on cabinet and ride it all the way to the

people just go ahead sorry go ahead any\nYou know I I Would just have to ask the smart political people is there someone that we can get done before the midterms and if there's not that I think you have to double down on Kavanaugh on say you\nKnow if if you vote Republican and we get we get a a a majority in the Senate or then we're going to nominate ... cabin all over again you know turn it into an election issue but I don't know the politics of it well enough\nTo let ... giving you the big thumbs up when you said that the that you're thinking you go to Andy ... is a legal\nYeah but you know he's a legal eagle he's always law\nYou know constitutional law but you you know you can be a political a political consultant if you want to and actually be a good one handy because that's exactly it's just like what they should have done with Obamacare Mitt Romney remember when he announced the Obamacare is a law passed\nIn twenty well Romney kind of just drop dead after he did his soap box a thing on the the hardware store like one of his eye sockets they just drive shouldn't take it out all across the country instead it's going to destroy your health\nCare and that would have been a great issue for him and he ended up this is a this is a great issue for the Republican\nYeah well I'm going to go from the who the Clint Eastwood and say a man's gotta know limitations um [laughter] I don't know that I'm the political guy or other you\nKnow that's all right the mansion as he asked for cloture ending debate or so it's like Murkowski isn't no it was just I don't know about my ... this is why the whole family dynasty of senators has got to ... the idea that just because\nThat's why the whole family dynasty of senators has got the ... the idea that just because your

Jeff Kevin no object like a Brett Kavanaugh\nThe question remains is this really a referendum we're seeing and is that what this mid term is shaping up to be a referendum on due process\nThe fair treatment of a nominee and innocent until proven guilty we will talk panels conservative women about that coming up and minutes and I want you to be part of that conversation to eight five five forty Laura let's go to Tony you wanted to say what Tony in New York\nWere going to keep showing up and no\nHow this goes they cannot keep us down we will win\nAbout saying women don't matter [noise]\n\nLet's say [noise]\n\nKnow maybe in the box\nOffice poison and occasional fickle\nFar vote for cabinet quota tree she's a voter games when the what we're gonna talk to someone and\nHow this is playing across the country not only the way it's been framed\nThe theatrics around it the paid lobbyists stopping in confronting senators in the hallways\nBlocking elevators and yelling at them saying you you don't you hate abused women and you ... you're disrespecting me look me in the ... um I Want to see how women are truly reacting to this uh Kathy Iraq Jordan says copy is the head\nOf a the conservative Center for Arizona policy we're also joined by military Potter she is the chairwoman of the west Virginia Republican Party Jody Smith is also joining us Indiana State director of the Susan B. Anthony Lewis and ginger ... Republican National committee woman\nGeorgia so we get a nice sampling of ladies from across the fruit to play like you all for being your capital to start with you your reaction to this what are you hearing and use this turning women all watching this play out\nWomen are very engaged conservative women are very engaged women are outraged by this whole notion that believes women enter a woman could acute any man of their sexual assault and that limited to the elite regardless of whether there's any um crap ready evident\nCetera so the women that I keep hearing from my end by my Facebook page it is full of women taken from Kavanaugh and certainly sensitivity toward women that have been victims of sexual thought that that this has just gotten to be on the plate plate of being absurd and ridiculous\nA melody I Wonder are you hearing the same thing you know in West Virginia the from from conservative women there are some polls I've seen where the engagement among women and I'll share this with you\nThis is the ... poll released yesterday\nEighty three percent of Republican women claim the midterms alert the term elections are very important that is a twelve percent increase of the same poll conducted in July so they're up all Seventy nine percent of a democratic women are saying that it's very important so the Republican women seem to have an edge here what are you hearing military\nI'm hearing a lot from our men and women as well as the women here in our state and there's also have been a couple of polls done here just recently\nThat there was one that said there were sixty four percent of West Virginians that want Kavanaugh confirmed and then there was another one that says there's fifty three percent that Kevin all come from so overwhelmingly for cap and all of our people say that the party of JFK has turned into Marlboro and that's exactly what's happened\nPeople are really livid over this and this is really about the Democrats trying to uh go back to the twenty sixteen election and try to cancel the election of Donald Trump and it's about roe versus Wade as well\nWorld military you also have Joe Manchin as your senator in West Virginia or what are you making his coming out and voting for cloture which indicates but doesn't always mean that he might support the Kevin ... nomination\nWell let me just sum up senator Manchin like this if you like to play football you see somebody that that makes a taco well Joe mansion didn't have enough leadership that are left courage to make the taco Joe mansion Powell after tackle\n... and that's just exactly the way he joined the string and everybody along\nOkay well we'll see how he votes but this is um do you ginger how would I Want to go to you you're the Republican National committee woman from Georgia I'm ... are women at all seeing\nThis as we heard Amy Schumer tried to frame this as we've heard so many Democratic senators or try to frame this as a vote for Kevin ... is a vote against when I'm going to vote against women who suffered some kind of abuse is that what your people telling you\nQuite the opposite by people and not just is melody stated not just women that men to that name like when I have had more women come up today and say I was in the Carter that baby toward the other day and the checkout lady was so upset about it women are saying that\nThis is my concern is that we played the politics at\nGender and women against men and all in the evening and I'm\nA woman and I and I it's ended up front to me that we did it it just makes me very angry that they are trying to play this game and the women that I'm Talking to say\nRight that they are trying to play this game and the women that I'm Talking to the right through it\nYep eight five five forty ... is the number I'm a ... and you know gender it's not only women\nI think you know learn I just talked so often about those men and women watching this I was ... I live in New Orleans and I was in New Orleans the other day and they had the TV on at a lunch spot I go to and this is not you know hardly a democratic or Republican spot it's a New Orleans but everybody's there\nAnd the conversation I overheard for mothers aunts sisters about ... ... and many of them said look I I I don't I was against this guy's nomination but after watching the way he was treated\nI feel my gosh this could be my husband my son my my my nephew\nThey see they've now it seems a dental fighting personalized the um attacks on on ... and the\nThe the immorality of empty attacks that are just pounded in with no evidence Jody Smith give me your reaction to this you're the Indiana State director for the Susan B. Anthony less water using\nAll week I can just absolutely agree with what everyone else is that we have knocked over four hundred thousand doors and Indiana\nAnd overwhelmingly we have support here for judge Kavanaugh I think what you said about people finally just getting sick to death we see a lot of people saying we were going to vote Democrat but we're changing our vote we can't believe these tactics\nI think that um the uh the adage of thing and I said before proven\nUm that you have to prove you're innocent says what has sparked people to be just outraged and America we believe in the bill of rights and the constitution\nAnd that means that you are innocent until you're proven guilty or not the opposite way and that's what's really sparked people to be angry and feeling as though this man is an utterly destroyed without any proof and it's changed their mind\nYou know you you see a lot of that and and I think um the\n... again I think the American people at their core are fair beyond ideology beyond anything else they are fair minded people and had these allegations panned out\nHad a witness or corroborating evidence been produced they might have taken a very different view of this but the unrelenting salt on this guy in the face of no evidence at all I think that his outrage and let me tell you ... the other day and we are in complete agreement I think\nWe may not be seeing the you're the woman this midterm election this could be the year of the man or the backlash demand where men come flooding the the voting booth because they think my gosh this is going to be meet tomorrow we're going to be right back happy very quickly just want to ask you that\nThe polls are tightening up between ... and a cinema\nIn I'm In Arizona you're there a forty five ... forty seven cinema could this\nTo the polls for ...\nWell I I Hope so and it it's all of that turnout is those who are concerned about having a part of an ... you got to get out there to turn out on that or I think Kelly can land so we all have to pull together\nOr we believe that their latest please stay with us we're going to take a quick break and we'll get to all your calls eight five five forty ... the ... from show continues Raymond ... sitting in for the great lady of course anger mangled tonight ten pm eastern on the Fox news show they\n\n\nWeigh three hundred and twenty nine pounds I was a heart attack happened I got ... it makes me not so hungry I started noticing more energy they're noticed my belly we're starting to see it come off\n... I went for three thirty to forty five four fifty six year old guy to lose that much worse it took some of the brother I feel great I feel like I was when I was thirty five years old\nThat was Reuben now listen to what Josh says about ... four hundred\nAll man that's that really works it was insane or for the commercials for a decade or the you know just going to try it my parents were like falling off\nIt really works about foods last year for my new job at they're falling off all it's the same\nGuys you can lose belly fat dean energy strength and muscle and look and feel years younger trying enroll for hungry cease natural affordable way to\n\n\n\nConsequences you know we have a very tight Senate race here as well\nAnd when people choose\nTo initially say they're going to vote for somebody because they are qualified are not qualified and then every five minutes the parameters changes to what we're utilizing to determine our vote people remember that and one of the the biggest things in Indiana that we're saying is\nMothers are concerned about their children that are going to be the next generation leaders ever being willing to run for anything I've talked to so many\nMillennials boys and girls are young men and young women\nThat are saying I never want to put my family or myself in that position you know how in the world is judge Kavanaugh holding up underneath all of this especially for his own family\nSo it's really it's a fascinating to me that these women are making it about race when everybody involved in this particular incident as white\nEducated and an upper income so it's a doesn't make much sense to me that that's\nIt's become about color it's become about\nUm women it really is as much about a judge Kavanaugh having the right to um have his innocence presumed to be full and be proven guilty so that's\nAbout all I think that's where a lot of Indiana I think that's where a lot of voters and Americans come down there they they feel ... they didn't have a real strong feeling about bread come and on the same way the president said ... up until we can go to knew he was\nBut watching this play out watching the dramatic testimony seeing the accusations and the lack of evidence I think they come down to what you just mentioned\nIt seems a presumption of guilt and something else\nPolitics politics\nIs overwhelming all of this this is ideological blood sport and a man's reputation whose family be damned we're going to take this nomination don't becomes the marching orders no matter what at all costs\nAnd I think the American people now are about to have a referendum on that idea that you can take down the political opponent at any cost with no evidence and shame destroy use reputation for all time\nIn public and even force of all of a woman who's going through some sort of distrust into the open to be used as your political weapon that I think you use\nThe Americans who could not go man this concerns me junior I Want to ask you um you you have the big governor's race a hotly contested one in Georgia between sushi Abramson and Brian Kemp he's up the Republican brand company two points\nDo you believe the milk conservatives are going to rally there in the governor's race\nYes I did and I think that having a hearing and it's going to really play into that because it's making when I\nWas really upset that people are playing that the women against man card and I'm Stacey Abrams is a woman but Brian can't is at a conservative man who stands for our conservative principles personal responsibility limited government and lower taxes all the things that we\nAre that's our party is all about so I really do think and I have seen just in the last week or so across the state\nPeople are more motivated than ever now to get out\nGet out and vote and not only that but volunteer that I was at the camp campaign the other day people were coming in to get guard times and the topic of the conversation was exactly what we're talking about the Kavanaugh hearings and how we see this politics being played out and they'll they they are really playing dirty the leftist playing dirty and\n... people don't want to see this they really are discouraged\nNo no I I you know as I look out and watches it it does have all the markings of the last presidential election where we saw a lot of drama for the cameras celebrities coming out now we've had walkouts and protests and signs in confrontations with senators and these dramatic\nMoments at the same time in coffee shops in factories yeah in the school on to pick up the kids\nIf you listen closely you're hearing something very different this same dynamic I think is what propelled Trump into office and it was that kind of well he called the silent majority\nI'm my sense is working Americans\nAnd Americans are not by nature political activists they don't get out in March the working there working the privately held their views about politics that they spread over the dinner table or to their families and occasionally to their friends but it's not something you go to war over\nAnd today in Washington I have to tell you\nI've seen friendship shattered people simply you don't talk to each other\nAnd it's all about politics it's because they they disagree politically and it's become an ugly violent thing where once it was dialogue to try to convince the other person to your point of view today is slash smashing destroy\nAnd I don't think Americans particularly women really want that now their core group I think who do and we've seen them in the streets\nBut moms wives\nWorking women I I I don't think it's where they live I'm going to give a quick round Robin we're going to go through every body again a starting with military Potter of from the Virginia Republican Party in West Virginia of your thoughts on we're we might be headed here in these midterms\n[noise] I think that are due to the situation with this nomination of a\nA very very qualified a judge\nThe Supreme Court I think that the Republicans were energized to get out and vote a for Republicans conservative Republicans that will support President Trump's agenda and I think the Democrats were also get out and vote the right way to for people because West Virginia's counties there's fifty five of them\nAnd all fifty five went for Trump and the election\nSo that meant and twenty six states that means that we'd had Democrat votes as well\nAnd I believe that the Democrats also are a work or to get out and vote for Republicans this time so I think that that everything's looking good and we love our country and we want to protect our country so and I'm going to spend every last minute I can uh if his last breath\nTrying to stand up for what's right for our country\nOkay well I don't want you to do that for a military we mail we need you in December so it may be my last breath I'm so busy [laughter] well you keep going great to talk to you junior high our last word do you um you're you're the you're in Georgia in the Republican Party in Georgia\nOr given to ... years and we're seeing given the cabin all fight in the in the way it's being processed by voters what impact will end up in the midterms\nI with melody I think it is energizing the veterans more and I also think that people that were kind of neutral and on the fence that were energized about mid term because a lot of times people don't get excited about the terms I think we're going to the ... where you've heard a lot about the blue wave I Believe the red way is going to come and people are\nSick and tired of being bullied around and they're going to stand up for their freedom and we love our country we care about our country and those people are going to come out of the woodwork and I think it's going to be a ... it's not just going to be a way it's going to be a ... and people are going to eight shot shock and awe as what I predict\nA Judy Smith I'm I'm going to end with you you know Republicans were really\nMm uh Jody Smith I'm I'm going to end with you you know Republicans were really bad at telling their story I always critique them for this they they can't tell a story to save their life\nIn this instance the Democrats gave them a dramatic story that ended up breaking their way how will this play the drama the intimacy and the projection I think many voters are are are engaged in as a project themselves on to a cabin on his family and what they've been through\nWell I agree with what the other gal said in Indiana we love our country and we were first on the board for Trump remember that Mike Pence says it's a law in Indiana and we are here to say that we support\nSupreme Court justices supports the constitution of the United states living breathing document and for that reason because we are so strong we also will support a senator\nThat well I'm actually beat the incumbent because he is an outsider because he is conservative and because he will stand for the values that insurers bully then\nSo we believe that we're so we're going to see a red wave a red suit in our state of voters that come out that never have before just as we saw during the Trump race where people voted for the very first time in their lives\nAnd we're looking for um the numbers to begin changing and that Donnelly will pay quite a price for his stand and saying that it could change its mind remember that he was voted the most ineffective senator in the Senate he could still change his mind and turn around but at the votes against this\nSupreme Court nomination I think that he will see that that he gave us a gift and the state of Indiana because people are going to rally to the cause\nWhen there were charged for no

for Kavanaugh getting back to that issue the vote count is fairly devastating I think\nSusan Collins unless something bizarre happens is going to vote to confirm Kavanaugh\nI also think in the end Jeff Flake will probably vote to confirm Kavanaugh although he might live up to his last name Joe Manchin still has not revealed what he's going to do he I think he doesn't want to be the deciding

Lindsey Graham decided you know something to heck with this I'm I'm going to take the floor and I'm going to reset this debate about the cabin are confirmation he did that I\nThink it was after the president's press conference with the president came out an hour and a half and he was just fantastic and his support of Kavanaugh and with whether what what the reporters how we dealt with reporters he was having a good time but he said yeah I'm not doing this anymore I'm not I'm not playing defense anymore\nAnd the Republicans have got to stop playing defense Trump won by being on the off and he's not in perpetual apology mode because he said he sent a sharp tweet about someone\nHe kept moving forward he didn't look back he's not gonna do well over mistakes we all need to do that you need to look forward keep moving the ball down the field that's what Trump has taught us as Republican and guess what a lot of Republicans are now seeing it he's transforming this political party and it was in a moment too soon\nI really appreciate your comments Rob we have a great team on the anger mango we're gonna take a break Kellyanne Conway up next\n\nThis is Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving

pressuring her to change your story which is a fancy word is saying asking her to lie\nWell bumps or crime yes offering\nA lot of that can be looked at after this who ... who leaked Ford's identity will kind of emails were going back and forth why Dianne Feinstein recommended ... a democratic activist\nLawyers to Ford why they never told her she can testify in private and keep her ... her face in her name out of the press as much as she could she could just do it in California they'd go to them that's something that Senator Lindsey Graham told me right away he said she can do it by phone we can send somebody out there but no no no they needed to the lights and the cameras\nOn for them and I guess there next client base so it it's just an awful\nBut America has been watching and I don't the after he's confirmed and hopefully he will be I won't get ahead of the way certain senators are grappling with their vote\nDecided to vote Lara but um if judge Kavanaugh is confirmed as a justice of the United States Supreme court this will not end there they think it won't end because it's there'll be shouting at men they've never met for things these men have never done to them personally

of that press conference which I think was one of his best press conferences offers incredible you could have gone for three hours or that he taught\nUp a really needed lesson much needed lesson to Republicans on how to fight for what you\nBelieve in a fight for a principal fight for a person instead of being back on your heels cowering in an elevator that the the reason Trump got elected as because he wasn't gonna take that any more he wasn't going to just keep getting pummeled and beyond perpetual a perpetual apology tour for either him sell for America and\nHe he's not they called him ... I think the bullies are the people who are swarming individuals in public or the Senate or restaurants and and screaming at them within a centimeter of their skin but I think Trump's taught the Republicans a lot throughout this whole thing\nIn a large struck me just last night after I was on your TV show and thanks for having me or that the way everybody describes Donald Trump President Trump is exactly that they're behaving and when I don't see from him he's\nFuming he's throwing things at the TV he's angry he's a bully it's exactly who they become he's not\nThat way how they're welcome yeah these unbelievable job numbers in and bringing peace across the world and bring make us prosper it at home if he's sitting there fuming all day they they own the acrimony they own the va to predict vicious wave via way they've gone after people um according to one gender according to one's politics\nAnd you're so right he doesn't retreat and back down when he believes in a principal\nOr a principal in this case PAL Brett Kavanaugh and they didn't know each other before this they didn't know each other well at all but the President Saleh judge Kavanaugh somebody who sat\nSo is sitting on the DC circuit second highest court in the land over three hundred ... judicial opinions that none of these Democrats even try to pick apart I respect them far more Lars they said you know we have a problem with the five following opinions that he wrote and these particular passages we think he went outside the contours of the constitution the law there is\nNo such are no jobs about ... they're talking about a passage\nFrom your book you can sit in a post it note versus three hundred judicial opinions the answers to twelve hundred written questions over one million documents you need a Mack truck the hall around all the stuff he's produced and you need a post it\nTo talk about a passage in your book so this just strikes a lot of Americans even apolitical Americans Laura as a logical and beyond commonsense I respect them or if they said we're angry lost the election two years ago and that President Trump is reshaping the federal judiciary was constitutional less than all this nonsense\nWe're going to later on in the show Kelly and have a discussion about\nWhat these currents feminists are doing to poison the relationship between men and women and specifically the ah this idea that if you're if you're an accuser\nYou must be heard and you must be believed and if you're not believe then you're anti woman or you're anti victim and\nJustice Thomas's talked about this a lot you know the ... we all have to stop identifying ourselves as victims of this or victims of that because that's the that's not going to help you advance with the person as being you know ...\nDoesn't and that every every man as a perpetrator every man has to shoulder the burden of the need to move in every man is a rape is every man is a sexual harassed or by virtue of their gender and then every woman is a victim on even those who many who are that have been victims of\nSexual misconduct or worse don't necessarily consider themselves victims overall and that's being lost in the den here as well I mean if you if you asked\nIf you do one of those are asking everybody who's out there with the masking tape on their mouths and those signs are holding up why are they there what this what is this about\nIt you're going to get answers that I really have nothing to do with his confirmation and really nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh that the Democrats used at Ford because they they breed sure anonymity they revealed her identity to their world they sat on this for six weeks\nAnd then they set her up with attorneys who never even ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Chris Plante Show", "city": "Anchorage", "day": "05"}
