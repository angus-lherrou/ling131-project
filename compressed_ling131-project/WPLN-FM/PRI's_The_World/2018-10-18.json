I set up to ...\nDo you call yourself a dissident yah yah this ... and ... ... did not call themselves a dissident\nDemocracy if fuel is this war and we talked about it he said this war it's certainly hippie because people inside the country they believe if you're out of dissidents or if you are opposing pick up on them and that I mean you are aspiring when you're on the bottom and you are trying to tell what that is\nSo ... yeah boy it's worth\nThe Washington Post published ... final column today the post went up in English and Arabic do you know whether it's getting red in Saudi Arabia\nYes

comment one day a steak\nOr it's fine for me to go to prison because when I talk nobody idiots what if the government that is to me everyone would lead to a vision that let's see right now everyone read what's her job hundreds you helped\nYour city floods Saudi Arabia is he now lives in exile in London where he founded and directs the human rights group I'll ... ya ya thank you very much for speaking with us\nSaid also touches on issues of freedom of expression you may recall the name Laura ... she's a University of Florida graduate who was accepted into a master's program at Hebrew University in Israel August and was granted a student visa to travel there\nBut when she landed in Tel Aviv two weeks ago Israeli authorities revoked her visa and barred from entering the country reporter Daniel ... has been following the storage joins us now so there is news on al ... case today Daniel what happened\n[noise] well the news is that the Supreme Court in Israel ruled that her student fees that should not have been revoked and she is now being released and her lawyer is on the way to the airport to pick her up\nSo take us back and remind us what the dilemma was for Israel and for Laura ... who is she in why did Israeli officials detain or upon her arrival\nAt the heart of this issue Marco is that Israel passed a law and twenty Seventeen that allows it to bar and treat to foreigners who are involved in calling for\nA boycott of Israel and so it's real estate lawyers said that al ... and his\nFather is a Palestinian descent and that she was the president of students for justice in Palestine a pro Palestinian group while she was at the University of Florida and she presents an ongoing risk of calling for a boycott wild in the country and until now the lower courts have sided with the state lawyers but her lawyers said that she hasn't been active\nIn that group for more than a year she's also said that she wouldn't support a boycott while she's in Israel\n[noise] so how does the kind of dominated conservative political class in Israel see the judge has ruined\nThe Hebrew University supported by our our cost\nOf an even sent their lawyer to back her up but education minister Naftali Bennett he's from the far right the Jewish Home party he said that that that was an improper move by the university and when I was at the court case last week in Tel Aviv I asked Israelis and the neighborhood what they thought a lot of caution\nCase and they said you know if she doesn't like this country she doesn't need to come but there are definitely other people who I've heard say this does not look good for a country that calls itself a democracy\nAnd as opposed to the hearing that I attended in Tel Aviv at this hearing judges seemed to be very skeptical of the way that the Israeli authorities were interpreting there's two thousand Seventeen\nLaw so now Laura ... is free to go to classes at Hebrew University any sense of what her life is going to be like when she gets or does she go to face pressure not to get involved in activism\nEarlier this week some students quite an empty chair in class thing is is reserved for cost them and they wrote it also in Arabic and then that's fine with the faced by right wing ears so you can see that her presence and Hebrew University is definitely going to raise questions but she's also\nAn Emmy program for human rights and transitional justice her fellow classmates are going to be dealing with questions around that very issue that she challenged and so I'm sure it'll be a ... year with
