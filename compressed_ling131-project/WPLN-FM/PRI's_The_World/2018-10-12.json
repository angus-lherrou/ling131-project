world\nI'm Carol hills this is the world imagined massive sabotage of our country's defense\nWell but it may not be that far from reality that at least is the warning coming this week from a new report from the government Accountability Office found that the country's next generation weapons systems could be easy targets for cyber attacks\nThat made some experts in the field to think about the TV show Battlestar Galactica\nIn it an enemy civilization has taken a humanities entire fleet of fighter jets find affecting their computers the jail report found real life owner abilities and us

unclassified report but these ... weapons systems are themselves classified so nowhere in this report or the weapons systems themselves named\nWe can do that these are everything from jet fighters to anti missile interceptors and an every kind of weapon system that the Pentagon is developing wow\nSo so what kind of vulnerability is did the report find\nAll sorts of vulnerability is the scariest thing I think is that they found that\nBasically an entire generation of Pentagon weapons seems to have been developed without cyber security in mind which means that these aren't necessarily vulnerabilities that are only for high level hackers\nTo take advantage of these aren't like really hard to get into systems some of these things were just\nThat they found beef fault passwords hadn't changed on the software of these systems so the testers were able to take over these systems completely just by guessing passwords in one case it was as simple as guessing a password and nine seconds

intentionally noisy to make themselves visible so that they would be found even then they weren't found\nNow to be clear these are weapons systems that are already deployed or are they things that are being developed and are going to be deployed what what kind of time period we're talking about so we are talking about systems that are being developed the reason why this\nReport was done by the government Accountability Office was at the Senate Armed forces committee asked them to look into the uh weapons that the\nDOD wants to spend one point six six trillion dollars to roll out and bring to scale to that they can use them so it is likely that some of these weapons systems are already in use but they\nAre going to be rolled out further but many of these are things that are being

on well it covers a wide range of issues that if you listen to President Trump you might think it all boils down to one thing dairy products from Canada\nThey've treated our farmers in Wisconsin and New York state that a lot of other states\nVery badly the new trade deals still needs legislative approval but it would give us dairy farmers more access to Canadian markets their worlds Jason Margolis went to Ontario to hear from farmers there\nPhilip Armstrong's family has been farming in ... Ontario for a very long time or family has been on this piece of land ... Eighteen sixty nine\nObviously dairy farming has lost a lot since then it's also made a huge leap sense Armstrong graduated college thirty seven years ago today each of his three hundred and eighty cows whereas a high tech color we watch is twenty four cows getting milk in a computer measures they're out for the call or that they have\nBut it also measures her eating habits for the individual ... it measures are ruined the stomach flu is to make sure that that's going well [noise] it measures are lying down time and measures are activists\nCombine that technology with better breathing and nutrition and Armstrong says his cows are nearly twice as productive as for decades ago\nThis might seem great but it's also created a problem for the world's dairy farmers they're producing too much milk so to keep things in check Canada has a system called supply management\nEach far has a quota and that's our share of the Canadian Marc\nThey match supply with consumer demand as part of its supply management system Canada also places high tariffs on foreign dairy imports up to about three hundred percent\nThat's what's enraged President Trump's candidate does lead in some American dairy before terrorists kicking and that's part of the updated NAFTA Canada would open up a few percentage points more to the Americans\nYou go okay well so much for that role in income we're giving up that allows us to modernize to expand so it's frustrating for us as dairy farmers\nAnd perplexing the dairy trade between the U.S and Canada is a sliver of overall trade between the two nations and Armstrong is annoyed that President Trump singled out Canadian dairy as the problem\nHe was distorting the facts or maybe didn't understand the facts I don't know and so if we were hurting their dairy farmers well Americans had a six hundred million dollar surplus with us but he got in just had that we were mistreating their farmers\nAnd many American dairy farmers agree with President Trump and applaud him for standing up for them they point out that Canada also recently read to find some of its milk products which could effectively shut out American products\nTheir pain is real thousands of small American dairy farms have shut down in recent years it's not all because of Canada bark from it they'd been squeezed out by consolidation corporate agriculture global competition and low prices people are also consuming less milk\nA lot of male cat in the past has been dumped because it couldn't be processed and in an appropriate time or sold an extreme discount\nBrian Gould is a professor of agribusiness at the University of Wisconsin well us dairy farmers maybe in a bad place gold says the U.S shouldn't be telling Canada how to manage its agriculture\nWe have no right to do that I I really think renting nice when we demand that they get rid of their quota system\nGold says think of the reverse Canada telling us to dismantle its production system the U. S. government sets a minimum price for milk and provide some subsidies\nUs also has its own high tariffs on certain dairy products sour cream for instance it so I think it's I don't remember exactly it's like grand Lloyd the c._e._o. of the dairy farmers of Ontario couldn't put his finger on the exact amount the U.S sour cream tariff is one hundred and eighty seven percent\nAnd Lloyd says there are a lot of other us tariffs on other cheeses and that you have like fifty percent terrorists Lloyd says this whole milk spat with Canada it's just politics Wisconsin\nBeing a significant important state to the Republicans namely obviously Speaker Ryan and it was a state that carried Trump became a political lightning rod and that is what started the whole\nBack on the farm fill up arms says the new NAFTA agreement doesn't address the fundamental problem American farmers are producing too much milk and Armstrong believes opening a little bit more of Canada won't make a dent\nSays the ... what's up with his dinner a fear but it has no as a ... year old and there will be it'll\nAgain plenty of Wisconsin in New York former see things differently they're glad to have more access to a Canadian markets\nStill there's an ironic twist here many American dairy farmers and organizations are actually now looking into a supply management system of their own similar to Canada is for the world Jason Margolis Khalid on Ontario\nMm this week we've been obsessed with what could be a murder story the victim Saudi journalist on October second Jamal ... entered the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul and has not been seen since we're not the only ones obsessed\nInside Saudi Arabia and outside I think we're all trying to figure out what has happened to him\nSo how ... is a Saudi journalist and filmmaker who made a documentary critical of Saudi Arabia she also new Jamal ... like him she live outside the Saudi kingdom because she says speaking up can get you in trouble with the authorities there\nDissidents human rights activists or even just simple critics of what's going on Saturday for the past few years have\nBeen put in prison taken from different countries and brought back to Saudi Arabia and so Japan is the highest profile of something that's been going on ... for more than a year now let's say and that's the scary thing\nIs also tell us again what happened to you after you produced a documentary\nSo that the government officially accused me of supporting terrorism and so this shows a lack of understanding of the Saudi Government itself of what is independent journalists because there isn't\nAnything called the dependence journalism and Saudi Arabia and so like for a lot of people even when I was being interviewed about the film there were like how would you like to be identified argue Saudi\nDissidents like no I'm a journalist was covering the story\nBut because there is no such platforms and fights added radio where you can take these things we all become dissidents inadvertently and there was no other space and this is the problem with\nWith with how the Saudi Government dealing with everyone right now they are shutting down even though my oldest of comments and critique about\nTheir policies and so they've left no room for us they've left no room for us to be able to properly cover stories and that they love criticizing journalists for not understanding what's going on in Saudi Arabia and so it's a lose lose situation for us\nHas has the government clamped down harder since Mohammed bin Salman a came I Can't look\nAt her absolutely on everyone's ... I mean like ... before you could be a human rights activists on for example woman driving or being critical of the economic reform in Saudi Arabia and there wouldn't be as much backlash as now we fought like a lot of the activists that had been arrested before\nThe ban was lifted that that would be released by now but instead of being released a\nLot more pressure has been put on them and they're using them or ... it's insane\nStuff I I'm at is a Saudi journalist and filmmaker we've been speaking to her from Washington I think he's off I think your cat [noise]\nOh [noise]\n\nComing up an American pastor goes free in Turkey but only after being found guilty of ... you're listening to the world\nSo how high were they when they had to start their land and\nI Believe there are about thirty miles up so they weren't quite in space yet but they were almost there\nThe astronaut noted that they experienced a moment of weightlessness which you're not supposed to be failing at that part of the flight and I think that had to deal with the fact that there were no longer connected with a booster and then at that point they start spinning and the goal is to a grand jury and then they're parachutes deployed\nTo slow them down to that they could land safely they're not spending as they're racing to the earth yeah they are [laughter]\nGod I've done what is known as a parabolic flight that's when you feel weightlessness for a moment in time and during the ... view experience extra genes and it feels like something is pressing down on you like a mattress\nI didn't experience nearly the level that they did but just imagine kind of feeling like you're pressed up against something you're ill so much heavier that's what they were feeling and it can be pretty intense\nOr are there any new details about what might have caused this problem\nI don't know if they've traced the exact origin but I Believe something happened during the stage separation so when rockets launched pieces of hardware shed a way to save on weight and the Soyuz has four main boosters around the center core and they were supposed to break away but\nRussia things that maybe there was some contact between one of the boosters and the center core we're when really they are supposed to separate completely this was the sixty fifth ... of this particular sways rocket so it's been around for decades [laughter]\nI don't know if they know what caused that contact but I think that's the leading theory at the moment\nNo us and Russia they're frequently at odds especially these days when it comes to geopolitics but they cooperate frequently when it comes to space flight why is that\nHas been kind of shiny beacon of hope in our relations with Russia and I think it's just because when it comes to space we cannot let\nCreeps into other aspects when Russia invaded Ukraine that\nKind of sparked a debate about whether or not the military should use Russian rocket technology to launch satellites into space so it has had\nAn impact on other parts of our faith infrastructure but when it comes to an asset we just can't let those things get and the way we need then at the moment because the soy is is the only way to get humans to the international space station so we have to continue cooperating and hopefully not that Russia will let geopolitics getting away with that\nIs significant setback for the international space station I Would say\nIt's definitely concerning about the Asians teacher we currently have three astronauts into orbit on the station and they're going to have to come home eventually they got up there and it's the way it is as well and the Soyuz capsule can't last forever and or but they have a two hundred or below the lifetime and we're about a hundred and thirty days into\nThat so there are slated to come down and December they could probably stretch that the January but not very long so either they're going to have to come down the road or Russia could possibly launch an empty phrase capsule and send that up to the station and give them an extra two hundred days to stay on board but that\nHasn't been determined yet we don't know if that's actually going to happen it just depends on what the investigation finds\nLauren ... is senior science reporter for the verge thanks Lauren\nThanks for having me this next story is also about Russia but guess what it
