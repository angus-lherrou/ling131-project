... and you're with the world a moment of crisis those are the words secretary of state Mike Pompeo used today in Mexico city to describe what's happening with that caravan of migrants moving north from Central America ... message to Mexico and Central American nations\nPresident Trump has been tweeting the same message even threatening to close our southern border if the migrants make about far\nThe group has grown in size to at least four thousand people mostly from Honduras right now many of them aren't border towns in Guatemala trying to cross into Mexico reporter Emily Green it's been on the road in Guatemala following their progress\nI'm Emily describe what four thousand migrants traveling together from Honduras through Guatemala what is it seen look like\nWell I think that this scene has evolved over the last many days initially what I understand though is that all the migrants were traveling together but then it became so big so huge that it became incredibly dispersed\nI ride to Guatemala yesterday and I made my way to a shelter in a city called ...\nWhen I was told us that roughly seven hundred hundred had arrived yesterday and so the idea of a caravan as one might think of it is not really accurate it feels to me more like a mass of thousands of people traveling right now to the Mexico Guatemala border\nI mean it sounds just like a very long line of people as many as four thousand though I mean that that's pretty dramatic\nIt's completely dramatic where I was last night was at a municipal of sports center that was like a basketball court was bleachers and there were just hundreds of people in it sleeping eating and it was loud and it kind of smell of human sweat and what really stood out to me was just how many kids do their work\nAnd I'm not just talking teenagers are ten year olds I'm Talking toddlers stumbling around in their diapers\nSo it started with a lot of Hondurans I'm reminded us where they're all coming from right now and and why they're leaving their countries\nI think that's still the vast majority of people are ...

journalist your mouth ... continues to unfold how it's been unfolding though that's what we want to focus on right now\nThere's sometimes gruesome details in the case appear to be coming out in a deliberate slow drip courtesy of Turkish officials they're the ones who first put out the story that ... was brutally murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nTo learn more we got in touch with Carlotta Gall dissemble bureau chief for the New York times so Howard took her to visuals getting their information and how are the parsing out what they know\nWell that's what's so interesting is I'd say they've known from the very get go I'm literally from the first day or evening [noise]\nUm what happened was that the first week the Turkish officials 'em all anonymous ... not to be quoted started reaching out to the foreign media which was interesting because it's not usually what they do yeah so that then became a big story in the west and it was clear\nThat that was that a they want it to be listening\nSo um it's been so they'd be they'd be cautious and careful with how they have released um what they know the details coming out drip drip I'm In a way that has kept it in the news every day\nSo how much of a problem is it for journalists both foreign and Turkish to report the Turkish findings one of the people in charge of the scene of the crime is outages are not really corroborating anything right now\nVery difficult I mean that's you know and and it remains this mystery in many ways\nThere's no ... now that's coming out in the Turkish press which we can't completely dark ... one of the one of the things was that the record the audio recordings maybe came from his uncle watch\nThat was quite quickly shut down by technical X but I'm the photos that were released of the fifty and Saudis who are being accused of being scored who flew in the sense that day and flew out that day we had teams and Neal and they were checking ... to try and match them with\nOpen source material social media and stuff and so on we found people who\nAre easily recognizable for all of you know the entourage of ah the crown prince of Saudi Arabia mom had been someone they caught on um you know photograph news agency photographs so those sort of things we will to match up there are others that it's difficult to work out who they are\nThese leaks ah have gotten a lot of attention in part because the killing is a reporter to be hideous and a ... he was tortured some are going to see this as a threat not something that went around by ... in your reporting have you come close to understanding this\n[noise] um no not yet I mean I think the first we need to find what exactly happened and then perhaps we move on to why and why in this way but\nYou know this wasn't a a a shooting in a dark alley um that could be pinned on no one this was a very brazen attack and so I think the Turks have been tucked should that as a threat against them against their own government and president I'd run himself so that's why that particularly in range die thing\nAnd so now people are looking at the relations between turkey and Saudi Arabia which although the sudden diplomatic deference they do have differences considerable differences\nAnd so now you see in the pro government columnists quite a lot of anger spilling out a particularly on demands that um the crown prince be removed so it's it's gone going very high\nCarlotta Gall the New York times bureau chief and assemble thanks very much for being with us pleasure to maybe they\nCan learn\n\nHurricane Michael is gone but the recovery is just beginning Michael tore through the south east us last week a powerful storm likely made even more powerful by climate change\nAmong the places that took a direct hit tend to air force base in Florida to do is just one of many us bases around the world that are vulnerable to be growing impact of climate change\nBut as the world's Carolyn Beeler reports the military is not tracking those costs\n[noise] is it how\nThe stuff that delving into force face and one of the air like ... [noise]\nThe wind also smashed buildings in the ... is for Ruth office\nAirplane hangar and damaged ask twenty two stealth fighter jets worth more than three hundred million dollars each more than a week later at this\nBut when they're done the repair costs will not be added to any running tally of military spending related to extreme weather or climate change because that doesn't exist\nI think it is fair to say that the military does not know what the cause of climate change will be going forward\nThat's John konger he oversaw environmental policy and managed facilities for the department of defense during the Obama administration last year the government Accountability Office recommended that the military start tracking the costs of extreme weather and climate change at all their installations Brian ... wrote that recommendation for the watchdog agency\nWhich it's important to cash or the distinction between the normal maintenance or repair versus the closer College of a severe storms so that it helps to guide future adaptation projects\nLook argues it's a lot easier to justify the cost of an adaptation project like strengthening a hanger Ruth if you know how much you've spent repairing hang our roots in the past and how much more you might spend in the face of increasingly intense storms and he points out it's not just about the money\nWe have military bases to support a military mission and if the base is out of commission by definition if not supporting the military mission\nThe department of defense responded to the watchdog agency is called to track climate and extreme weather costs by saying no thanks actually they did say a little more they responded that quote associating a single event to climate change is difficult and does not warrant that time and money expended in doing so\nFour or five years ago that favorite was correct\nTrigger Hauser is with the economic research company radium group\nThe science was not yet at a point where that kind of attribution was possible but thanks to a lot of research work over the past few years we can do it\nScientists still don't usually say a specific drought or hurricane was caused by climate change but they can say for example that an individual drought was twice as likely because of climate change or that Fifteen Percent more ... during hurricane\nCombining that new science with big economic data lets people like how's your estimate how much climate change will cost investors insurance companies and government agencies\nBreak down to a building level to estimate how much more likely it is sort of given building a experiences extreme weather events now than it was Thirty years ago and how much more likely it will be in the future and what the price tag of\nFiguring out how much damage climate change is currently costing the military nearly five thousand sites around the world wouldn't be cheap but Hauser says it'd be totally doable\nI mean I don't know exactly what it would cost but I'm guessing it would cost them wash then you know half of a wing of wind up six getting fighter\nA department of defense spokesperson told the world they plan and design facilities to address whether an environmental conditions but climate change planning doesn't have that specific budget line however they say they're currently reviewing their climate resilience policies for the world Carolyn Beeler\n[noise]\nNews headlines or next year with the world [noise]\n[noise] so what does this mean for immigrant kids like what were the eating at lunch and how do they go to school and how did they get home\n[noise] the thing is that before signing a low the first thing ... she's trying to figure out the consequence of that resolution and convinced they were totally aware my grandchildren will ... being forced to eat separately from their classmates\nThat was his older load that prevents Keats from bringing their own food from home inside ... obviously was a problem for their parents because they were forced to take their kids to school in the morning\nThan some of them were taking their kids back home for lunch and then sending them back so they had to do back and forth from the house to school like three or four times a day to provide their key some food\nHow have Italians been reacting to this\n... there was a reporter for ... for many ... TV program for first report that the case and they went to low income from that some of the seats and slow the asking them what are you to think of the ...\nAnd you know what they were pretty happy with it because they proceed migrants invaders but things were different you know after a few days when the news got huge a NATO ally\nAnd as I say a ... any support that there is a dish should but then when he figured it out that a massive crew finding to help the migrant kids had already and raise\nSixty thousand euros you said that a ... of assets that being an off to go out on the school meals\nThere was one left wing politician in Italy called this resolution apartheid ah how many Italians feel that way\n[noise] yes there is a vision is being described as an op are tied as a form of segregation or that he's a feeling that we are going seriously to fall\nTo see that you know this is probably the most ... since the end of the world war second any tele for sure and maybe in ...\nYou know for kids it's never easy arriving at a new school and then you face these regulations that alienated from other classmates have you spoken with immigrant families and did they tell you how their kids are dealing with this\n[noise] I did speak to a mother you know do the she came from Tunisia and she was telling me that she fell you mediated she felt\nYou know she was angry she was seriously you know disappointed and humiliated by a little sign by politicians were totally aware of ... migrants in lowly\nStill they felt the was injustice and it's very hard for them to express their anger and frustration because often they are invisible any of the\nInterior minister Mattel solving supported this resolution but then backtracked as I said has the mayor of Modi also backtracked\nNo she didn't know she didn't she said that she will consider a self justification of the family says as a way to guarantee school meals that kids but she said that she doesn't have to drop the resolution\nGuardian reporter ... thank you thank you speaking of\nThings that sound wrong imagine a TV show like cops but for ice as an immigration and Customs Enforcement you know show would follow ice agents around as they conduct raise looking for suspected undocumented immigrants\nAnd the purpose of this t._v. show uh sensibly entertainment you may be surprised to hear that a TV show much like that does exist in Japan Nevin Thompson has seen it he's Japan editor for the online news ... news organization global voices\nWell it's like a typical uh reality talk show in this case immigration officers go out and seek out um I guess visa overstay ... people who are\nWorking against the terms of of their views in Japan they stake out people you're there with them in the car um they they capture them interrogate them and then um as the title of the show suggests there to forward it on the next plane but bang\nWow what what's the name of the show either in Japanese or translation and English\nIn Japanese it's called ... which I guess translate says Koch at the moment of deportation wow minutes actually modeled on another a cop show or in Japan called a Tylenol shoe guy which is like caught at the moment of arrest sounds like a trend\nWell yeah I mean there's a lot of these shows everywhere in the world you know I'm In Canada where I'm from for example uh we had a show like this but a kind of the border services agency\nCooperated with with the producers and actually the Canadian government help funded and so they would go out and look for so called illegal immigrants and stuff like that very tasteless and it was only taken off the air because of the ah there'd be contravene privacy regulations you kind of\nWhat is the tone of the the Japanese program and what were your impressions of it\nWell I mean it's it's very literate and breath was um when you eat you basically have a a Japanese person I'm narrating what's happening and it's just it's kind of odd because like their tone is very tricky and and bright and pleasant so now the the immigration agents are on their way to the\nThe dormitory were some Vietnamese a guest workers are suspected of of hiding out in the ministry of marriage is a it's a very um you know cinema verite say you're you're with ... with them in the car there was a camera\nYou know you're driving down the road it's kind of odd because like because Jeff Japan also has very stringent privacy regulations you can't really show anybody's face so everything is\nIt is 'cause like like say if you show the neighborhood um the people who live there would probably complain and ... criticized and so it's just like this is like an hour and a half of what worry blurt out images you can't see people's spaces voices are describes is quite an odd program\nThis was a two hour episode aired earlier this month is that a one off or are they going to be more episodes that follow these migrant raids and deportations\nI imagine there probably will be a because uh the the program did cooperate with the Tokyo branch of the national immigration girl\nSo they I mean there's people have put a lot of time and effort into set in this thing up and and just also because the the immigration bureau is going to be elevated status to immigration agency and get more resources I'd assumed is going to be some work PR efforts like this to\n[noise] I I gather there's been some backlash to the show in Japan or what have active it's been saying\n[noise] well I mean yeah at least on line there is considerable backlash from anti racism activists who are very well organized in Japan Japan is a very vibrant\nAnti racism or movements and so yeah they they basically said why are we turning this into entertainment like why why are you showing people being deported\nHow can this be entertainment and then um the the mainstream media picked it up so you know various newspapers ran articles about you know how degrading the show is\nI mean is it shot in front of 'cause I mean like the bad guys aren't really bad guys they just are looking for a job and you know trying to stay a little longer to make some money and overstayed their work permits\nWell I mean I guess it'd be of the obvious appeal is racism because people I suppose have biases about people from other countries the uh they don't speak our language or they look a bit different and\nAnd they're coming over here and taking our jobs type thing so I'm but personally I I'm not sure like uh I think is just kind of a lyric sensational kind of cheap TV to watch\nI remember the cop show theme song ended up getting samples all over the place that they have a a catchy tune that everybody's not singing\nYeah I mean I I guess you might think also we live within time\nWhen around the world I think people are feeling less secure than ever before just because of a say for example Donald Trump for Brexit or invasion of Crimea so many people are just feeling I'm less secure in their own country is so perhaps these sorts of shows provide some reassurance that\nSomeone's doing something to protect us here\nNevin Tom Cindy Japan editor for global voices thank you very much for telling us about this a somewhat bizarre show\nOh You're welcome was great to talk with you\nAnd [noise]\nChanging leaves and climate change that's just ahead you're on the
