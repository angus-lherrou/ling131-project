and maybe that's the moment you want to act so that's really a psychologically\n... parish and for me to become a new boss for myself a new boss of yourself yes this is like the godfather fail\nSo I'd like you if you would tell us the story of the preparations for his memorial after your father died in Nineteen Ninety six because the Chinese officials had their own ideas about how that defense should really unfold right\nYes is this the communist society Irish and have a clear hierarchy you know so he was a kick out from a Communist Party and even he was the same generation is a state leaders Chairman Mao drawing the lines of\nPeople they weren't together but uh but he was heavily criticized us or right is in some way against the party so your father was in that inner circle with

... years so yeah I ... and not just allowed to ride towards his name's\nTotally disappeared in the public so the memorial how did that memorial first they decided to his body has to be covered by communist flack\nIs very high on there and that means you're you're part of it is a revolution but I feel ... uncomfortable you know I said you know you should not do something to somebody already passed away which you know it's made against as well\nSo I made that argument that says we don't need cars out flak\nDid they resist ... yeah they they told me they said to your father doesn't just been onto your family you know which is very good argument and they say a recent belongs to the Communist Party or state was it a convincing arguments oh no it's not it's a bit for me is insulting\nTo some mind now and has suffered so much\nThat they are being covered by that piece of red button kit with this Hummer and a hundred cause that sickle sickle yeah I'm right\nIf I mean it's brutal

like when I saw this it's like a rebellious teenager has just gotten a camera for the first time what is up with the finger\nIs just so sad to survey about ... now I realize that don't do that anymore because I'm a girl older you know and the U.S individual in this society what else do I mean it's just give out your opinions\nSo you spent a lot of time in the United states do you feel you can still

human rights\nBut deeply us also costs and a lot of problem for other people from other nations for broader human rights violations\nI mean I asked partly because you live in Berlin now but I understand you're moving to New York with your family right yes so I Know you've described to us as a country of immigrants which I think a lot of people would agree with but president Donald Trump

allergy or\nDo young enough to take the challenge and have a vision and a and a half of the big heart so if they don't then they will push people way they'll blame other people and uh it just shows that we can is\nAnd if that big heart starts to shrink while you're here you're going to turn your eye and your critics toward the United states or at least make your critics in your art of China more universal and maybe aligned to the u._s.\nI always protect the basic rights of freedom of speech and uh humor I I don't see that the only as a Chinese problem is universal problem\nI weigh thank you

a globally important service keeping carbon out of the atmosphere free of charge\nSo the permafrost that we have here was formed probably in the during the last ice age though like eleven thousand years or so ago and the material in the ... is that old like it is made out of material from finds that used to grow at that time\nAnd the remains of dead end\nAllies Bones Are petrified wood to actual stuff\nAnd all of this organic material had a lot of carbon in it in fact that's what the word organic means organic chemistry is carbon chemistry so when ... says the soil has a lot of dead plant in it she means we put our carbon in the freezer\nYeah we have and now we're unfortunately kind of taking the owner of the freezer and let's start when she saw\nAnd so then one permafrost ... starts to truly thought than than carbon just kind of comes like how does the carbon get from down there to up into the atmosphere um because microbes are eating it and they are aspiring so they are breathing\nBasically and then they emit carbon\nSo it's a macro breath that we have to worry about\nBasically [laughter] microbes when living things die microbes begin breaking them down and the carbon that was locked up in a blade of grass or the horn up a basin gets liberated and floats up into the atmosphere at ... or carbon dioxide\nFreezing slows microbes down but it doesn't kill them

conditions groups of scientists art work around the Arctic studying sites that are ... are drier colder or warmers with more or less vegetation\nAnd they're all trying to understand just how quickly these billions of tons of carbon might be released\nI think the the scary part is that we don't know what an extra four degrees of warming will do to this huge amount of carbon bookstore tearing it from [noise] we're trying to actively to figure that out [noise]\nYour team says it's hard to accurately assess greenhouse emissions from Arctic soil because the whole system is so complex\nBut it's also hard because humans have never won the planet up like we are now we have nothing to compare this to at least from our species perspective wearing what climate scientists call a new analog
