native ... and getting out the vote I Know standing voted it is a campaign geared toward native populations in the U.S and in a big part of it it has to do with the Supreme Court upholding this North Dakota vote voter id law what does that law sang\nIt basically says that ah unless you have a a street address on your id in North Dakota you aren't allowed to vote\nMost of the people who live on reservations\nDon't actually have a a a physical street address they use PO box is\nSo now that the Supreme Court has upheld that law what can people on reservations in North Dakota do are coming up

dropping spy on one another but they shouldn't be doing in such open crass\nWays that seems to have gotten a bit last year you know as soon as being more reported on as you well you know this is just another son that Trump doesn't do what he's doing that he's reckless that he's endangering the security of everybody and hasn't generated nearly as much heat and save the letter bomb story which is\nThe reaction that Kristof described in Greece is exactly the same reaction that's happened here where they're saying that Trump has brought this on himself he's ratcheted up the tension um that's

Greece's lot smaller than Germany so it doesn't commands or tension here probably as much as we come in there the tension there but I think this sense is that you know the Greeks has done a pretty good job of trying to get the\nEconomic problems under control they basically don't watch the Germans have asked to them and that they should be given a break and of course\nYou're ... medical has
