shouldn't be judged for the actions of a man he never knew\nOur lives never overlap he died sixteen years before I was born so when I Do know about him I Know through reading about it from the same materials you have access to so I can only speak about it from a historical standpoint there's no personal connection time and space would allow him [laughter]\nAnd so you know what I Do know about

background and family but an hunters alleged crimes\nYou lost his way in Washington and I think there was a a kind of a slippery slope that he went on it turned to self interest and now it's leading to self destruction\nAccomplish are also says he wants to keep his campaign positive his platform emphasizes affordable health care bill ... training and clean energy reserves were\nWorse when he talks to voters companies are emphasizes need to get beyond today's tried to call it ...\nIt's not the right word for all of the nation\nFrom Jason race a military veteran who often votes Republican likes what she hears from companies are even no policy wise\nI'm not a hundred percent in agreement with everything [noise] um I think he's got to be character and I think he means the best for America and for this district and so he's got my vote\nUntil hunters indictment ... campaign was considered a long shot and even in the wake up in the indictment hunter skill leads in the polls but companies are is counting unsteady demographic changes in his district including a growing Latino and Arab American population\nIs the biggest county in so Christian Iraqi population outside of Michigan in Iraq is thirty five percent Latino we're sitting in a place where as can be the worst thirty percent of all the voters love and it's a majority minority city and and\nYou think because of those changes more receptive yeah you and your ... and in the last few weeks of campaigning companies are says he's ready for a political dirty tricks that tried to use his heritage and family's past against him\nHere's the thing I didn't wake up and become Latina Arab American when I started running so all the all the intrigued that comes with that and all the trials and tribes that come with having a diverse background and the opportunity and challenges of that I've carried my whole life for the world Saul Gonzalez San Diego\nUSA Today published an opinion piece and by President Trump today drop attack the plans with some Democrats to expand Medicare to include everyone Trump called that socialism here's a quote the new Democrats are radical socialist who want to model America's economy after Venezuela which got us wondering about\nIt Patrick ... theory reports on language for us so people on the right Patrick of long attack their opponents for being socialists what's different now Trump used the word today\nWas funny you know this in a way there's nothing different from what people have been saying for decades about socialism like basically it was just a stand and communism right\nNow though some elected politicians on the left or she embracing socialism you think of bunny son does New York congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio Cortez they identify a social or what a socialist means\nFor for a democratic socialist down the value for me that I Believe that in a modern moral and wealthy society no ... for the last [noise]\nPretty Sanders a cause of Cortez they use the term democratic socialist what what does that tell us because it kind of a branding their socialism away from Marcus revolution and communism as you were saying\nYeah I think that's what they're trying to argue and its way because to somebody like me who grew up in Europe it really isn't a stretch I you know I'm used to hearing about political parties during the Cold War who called himself socialist sold at least they openly supported socialist values\nAnd nobody was espousing mocks his revolution I Know that wasn't the case here in the U.S if you were a socialist he might as well that's just been a Soviet spy like socialism was a political ...\nYeah right I mean even the white Trump use the word today kind of has its genetics and the red scare and the Nineteen fifties in the McCarthy witch hunt so what kind of support that socialism or democratic socialism if they call it that what kind of support does it happen to us right now\nWell I think we'll get some clues from the results in the midterms\nBut there are other indications too I mean for one thing you have people on the right attacking socialism far more frequently than they used to lead the idea of socialism has become very popular among young people like Ben Shapiro who's a relatively young conservative commentator he was barely alive when the Berlin Wall came down\nAnd they framed socialism as you know the opposite\nOf capitalism capitalism is good because capitalism is freedom socialism is advocates socialism is charity not an aspect of journey socialism itself is cheering\nAlso mark ... democratic socialist of America on the eve of Donald Trump's election that membership was less than ten thousands today it stands up more than fifty two thousand you know no big but it's growing\nYeah and that's interesting when you think about Trump's inkling of Venezuela it's the opposite trend where the Chevy Chase a socialist it pretty much all headed for the exits except for the loyal died in the little ones anyway fascinating Patrick Cox thanks very much You're welcome ...\nFood [noise] for the soul\nOf Islam in\nComing up as hurricane Michael brings pain to the Gulf Coast the U.S military confronts
