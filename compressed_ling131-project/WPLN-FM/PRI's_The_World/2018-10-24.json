not just over trade and tariffs earlier this month and a major speech vice president Mike Pence took aim at China's leaders\nThere contesting America's geopolitical advantages been trying in essence to change the international order in their favor under President Trump's leadership the United states has taken decisive action to respond to China with American action\nOther areas of friction include the south China Sea Taiwan human rights intellectual property not to mention President Trump accusing China of meddling in the mid term election campaign David Rennie writes the blog one column and the economy is so big question David here is this a new Cold War with China\nIt doesn't have to be on China is extremely keen that it should not be they don't even want to trade will and they are pretty desperate to avoid one end to work out what America wants\nBought it used to be just a few hard liners here in Beijing who saw that America actually couldn't be negotiated with the America wanted to contain China and to stop China's rise\nThat fringe of hard line is is now spreading an awful lot of Chinese leaders look up the speech by vice president Mike Pence attacking China for a a kind of laundry list of complaints\nThey look at how Donald Trump isn't really engaging when it comes to winding down this potential trade ... and they're starting to wonder whether there was fear\nMight actually be what's happening to them which is that just as they were poised to become a kind of great superpower or the top of the sudden economic totem pole America in its last kind of\nDying vengeance is a kind of aging have him on has decided to try and stop them and so that is the that is the question that Beijing leaders are skiing and they absolutely will not looking for this fight right now that busy trying to become rich and powerful than others has come out of out of the blue cap the\nWell the Trans Pacific partnership or TPP that was supposed to give us some leverage with some of the those issues like intellectual property rights but Trump pulled out of it\nRetired very senior American officials in Beijing last week and it was off the record so I Can't name in it but he was a kind of household name in this day and he comes to trying to a lot for business or an stokes the Chinese they take advice from him\nAnd he had a small dinner for a group of us in Beijing we're discussing what Donald Trump wants on you know I was discussing having into the Trump he times about China went understood in DC I kind of put it to him and he was kind of uncomfortable but then said that maybe there was something to this that\nThe problem is that the machine and Washington\nHas kind of systematic structural things that it wants China to do\nDifferently to play by the rules to try and fix the world trade older as you say Marco to you know to what was something like the ... everyone opens their markets that will do look Trump I don't think is a systems kind of guy I think he has a number of very powerful very instinctive ideas and I think\nIf you look at what he's been saying about China on trade it's almost as if you know he's a real estate guy and he thinks of the American market the American economy as a fantastically valuable piece of real estate\nAnd that previous presidents in America's administrations were too dumb and to\nKind of kindly to charge enough rent to the rest of the world the access to that market and so it's like you know don't Trump's back in his real estate days he's he he he owns a valuable property this time it's called the United states and it's time to review the rent and it's not going to be pleasant for the guy on the other side of the table but\nThere isn't gonna biggest structural kind of vision of how to run the world trading older it's just it's time you paid a lot more rent\nFive I think that's the core of what Donald Trump is up to right now what is China's vision for the world\nSo he was really interesting saying the Chinese joined the world Trade Organization Seventeen years ago and have basically been gaming the system ever since uh China\nChina is very interesting world power because China has an incredibly clear vision of where it wants to end up it has a very clear and gold and you know broadly that's to be one of the world's most powerful to countries and so powerful that no one else gets to say no to them\nThat's the go how'd they get that\nIs not actually so important that quite opportunistic if one policy looks ... they'll try another\nIf there's too much pushback then there'll be nice for but that's very very kind of\nCross through by feeding the the Chinese kind of fries and and for a long time they gave me the world trading system and that was how they liked it well it's really interesting about this last few months to trade tensions and you get this when he talked to a European government leaders have been talking to the Chinese visiting Beijing\nIt turns out that the one thing that the Chinese dislike\nMore than an American led worlds trading order is no rules a tool and so suddenly the Chinese are being undermined the rules gaming the rules playing the system so I think they realize that the one thing they do want to do is to lose the system completely so suddenly the Chinese are\nQuite in the order of reforming the company's CEO and no longer kind of cheating so much so there is all this kind of this will be moving parts where you could actually see something quite positive\nComments is the problem is\nThat you can also see some very negative kind of forces the crew to feed off each other and we could go the wrong direction\nOr I'm absolutely confident that the Chinese don't actually know how to play this ... because\nReasonably senior Chinese officials are now working their way down to list the people who can explain watching them and they got ... down the list there are people like me and I literally have conversations with what I say I'm a reporter it's not my job to tell you you know how to handle the Americans but they're all ski everyone is this trade war avoidable\nGraham Allison over at Harvard coined the phrase a few cities trap tell us what that is and how the Chinese see it\nA sponsor coming up against the status quo wealthy paw Athens it ended up inevitably legions of war and so he analyzed a number of occasions I have a human history where\nThe state has ... finds itself being challenged by an upstart and in a depressing number of cases that does triggered armed conflict I mean you could be an optimist in say the Chinese are busy trying to get rich\nThat trying to become more powerful they are absolutely not looking to start a Cold War they don't have time for this they don't have time even for a trade war let alone a shooting war so they're just not going to stall sentencing um and actually I didn't think told Trump is to particularly militaristic\nMan I mean he's the kind of the guy who got any number of photons from Vietnam I think he's not physically a kind of war like person these kind of ... soft handed kind of New York real estate guy\nUm so I think as people itching to go to war but the dynamics can get a bit away from you when you've got these two big big countries but no longer think that they ah\nConfined win win solutions you know this does feel weirdly zero some now it feels as though the American charges that China's rise is at America's expense\nAnd that this is a kind of wouldn't before trying to get so big that it's too late to stop it\nIt's it's a window to try and ... there was this ... thing Donald Trump said I think it was in the U.N General assembly speech when he said the previous president subset of\nBeing ready to watch China rise to become the world's most powerful country and the on his watch that wasn't going to happen quite so see that's a really extraordinary statements and you know previous American presidents said you know if you're going to rise let's make sure you rise in the right way\nYou're going to rise as a responsible stakeholder remember that phrase that people used to use about China that it was going to become a kind of a member of the grace and good ah uphold the international order along with everyone else but Sedona Trump to say at least as a piece of rhetoric\nYou're just not going to grow rice and the way that you thought you were going to I'm going to stop it\nThat that is an incredibly bleak thing for Beijing to hit\nDavid Rennie of the economist speaking with us from Beijing

preserved shipwreck long at the bottom of the black sea off the coast of Bulgaria it is so old how old is it it made it back to a time when Aristotle was alive hard to believe\nThis rock was found by a team of researchers using a remote controlled submarine they found more than sixty shipwrecks and total deep and the black sea including this one Seventy five foot Greek trading vessel which they estimate has been lying under water for the past two thousand four hundred years\nWhich they say might make this the oldest intact shipwreck ever discovered professor John Adams was the principal
