I make meaningful and your ... and they can and injustice by my bad about a\nReporter and you know the economy in Mexico city wrote about ... he bought a remarkable advocate for women's soccer in Mexico mysteriously and brutally murdered in a thank you very much for\nTelling us about motivator no problem thank Cape\nIt's been three weeks we're still trying to unravel the mystery of Saudi journalist Jamal ... disappearance and suspected murder the Saudi Arabian authorities denied having anything to do with it now they admit ... died inside the Saudi consulate and assemble as a result of a fight\nFew are buying it all along President Trump is facing mounting pressure to punish Saudi Arabia if it did murder ... for the president has been reluctant to do that in part because he says American Jobs are at stake\nSix hundred thousand jobs maybe more than the and he would be very hurtful to this country if we are we're not going to sell it to you\nSo how many Americans would lose their jobs of President Trump stopped selling weapons to the Saudis arms and security analyst William Hartung studies weapon sales at the center for international policy we looked in a crunch the numbers\nSix hundred thousand jobs in that clip just a moment ago how many us defense jobs actually depend on Saudi Arabia\n[noise] well it's hard to know precisely but you know a year and a half ago the president said it was forty thousand jobs there hasn't been a major platform where they've actually signed a deal since President Trump came into office so\nEven if they you know decided to get rid of some had made under Obama we'd be talking thousands or at most tens of thousands of jobs not six hundred thousand or even a million which he said uh the other day as well you know in the economy with a hundred and thirty million people employed it's just a blip I mean obviously if you work in a particular factory\nWhere things are built that are being sold to the Saudis it's a different matter but it's for our economy as a whole it's certainly not much and certainly not a reason to arm of murderous regime that's not only kill the journalist but is bombing thousands of people in Yemen\nThe president talks about Saturday contracts with Boeing and Raytheon you're saying that those contracts date back to the Obama administration so just tell us how many deals are currently signed and what have the Saudis paid for\nThere was a big here in the Obama period where they offered sixty billion dollars worth of weapons all in a couple of packages so not all of us have gone through but at Fifteen fighter planes Apache attack helicopters those happened were worth tens of billions of dollars\nSome of that money is already flowed they've started delivering the fifteenth so the\nMoney as water under the bridge it's already been spent we're not going to see it again it would be hard for them to interrupt a deal that's in mid flow because allegedly they need these systems so what's actually on the table that might changes to jail for a missile defense system called fab which was introduced during the Trump period and they've got to agree on the details so\nIn theory the Saudis could say well you know this particular deal we're not going to go through with\nAnd is there any risk if Trump or to ... that in China or Russia would pick up any of the business\nSaudi Arabia is whole military is built on us in UK supplied weapons communications and maintenance and spare parts they would take a long time to turn that around\nSo William just give us the big picture here how important is the defense industry like all the jobs from planning to production and how much of the U.S economy depends on defense goods and how much is that is reliant on Saudi Arabia\nWell everything the Pentagon spends accounts for about three and a half percent of our entire economy\nAnd not all that as weapons and then the Saudi peace has a tiny fraction of that less than a tenth of a percent I Would say so it's really for the national economy it's not really important at all it's marginal it's it's really important and very specific places where a particular bomb is built for a particular aircraft\nI mean it's hard to know why President Trump wheels out numbers that actually aren't totally accurate but if you had to guess why do you think he would be bringing those numbers way way up I think partly\nHe likes to show up and sort of a master dealmaker who's getting the best deal for the American people in the American worker and you can see that as trade policy as well\nBut also I think he's trying to change the conversation away from the crimes of the Saudi regime because he wants to team up with them a and going after Iran\nWilliam Hartung the director of the arms and security project at the center for international policy in Washington thanks very much for explaining this to us thank you [noise]\nThe day's top news headlines just a minute away this is the world\nAnd that's the thing that they were kind of semi nomadic um we didn't have permanent settlements and that sort of thing\nBut all of that changed in the early Nineteen hundreds when the U.S government and the Lutheran Church came to coastal Alaska and build churches in schools it was an extension of the colonization process that had already swept through the lower forty eight states\nAlaska Native people were told they had to send their kids to the new schools or risk having them taken away\nOver time the population of this part of the coast concentrated on Sarah chap island so this thing called development committed these people to a spot which turns out to be directly in harm's way\nWorse case scenario of course is a storm comes at it and forces them off that land um this year\nThat's Joel climate again at the Interior Department she set out to get federal agencies to help protect people in coastal Alaska from the threats of rapid climate change ... and other towns were already engaged in planning her own solutions but the sticking point was money\nMoving a whole town is a complicated inexpensive affair one federal study peg the cost of living ... at a hundred and Seventy nine million dollars\nAnd ... doesn't have that kind of money they don't have any kind of money actually forty percent of people live below the poverty line many homes don't have running water but Congress was not supportive of helping them make the move many members weren't and still aren't willing to accept that human caused climate change is even real\nThe funding dollars was very difficult we did manage to get some good money as some grant program spun up but the boys just embarrassingly difficult to find those dollars within the federal government\nIn twenty sixteen right before leaving office President Obama signed an executive order protecting marine resources and the ... sea and setting up a new structure for helping Arctic community\nThat was optimistic that would finally bringing meaningful action for ... and he thought it would stand up under the new Trump Administration\nFrankly despite all the anti climate change rhetoric of these new folks uh I wasn't worried about climate change adaptation because ... you know you're\nYou're addressing issues that are very clear in front of you people are being directly impacted by climate change it's not a model it's not a theory it's fact and of course I was being very naive\nLess than four months into the new administration President Trump revoked Obama's executive order the project was dead\nIt was a clear shot across the bow that have a doesn't matter whether you're working on reducing greenhouse gas emissions or protecting people imperil anything that has a with climate change to it\nHas to stop then a few months later Clinton got reassigned to a totally unrelated job for which he had no qualifications and he wasn't alone\nWhen I found out that dozens more senior executives like me had been reassigned I realized that it was that I was part of a purge\nClimate found a lawyer and filed a whistle blower complaint which is still pending he also wrote an op ed in the Washington Post and started speaking publicly about what's at stake not just his and his colleagues jobs but the people of many coastal Alaskan communities\nI mean government should be scrambling to try and find ways and dollars to get people out of harm's way and find innovative ways to do that it's what government does and that's what's appalling about this\nWhat would you say to people who are like um well it's your problem why should the state of Alaska or the federal government or anyone else help you if you need two hundred million dollars to move go find two hundred million dollars and good luck to you\nYeah well they'll they'll be saying the same thing to Miami pretty soon right so I mean what happens up there are in the face of climate change is an important bellwether for what's going to happen and the rest of the coastal areas of the United states right I mean\nWe're all American citizens and we have some expectation that we're not on her own right and and that's one of the things that makes this country great [noise]\n\nI reached out twice to the department of interior for comment but they did not respond\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nSo given how tenuous the situation is why don't people just leave ... raff like if they can't relocate the whole village why don't the residents just go somewhere else no more fair banks or Seattle\nThat's a that's a cultural death to these communities each one of these villages is its own distinct culture their own distinct dialect to ask them suggests assimilate into another village somewhere a is to ask them to let go their culture entirely which I think is is horrible [noise]\nEveryone I met ... seem to agree on this they want to stay together people here depend on subsistence hunting to feed their families and that food is shared with elders and others who can't go out and hunt\nIn fact people insured rough rely on each other for all of the essential for life they visit each other when they're sick they take care of each other's kids and they know that their future\nDepends on keeping those relationships intact\nBlow to restructure Dick or ... or ... for ... you know such a way I view\nThis is Stan Lee talked to the vice mayor of ...\nAnd ... D work community you know it come from families that are really good for this community was like a real big family\nStanley's on the search and rescue team here and he knows better than anyone just how bad things could seem get he is frustrated by the indifference in Washington or\n... or ... or proven movement climate change or not\nOr or um you know ... is a case study and how climate change can be understood in isolation from history and politics that community is where it is in large part because outside institutions wanted to exert control over these people and their way of life\nThe United states government was very effective when it wanted to make people settled in this particular place but it's so far proven completely ineffective and helping them to get out now that it's clear they need to relocate\nFor America to over ... director George world country\nJoe Clement says that we're likely to lose at least one coastal Alaskan village within the next ten years it could be ...\nAnd it doesn't take much imagination at all to picture it the winds wailing the waves rising and the frigid water rolling and crashing over this island on a dark winter night\nIt's a nightmare scenario and it's completely possible that's why Stanley talked he says they need to relocate and they need to do it together\nWe're not trying to make a new or were my show were drawn to build these do for them ... took her to elect a runoff [noise]\n\nOn some of the nights in the far north son never really sat and the kids have ... for taking full advantage of the endless twilight [noise] eight year old Walter night puck takes a break from the swirling kid mosh pit to catch his breath and ponder the universal rituals of childhood\nMostly chasing the boys [laughter]\nThese kids show no sign of getting tired but I'm ready for bed and as I Walk away the sounds of their pop up playground or quickly drowned out\nHundreds that's two hundred stuff\nOne of the climate change buzz words right now is resilient the people that are ...\nExperts in it they've been practicing it for a long long time and what they're asking for is basically the right to keep practicing resilience they just call it by a different name [noise]\n\nFor the world I'm Amy Martin ...
