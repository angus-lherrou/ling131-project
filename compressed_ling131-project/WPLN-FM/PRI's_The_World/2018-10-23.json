marker woman and you're with the world bank for being with us this Tuesday\nDrop administration says it is serious the U.S will soon officially pull out of a major nuclear arms treaty with Russia it's an agreement the U.S signed with the former Soviet Union more than Thirty years ago earlier today during his visit to Moscow national security adviser John Bolton confirmed the move\nI think this recognizes the change reality and I think given Russian violations of the treaty as well so you have to rely on the facts on the grounds of\nThe eye and F agreement that back to Nineteen eighty seven I enough stance for intermediate range nuclear forces it puts restrictions on the U.S and Russia from testing and producing certain types of nuclear missiles Heather ... is with the think tank New America\nAs the the word intermediate implies I'm\nIn the days of the Cold War these were were missiles that were that were designed to fight a war between the U.S and the Soviet Union on the territory of Europe and understandably Europeans really didn't like that idea very much so in order for us to maintain facing and other defense programs aimed at\nThe Soviet Union from European territory Americans thought it would be smart to have this deal which would make it harder to accidentally\nOn purpose wind up in a war that would\nDecimate incinerate Europe and leaves the U.S and Russia relatively untouched and for twenty five years this treaty was a huge success in in making a nuclear exchange in continental Europe unsinkable\nAnd you know what's really happened in the last say five to ten years is that tensions have ratcheted up and\nRussia has changed its its military posture I'm In ways that are at odds with the treaty Russian say the U.S has introduced defenses\nUm missile civil liberties that are they say are at odds with treaty and so the idea of of war and even nuclear war in the heart of Europe isn't as unsinkable as it was when this treaty was signed and for most of his life\nTo some people wearing in on the U.S pulling out of this deal have called it the most severe crisis in nuclear arms control since the Nineteen eighties or other people have been more tempered how do you see them move\nI think that that statement is a little overblown and I would be careful in saying what the most severe crisis is less than other more severe one come along quickly behind it um look\nThere's no question as I said that that Russia is is violating the terms of the treaty is is building weapons and testing weapons that explicitly violate the terms of the treaty so you know it's fair I think\nFor supporters of the Trump Administration to say no that's the real crisis I'm the real crisis is that Moscow is aggressively testing missiles that target Europe and wants Europe to be afraid that in a crisis Moscow would would you stop you know a secondary\nL.

misses the world\nIt is a huge number of people are walking together five to seven thousand migrants across the board of this week from Guatemala into southern Mexico from here in the u._s. it's become a political issue ahead of the midterms President Trump strikes they conspiratorial tone when he says hardened criminals and middle Easterners are heading toward the U.S\nThose claims have no evidence by the way\nThe Mexican government is handling the situation as a humanitarian one Danielle beyond is a former spokesman in President Enrique opinion yet the government he's now a political consultant\nBeyond says Mexico's government is currently walking a tightrope\nOn the one hand you have your ally and your biggest partner putting pressure on you and also ... and I think the fact that you need to protect your own borders and you're you're only as\nWell on the other hand there's like the whole movement in the public opinion of Mexico's saying guys we should drink the Central America as as we require the American\nTo increase economic prosperity and those countries and strengthen institutions they can learn a lot of issues with corruption so that's one of our our major programs going into these countries and and one of the programs that the president you know in reality is threatening to the end\nSo regardless of how much eventually get stripped out of the this budget lawn for a Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador can the Trump Administration or any other administration without approval of Congress to slash the aid package to a country\nLooking at the law as it might be possible that he has the ability to transfer maybe ten percent of what has been appropriated but now he cannot do that you know laterally and of course because Congress isn't in session now if he really wanted to to end it to these countries have really need to wait until they come back in session after November\nOr how political do see this move being as it's only about Trump believes will play well with Republican voters prior to the midterms\nYeah absolutely President Trump ran immigration he saw that issue when him the election and I think he thinks that it is a good one for Republicans going into the midterms\nSo this caravan effectively as a political guests to him and Republicans in that they can play this up they can play themselves up as the party that is hard line on immigration and that will\nSave the country quote unquote from this caravan\nTrump made this announcement yesterday have you heard any news from Honduras or El Salvador Guatemala or about what could happen if as much as forty percent of the state gets caught\nI think the northern triangle country and Mexico as well are are doing a good job of trying to\nWeed through what's coming out from the president and what's coming out in the press and and try to stick to what's actually happening on the ground they recognized that we have a very eminent election in the country and they're just trying to stick with what they think will will actually come so I haven't heard a lot of\nReal concern on the ground up around that aid\nAnd just because it seems so unlikely that that Congress would go through with a threat like that\nAnd what is your organization the migration Policy Institute planning in terms of strategy to to take this on anything\nFor us we're really looking at those reforms to asylum like I mentioned earlier we actually published a report last month\nAdvocating for certain reforms to the asylum system including changing asylum for individuals who are applying at our border like this care of and so that and it operates more efficiently because right now if if anyone in the care of and apply for asylum\nThey'll likely be placed in our immigration court backlog which stretches on for years so lovely waiting in the United states and the way down the line and immigration court judge will have to pick up their case and started from scratch and see if it's in sincere asylum application\nIn reality we'd like to see a a more efficient system operating at the southern border so where we're working really hard to to kind of push out that idea and and stress the importance of granting asylum to those who merit it\nSurreptitiously policy analyst at the migration Policy Institute in Washington Thank you for your time\nThank you for having me [noise]\n\nDo
