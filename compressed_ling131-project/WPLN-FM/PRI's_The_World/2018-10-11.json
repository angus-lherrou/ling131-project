very tough and we have investigators over there and we're working with turkey and frankly we're working with Saudi Arabia we want to find out what happened\nThe Turkish government disputes that us investigators are working with them and the question remains about just how tough Trump might be with the Saudis it's a key relationship for the U.S and follow us judges of the London School of economics says the consequences would be huge if relations become further strained\nWhat you have is an American president who use the world through the lens of the business I'm profit prioritize

[noise]\n\n\nI'm Carol hills this is the world it's less than a month to limited terms and if it seems like the whole country is a political battlefield well it's pretty much the case Republicans and Democrats are in a fierce fight for control of the country's political agenda and the age of Trump the whole world's watching\nAmong other things this election season is seeing an unprecedented wave of female candidates and the trend extends to red states and less prominent offices the world's repetition noise spent time with one candidate in Arizona where rapidly changing demographics have got both parties paying close attention\nI never wanted to be a candidate\nJanuary ... swears she never wanted to be doing this\nShaking hands and raising money for a campaign even though she says people urge her to run after she served as an advisor to Janet Napolitano Arizona's last democratic governor I think are many many ways to serve and it doesn't have to be as a candidate but last year with President Donald Trump in office\nAnd Republicans in control of Congress\nHer son Noah remembers when he learned of his mom's plans to change\nThat we were at a dinner table and then dad said we talked this over and your mom's orange run to the attorney general Arizona\nAnd it was a high school freshmen who still rubbing in science this Sunday Morning we're in a union hall after one country versus campaign of\nYour number what your first reaction and author\nYour first question was what's attorney general I you're running for governor [laughter]\nLike me and Luke is remember yours for older son Lucas is a high school junior first response was order the commercials are going to say about\nYou know he worried that political attack ads would target contrary for being Latina she's fourth generation Arizona and and pro immigrant right\nOn the way to another event a fundraiser in a gated community contrary says that was a powerful moment for her one son asking about the risks people face when running for office the other asking why she wasn't taking a bigger risk for a more prominent position\nThere are a lot of people who don't know what the attorney general does but after\nServing in the Obama administration and creating a nonprofit that provides free legal services can trailer is as attorney general may help decide things like whether Arizona will try to repeal the Affordable CARE Act or Obamacare\nShe wants to keep it the Republican incumbent mark Bernadette doesn't\nAnd had Arizona joined other states that argued the Affordable CARE Act is unconstitutional

country Democrats hope that with Latino candidates like ... and David Garcia for governor more Latinos\nWill vote and can tourists says she hopes that Latinos see in her someone like them someone they can trust but she also knows that Latinos in Arizona don't see themselves as a single group\nWe don't always\nSee issues from that lens but we certainly can see when others are trying to constantly make issues about ethnicity from the other side and that is I think something that we will stand up for it and reject because I think it's clear to a lot of people\nIncluding Latinos that there are people\nIn power right now who want to treat\nUs as second class citizens\nThat may have helped spur a record turnout in the primaries last month with a big showing by democratic voters are loose drivers confirmed he'll be one of them in next month's election\nAnd contrary confidence as she heads into her fundraiser\nI think that the rest of the country to watch Arizona and watch a wake up in\nArizona is a state going through big changes this'll be the first election after Republican Senator John McCain passed away\nSenator Jeff flake seat is also open he was openly critical of Trump and won't run again your support another longtime Arizona figure former Sheriff Joe Arpaio was in the running for like see he's well known for being tough on undocumented immigrant\nAnd many people here are just\nPile was not out in the primary Republican\nThat Republicans are vulnerable with some promises unfulfilled\nThey have not yet ... they are not yet you know gotten rid of Obamacare and so you have a certain amount of\nFrustration within one party's base and a great deal of energy in the opposition parties base and that's what can make these midterms are challenged\nBut ... says Republicans are entrenched in Arizona and they brought more resources into the state this election cycle using more database strategies to target voters card says Trump and his plans for an expanded border wall or popular among GOP voters here including let the you know\nYou know the idea of the Latino they'd been this monolithic both good moves in a single direction really isn't true the highest rating Hispanics Latinos in in Arizona the last several years have all been Republican and a lot of Hispanics in Arizona who are here legally\nTend to be some of the strongest advocates for border security so they don't respond to ensure that knee jerk fashion that if you're secure borders that means you don't like brown people\nSo crowd scoffs at the idea that Latino candidates like ... could draw enough new voters for Democrats to win\nThis is a Republican state is going to get crushed\nWelcome January first a fundraiser scribes doesn't people\nControl the questions about mass incarceration children in foster care and immigrant families in detention contrasts response that her role as state attorney general is limited but she'll do what you can and joined other attorneys general in their fight against the Trump Administration I think the bottom\nThis is a moment where I'm running for attorney general this is one line on your ballot but people in Arizona right now are choosing what version of Arizona they believe in and will that be in Arizona where we come together where we are fighting for one another or\nGoing to be in Arizona that adopted us versus them for a longer period of time [noise]\nSome polls show the Arizona attorney general race\nAs tight others give the Republican candidate a clear edge it contrasts wins she'll be the first Latina to hold the position if she loses she says she'll do what she's always done find other ways to serve for the world ... in Tucson, Arizona [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nComing up the rare case of an accused Chinese fine apprehended in Belgium and brought to the U.S to face charges hand when us tariffs on Chinese goods hit workers in a Chinese factory right here in the U. S. you're with the world [noise]\nAre you able to tell us the name of that company [noise] I don't think so\nYou know of cases though where American companies who've had a things stolen from them in ... you know technology and and secret and have they ever been able to litigate cases\nAs a matter of fact they have and uh the situation is really improving in China you go back Twenty years and the Chinese didn't have much in terms of\nA legislation for protecting intellectual property\nBut over this period the legislation has improved quite markedly now in force meant has remained a challenge but even enforcement is improving\nThe big exception is in trade secrets for our companies that remains probably the biggest area of ... intellectual property that is difficult to protect why\nBecause there isn't a proper legislation on this and uh I Know that the Chinese are working on it and the U.S or over the years have worked with the Chinese in capacity building\nIn other areas of pie and this one seems to be like the last frontier um but uh but we're all working\nOn it still [noise] what's the threats that comes with trade secrets theft is a security threat an economic one or both well\nI Would say uh in\nIn the case that we are reading about this alleged the ministry of security person it's it's both um in most of the cases in which I was involved it was really most economic your technology has been stolen and products like yours\nAre being produced um and so your market share\nThen Trump has been really vocal about China stealing us intellectual property but presumably this has been happening for a while or way before Trump ... is the problem getting worse or is it just that President Trump has decided to be more vocal about it than previous presidents\nIt's the latter I don't see that the problem is getting worse\nUh and in some ways I think this trade friction that we're uh we're now in the middle of the um I think that the real crux of this issue is reciprocal treatment\nA U. S. I. P. violations have been going on for a long time and the U.S has talked with China for years about this but we have never before applied pressure\nYou know I feel that we've had this grand bargain with China for a long time in which\nWe knew these things were going on and we would talk with the Chinese about it and yet we wouldn't apply the leverage because we were also benefitting from the relationship we were getting less expensive good consumers were happy companies were making money even political leaders\nTheir voters were getting a less expensive product and stretching dollars and it just came to a tipping point and and so now we're applying pressure uh so I think the approach that we're taking\nWe have to the U.S that is has to come with the idea that OK you've been doing these things but we have been more or less complicit because we really didn't apply pressure until very recently\nWilliam Zarit is chairman of the nonprofit American Chamber of commerce in China he's been speaking to us from Beijing thanks so much thank you\nMore now on the strained business relationships between Chinese companies and the U.S only this story is mostly about the effect of tariffs on American workers a few years ago Massachusetts wanted to make a big order for new subway cars for the Boston area but there was one stipulation they had to be made in Massachusetts\nEnter the Chinese runaway rolling stock corporation or see our our seat the company won the contract and build a factory about a hundred miles from Boston well that was before the new trade war between the U.S and China under President Trump\nNow the future of the factory and it's a well paid workers is in doubt Adam Reilly from our partners here at W. GBH in Boston has the story\nWhen you pull off to the CRC plants in Springfield, Massachusetts the first thing you notice is the size two hundred thousand square feet sprawled over once vacant\nLot stuff inside and you see just a fraction of that space is currently in youth though the activity there is intense\nRight now see are RCs workers you're building six cars for Boston's transit system\nBy twenty twenty there'll be sending eight new cars per month eventually delivering more than four hundred that's good news for riders seems to shabby decks even better news for workers like Eric Anderson I was a cook better cook for about seven years than CRC a massive state owned Chinese company\nOpen this facility on Springfield side Anderson got assembly job significant hey how you probably have doubled with the benefit from what I was making also reaping the benefits in the south moved from Vermont for his job as a mechanical assemble\nIf I'm perfectly all over the water up there currently but I'm aware of especially\nIn this field the coming years should bring more solid blue collar jobs like theirs to Springfield CRC built subway cars not just for Boston but also for Philadelphia in LA now there's a hitch significant uncertainty like depressing\nI Know junior yet so far the new tariffs and new policies have an impact on our manufacturing and also are CRC\nJob both who spoke with us through an interpreter because the vice president of see our our ... Massachusetts operation and she says since some of the parts used here are imported from\nChina the Trump administration's tariff to ... million new cost there's also bipartisan interest in banning CRC from bidding on federal projects and even talk of labeling the company a national security threat\nCritics say CRC under bids to gain market dominance and the technology on its vehicles could be used for surveillance but shot instead the\nCompany is a force for good ...\nCRC as that point here in the United states to say we have a long a growing plants\nAnd where ... brain benefits for taxpayers here that's sad from twenty twenty why that job creation will flee from there if there is no additional new authors coming on board regarding to the terrorists and the new restrictions on the company which\nIs why politicians like Springfield mayor dominance Arnold in democratic congressman Richard Neal want the Trump Administration\nTo reconsider also hoping the president ships course Jon ...\nYou know this day and age in Springfield we need the manufacturing we haven't had manufacturing here in the years\n... is the business for sheet metal workers local sixty three and he's real spicy RCs embrace union labor\nIs over a hundred and twenty union workers from Springfield Americans\nBut now he says Trump's approach is jeopardizing that you're going to possibly put them out of work\nIf they can't get contracts they kick you know maintain this building and I do believe he wants to put people to work but yet I don't think he realizes the impact of what he's doing over here\nThen again CRC now plans to circumvent Trump's tariffs by shifting the production of certain parts for China to the u._s. which could mean more new jobs not last and convinced the president's supporters he knows exactly what he's doing for the world\nAdam Reilly Springfield, Massachusetts\nWe take another look at trade tomorrow only this story will be all about North America dairy farmers and President Trump\nCanada what they've done is your dairy farm workers is a disgrace\nTrump made good on his promise to replace NAFTA by drafting a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada and focus was on selling more U.S dairy products in Canada so tomorrow in the world we talk with a Canadian dairy farmer about how the new trade deals looks from up north\nYou said we were hurting their dairy farmers well Americans had a six hundred six hundred million dollar surplus with us but he got in just head that we were mistreating their farmers\nTurns out the big problem for America's dairy farmers is not Canadian tariffs our reporter learns about the real threat to America is dairy industry that is right here tomorrow [noise]\nYou're listening to the world's\nFor Nashville public radio comes from central point energy services with more than a century of experience in business energy needs including consulting strategy and pricing information etcetera point energy dot com slash energy services firm ... companies that are presenting John ... and a solo appearance the bandleader for the Late Show with Stephen cold there\nMore discriminate on October ... tickets at Nashville Symphony salt or [noise] an sites and harvest them all from helping clients with all their intellectual property needs by counseling and represent the companies in the creation registration management litigation electoral property claims to learn more at sites dot com [noise]", "show_name": "PRI's The World", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "11"}
