prevent the ... billion judges\nYes that's a great way of putting it on there was some brave judges in the seventeenth century but if we look at the standout cases that were more judges for example denying bail or just arbitrarily imprisoning opponents of the king when that hadn't commit a crime that type of behavior which was driven by their\nDismissal one could say looking at the big picture\nAnd today in England or those lifetime appointment still the situation\nSuddenly enough to not so lifetime appointment was the main safeguard for nearly three hundred years but in the Nineteen eighties it was realized that\nAs more judges were reaching advanced age there um but let's see if I could ... and that's one of the most famous Anglo stretches no tending\nThe leading judge of the twentieth century started expressing some very a socially conservative views and books he was writing and the feeling was that if judges were going to do this and that hunter edge they could bring the\nReputation of the courts into district periods so retirement age was introduced it currently Seventy\nI mean they're more than fifty countries in the commonwealth which are influenced by the English model from India to your own native South Africa have they all evolved in the same direction of ending lifetime tenure\nI guess they have so there are exceptions but there are three small island states where judges are typically brought in on a contract basis for this discussion when we're talking about large countries we can leave them to one side so it's striking that\nThere's no more lifetime appointment in that group of upcoming countries with their heritage that the u._s. system also sheds\nSo here I Am a little confused about where the U.S sits right now so if you consider the systems of judicial appointments or in the countries you've looked at and compare them to the current state of affairs in the U.S would you say the U. S.\nBack and how how scrutiny even if that means sometimes new products and I what I Do want to highlight the\nIssue of retirement that we've been speaking about that is an area in which we've seen that the U.S has been left behind where other countries have introduced a time just\nTo another problem that we haven't talked about yet in the pressure on individual\nJust decide when to retire so Justice Kennedy made a very important decision when he retired now like any of us he's been title to stop working back that carry far more consequences\nBecause it was his and whether the retirement age a more predictable in that way I pick up less tension between\nPresident governments on the one side and judges on the other side you have to decide whether to yield there on the court to\nThe government of the day that will be choosing the next nominee\n[noise] I'll never forget a Thurgood Marshall are retiring from the court and a reporter asked him on the steps of the Supreme Court why argue stepping down and he said because I'm\nOld [laughter] should be the reason\n...
