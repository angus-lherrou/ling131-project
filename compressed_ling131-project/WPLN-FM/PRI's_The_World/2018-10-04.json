need to protect the Amazon that's the word for scientists who've been studying the forest ability to capture CEO to pollution from the atmosphere and how that starting to change it's a story we've been focusing on this week here on the world\nToday reporter Sam eaten visits with some of the people who lived in the forest pretty much forever and who in some places are the last line of defense against deforestation\nYou might well have heard the sound of a chain saw in a story about Amazon deforestation a thousand times but this chain saw in the Brazilian state of marrying yo isn't being

the some of his fellow guardians from an indigenous territory just south of here was found dumped along the river bank\nFacility himself has received thousands of death threats says it's worth the risk\nI feel as if ... if I was used for the indigenous he says our wealth as the forest is not gold or whatever else you there is what we want the forest if you're ...\nIt's a wealth that extends far beyond the glass jars land and even the rest of the Amazon indigenous groups protecting their forests are providing an invaluable service for all of us helping soften the impact of climate change\nFifty six percent of the carbon dioxide we are throwing into the atmosphere is removed back to the ocean to the fore is\nCarlos ... is a Brazilian climatologist\nSo this is a tremendous equal system so it was very few people have a vague idea what that means or even of its existence\nOr the fact that deforestation may be driving the entire Amazon and the services it provides to all of us to an alarming tipping point after decades of sucking up huge amounts of CEO to pollution from the atmosphere of the process seems to have stopped maybe even reversed\nIf that happens or when it does that would mean the end of one of the planet most powerful buffers against even more dangerous climate change\nMany activists say indigenous groups like the ... are the last best hope for saving the Amazon and other tropical forests and there's evidence to back that up multiple scientific studies have found that the best way to protect for us is to empower the people who live in them\nThe study said this effort to pay off with two to three times lower deforestation rates they also produce billions of dollars worth of benefits from carbon seek restoration clean water and more [noise]\nBut at the David and Goliath battle protected indigenous lands cover nearly a quarter of the Amazon and powerful economic forces are testing their resolve from big ag mining and logging to the global demand for me\nIt's a way to have allies in the Brazilian government myself also a deficit there's more give that to congressman\nKnow suddenly now is a leader and powerful agribusiness lobby called the rural east us all the time says Brazil shouldn't be protecting native land's for modern enterprise\nUnder his leadership the rural east is in their ally of president Michel to mirror have stopped the process for creating new indigenous reserves defunded the agency charged with protecting the rights of indigenous people in her pushing to open existing indigenous territory to agribusiness and mining\n... President George ... most Indians metastasized live on government grants is dead he says they should be able to exploit their land and make money there are also William Brazil's indigenous groups generally see this rhetoric is self serving and they're fighting\nBack [noise]\nLast spring more than three thousand indigenous people descended on the Capitol\nJust [noise] it was the largest indigenous mobilization in Brazil's history\n\nSony I go to John Adams the articulation of indigenous peoples of Brazil and the vice presidential candidate organize the event\nI guess they feel like I had no but I hear when that are better than you're calling it that fell said my God the evil\nWe've always lived in a war and Brazil she says colonization period was marked by deaths murders extermination and this hasn't stopped it requires a constant campaign staff yet costs thanks [noise]\n\nBack at the ... indigenous territory cloudy out to fill the cause the regional office the military police for back on the Guardian's have discovered a possible marijuana plantation on\nTheir land scale nothing but ... says confronting drug traffickers and the most dangerous kind of radio show that the next day eight heavily\nArmed policemen Iraq [noise] we entered the forest up the river and had to pass with assault rifles and bulletproof vest checking for trip wires booby traps [noise] before long we find a planted field but it's not hot ... planted by land grabbers after they cleared the trees for charcoal [noise]\nThe Guardian's cut and burning the ... but the forest will take decades to recover\nSkill that he did he go all the shows like sometimes when you see the trees cut down to sort of says we feel rage but we also have a heart so sometimes we pity the outsiders to romance novels follow me they wrecked what they had to sell his head and now they want Iraq what we have\nThis is why we keep fighting so this doesn't happen in ... the for the world Sammy marrying yeah Brazil\nTomorrow fighting deforestation by trying to make the standing forest more valuable or stories this week come from a partnership with the nation magazine and the PBS NewsHour\nWith support from the Pulitzer center and the society of environmental journalists we've got photos video and the rest of them series at the world dot org slash Amazon [noise]\nNews headlines are coming up here with the world\nTurn and focus on amplifying both sides of that issue of sowing discord which is again really similar to what we saw on twenty sixteen\nOr are these campaigns are targeting specific races and specific states\nEven in races that have been very high profile\nFor example the crews ... Senate race in Texas right while there is a lot of social media engagement around that race\nAnd there are some tactics being used again by we think domestic actors that are arguably manipulative we're not seeing a lot of foreign amplification of um of one candidate or another and in those races\nGenerally how would you say these operations are right now compared to what we saw in the twenty sixteen us presidential election both in terms of the end goal and uh the strategy how it's actually done what\nWe're seeing an evolution of tactics so this is definitely an arms race the social media platforms haven't proved to their ability to detect\nCertain types of tactics that we know are associated with foreign influence but of course new tactics are evolving a new proxies are being developed or new human assets are being cultivated so that foreign actors can operate through real Americans and ... skate their activity\nUm and in terms of strategy I'd say that's been largely consistent from one election to the next\nAs much as there's been a huge focus on whether or not the Russian operation was focused on supporting the Trump campaign over the Clinton campaign ultimately I think what we've seen over the long term is that they're real strategy was focusing on things that were very divisive and of course presidential elections are very divisive and\nAnd the more divisive they can make that conversation the veteran the Kavanaugh nomination and the me too movement of the allegations of sexual assault I think of course that's been a a very sort of an open wound for the country right now so it's really no surprise that these accounts were tried to\nUm exacerbate that uh that discord\nSpeaking of social media tactics we just heard a story about Facebook working with fact checkers are on the ground and Brazil to prevent the spread of disinformation or as people there had to polls over the weekend this coming weekend to our Facebook and other social media companies doing the same kind of things here in the U.S they are\nAnd I think working with fact checkers is certainly one part of the solution of course we want the information that gets disseminated on line to be authentic and correct\nBut what we think about is this information has actually less about the truth or the authenticity in any given story and more about how it's distributed\nIs the platform being manipulated to elevate one story or one narrative at one point of view over another and I think that's where the social media platforms are also starting to work with third parties to identify this sort of manipulative distribution\n[noise] I I just want to ask you about the the news today a department of justice that charging seven Russian military officials for hacking into anti doping agency's and activists as well as a Pennsylvania nuclear energy concern um it's kind of apples and oranges compared to what we're talking about but it does suggest more Russian meddling\nHow do you see these charges against the concern of more apparent election meddling\nThink this is actually an indication that what we traditionally think about as cyber warfare and what we've started to think about his information warfare are actually won in the same and the more that we think about these two things as being synonymous\nAdversaries around what isn't isn't acceptable or you know what are the rules of the road in terms of this ongoing combat between nations that are sometimes friends and sometimes adversaries\nJonathan Morgan is the c._e._o. of new
