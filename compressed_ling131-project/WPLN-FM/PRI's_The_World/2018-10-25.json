P. Ellen de listen when you as you get ready in the morning or maybe it's every time you get in the car is your companion throughout the day\nThere's films that people watch where they get patriotic education there is also cultural events that people participate in their drinking events basically testing to see if there's any reticence to doing this sort of thing because for a week or this is Saddam is not comic activity\nAll of these things are tests of the loyalty of the week are subject to the Chinese state\nThey're trying to see how patriotic these people are willing they are to participate in hard cultural activities one of the things that the manuals that the ... billion choose one of the things that they advocate is that you ask the children because you'll get honest answers from the children concerning the allegiance of the parents\nDo the Han civilians who are in these homes they report on their host to like some higher authority\n[noise] yeah that's one of the primary goals of what they're doing it as fact finding mission so they have these manuals that they're using and their spots in these men does what they fill out whatever activities they've been involved in if they've seen anything religious on the walls of the home that sort of thing\nThey're making recommendations as to whether or not these waivers that they're spending time with our safe or unsafe whether or not they should be sent to the re education camps to get formal education were not\nHowever the weaker is reacting to this well many regrets that I've spoken to have had ... on civilian staying in their homes have told me that they experienced is a pretty extreme form of paternal is them a kind of in ...\nThey feel like it's a violation of their personal space and of their family life there particularly concerned with the way that the ... civilians are treating their children their training their children to speak Chinese weaker language is now something that's forbidden in schools\nThey might see their parents as backward which is what they are basically being taught by the state\nAnd we were parents feel as though they have no power to stop that sort of activity\n[noise] so how do harm civilians view their roles in this government project\nSo I found a variety of perspectives it's it's complex because there is Han people that live in this province who have lived there for decades those people that are from this older\nSchool in their neighborhoods from their perspective what's happening to the leaders is appalling\nMany of them talked about this as being something similar to the cultural revolution in the Nineteen sixties and seventies\nWhere populations were polarized and extreme way and all speech and action was politicized so there's a lot of concern there from this older group\nThe newer group of people that I met people that I came to the profit more recently are much more positive about the approach the state is taking they see it as something that needs to be done has essential or many of these newer folks that I met were wearing lapel pin that had Xi Jinping's face on them or\nThe Chinese flag they call each other comrades or sort of a patriotism fever among them\nAlso seemed as though they enjoyed dominating the spaces of leaders\nLike in a restaurant for instance if there's a long wait for food they would demand that they'd be served first so it seemed as though they were taking up the position of the occupier or you know to conquer kinda enjoying the privilege that they now have there certainly are resonances that goes with earlier projects to control unwanted populations\nThe way they framed their final solution is lasting stability or long term security\nBut it's quite big we don't know exactly what that looks like it seems as though they're thinking that the whole people for a generation either in the camps or in tight surveillance\nAnd then maybe the next generation the young children that are going to these Chinese medium schools now that they'll be able to assimilate into mainstream society so their position is really quite fraud and precarious\nDarren ... is an anthropology professor at the

because he's afraid other Palestinians will tear them down instead he speaks in private homes in mosques and on social media and Jeb Bush hired a religious Israeli campaign advisor to open doors in city hall\n... for me because I have a much worse than it was\nA recent Hebrew University poll found that fifty eight percent of Palestinian surveyed in East Jerusalem agreed that Palestinians should
