figure out why ambassador Haley resigned today essentially she said it was time what do you make of the timing of this resignation one oh\nWell the timing was somewhat of a surprise Marco but I Do think\nIt's no secret that ambassador Haley's influence has been in decline since John Bolton took on his role as national security adviser Nikki Haley as not someone who fold easily I Would say and so the idea that if\nHer role were significantly diminished by the arrival of secretary of ... and\nJohn Bolton that she would depart I think is is a logical next step\nYeah I mean tell me more about the arrival of John Bolton Trump's national security advisor because he's reputed to throw his weight around and he's got strong views of the UN to boot how well did he and he would get along\nMy understanding is that he certainly exerted more as an influence\nHe is a former U.S ambassador to the United nations and said that says somewhat of a pet issue for him and during his tenure he was

that\nDuring the early months of the Trump Administration Nikki Haley was really willing to push U.S policy in areas particularly concerning in Russia\nAnd Ukraine from her perch at the un and she was

[noise]\n\n\nGathering intelligence can take you to the far end of the earth remote villages in Russia for example but getting intel can also be as easy as going online and doing a few searches\nThe investigative news websites belly cat and the insider did both and in the process managed to reveal the likely identity a one person allegedly involved in the poisoning of a former Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter in the u._k. the suspects name is Dr Alexander Michigan\nAccording to the investigation he's a trained military doctor who worked for the G R U Russian Army intelligence\nOur told her as one of the building cat reporters who worked on this case you went through a pretty a lengthy process to identify Alexander Michigan what clues did you actually have to work with\nWhat we had a little bit to start with just from the information that Russia had released and also the British authorities had released about the cover daddy said this guy so we now know his real name is Alex on their skin but before he was ... he was known as Alex in Petra which was his coverage as soon as you know totally fake identity they made up out of nowhere for him to travel and\nUm and so we had some information about that cover identity quitting his birthday um where he had to pass passport issue too which is very small town in the middle of nowhere [noise]\nI'm In northern Russia so that was a good starting point\nSo talk a bit more about that process how you you've got that starting point where do you go from there\nSo we have the starting point if we can assume that he probably use some of the same information to discover identity from Israel I get so we looked into a bunch of database of some of them are openly available some of them are league um Russia is a very corrupt in leaky society and because of that there was leaked the databases\nFrom driver's license as an insurance stuff and voter registration an address it all over the Internet you can find if you know where to look yes we cross reference everything we can try and we found that ... about a guy named Alex in Michigan at the same birth dates and the ... roughly the same belly middle of nowhere\nAnd northern Russia and after a bunch of digging including actually sending someone to go to these tiny little ... finding locals who knew him apparently he was a local DJ before he went to medical school yeah he was he a DJ at the local club the ... club I'm sure they had in the tiny village\nSo we once these hunters in these databases across represent a tiny bit of information we think would probably max the true identity Michigan\nI gotta say some of the steps in in your process to you and your investigators it really seemed to have to put your cells in the mindset of a spy\nAway I mean a lot of this has yes a lot of very creative thinking thinking of a mini vulnerability of what would lead a paper trail\nCan't find his birth certificate right because maybe that's all the information has had no way forever but again these spies I've realized too they have a family they have kids\nSo you can find information that would track back to that so yeah I mean yes maybe some of this kind of spy Ware but a lot is very very basic routine research on this stuff you wanted and you know high school or college or you know searching looking for an interesting details and cross reference bring them and see what's that matches up\nNow that you've got a name what else were you able to find out about Dr Alexander Michigan like do have evidence that he was working on behalf of the Kremlin\n[noise] yeah I mean this guy is listed his registered addresses as the headquarters of the chair you which went first glancing absolutely insane like why would a secret spy list his public\nAddress like on his driver's license the address of the you know see I ... the equivalent of the CIA [noise] well he did it because uh you know if you get pulled over in his car to cop pulls up his address and he sees the address of the you know the Russian CIA more or less and he's like oh actually you know everything's me up and up you can just go you know you're fine so\nUm that we ran the address I'm at a traffic database we found there's three hundred and five men\nAll between the ages of twenty five hundred fifty\nWho all have the same register to address this one address in Moscow so all these men almost certainly are often you that you are you and they all lifted their vehicle registration as his address 'cause they just don't want to pay traffic fines and they get pulled over or they get pulled over drunk driving or speeding the cop just let them go right because they want to mess with somebody in the intelligence services\nSo really everything just goes down to laziness and I guess corruption in a way to 'em and that's how a lot of the owner ... how are you able to research this um played out\nSo the headline in the guardian on this news intrigued me it said a string of own goals by Russian Spies exposes a strange sloppy and as to what is your take on the possibility that this was not sloppy and his butt intentional that Russia want it to leak who these men were\nI mean I suppose that always possible right because we know every time any investigation affirmation I Russia people always chime in and saying well they wanted you to find it very well if they want us to find out why is no one published this stuff before because you know these insurance\nRegistration for these vehicles to the jury you headquarters [noise] you know they've been doing this for years and years and years and years registering new agents needs address saying like Jerry you address it again it makes no sense when you think about it but it all kind of boils down to again just corruption and laziness\nA few weeks ago your website ... identified as a second person allegedly involved with this group of poisoning I have authorities in the u._k. or anywhere else been in touch with you about your findings\n[noise] um no no no not really at all I mean I don't really have any ... in I don't think Elliot our founder has any contacts with UK police either um so we don't know what they're thinking for all we know they discovered this all weeks and weeks ago or maybe in this all completely news and then we honestly have no idea\nYou know just listening to what you said about all the available data that is on line is it impossible to be a spot in the digital age\nIt depends I I again I don't know if I have no idea I've never worked had intelligence services but I'm sure you can do it in some ways but it's much much harder than ever been before\nThat was our solar with the new site billing cats together with their partners that the insider and they say
