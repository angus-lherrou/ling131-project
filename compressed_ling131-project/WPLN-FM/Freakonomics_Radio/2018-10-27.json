conversation with referred to as a beta we spoke a few weeks ago I was in New York and I was a beta was that WTO headquarters in Geneva [noise]\nSo we are in a particularly noisy a trade environment at the moment it in the headlines all the time\nConsidering the threatened an actual terrorists emanating from the U.S a and considering the U.S role in the global economy what share of your time currently I'm is taken with issues that concern directly or indirectly the U.S\nWell you're talking about the largest economy in the world\nSo it's natural that a lot of my time or we'll have some kind of relationship with our actions taken by the United states also because an accident that it's taken by the United states has repercussions are everywhere\nAre across the world so anything that the U.S does will have a global systemic effect\nSo of course a lot of my time\nHas to do with that but what is important also you have to realize that President Trump didn't just happen\nYou know he didn't just you know fall from disguising the ambient that was a a north right and then found a direction that didn't that that was not there he is the results of a very real\nA situation in American society and in the American economy and uh if you don't understand the forces that put him there I think that's part of getting the wrong diagnosis and I have to tend to there is a lot of sympathy for some things that are said uh owned a part of the United states\nThat are welcome in other areas of the world but not every single forced\nThe WTO as opposed to tariffs generally and most economists agree that terrorists are are really distorted way to do trade\nBut it strikes me that there are a lot of instances where tariffs exists under a different name one of the U.S his biggest complaints is that China for instance doesn't honor intellectual property that\nRather than being bought or license the properties copied so that would essentially be a tariff on the imported version then their their governments that subsidize their airline industries or their agricultural industries are oil and gas and sugar\nAbility to direct totally request or command that these are terrorists not by name but in essence be eliminated\nAbsolutely happens all the time\nIndustries like protection they want to be supported by the government is they want to get help and they are now seen this um a prize in what we call\nBehind the border protection a and that happens in the form of a technical barriers it happens in the form of a insufficient or enforcement of certain rules like you mentioned intellectual property and that's much more difficult to assess because tariffs you can measure\nThe Arabs you include on the spreadsheet and you'll prepare for it to pay that additional cost\nA behind the board there measure you don't know when they come you know what form they would take so it's it's stuff we have a communities are hearing the W. job will discuss exactly that\nDo you have any sense if you had to estimate the size of those ... what they would be compared to the official tariff rates\nNot really a also because some of those are perfectly legal you would see some countries are a put it in place technical barriers or technical standards that are more demanding than ah what other countries apply and that would be for the protection of the consumer\nOr it could be for preventive measures and those things are difficult to measure but they can be very significant definitely uh in several situations they just stopped trade altogether so that's ah whatever and even if they're if at the border\nOnly measured and [noise]\nThe WTO says the average tariff rate among members fell by Fifteen Percent between organizations founding in Nineteen Ninety five\nAnd two thousand Thirteen [noise] there are however many ... Harris rules are less stringent for developing countries for instance furthermore trade deals negotiated in good faith by one country's administration can be deemed by a leader administration to be unfair or just on power the NAFTA\nYou know the WTO has positioned itself to be um theoretically a friend to all or at least a referee to all but when there is something proactive and maybe unilateral like us ah terrorists in other countries respond by making their own deals\nI'm curious how that makes you feel as a director general of the WTO do you feel excluded do you try to get involved in those discussions and make sure they fall within the um the proper parameters of WTO behavior\nTo be Frank with you I don't have to try very hard they reach out for me very quickly sometimes I Try to discourage a some courses of action\nBut I also have to understand the the political sensitivities in in many of these uh players we have um I'm happy to say uh conversations which are\nVery open and very Frank and um of course I can share with you and the listeners or the content of those conversations but\nUm they are very very Frank and uh we explore all kinds of options are before us I tell them about the importance\nOf the system and not to compromise the system and I would say that pretty much everybody I've talked to a ... tells me that the system must be preserved even strengthen\nBut it's not easy under these circumstances to be you know showing the line when others are\nComing up after the break with\nThe head of the WTO on our show of course we're going to ask them to make some predictions about trade and the economy my crystal ball doesn't allow me to go that far\nNo well don't worry Roberto as of eight has plenty more to say and we'll hear it after the

when the train waters were considerably less choppy than they are today [noise]\nSo you're from Brazil and you've studied electrical engineering before becoming a diplomat I'd like to just very quickly here had those three factors Brazilian engineering\nAnd being a career diplomat how they inform your role as director general of the WTO Brazilian um\nWell the good thing about being a Brazilian is that it gives me a very diverse perspective Brazil has a is a big economy a it's a big country with several ethnicities a very diverse cultural backgrounds\nAnd it has aspects of a a developed nation a very sophisticated industry but also has important ah aspects of of developing country very social challenges and that gives me this different perspective engineer\nI was always good with numbers and I think it was natural for me to become an engineer and it was\nUntil I met my wife uh and uh she decided to get into the diplomatic career and I'm at that point in time I had to decide you know ... what would I Do an engineer married to a diplomatic was going to be pretty challenging especially when she was\nPosted abroad so I thought you know what let's let's work for the family so I took the um the exams and I passed the exams and I joined a diplomatic career I think that was a love story in its own rights\nCan you give me a quick example of an engineering lake solution to a trade or economic problem\nSo and I'm In a meeting or something like that I Try to understand the basic motivations in and then figure out a way to make 'em those motivations work together\nAnd that's something I think that engineers do to try to get very complex situation some problems [noise] try to reduce them to derail a mental a constructive parts and figure out a way to make them work\nPersonal chemistry is very important as well even between negotiators are I Know some people think that\nEverything you need to know you learn to kindergarten and I think that's quite accurate but um I I found out that your forever learning how to re a relate to people how to take into account as diverse personalities cultures objectives\nSo as long as the world still has um independent nations and it seems that will be the case for at least another few decades that we're not becoming one big global nation it strikes me that there is an inherent friction around trade 'em in which\nEvery country has to strike a balance between protectionism\nSo I'm curious whether you agree or disagree with this notion and however you answer what's to be done about that\nDistinction I'm that exists or even today are with regard to trade it always existed\nCountries that do trade and that have ah a cooperative\nRelationship with the other partners they essentially gain from that\nBut it is also a reality that when you trade some sectors into domestic economy will lose me again or many are better off with a with a trading relationship but that some news in the sense that they're not competitive enough\nSometimes the factories clothes or in particular sector and are you cannot ignore that\nI think what you see today is something different from this very traditional very a historic attention\nToday we are seeing a transformation of the economic structure of the global economy Web producing things differently we're producing things faster we don't require 'em as much human input as we did before and this is increasing\nNow clearly even for a government sent for politicians it is easier to blame you know the foreign for these problems which are happening inside their own economies\nIt's easier to blame the the imports are for the loss of jobs when they are ... are they have a role of course but the minor in this structural change and I think if we don't realize that and if we don't try to find a solution for this will be hurting much more than help it\nOkay so you've just described I Would argue beautifully and succinctly a big problem that of course a lot of economists and and some others have described but you're right that's not the political rhetoric\nSo it's easy to think of what the wrong medicine how involved is the WTO in trying to discover and administer the right medicine\nI think that number two is already at least trying to help governments and public opinion to understand uh the situation and reached the right diagnosis if we get the wrong diagnosis who get definitely the wrong medicine the important thing to understand is that whatever medicine we choose it's not going to work overnight\n... there is no quick fix for this this is a this is essentially something akin to the industrial revolution so\nThere will be a need to rethink the whole educational system or in countries how to support the displaced people are those who lost their jobs but cannot find a job somewhere else in the economy how are you will help them\n[noise]\nThis is freakonomics radio with your host Stephen ...\nSo I wouldn't say that my Pop's economics listen through Marxism but it was through reading some very inspirational economist which one was definitely Carl Marx\nThat's Mary Annette ... I'm a professor and the economics of innovation I'm public value at University College London\nYou also advised as far as I can tell a number of governments and governmental institutions\nShores I'm currently on the council of economic advisors for the first minister Scotland I'm also the special adviser for ... their research commissioner in the European Union and I used to be on the advisory board offered Jeremy I'm courtroom and then I resigned because of breakfast\nIt's sheer special advisor to the secretary general of the CD is that right yeah\nSo the city is currently rethinking its economic narrative and\nSo they have a group that's literally called called that the new economic narrative and I'm One of the people on that a group\nGotcha and also um citrus advisory panel in Finland is that\nTrue oh yeah I didn't realize one of the whole and yes [laughter] there's actually even like thirty mark\nI'm going to be that one university economist says the era of so many governments and institutions for a clue let's get back to why months of Cato found such inspiration in Carl Marx\nOne thing that's fascinating about Martin says that he's known as a critic of capitalism but actually when you read capital of Mali one two and three you end up really admiring and appreciating the dynamic\nAspect of capitalism which is technological change we shouldn't forget that futile ism was five hundred years of inertia\nOne of the defining features of capitalism is in fact the way the innovation was really broken down all sorts of laws that it's constantly changing how industries operate how production distribution in consumption work and marks really talks about that\nSo it's quite curious that one of the you know most famous critics of capitalism actually described it and the most dynamic kind\nOf always and that's what got me interested in economics of technological\nChange but it's not just technological change interests much cut out she has a relatively radical stance on the value that created by technological change what do I mean by radical stance\nConsider the titles of her books the first was called the entrepreneurial state those two words entrepreneurial and state typically are not used together\nMaking and taking in the global economy when it comes to the relationship between government and economic growth Mexico knows how the popular narrative goes it goes like this\nMy God the government what a basket case group of your class they don't know what they're doing\nBut she sees it differently you know what would ... be without a GPS publicly financed what would Google be without the Internet publicly financed [noise]\n... was born in Rome but grew up in Princeton New Jersey where her father took a job as a research businesses at the university\nShe studied history and international relations at tuft and got her PHD in economics at the new school for social research in New York and now she lives with her family in London in an interview with the Financial Times I'm lunch with the F T um where you go and have lunch and a glass of wine\nYou said well they're expensive that's the one I saw that the glass of wine you ordered called forty pounds\nI made an error they made an error you well I didn't write this is how they treat you know they trick you they trick you I don't know if it's because I was a woman and they didn't show me by surprise you know to the gentleman or if it's what that does but there is no prices I was so involved in the conversation I just pointed to the first one I saw and it turned out to be the most expensive one that\nGot anyone who read that article at the Columbia\nSylvie ... social [laughter] right\nSo to someone who says you know free markets are almost always good and governments are almost always bad to someone who says that you say what\nThe first is what do you mean by the free market and it's curious if you read Adam Smith\nA you know a one of the first economists back in the\nLate Seventeen hundreds he actually meant by the word free market not free from the state but free from rent seeking free from those activities that extract value so when I say to those who say that you know we need less state\nI'm uh in order to be more innovative more dynamic might say well let's look at one of the most innovative parts of the U.S economy which is Silicon Valley did that come from the free market or from an active uh there's a little hand or the state\nMy point is actually the states with involved in almost everything a Silicon Valley not to exclude the role of the private sector of course we all know the very important ah companies in that area but\nThe role that public actors played was really across the whole innovation chain\nSo you're talking about agencies like dark but NASA and the national institutes of health and so on yes\nExactly I'm Talking about both agencies that do basic research like the national Science Foundation but also a agencies more downstream doing applied research\nLike a DARPA but also his sister organization in more recent times called ARPA e the national institutes of health which continued to spend more than thirty billion dollars a year and the most radical\nOn search in high risk a research\nAnd there's some evidence of the government funding the ... was talking about DARPA the defense advanced research Projects Agency created during the Cold War to keep American technology ahead of the Soviet\nIs over the years produced several kinds of missiles and airplanes as well as the first computer mouse miniature GPS receivers each de displays and the digital personal assistant so ARPA e or the advanced research Projects Agency for energy found that under George W Bush\nHas funded a variety of energy projects including battery storage tech\nThe department of energy starting in Nineteen Seventy eight invested in\n... techniques that have come to be known as fracking\nAnd the national institutes of health is helped fund the vast majority of all new drugs approved\nBy the\nNeed public institutions have absolutely co created value is quite extraordinary that we've become very used to these kind of much more passive words to describe the state you start having to change the copy Larry\nOn that one uses so instead of saying the public sector deem risks the private sector is actually about sharing risks instead of talking about just facilitating and enabling business it's really about you know taking on the lead investor role as an investor first resort\nOne of the central arguments you make is that government institutions and causes that government institutions are involved in the investment are involved in the risk and yet you argue barely share in return how big of a problem is that\nSo it's a huge problem and it comes back how we talk about things I often remind people um you know the Plato [laughter] a sad story tellers ruled the world so these stories that we tell\nAbout who creates value has in fact created the stories that are that justify the extraction of of value so let me give you an example which I think brings home the U.S\nGovernment after the crisis decided to have a proper fiscal stimulus program of close to eight hundred billion dollars and part of that agenda was really also to direct\nThat the school stimulus towards the green economy so you might remember that Obama finance some companies like a cylinder through the U.S department of energy through a guaranteed loans that was for about five hundred million and that company went bust\nYour new questions about a cornerstone of stimulus won five hundred and thirty five million dollar loan to a company called cylinder makes solar energy panels what is the taxpayers\nHave to be the one footing the bill to try to shift some power solar power works\nSaid my God the government would a basket case group of bureaucrats they don't know what they're doing they shouldn't be picking winners they should just really do this kind of facilitating rolls of you know construct some roads education infrastructure and then get out of the way\nI'm which first of all completely misses the point that actually the U.S government in terms of energy has been the lead finance or\nOf areas like solar and wind alongside other governments but also nuclear fracking itself came out of\nA U.S government financing early on but more concretely at the same time that it was financing cylinder and also finance Tesla for a very similar amount of money so they passed last car got a four hundred and sixty five million guaranteed loan\nAnd when I say guaranteed I'm Talking about guaranteed by the U.S taxpayer so until enderlin bus the taxpayers we're\nPretty angry that they had to pick up the bill but why did the taxpayers not know that they had also finance Tesla would not have changed the narrative and the perception of what these bureaucrats in Washington were doing they actually had a portfolio like any venture capitalists\nThis is Ninety point three WPN land Nashville public radio Ninety One point five W T amount of Houma and Ninety One point seven W.

good\nThing about being I'm a Brazilian is that it gives me a very diverse perspective Brazil has a is a big economy a it's a big country with several ethnicities a very diverse cultural backgrounds\nAnd it has aspect of a a developed nation a very sophisticated industry but also has important aspects of of developing country very social challenges and that gives me this different perspective engineer\nI was always good with numbers and I think it was natural for me to become an engineer and it was\nUntil I met my wife uh and uh she decided to get into the diplomatic career and I'm at that point in time I had to decide you know ... what would I Do an engineer married to a diplomatic was going to be pretty challenging especially when she was\nPosted abroad so I thought you know what let's let's work for the family so I took the um the exams and I passed the exams and I joined a diplomatic career I think that was a\nLove story in its own rights\nCan you give me a quick example of an engineering lake solution to a trade or economic problem\nSo and I'm In a meeting or something like that I Try to understand the basic motivations in and then figure out a way to make 'em those motivations work together\nAnd that's something I think that engineers do to try to get very complex situation some problems [noise] try to reduce them to derail a mental a conservative parts and a figure out a way to make them work\nPersonal chemistry is very important as well even between negotiators are I Know some people think that\nEverything you need to know you learn in kindergarten and I think that's quite accurate but uh I I found out that your forever learning how to ... relate to people how to take into account as diverse personalities cultures objectives\nSo as long as the world still has um independent nations and it seems that will be the case for at least another few decades that we're not becoming one big global nation it strikes me that there is an inherent friction around trade 'em in which\nEvery country has to strike a balance between\nWeb streaming is made possible by the pack presenting camera Macintosh a spectacular new production of Andrew Lloyd Webber the fabric of the opera the love story and thrilling score October twenty fourth through November fourth tickets at ... dot org\nExisted countries that do trade and that have ah a cooperative relationship with the other partners they essentially gain from that\nBut it is also a reality that when you trade some sectors into domestic economy will lose many gain a mini are better off with the with the trading relationship but that some lose in the sense that they're not competitive enough\nSometimes the factories clothes or in particular sector and or you can like more of that I think what you see today is something different from this very traditional very a historic tension\nToday we are seeing a transformation of the economic structure of the global economy Web producing things differently we're producing things faster we don't require 'em as much human input as we did before and this is increasing\nNow clearly even for a government sent for politicians but is easier to blame you know the foreign for these problems which are happening inside their own economies\nIt's easier to blame the the imports are for the loss of jobs when they arm or they have a role of course but the minor in this structural change and I think if we don't realize that if we don't try to find a solution for this will be hurting much more than the help it\nOkay so you've just described I Would argue beautifully and succinctly a big problem that of course a lot of economists and and some others have described but you're right that's not the political rhetoric\nSo it's easy to think of what the wrong medicine how involved is the WTO in trying to discover and administer the right medicine\nI think that number two is already at least trying to help governments and public opinion to understand uh the situation and reached the right diagnosis if we get the wrong diagnosis who get definitely the wrong medicine the important thing to understand is that whatever medicine we choose it's not going to work overnight\nThere is no quick fix for this this is a this is essentially something akin to the industrial revolution so\nThere will be a need to rethink the whole educational system or in countries how to support the displaced people are those who lost their jobs but cannot find a job somewhere else in the economy how old are you will help them\nTomorrow night at seven [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nThis is freakonomics radio with your host Stephen ...\nSo I wouldn't say that my pop economics listen to Marxism but it was through reading some very inspirational economist which one was definitely Carl Marx\nMary Annette ... I'm a professor and the economics of innovation I'm public value at University College London\nYou also advised as far as I can tell a number of governments and governmental institutions\nShore so I'm currently on the council of economic advisors for the first minister Scotland I'm also the special adviser for ... their research commissioner in the European Union and I used to be on the advisory board offered Jeremy I'm courtroom and then I resigned because of breakfast\nIt's sheer special advisor to the secretary general of the CDs that right yeah so the\nLAPD is currently rethinking its economic narrative and so they have a group that's literally called called that the new economic narrative and I'm One of the people on that a\nGotcha and also um ... advisory panel in Finland is that\nTrue oh yeah I didn't realize one of the whole it yes [laughter] there's actually even like thirty more\nHow can it be that one university economist says the Europe so many governments and institutions for a clue let's get back to why monster Cato found such inspiration in Carl Marx\nOne thing that's fascinating about mark says that he's known as a critic\nOf capitalism but actually when you read capital of Mali one two and three you end up really admiring and appreciating the dynamic aspect of capitalism which is technological change we shouldn't forget that she was five hundred years of inertia\nOne of the defining features of capitalism is a fact the way the innovation has really broken down all sorts of laws that it's constantly changing how industries operate how production distribution\nIn consumption work and marks really talks about that so it's quite curious that one of the you know most famous critics of capitalism actually described it and the most dynamic kind\nOf always and that's what got me interested in economics of technological change\nAnd but it's not just technological change interests much cut out she has a relatively radical stance on the value that's created by technological change what do I mean by a radical stamps\nConsider the titles of her books the first was called the entrepreneurial state those two words entrepreneurial and state typically are not used together\nThink making and taking in the global economy when it comes to the relationship between government and economic growth Martha ... knows how to ... goes it goes like this\nMy God the government would a basket case group of bureaucrats they don't know what they're doing\nBut she sees it differently you know what would you be without a GPS publicly financed what would Google be without the Internet publicly financed [noise]\nAnd ... was born in Rome but grew up in Princeton New Jersey where her father took a job as a research physicist at the university\nShe studied history and international relations at Tufts and got her PHD in economics at the new school for social research in New York now she lives with her family in London in an interview with the Financial Times I'm lunch with the F T um where you go and have lunch and a glass of wine\nOr do you said well they're expensive that's the one I saw that the glass of wine you ordered costs forty pounds\nI made an error they made an error you identify tried this is how they treat you know they ... they trick you I don't know if it's because I was a woman and they didn't show me the price you know to be a gentleman or if it's what that does but there is no prices I was so involved in the conversation I just pointed to the first one I saw and it turned out to be the most expensive one that\nGot anyone who read that article to call me a\nSoviet in your own social [laughter] right\nSo to someone who says you know free markets are almost always good and governments are almost always bad to someone who says that you say what\nThe first is what do you mean by the free market and it's curious if you read Adam Smith\nA you know a one of the first economists back in the late Seventeen hundreds he actually meant by the word free market not\nFree from the state but free from rent seeking free from those activities that extract value so what I say to those who say that you know we need less state\nI'm uh in order to be more innovative more dynamic might say well let's look at one of the most innovative parts of the U.S economy which is Silicon Valley did that come from the free market or for I'm an active visible hand or the state\nMy point is actually the states with involved in almost everything a Silicon Valley not to exclude the role of the private sector of course we all know the very important ah companies in that area but the role that public actors played\nWas really across the whole innovation chain\nSo you're talking about agencies like dark but NASA and the national institutes of health and so on yes\nExactly I'm Talking about both agencies that do basic research like the national Science Foundation but also a agencies more downstream Blake applied research\nLike a DARPA but also its sister organization in more recent times called art they eat the national institutes of health which continued to spend more than thirty billion dollars a year and the most radical\nOn search in high risk a research and\nSome evidence of the government funding that much to kind of just talking about DARPA or the defense advanced research Projects Agency created during the Cold War to keep American technology ahead of the Soviet\nIs over the years produced several kinds of missiles and airplanes as well as the first computer mouse miniature GPS receivers each de displays and the digital personal assistant so ARPA e or the advanced research Projects Agency for energy found that under George W Bush\nHas funded a variety of energy projects including battery storage tack\nThe department of energy starting in Nineteen Seventy eight invested\nTechniques that have come to be known as fracking\nAnd the national institutes of health is help fund the vast majority of all new drugs approved\nBy\nThe public institution said absolutely co created value it's quite extraordinary that we've become very used to these kind of much more passive words to describe the state you start having to change the copy Larry\nOn that one uses so instead of saying the public sector deem risks the private sector is actually about sharing risks instead of talking about just facilitating an enabling business it's really about you know taking on the lead investor role as an investor first resort\nOne of the central arguments you make is that government institutions and clubs or government institutions are involved in the investment are involved in the risk and yet you argue barely share in return how big of a problem is that\nSo it's a huge problem and it comes back probably talk about things I often remind people um you know the Plato [laughter] you know a sad story teller ruled the world so these stories that we tell about\nWho creates value has in fact created the stories that are that justify the extraction\nOf of value so let me give you an example which I think brings us home the U.S government after the crisis decided to have a proper fiscal stimulus program of close to eight hundred billion dollars\nAnd part of that agenda was really also to direct that physical stimulus towards the green economy so you might remember that Obama\nFinance some companies like a cylinder through the U.S department of energy to a guaranteed loans that was for about five hundred million and that company went bust their new questions\nAbout a cornerstone of stimulus won five hundred and thirty five million dollar loan to a company called cylinder makes solar energy panels what\nIs the taxpayers have to be the one footing the bill to try to shift some power or solar power works people said my\nThe government would a basket case group of bureaucrats they don't know what they're doing they shouldn't be picking winners they should just really do this kind of facilitating rolls of\nYou know construct some roads education infrastructure and then get out of the way I'm which first of all completely misses the point that actually the U.S government in terms of energy has been the lead finance or\nOf areas like solar and wind alongside other governments but also nuclear fracking itself came out of\nA U.S government financing early on but more concretely at the same time that it was financing cylinder and also find us tax law for a very similar amount of money so the tests last car got a four hundred and sixty five million guaranteed loan\nAnd when I say guaranteed I'm Talking about guaranteed by the U.S taxpayer so until enderlin bust the taxpayers we're\nPretty angry that they had to pick up the bill but why did the taxpayers not know that they had also finance Tesla would it not have changed the narrative and the perception of what these bureaucrats in Washington were doing they actually had a portfolio like any venture capitalists\nWhich you know takes on risk and so to speak to any a venture capitalist they will tell you that for every success there's many failures however if you really want to be a venture capitalist you have to construct your portfolio and such a way that you also get some of the upside from the wins precisely to cover that downside", "show_name": "Freakonomics
