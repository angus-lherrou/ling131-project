new one [noise]\nSo you were for many years obsessed with the idea of bringing the Olympics the summer Olympics to New York city and you ... first in obscurity for a while spending a lot of your own money\nA recruiting a lot of people to your cause you you got some leverage over time you got in the Bloomberg administration you were first reluctant to take that job because he thought it would curtail your limping activity but Mike Bloomberg persuade you that it actually would give you leverage\nOr you've got delayed you wanted to be two thousand they had got pushed to two thousand twelve Olympics\nUm you pursue do you pursue you pursued you traveled the world did everything you could\nFinally you were a New York was voted the U.S a city in the bed and then um ultimately lost out in the in the Iowa seeing the international Olympic Committee vote\nSounds pretty nutty doesn't it\nYou know I don't mean to be dismissive of the Olympics themselves but was the Olympic bid on some level kind of a a stalking horse to rebuild New York city whether the Olympics came here or not and is it possible that New York ...\nAnd all the infrastructure and related benefits of the produced then they would have benefited from actually hosting it\n[noise] I wouldn't describe it as a stalking horse I Would just say that that was always part of a strategy that it was sort of the off ramp from the strategy that\nYou know the Olympics could be the catalyst to getting things done that people have been talking about for generations but never were able to muster the political will or financial resources to actually do and you could look at successful examples in the past\nAs to how they used the deadlines at the bidding for the Olympics were more likely hosting the Olympics\nCreated sort of an imperative in a city of Tokyo in Nineteen sixty four built the subway system around it\nYou know Barcelona in Nineteen Ninety two did an amazing job of recovering from being a stepchild of dread under Franco for decades and revitalizing the city\nYou're leaving out that the counter examples like Athens but I mean it's not quite the science of what kind of regional will benefit from it all depends\nOn the planning and it depends on the economic resources and other things but I convinced myself\nThat we're in New York was in its development cycle having that kind of catalyst to be a really important thing and we use the deadline of the Olympic decision to get massive region owning done in time it cetera et cetera\nNow the second question you asked was or we'd better off having now one\nAnd there I think the answer is no because I think we could have used another seven years of deadlines to get more stuff done for\n... subway today if we'd gotten well right now\nI think that might have had a real impact right we could have argued look all these people are coming I think it could have been a deadline to getting for example congestion pricing done but at the end of the day you know much of what we wanted to do as part of the Olympic plan and that was re developing the waterfront\nYou know in Brooklyn or queens or the whole west side of Manhattan or the high line or regeneration in Coney Island in Harlem and flushing\nI'm originally from life from here with Chris and we're proud to be the highest rated to our live musical comedy\nVariety show on public radio in this time slot in this weekend for our show at college leader in Saint Paul Minnesota with the ... brothers miss Madison Cunningham\nDirty projector fly from here we make great radio some good people [noise]\nSaturday at five PM and again Sunday afternoon at one [noise]\n[noise]\n\nThis is freakonomics radio here's your host Stephen ...\nDamn doctor off started his New York city life as just another banker who then got obsessed with bringing the Olympics to New York\nThen joined the Bloomberg administration to help New York recover from the nine eleven attack\nWho then haired the recovery effort with the Olympic dream to dramatically reshape the New York that exists today one of his projects at the moment is a new cultural center on the west side of Manhattan called the shed of which Dr off is chairman of president\nShed I was just curious about the the why ... why did New York city need another arts complex you I understand are not exactly a a performing arts beans at least\nYeah well the origin of it actually dates back\nTo when we re planned the west side of Manhattan which we did and in two separate parts one part of it was in West Chelsea in the core of it was to save the high line\nThe second part was to a bill what's called Hudson Yards which is this\nArea on the far west side of Manhattan and uh we decided at the intersection of the high line in Hudson Yards we wanted to have a cultural institution we set to standards for one that should be unlike anything else in New York which is hard 'cause there's twelve hundred cultural institutions in New York\nAnd secondly that it should play a role in keeping New York the leading edge culturally in the world\nAnd so we eventually had an insight about the role of technology and the role that it's playing in reshaping the cultural ecosystem that led us to conclude that what New York needed was a completely different kind of institution one that would be the most flexible but pro grammatically a and physically\nRight so this is a building that kind of can be recon figure like a transformer or something else\nThat is exactly right it's like a transformer it's really remarkable the buildings literally moves a and it will open up a in March twenty ninth is what we're targeting two thousand Nineteen and it may be one of the largest cultural start ups of all time\nAnd the c._e._o. phoning Alex boots or ran for many years in Manchester international festival which again is unusual in that it takes place or took place at least all over the city not in set theaters\nFrom what I can gather the shed seems to be a sort of um you know professionalized gorilla operation in a way right it's got a lot of the experimental is some of the experimental arts movement with kind of the the juice and leverage the big city like New York\nA great way of saying you know another way of expressing as say cultural\nWhole spaces that can be recon figured that can accommodate virtually any cultural discipline and may look our basic view whether it's with respect to culture or whether it's with respect to city building is\nNobody smart enough to predict the future so you cannot plan\nTo the detail or even sort of the gross level what's gonna happen in the future instead what you can do is create the infrastructure that might be physical it might be digital might be some ground rules et cetera\nThat enable people to project their own ideas and innovations onto it as taste technologies trends began to change I think that is a very different notion of cultural institution as well as city building\nI find it and I mean zero disrespect by this but I find it interesting that of all the things that attracts people to New York city these days outsiders visitors\nThe high line is among the most popular it was proposing to be turned into this you know public parking strolling area and you are not a big supporter of it not that you are so hard against it\nBut it's just a striking reminder illustration I guess to me and\nYou and your folks around you who were obviously doing the central infrastructure planning you couldn't have possibly predicted something like that and his humble is the high line for God's sake and it's an abandoned freight line would turn into this thing that has so much appeal I'm just curious what kind of lesson that taught you know\nWhen I came into city hall um the high line was really one court decision away from being torn down and the Giuliani administration which had proceeded us was really intent\nOn ripping it down because the landowners who owned land under the high line really were really pressuring the Giuliani administration to get rid of it\nAnd you know there were some of us in the administration and immediately saw what the two young guys who would basically kept it alive saw which was that this could be a beautiful park and a manatee I\nWill confess I didn't see that right away um but the key point is is that you know you seize opportunities as you see them and as they evolve and if you're flexible enough to do that then ultimately you can create something that might be amazing\nI mean the the paradox and that is flexibility is not a hallmark of government is it\nWell it generally is not because government is really hard um and just getting anything done and often takes extraordinary effort\nA but it should be a on some level a hallmark of government at the same time you have to have a sense for what you want to do and so you have to\nCombine sort of this openness with a determination to get things done or else nothing ever happens you know one of the principles that we always operated with is that look we're competitive entity in New York and whether we were competing with\nLondon or Los Angeles or Jersey City to be honest you know we can't make policy that puts us at a competitive disadvantage\nLet me ask you about that competition between whether it's far away cities are are near a city you and the Bloomberg administration made it a point to change policy and stop throwing a lot of money at firms are institutions that threatened to leave using that kind of standard financial incentive\nBut I'm curious what effect that zero sum competition has on each area because you know in some of them\nOn the other hand firms and institutions can end do game the system and basically skim a bunch of taxpayer money for their own purposes so what's the best way to balance that and still incentivize firms in institutions to be where they can do the most good\nOur view was that financial incentives or to lure companies or more importantly keep them was almost always a fool's errand we did a lot of work when we first came in the economy was just on its back\nYou know we're facing enormous budget deficits so the easy temptation would have been to bribe companies to stay or bribe companies to calm ah we met with CEOs of companies all over the country and all over the world in addition to in New York we analyze their cost structures\nIn great detail and eventually what we concluded was companies are going to do what's in their economic interest over the long run and that providing these sorts of incentives was like giving a crack\nBut the crack was ultimately going to affect the dealer more than the user\nAnd so it just didn't make a lot of sense and so we just stopped instead the way we compete was based on our natural strengths which we thought we could enhance and our number one natural strength was that New York um had been a haven for people from all over the world\nYou know it's sort of this optimistic sense that produces incredible energy\nI'm that attracted companies to New York and we ought to build off of that\nMost places have some sort of competitive advantage but they got to be honest about what it was and so that for us was really what the strategy became\nYeah you got to be true to yourself um that's one of the things that I consistently preached to leaders in cities around the country and around the world\nYou know cities are like people um or maybe like companies they have personalities they have strengths and weaknesses\nYou know you know how hard it is to change your own personality it's hard to change the city's personality but that doesn't mean you can't you know structure around your strengths and structure around your weaknesses\nRoom all\nCities ... unlike people reading companies\nCan be as we noted earlier difficult director ... not just physically all those buildings that transportation\nAnd energy infrastructure but also psychic clean culturally and economically which is why Dr I've concluded looming really interesting to start city from scratch two dozen Fifteen he teamed up with Google to create a company called sidewalk labs\nThe jungles of El Salvador [noise] to voters launched drove [noise]\nThey're searching for the ... shifts lucrative cars a drugs\nSharks and their fans are there we go wow they can and migrants who spent months sometimes years ... working under brutal conditions there is\nSlavery is the most of the next ... Sunday at six PM and to get on Tuesday night at ten [noise]\n\nThis is freakonomics radio here's your host Stephen ...\n[noise]\nI'm sure you've been hearing the ever more anguished calls to regulate the huge tech firms known collectively as gaffe Google Amazon Facebook and\nHe's confident super large for monopolistic they have developed the capacity to manipulate us to control us to control the information that is deliver to us to control\nThe pricing it which products are delivered to us to control us as producers\nThe gas companies are far bigger richer and arguably more dominant than tech companies in the past Google for instance has Ninety percent of global search engine market share Facebook has more than ... billion monthly active users\nAmazon has an estimated Ninety five million prime members in the U. S. it's something like Seventy five percent of all American households\nIt's estimated almost fifty percent of all online spending goes to Amazon\nThis kind of scale creates a lot of concern we've examined this concern in previous episodes like who runs the Internet and use the Internet being ruined we're seeing the birth\nOf new center of power real power we depend on these technologies that have been in many ways wonderful and fascinating but they're making significant decisions laterally\nThere's also the question of whether the mission of these firms is as socially beneficial as many people believed they were in the early days the Internet there's old is really\nSmart engineers there the brightest computer scientists and all they're thinking about is how do I keep someone on Facebook for ten more minutes was the exact combination of things that will keep them stay on the site as long as possible so that we can show them as much advertising that's\n[noise] so here's a question if you are one of those huge dominant super wealthy for what\nState [noise] probably spend a lot of money lobbying politicians which yes they do it's been a huge ramping up lately lobbying like tech for [noise] but you may also do something a bit subtler\nStory today begins with a journalist\nFranklin for a writer with the Atlantic\nYou are one of three brothers who write books are talking about that for just a minute and the family that produced all of you\nRight so I have two brothers Johnathan he's written a good number of novels including everything is limited and I got a younger brother named Josh who is a a science writer who wrote a book called moon walking\nWith Weinstein and it's actually\nIncredibly uncomfortable for us to talk about growing up in a family of other writers just because ah I'm sure it would in some ways we benefit from the novelty act of being three brotherly writers but then we all of course want to be known for her own accomplishments right but uh you know our\nOur parents didn't do anything they didn't force us to play violin or four hours a day and or or a sit down and study the great chess masters [laughter] we watched a lot of heat man an Addams family reruns on television when we were growing up\nBut one of the things that they did was they gave us a credit card which they said we weren't allowed to spend essentially on anything except in the event of an incredible emergency and there was one exception to this which is that they said that we could basically spend the credit card that will at the book shop\nAnd so they basically guided us to one thing\nYour first job in journalism was at slate one of the very first mainstream online publications would just start by Microsoft and so there was a huge enthusiasm certainly among the chattering classes\nThere was a certain amount of utopian isn't associated with the emergence of the Internet this idea that we were gonna tied the world together I Love search engines I Love the fact that I can access every book in human history\nIn a nanosecond I Love that I can get things delivered to my door incredibly quickly and these things arguably make life much better\nAnd maybe in arguably make life much better so these technologies were incredible and Amazon is an incredible company the Kindle is an incredible invention Hi Pat and yeah and the iPhone were incredible innovations and so I think we were right to marvel at them\nSo after rating for sleep for a while you moved on to the New Republic or as you call it the intellectual Oregon for hard nosed liberalism you ultimately became editor they're not once but twice\nSo the New Republic but this little magazine that always had outsized influence in politics and culture it was an incredibly elitist\nOregon and managed to persist over a hundred years well never really turning a profit and so as we entered the Internet age that became a more and more difficult thing\nTo continue to do and so we ended up shifting from one ownership group to the next and I got so exhausted trying to find an owner and kind of sick of that I ended up\nResigning his editor but then a couple of years after I resigned the magazine got bought by a guy called Chris Hughes who'd been Mark Zuckerberg's roommate at Harvard and co founder of Facebook and he bought the magazine and\nTo me it just seems like almost too good to be true or that you had this guy who understood social media\nWho had incredible number of resources and seemed devoted to this little magazine that I was also devoted to and so I came back and I edited the magazine and Christian I Try to remake it\nAnd their relationship and the beginning seemed like it was unbelievably good yeah we became ...\nRating we felt like we were trying to save something that was imperiled in the world and that maybe we can help provide some sort of dignified solution to the rest of journalism which was grappling with a lot of the same issues that we were grappling with\nBut there was a moment when things just took this turn which was that Chris decided that he always talked about wanting to make a profit with the New Republic and he suddenly decided that he didn't want to lose at least not lose a whole lot of money with it\nAnd so we had to turn around our financial position incredibly quickly and so\nHe insisted that we start chasing cliques in two thousand Thirteen ... way to get clicks was to post a clip from last night's Daily Show with John Stewart and you slap a headline on it and he may be right back a couple of sentences about it and everybody would click on it\nAnd you got caught up in at least monitoring the numbers right\nYes I did um look data is crack cocaine then if you're the guy who had a hard time getting a date in high school to suddenly find herself producing things that are extremely popular\nYou become obsessed with replicating that popularity in ... in some ways everybody in the magazine wanted to be successful on Facebook we wanted to master social media and this new environment but we didn't want that new environment to dictate how we did our jobs\nAll right so we should say that you ended up getting will you ended up quitting as you were about to be fired from the New Republic\n[laughter] yeah so um you know I I took the brave decision to resign when I learned that there was some guy who already had my job was offering other people jobs at the New Republic\nIt's funny you're describing what was happening to you at the New Republic but it sounds as though you're also perhaps describing\nYour view of what happened at places like Google and Facebook over time where you may begin with a certain set of motivations but as those motivations lead you to this overwhelming commercial success you're so seduced by the magnitude of that success that you can't help but want to replicate it over and over again\nYeah that's completely right I felt like it in retrospect I realized that I was just living this compressed version of recent history\n[noise] the reason the history of the Internet at least over the years Franklin for his view of the Internet it shifted the same guy who used to think this\nThere was a certain amount of utopian ism associated with the emergence of\nThe Internet and this I Love search engines and this these technologies\nWere incredible Amazon is an incredible company\nHas now come to think this Amazon thinks of itself as the everything store\nAnd it's gotten itself in a pretty much every conceivable business it owns whole foods it powers the cloud or it has this data for the CIA and so on and so on and there's really nothing that it doesn't try to squeeze into its empire he also thinks this\nAs Facebook shapes the way that we

moves a and it will open up a in March twenty ninth is what we're targeting two thousand Nineteen and it may be one of the largest cultural start ups of all time\nAnd the c._e._o. phoning Alex boots or ran for many years in Manchester international festival which again is unusual in that it takes place or took place at least all over the city not in set theaters\nFrom what I can gather to shed seems to be a sort of um you know professionalized gorilla operation in a way right it's got a lot of the experimental ... of the experimental arts movement with kind of the the juice and leverage of the big city like New York that's\nGreat way of saying you know another way of expressing as a site called ...\nMultiple spaces that can be recon figured that can accommodate virtually any cultural discipline I mean look at our basic view whether it's with respect to culture whether it's with respect to city building is\nNobody smart enough to predict the future so you cannot plan\nTo the detail or even sort of the gross level what's gonna happen in the future instead what you can do is create the infrastructure that might be physical it might be digital might be some ground rules et cetera\nThat enable people to project their own ideas and innovations onto it as taste technologies trends began to change I think that is a very different notion of a cultural institution as well as city building\nI find it and I mean zero disrespect by this but I find it interesting that of all the things that attracts people to New York city these days outsiders visitors\nThe high line is among the most popular it was proposing to be turned into this you know public parking strolling area and you are not a big supporter of it not that you are so hard against it\nBut it's just a striking reminder illustration I guess to me that\nYou and your folks around you who were obviously doing the central infrastructure planning you couldn't have possibly predicted that something like that and his humble and the high line for God's sake and it's an abandoned freight line would turn into this thing that has so much appeal I'm just curious what kind of lesson that taught you know\nWhen I came into city hall um the high line was really one court decision away from being torn down and the Giuliani administration which had proceeded us was really intent\nOn ripping it down because the landowners who own land under the high line really were really pressuring the Giuliani administration to get rid of it\nAnd you know there were some of us in the administration and immediately saw what the two young guys who would basically kept it alive saw which is that this could be a beautiful park and a manatee I\nWill confess I didn't see that right away um but the key point is is that you know you seize opportunities as you see them and as they evolve and if you're flexible enough to do that then ultimately you can create something that might be amazing\nI mean the the paradox and that is flexibility is not a hallmark of government is it\nWell it generally is not because government is really hard I'm just getting anything done often takes extraordinary effort\nA but it should be a on some level a hallmark of government at the same time you have to have a sense for what you want to do and so you have to\nCombine sort of this openness with a determination to get things done or else nothing ever happens you know one of the principles that we always operated with is that look we're competitive entity in New York and whether we were competing with\nLondon or Los Angeles or Jersey City to be honest you know we can't make policy that puts us at a competitive disadvantage\nLet me ask you about that competition between whether it's far away cities are are near a city you and the Bloomberg administration made it a point to change policy and stop throwing a lot of money at firms are institutions that threatened to leave using that kind of standard financial incentive\nBut I'm curious what effect that zero sum competition has on each area because you know\nThe right on the other hand firms and institutions can end do game the system and basically skim a bunch of taxpayer money for their own purposes so what's the best way to balance that and still incentivize firms in institutions to be where they can do the most ...\nOur view was that financial incentives uh to lure companies or more importantly keep them was almost always a fool's errand we did a lot of work when we first came in the economy was just on its back\nYou know we're facing enormous budget deficits so the easy temptation would have been the bride companies to stay or bribe companies to calm ah we met with CEOs of companies all over the country and all over the world in addition to in New York we analyze their cost structures\nIn great detail and eventually what we concluded was companies are going to do what's in their economic interest over the long run and that providing these sorts of incentives was like giving a crack\nBut the crack was ultimately going to affect the dealer more than the user\nAnd so it just didn't make a lot of sense and so we just stopped\nInstead the way we'd compete was based on our natural strengths which we thought we could enhance and our number one natural strength was that New York um had been a haven for people from all over the world you know it's sort of this optimistic sense that produced this incredible energy\nI'm that attracted companies to New York and we ought to build off of that\nMost places have some sort of competitive advantage but they got to be honest about what it was and so that for us was really what the strategy became\nYeah you got to be true to yourself um that's one of the things that I consistently preached to leaders in cities around the country and around the world you know cities are like people are maybe like companies they have personalities they have strengths and weaknesses\nYou know how hard it is to change your own personality it's hard to change the city's personality but that doesn't mean you can't you know structure around your strengths and structure around your weaknesses\nRoom\n... unlike people reading companies can be as we noted earlier difficulty director ... not just physically all those buildings that transportation and energy
