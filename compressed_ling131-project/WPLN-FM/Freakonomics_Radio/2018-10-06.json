pretty narrow don't you think because athletic success like any success and leave money failure it's what you might call multi factorial\nA lot of input from a lot of variables imagine you've got to

like I didn't go through the course of my life and look at all the things that happen\nThat were just happenstance that led me to these positions and I'm not going to say that it's a model that should be that should be followed understand that there are occasional outliers but trying to build around that seems\nCrazy so okay we're not going to arrive at some perfect model for turning an ordinary person into a world class athlete but\nWe'll do our best to describe some of the inputs that seemed to be strong contributors let's start with physical ability it may not surprise you to learn that a lot of elite athletes exhibited a pretty high baseline level of talent from an early\nThree time major league baseball all star yes you are and most kids grow up being you know if you're an elite athlete are gonna be the best get on your team\nPlayed every sport as a kid was baseball your best sport in the ... always while yes ah and I actually enjoy playing basketball more ah I played back yard football I played soccer tennis and uh but I I was always good at baseball so I knew baseball was going to be um you know a sport\nFor my future athletic talent is considered one of the more heritable\nTraits passed from parent to child in super freakonomics one of the books I wrote with the economist Steve limit we performed a rough calculations showing that if a major league baseball player has a son that boy is about eight hundred times more likely than a random boy also make the majors\nSo it may not surprise you that a lot of the athletes we've been interviewing for the series came from athletic families here's Kerry Welsh Jennings who's won three Olympic gold medals in ...\nOh man well my ... my life has literally been family and sports link from day one I think from birth and my parents are both superstar the athletes they both come from very athletic family\nMy parents are both athletic\nAnd that's the alpine skier McHale is shifting who's won two Olympic gold medals\nMy mom is extremely athletic and even now she's had knee surgery than hands surgeries and next surgeries and everything but she still such an incredible athlete\nWell I mean my dad kind of did every sport when he was growing up and the gold medal gymnasts Shawn Johnson he was a hockey player he wrestled he did BMX he ... race ... 'cause I mean everything\nJust how powerful is the sports gene David Epstein is a science journalist and author of a book called the sports gene in it he tells the story of a man named Donald Thomas\nDonald a is about six to um lean a\n... guy\nThomas played basketball at a small college in Missouri but he was far from an elite player in the college program was far from ... one day in the gym he was bragging about how high you could jump\nAnd your ultimate goal isn't to become an elite professional athlete but rather to get into and Lee University [noise] like one of the top ten schools in the country [noise]\nYou know I've actually been thinking about that exact problem that Steve ... my freakonomics friends and co author he's an economist at the University of Chicago\nBy my calculation about point four percent of kids so about one in two hundred and fifty kids will make it to one of those ... hey so it's a it's a hard hard goal to do it\nAnd I can't say I've thought about the University of things you you could do but I thought about sports and uh and I stumbled on to something that was pretty surprising to me so the answer I think is you want your kid to be a fence or\nThe guy that he might say that sounds crazy like this college fencing even exist and\nAnd the answer is there turned out to be exactly forty six schools that have fencing but the correlation between quality of school and having a fencing team is incredibly high so for instance among the top ten ranked schools in the country nine of those ten\nHave fencing team the only exception being my own university University of Chicago\nIn each fencing team has quite a few slots to fill there's three different blades says ... soil and there's male female fancy and\nGiven that relatively few kids in the U.S are serious you Spencers so it's something like six or seven percent of the kids you ever tried to be sensors ended up being college fences about saying they get scholarships but that they're likely to be admitted to college based on their fencing\nHow much does limit thing fencing increases your chances from that point four percent base fine\nSo fencing seems to raise that number holding everything else cuts them something like Fifteen fold\nWe should say here that college admissions being what they are fencing doesn't necessarily increase your chances all that much your grades would soon to be very very good to get into those top schools that said as an admission sweetener how does ... think fencing compares to other sports\nMy God if you want to go to school forget about soccer and basketball and football there's something like three hundred thousand kids\nPlaying high school soccer and presumably any of those kids would love to be caught soccer players but that the chance of having soccer beer vehicle to get to college as opposed to fencing turns out to be about Seventy five or ... times harder so how many of your kids have you turned into sensors limit\nExactly one and uh so far so good uh I I couldn't say I really turned him into a fence or uh he he strangely enough gravitated towards fencing when he was about nine years old\nAnd he fences at a really good club in Chicago and I don't know is grades aren't that good so she knows that I Know everybody else knows if he's going to go to an Ivy League school it's going to be because of fencing

D\nAs we've been hearing there are a lot of input to go into the production of an elite athlete in gallons drives the right kind of practice may be a parent or to to get you to the ring to the gym or the track at five AM band as Shawn Johnson told us earlier he might need some luck\nMean you you can't get hurt you can't have the flu on the wrong day you have to find the right coach Wright city I was incredibly lucky to end up with my coaches so how'd that happen it was kind of this freak occurrence my coach was Chinese born and raised Chinese\nAnd when he was three years old and he was taken away from his family and raised to be an Olympic gymnast\nAnd he kind of had this crazy career that I Would say almost traumatized him he he lost his childhood he looked kind of lost his family and so when he was Twenty one years old he actually left to China\nCame to the United states open to a gym in West Des Moines Iowa of all places and had this dream this American Dream to raise an Olympian are lumpy ends that were also children and how to balance in life and were\nYou know fun loving and had a true childhood Johnson that started her training at different gym and I loved it it was awesome but child my coach that took me to be on backs opened up a gym about five minutes from my parents' house\nAnd my parents ended up switching the they had to save gas money and I was really really blessed\n... I mean I I was a very very fortunate child's within the gymnastics community to have very loving very very protective people around me\nAnd he I mean\nGiven today's society I can bang fillet in\nMay that he he kept me hey and I and ...\nSean Johnson's good luck created good opportunities which she worked hard to parlay into an Olympic gold medal but what about the young athletes who don't get the right opportunities whether if you're bad luck\nMore through something much more concrete like lack of money what were the past decade the youth sports economy has doubled its more than Fifteen billion dollars a year\nAnd a lot of youth sports involves some sort of pay to play model\nBeta play is something that just it just scares me because it's become so much of a business on another itself and less about true true true development\nThat's Brandon McCarthy he's been a pitcher in major league baseball for Thirteen seasons\nIt's a tournament in California this week and the next week and you go to Nevada after that it's Texas and I don't understand how two working parents could never afford to put their kids through that and then take the time to travel with them\n... you know the theme of economics last like ten or Fifteen Years has been income inequality and connected to that the rich getting richer it sounds like what you're saying with youth sports is that's being near that all the way down the line yes\nI Would think so I mean there's two players on your team and one player I'm at the age Thirteen level can make all the tournaments in the summer and one can only make to the tournaments well how much playing time as the player who whose family can't afford for every one of those trips and then the coach doesn't favor him and play um [noise]\nI think this that trickle down effect from there and there's less access to the top coaching lessons equipment you name it over time it's starting to ... has some income inequality just creates better baseball players and worst baseball players\nOr in one where the instance a huge drop in baseball players in Nineteen eighty one there was Eighteen point seven percent black African American players in the major leagues as of two thousand Eighteen seven point eight percent so the question is why the decline\nDavid Canton is a history professor and director of the Africana studies program at Connecticut College\nThe huge drop of black players in baseball he argues has a number of historical causes\nIncluding the relative rise of black football and basketball players but he puts most of the blame on deeper

hearing there are a lot of input to go into the production of an elite athlete Palin's drive the right kind of practice may be a parent or to to get you to the ring the gym or the track at five AM band as Shawn Johnson told us earlier he might need some luck\nI mean you you can't get hurt you can't have the flu on the wrong day you have to find the right coach and the Wright city I was incredibly lucky to end up with my coaches so how'd that happen\nIt was kind of this freak occurrence my coach was Chinese born and raised Chinese um when he was three years old and he was taken away from his family and raised to be an Olympic gymnast and he\nKind of had this crazy career that I Would say almost traumatized him\nHe he lost his childhood he'll kinda lost his family and so when he was Twenty one years old he actually left to China\nCame to the United states open to a gym in West Des Moines Iowa of all places and had this dream this American Dream to raise an Olympian or Olympians there were also children and how to balance in life and were\nYou know fun loving and had a true childhood Johnson that started her training at different gym and I loved it it was awesome but chow my coach that took me to you on backs opened up a gym about five minutes from my parents' house\nAnd my parents ended up switching they had to save gas money and I was really\nI didn't and his coaching I mean I I was a very very fortunate child's within the gymnastics community to have very loving very very protective people around me\nAnd he I mean\nGiven today's society I can thankfully in\nMay that he he can't maintain and I and federal grant for for that Mm\nShawn Johnson is good luck created good opportunities which she worked hard to parlay into an Olympic gold medal but what about the young athletes who don't get the right opportunities whether if you're bad luck\nMore to do something much more concrete like lack of money right over the past decade the youth sports economy has doubled its more than Fifteen billion dollars a year\nAnd a lot of youth sports involves some sort of pay to play model\nPay to play is something that just it just scares me because it's become so much of a business of itself and less about true true true development\nThat's Brandon McCarthy he's been a pitcher in major league baseball for Thirteen seasons\nAt the tournament in California this week as the next week and you go to Nevada after that it's Texas and I don't understand how to working parents could never afford to put their kids through that and then take the time to travel with them\n... you know the theme of economics last like ten or Fifteen Years has been income inequality and connected to that the rich getting richer it sounds like what you're saying with youth sports is that's being near ... all the way down the line yes\nI Would think so I mean there's two players on your team and one player I'm at the age Thirteen level can make all the tournaments in the summer and one can only make to the tournaments well how much playing time as the player who whose family can't afford for him to go on those trips and then the coach doesn't favor him and play um\nI think this that trickle down effect from there and there's less access to the top coaching lessons equipment you name it over time it's starting to ... has some income inequality just creates better baseball players and worst baseball players\nOr in one where the instance a huge drop in baseball players\nIn Nineteen eighty one there was Eighteen point seven percent black African American players in the major leagues as of two thousand Eighteen seven point eight percent so the question is why the decline\nDavid Canton is a history professor and director of the Africana studies program at Connecticut College\nThe huge drop of black players in baseball he argues has a number of historical causes including the relative rise of black football and basketball players but he puts most of the blame on deeper structural issues\nSo [noise] um for me I sacrifice from the time I was I don't know uh\nProbably at high school is when I started to uh forego other opportunities\nThat again is Dominic Fox worth who over did his push ups and sit ups at age eight in order to make the NFL\nAnd then in college I wanted to be a ... computer science major at um University of Maryland and my academic advisor was like Mm\nThough that that core slows gonna make it very difficult for you to make it to our practices their labs and blah blah blah blah\nSo I was like no not going to do that so instead you did was it American studies at American studies when journalism right in journalism which just shows how easy would I Do is that you could do it and another major while playing football [laughter] no I um\nI enjoy those and it was it was good but it wasn't what I wanted to do and in the summers when when people were getting internships or whatever I was working out and getting ready\nFor football and I\nSay all that to say once I got to the league and I got drafted in I was in the third round so that's it's money it's good money but it's not life changing money doesn't make up for all the things that you have given up through the course of your life\n[noise] you shouldn't feel too sorry for Fox or played long enough to enter free agency to final NFL contract paid him about twenty seven million dollars but now now the football for a few years he's still feeling the after effects of his single minded\nSo like my my whole life since I was a kid I had a very clear

family and\nAnd then I was like All right I'm done playing so I Will be in the state of transition\nHis transition included getting an MBA from Harvard and working at the NBA players union he's now doing some writing and sports casting\nMean I think it's a feeling of loneliness honestly which and it's not like I have three kids and my wife and I'm not like a loan obviously and I love them and I have fun with them and but throughout my life I have been\nAlmost myopic Lee focused on a goal which being focused on that goal I gave me purpose and I'm sure I'm going to butcher the maid she quote but it's something to the effect of a when a man has a why he can bear almost anyhow\nDidn't I don't drink now never drank in my life I never smoke we like I\nWas single focus on doing everything every decision I made with like All right I'm going to get closer to go and I I ... the people I was close with in high school like those are my friends any more people I was close with in college like not really my friends anymore and then at thirty five I'm In DC where my wife has\nA bunch of family and friends Frank that she's been close which which they weren't a second grade and like and

two thousand and one and so that's a but you know it's ten years\nAnd that is Sudhir Venkatesh\nAnd so we thought that would help us understand what happens to these folks I think one of the the the

is making about forty percent less on average ten years after they entered the game than the person who decides not to play baseball and who just wanted a regular career\nAll right so what kind of background is typical for these players you're\nTracking the average player probably looks like an upper middle class kids who comes out of college or comes out of high school\nUm and when you follow in upper middle class kid for about seven to ten years they're probably gonna make higher than the median average income they're probably going to live in a neighborhood that's relatively safe they
