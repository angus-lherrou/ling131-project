I think it's actually a good thing not a bad thing I think it's a good thing now with that being said I'd like it to go quickly\nKavanaugh's nomination is on hold until the FBI investigate allegations of sexual assault against him let's bring in Chad program who covers Congress for Fox News channel it's good to have you back thanks for having me shore so there have been questions about the scope of this investigation did the president tell us anything new about who's in control and what the terms are\nWell he indicated quote I Want to make the Senate happy and I've been told here in the past the hour hour and Fifteen minutes or so\nThat by one senior Republican Senate stores that they think they could wrap this up could underscored that by tomorrow but they can't be viewed as rushing this remember the terms of the agreement laid out by Jeff Flake the Republican senator from Arizona on friday was that this was supposed to take a week\nNow let me get a little bit into the weeds here and this is very important and there's a procedure\nMitch McConnell the Senate majority leader has a right to file what's called cloture that's an effort to end debate and whenever he does that consider that to be day one a confirmation vote after you run through all the Senate traps would be on about day for maybe day five\nMitch McConnell really can't do that until Wednesday at the earliest the question is if he goes ahead before the FBI investigation is complete\nIs he interrupting disagreement with Jeff like Susan Collins of Maine Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nOr if they they are OK with that and they're like yes okay this is satisfied it hasn't been a week that's fine that's go ahead\nThen everybody a you know is is cool with it that's fine but if if the he's perceived as jumping the gun that's a problem that could be viewed as a violation of the agreement and you know just like got a lot of criticism from some conservatives over the weekend or who you know criticized him for saying that you know he was delaying all this\nThey wouldn't have a chance of getting the votes to confirm Brett Kavanaugh were it not for Jeff Flake they're basically sitting right now about forty nine years\nAnd with this deal they could potentially get Collins potentially get Murkowski maybe Joe Manchin a Democrat from West Virginia\nMaybe Heidi Heitkamp a Democrat from North Dakota maybe get his highest fifty three days but otherwise they're stuck at forty nine so they can't move too quickly in the Senate they have\nTo be careful the president says he wants what Senate leadership wants to the question is what does Senate leadership one I mean who is on that list of people that will be interviewed by the FBI\nAnd that's the question at you know what ... what does Murkowski one that is a big unknown and that's why you know Senate timing around here is not exactly Swiss when they tell you that something is going to happen seven days from now or six days from now usually happens in about eight or nine maybe ten\nLearned more at read lighten or law dot com [noise]\n\n\nFunding for here and now comes from WVU are Boston and carbon night offering secure data protection solutions for

OK okay if you're frying whole chicken you're going to do all the wings at first but then you're going to do the size then you're going to do the best pieces because each one of those cuts cooks for different amount of time and if you only have one type of part of the chicken in there\nYou're not going over or under cook it now you've got a little bit of honey here and some lemon so I didn't do so you would yeah I don't I like it out a lot I like the way the lemon cuts the ... of the fried chicken and I love the way the honey adds a sweetness to the buttermilk drenched fried chicken and you'll see that in the south\nThis would be the perfect kind of chicken for waffles and chicken\nFried show yeah and what's right with the hunting isn't the hunting of Israel is out this sweet flavor that's there but it's subtle and a kind of pulls it out\nThat's a really favorite wrestler by the way what do you do with the left of oil after you're done can use that again you can fry more than one chicken and the oil so yesterday I tried to hold chickens in my oil and I did not keep it because I did answered the phone and the oil got a little hot at the end\nAnd was a little bit to brown but the idea behind having not greasy\nFood is that you're monitoring your oil and that you're using fresh oil after every one or two frying 's\nOkay there's another piece of fried chicken here but it has got something else on top of it some sesame seed exactly this is my version and I will not claim it to be authentic of Korean fried chicken and what I did with this was I'm marinated the chicken in Korean chili paste I Hope I say this right go wrong\nAnd soy sauce ginger little catch up to Seventy and Scalia and took it out of the marinate and dusted it in a combination of flour and corn starch\nAnd then you deep fry it oh I forgot to mention something really important this is double fried\nFood so you fry it you call it down and they might try it again for about two minutes on each side for that extra crispy knows that's just for Christmas that is it yeah it's not that you didn't cook it fully it's that you want that extra crispy and is\nThen I made a ... sauce out of the marinate I simmered down again the chili paste the ginger and\nI spread that on the chicken and Dustin with sesame seeds and I don't know what do you think it's delicious and and find a way off that well and and I remember we talked to David Chang chef of ... about fried chicken he mentioned there's a lot of history involving fried chicken when it comes to African Americans\nI've also eaten at high schools in Atlanta which is where Martin Luther king used to go in that way\nLots of history and David chain did a whole series for Netflix about right did a whole episode on fried chicken and what the big takeaway is that it's eaten all over the world but I did talk to\nMichael ... he is the author of the cooking gene which won some James Beard awards he said fried chicken goes back deep into the middle ages in Africa during the slave trade it's emblematic of the afro krill innovation that gets co-opted time and time again\n[noise]\n\nFunding for here and now comes from W.

recently found that in several rural and suburban areas the homeless student population had more than doubled between twenty twelve and twenty Seventeen and statewide the number is ...\nAcross the country about one point three million homeless students are enrolled in public schools\nBut why is this happening at a time when unemployment is below four percent in the economy is booming\nWell it turns out that may be part of the problem Carly ... is family resource coordinator for buffalo school district in ... county Washington one of the district trying to figure all this out Carly welcome yeah thank you for having me those numbers are shocking ... what are you seeing there appears county\nWe definitely have seen a significant rise of our homeless families and the last few years\nTwo years ago we had about three hundred and fifty homeless students enrolled just this last year we enrolled seven hundred and fifty nine homeless students [noise] um this year we don't have a total tally yet but I can tell you right now we're well ahead of the numbers that we had last year\nDid you have any idea why\n[noise] yeah I go out in the field and I I speak with these families I see these families and it it's very difficult to meet with them you have to go out to see them to really understand\nThe layers of the onion that these families are going through there's multiple layers of it but I I truly believe back in two thousand fourteen when we had our economy boom\nWe never saw rental prices as high as fourteen hundred dollars you used to be able to get a small apartment or a rental unit for you know a thousand eleven hundred dollars twelve hundred dollars\nUm since then um rentals have gone up it is a lot more difficult to find section ... housing and affordable housing for these families especially if you are a working family and you work a minimum wage job at twelve dollars an hour forty hours a week\nYour income is going to be about Nineteen hundred dollars for the month and then fourteen hundred of that's going to be going towards the rent so that doesn't leave you a lot for crisis that happened\nUm there's many different factors that are leaving these families just on the edge of becoming homeless and really it's a matter of and when that happens then they're on the streets\nNo you are just outside of Tacoma, Washington not far from Seattle one of the most expensive cities in the country are you seeing a an issue where people are getting priced out of a of a place like Seattle and then they're coming your way and they still can't afford housing is that what you're noticing\nYes absolutely we are known 'em for a bedroom community is what they're calling us a lot of families are coming out to our area to find the fourteen hundred dollar rentals or\nAs cheap as they can um and they will commute as far as two hours to work on a daily basis and like I said it just takes a loss of a job or that one crisis or they didn't have money saved up for an incident that happened before things start to crumble underneath them\nAnd it's a symptom of the good economy which is the most fascinating thing about yes yeah [noise] so for an elementary school kid who is homeless in your district what is a typical day like\nIt's very challenging I'm first off\nThere are families that aren't even getting identified because they don't want to be identified they're afraid if they tell anyone that they're living in their car that their children will be taken away from them um it could be their immigration status that they're afraid of being identified from\nSo really a lot of the homeless families that we have those children go without until we get them recognize we recognize them through a variety of just being aware and paying attention to our students at school which students are getting lunch which students are sitting without lunch um which\nLast um who's coming late tardy to school every day\nYou noticed that and then what do you do do you sit them down and ask them what's going on at home do you ...\nYeah it's you know I find my role becoming an investigator [laughter]\nBecause they won't come to you you have to go to them and you have to be very gentle with it I go out and my community and I do drive ... to go to the address if they have listed in our system just to see kind of what the house is like a lotta times I\nJust go out to the house and cold knock on the door they totally don't even expect me but it's just you know they're not responding to me and I just want to\nAsk them in a gentle way you know hey I'm here for you how can I support you and a lot of times at that moment they will just pour in and just explain everything and then it's building a relationship from there to get them the services they need to address the barriers they're experiencing\nIt's not just your state of Washington it it's a lot of other states especially across the west and seen reports out of Idaho they've got the highest number\nHomeless students that they've seen in years um there's a report out recently about a jumping homeless school kids outside of Anchorage, Alaska this used in many places around the country do you think it's the same root cause a each one of these places or something different\nIt's very hard to say I mean each family story is different each demographic is different employment rates are different but I Would say it has to be directly correlated with\nUm just housing prices going up and we haven't really seen any new shelters or funds being set aside for section eight housing\nTo accommodate the massive boom in these homeless families it's like we're not keeping up with the neat\nSo what kind of help or are you getting\n[noise] we um Bethel school district is not connected to a city title so it's very difficult to\nHave the resources and the funds that we need so we require solely on our own community to provide funding and donations\nI Believe that's all we're a model for a lot of school districts serving our homeless families because we have system set up where we have a resource bus we drive we'd go out to the community we do food drops we bring them clothing that they need sometimes we have these ... medical supplies such as wheelchairs out to families that they need\nAnd we have a food program where we um send food packs home with every homeless students on friday so they have food for the weekend until they get back to school on Monday we have multitudes of faith leaders that have pulled together to solve to help solve our problem out here\nAnd it's wonderful and we're well supported but it's it's like a band aid to every crisis it's happening\nAnd it sounds like you're saying it's private citizens step in and it's not it's not going to come and had to do it\nIt's private citizens it's our team baffle it's our hard work and community leaders that we have that have recognized the need and have wanted to help\nThe big picture of course is that this makes it very hard for kids to succeed in school and there's a lot of data out there that the back that up there's one study that says kids who experienced homelessness in school or eighty seven percent more likely\nTo drop out of high school and as you will know then becomes the cycle of poverty you see this every day and your job I mean how how does that look to you on the ground to see how these kids than struggle with the class work\nIt's just heartbreaking to work with the families and work with the students um their self worth and their self value and what they believe\nThat it debilitate them from doing potentially well and what they potentially could be I'll just give you an example I had one young man I was working with and he had\nNo self value could care less about doing his school and I had asked him I said what do you want to do what do you want to be when you grow up and he's like I don't know\nHis like I'll probably just end up like my parents and be on the streets and I'm like no you can be you can be something different I said what do you enjoy\nSo after a couple meetings with him over the next week um I had discovered they love

I was working in the place and I was told to go to new Scotland yard and get some testing done with don't just Davis because I was doing very well ... ... people from close circuit television and I didn't have a clue to talk of due to that point\nReally so and and and how does it work for you if you just see a little bit of someone's face like the un ears sticking out from beneath the cap for instance or or an eyebrow is that enough\nIs a leaves you'd be amazed last year ... from the back of the head from above who's with those uh\nHe's a very strange ability but when it when it comes off you are very excited the thing is every single time I look a fight sucking up into the ... if someone is lobbying Iraq style and you also have on well it's a rock star gone on stage that's Exxon for them put me in a room full of people and pitches\nLast amazing smell you like that I actually love it and those who prepping all just a\nIt's not a burden so in other words I see thousands of faces everyday to I wouldn't want to remember each of the details that I pick up\nIt can be a burden speak on it because you could be walking down the street and someone would Wilkins who would you they might smile she think oh I Know that person because you recognize the face but you don't actually know them ... and then like a a don't we know you if the problem is because if you walk in the same area qualified and you'll see the fights you are recognized suffice\nHuh do you have to commit the face or the details of the face to memory or is it involuntary\nIs involuntary um you don't really have to try you can just be walking down the street you'll see that face so many times I recognize them years later\nAnd you didn't know this until you were working with the police as a as a grown man it wasn't something that you recognize when you were a\nKid that oh my gosh I've got this strange talent\nNot us to talk to the correct or did not have a clue ... everybody could do to stop though it was a natural but let's see if everyone and so I didn't have it\nWhen the test we have ... that's ...\nHuh you are as you say took these skills to your police work and let's talk about this case of the Russian spy poisoning or insult very of course you were not involved in this investigation but take us inside that department how would this have played out behind the scenes\nSo I ... I Know they are the guys dealing with it would've been very excited because the whole point is they're going to get lots of ... and ... that's a very exciting thing because that gives us time to review the CCTV would never go look for some people or if not with ... people from the first each\nSo would you use many different techniques like links the resulting discussion Web I Will take time for the postage until we notice and normally scientists and appearing mostly because of a super recognizes were recognized that person that we got some memory and then if we see that bus to get another day after each with stop building to pitch and then we can start seeing is that the person we're looking for\nNow London as you well know is one of the most surveilled cities in the world there's some estimates that there is something like a million CCTV cameras capturing hours and hours of footage every single day of the year how important is that trove of evidence for you as a detective in ... in that unit\nI think is absolutely brilliant is estimated at one point five billion cameras now in London and I think is absolutely marvelous because\nThey know that said recognize you and which I was we used to get so much CCTV come fruits wasps are pictures of suspects the oath I wouldn't look into the suspects sometimes ... victims were looking for missing persons and having all that say CCTV available to you where do you help solve ... fun people well what\nKind of cases did you crack\nA very good well most of his mouth who is one of ... most wanted and he was believed to be out of the country of the time so I was in London and I've seen a ... I mean I'm actually not just a suspect I've never met them before about seeing a picture of them full\nSolve going around in the police ... he's giving me folks details but strikes whoever we lost at the same and he'd been stopped several times of the police officers who hadn't recognizing being on London's most wanted but luckily ... when we took him back for fingerprinted it comes down to the same\nPeople probably shocked when you tell us how you found them\nWe did get quite often we even had long ago Iraq from prison and I can't believe you can only for that one sided I ah like the ... is a very unique skill\nWow Josh Davis let's bring you in again from the University of Greenwich what is the science say about how this works\nThe science says we think they just sort of a night we think that super recognizes a less than one percent to population very very few people have this ability we found some very small differences in the way that their brains function\nAnd I think that sort of direction that the research may be going in future\n[noise] is it a matter of having a very very good memory or is it a completely different function of the brain altogether\nWe think it's a different function is is quite an interesting question that because\nPeople who've done research on a world champion soup and memorize those who ... hundreds of ... something like this\nAnd when they tested they face recognition of let's say they found that they will not very good at all on the other hand super recognizes seemed to have average IQ they seem to be average at recognizing other types of objects recognizing sort of streams and numbers and words and things like that\nSo it does seem as though it's a unique skill that he's specific to faces\nWould there be an evolutionary reason why humans might develop a skill like this\nNot in fact what was the opposite because as you could imagine and ... and sort of pre history people lived in very very small\nNumber of faces wouldn't being very necessary so so that sort of strange situation as far as the sun is concerned it may be the what's happened is the policy of the brain associates it with\nOther aspects of object recognition as somehow change slightly too in the sleep recognizes to become very very good at face recognition but that's a hypothesis ... the sun's definitely well look\nComputers can be trained to recognize faces is well how how does the human brain compare to what artificial intelligence can do\nLike I said with very very good high quality images computers are operating at about the same level as an average human being super recognizes a still better than the best computers in the world\nBut we low quality images which most CCTV footage is a human beings still beach computers\nI think in the future well what the situation is going to be it's the best algorithms working with the best humans to super recognizes to make the most accurate identity decisions\nWhat are the limitations that people like Kenny have\nAs a human being leads to sleep unlike excuse to uh we get tied fatigue there isn't that must be a limit to how many images and how many people Kenny can say I'm big before before he does get fatigue so that's one limitation of humans\nWell is really I think ... impressive about Kenny skill is he's ability to rule out\nThe huge number of faces the Hindus and they'll say ... to him because obviously when they're searching through CCTV footage for ... you know for a suspect Fritz ... most of the time they're actually looking at face these people they're not interested in vaccines ... asleep recognize that can do\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

body's immune system to attack cancer Allison is the chair of immunology and executive director of the immunotherapy platform\nAt the University of Texas empty Anderson Cancer center and joining us now is Dr Peter pitchers who is president of empty Anderson Dr pitchers welcoming congrats to you and your colleague on winning a Nobel Prize\nThis is fantastic news of course for Jim for MBR sin but most importantly for cancer patients around the world\nWill tell us a little bit about James Allison's work in immunotherapy to attack cancer\nWell Dr Alison is really dedicated his entire life and his research career to understanding how the immune system works and more specifically how it works or in cancer patients and in the biologic setting of cancer and\nHis main insight was to understand how to block of protein on T cells that acts as a break on their activation in essence enabling those T cells to be freed up to attack cancer cells\nSo explain that in a way that everyday people could understand it 'cause that's you're still probably a doctor level\n[laughter] well in our bodies we have a group of cells that we think of as the soldiers of the immune system the T cells and those T cells are really held in check to ensure\nThat those cells do not attack normal cells in our body or caused autoimmune diseases\nAnd part of that break process also impairs the ability of those cells to attack cancer cells in Dr Alison really understood the underpinnings of how that break works and developed approaches to release that break so that the immune system could in essence target and attack the cancer\nAnd so what has that meant for cancer treatment and general well this is really\nOpened up an entirely new fielding cancer treatment that we call them you know therapy and we see that really as a fourth pillar of cancer treatment joining surgery\nChemotherapy and radiation and creating entirely new way of approaching cancer treatment that can be combined with the other treatments or sometimes used in isolation alone\nDo you think we're going to get to a place because of this where people don't use chemotherapy and radiation to treat cancer\nI I Do believe that this will lead to an sites and two opportunities to see this as a ... form of treatment and allow us to reduce the side effects associate with other treatments as we really look for new ways to treat cancer\nCancer treatment includes immunotherapy\nWell we've seen spectacular resolve including\nPatients who are surviving for decades as a result of these novel treatments when we look more specifically at the populations that have been treated by the drug that Jim ... team has developed we can see the twenty percent of those live for at least three years with many patients living ten years and beyond\nThese are really unprecedented results for patients who really had no other options\nGenes Allison started his career at ... or send in Nineteen Seventy seven and then he returned in twenty twelve to work on\nHow the NBA Anderson moon shots program which we've talked about before basically allowing people to work on things that might pan out it might be game changers or maybe they won't ah ... how many examples like this have you had of the moon shots program really giving you a good results\nWell there's a myth shots program really has enabled us to move into what we think of his team based science and we're seeing tremendous successes as a result of this both scientific discovery as well as policy initiatives that we've moved forward in Washington in Austin and other state capitals\nAccording to the world Health Organization's international agency for research on cancer an estimated Eighteen point one million people will develop cancer and nine point six million will die of cancer this year how hopeful argue about the future of cancer treatment right now\nRight now we're in an unprecedented era of cancer treatment we have the combination of targeted therapy immunotherapy and the use of science as a way to drive discovery as opposed to the historical approaches of screening the environment for compounds that might have anti cancer a fact\nThis change in research strategy coupled with the types of innovations that are heralded in today's a Nobel Prize award really open up avenues that create great opportunities for cancer patients in the future\nIs Dr

eighty thousand where you're more likely to hear chirping birds than honking horns\nThat's because much of the city is now car free parking spaces no traffic lights and in Ninety seven percent cut in auto traffic since Nineteen Ninety nine freelance journalist Stephen ... wrote about this he joined us on Skype from Barcelona welcome\nHigh and did they ban cars entirely in parts of Asia well\nThey they ban them from the initially from the historic part of the city the medieval city which is about three hundred thousand square majors and then they extend that to a slightly bigger\nA area which is sort of the they see nineteenth century part of the city so the city centers calm free and then it's it's it's ringing to buy a areas where you can drive and also where there are a lot of places to park and how's that working out\nUm it's what you know very well let's say you know like most of these things that was a lot of resistance ah people you know associated having caused with their personal liberty um but I spoke to lots of people while I was there and I couldn't find anyone who criticized the even though you know this is a part of Spain where\nTens of rain quite a lot and it's
