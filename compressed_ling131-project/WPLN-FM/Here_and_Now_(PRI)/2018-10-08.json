Scientists spread of what is your reaction to this very dire prediction and the report\nYou captured it this is a really important report and the assignment to the scientists was to tell us what's the difference between the world warming one point five\nOr two degrees Celsius above pre industrial levels and the difference is as you said striking in dire in many instances\nSo this was a lot of scary predictions um but a lot of scary predictions are made in a lot of climate studies by different sources what makes this one different and how do you gauge um the the importance of these protections\n[noise] a lot of the scientists study talks about much larger changes by Twenty one hundred three degrees Celsius which by the way happens to be what countries have put forth in their nationally determine contributions to try to help solve this so they look at much higher temperatures this is the first report to really look at\nWhat would it be like at one point five degrees C and how much effort with the world have to take to reach that goal\nSo again one point five degrees Celsius doesn't sound like a lot um what what would be the consequences according to this\n[noise] was it it is a big deal because think about this the world has gone through about point eight degrees Celsius rise since the pre industrial period if we added another point six degrees Celsius to get to

and now the conflict in Yemen is taking a terrible toll on civilians who are\nCaught in the crossfire a civil war started there in twenty fourteen today in Yemen much like in Syria the fighting has turned into a proxy war involving other countries on opposite sides of the U.S back to the coalition led by Saudi Arabia it's trying to oust rebels known as who these who these are backed by Iran\nDavid Miliband has seen all of this up close he's president and CEO of the international Rescue Committee David Miliband you were just in Yemen two weeks ago what did you see there\nI mean Yemen is the world's largest humanitarian crisis this is a country of twenty eight million people\nEight million people are being fed by the un world food program every day it's a country with three and a half million people are on the brink of famine and wet eighty three percent of the population are in extreme poverty and the temptation is to describe this is uh\nThis is not saying natural catastrophe it same man made a trauma that is the results of a war that has been waged over the last three an off year neither side winning\nAnd they want to ask you about that war because there are lots of people who want to pay attention to what's happening in Yemen it feels very remote it feels it's very complicated as well um could you describe in your own words what this is all about\nYeah I mean Yemen is a conflict goes the hall of the trauma that he's going across the middle east of them the government of Yemen was toppled in two thousand and fourteen by who seek to the who sees are a group from the north of the country socio economically deprived\nOr they rolled over the then government and capture Seventy percent of the country\nI'm what's happened since then is that a Saudi led coalition with us support also UK other European support so it's not that far from home because the U.S is very strongly implicated in as\nA Saudi led coalition has been trying to pull the Yemen the control of the capital Sana'a enough Seventy percent of the country the truth is the Eighteen thousand bombing raids being led by the Saudi led coalition has shifted\nThe front lines of Seventy to eighty percent of the humanitarian and commercial traffic\nIt goes through the port of data which is currently choked really ah by the fighting only a trickle of eight and commercial traffic is getting through um what's happening in Yemen is the ... conflict between the who the is on the Saudi led coalition has both in the Iranians who supporting the who the Z\nBut other than the other side from the Saudis the U.S in the u._k.\nExactly so I immediately you have a theological splits Sunni Shia you also have a split of trout regional power struggle but in the chaos of the groups are emerging separatist groups in the south\nI'll ... drove the Arabian Peninsula in the east ISIS growing as well in my case the case that I saw with my own eyes is that this is a humanitarian catastrophe or the levels of malnutrition are absolutely shocking in that country that have children literally starving to death but at the same time there is a political emergency too\nBecause the only sign that he's gaining from the current stalemate all the extremists of I'll tell you that and I says\nAnd it's a country now which is on the verge of melt down not just humanitarian meltdown but political melt down and look what does that mean it means that the humans are a meltdown is that three and a half million people on the verge of famine forty thousand children are waiting for hospital places in Yemen\nOr there isn't the fuel to support the hospitals there isn't the fuel for the cause you can see half a mile cues at gas stations on the\nRoad you've got teachers and doctors and nurses were not being paid because public sector salaries and not being paid as a country which can't sustain itself at the moment as being ravaged by war\nThat is not to the benefit of any of the sides are waging it was in fact being exploited by extremists and I think that the onus\nOn the permanent members of the Security Council including the U.S on the u._k. is to recognize that this crisis is of no it's no one's benefit the war is not being one and the only way to address both the humanitarian and political emergency is a ceasefire a winning a whole stop digging\nAnd that's the message that needs to go to the Saudi led coalition\nSo hold on right there for a second what is it that the Saudis the u._k. to us and the others want what's their goal\nThat goal is first of all to roll back the influence which they see as being allied to the Iranians\nSecondly to reestablish what they call the legitimate government that was in place before the two thousand um fourteen or two and a third Leon importantly for Saudi Arabia they want to be secure or from missiles being sent from Yemen into Saudi Arabia and there's no question about who sees have launched missiles into Saudi Arabia\nBut what I saw was the price being paid by the Yemeni people far outweigh the costs that were being imposed on the other side\nWe should say that the u._s. acts case they make them pay as his the coalition is taking steps to minimize civilian casualties that obviously\nSix in the ... because I met a young ... who told me about missiles had landed on a hospital next to a health care center that we were delivering\nAnd they all know about the fact that the Saudis bombed a coach or school children more than forty of them killed in ... the U.S interest that Mike Pompeo has indeed\nA certified as he is required to buy congressional legislation that everything is being done to protect civilians why we I Know that seven and a half thousand civilians being directly killed them Monday indirect effects on far larger numbers\nAnd why would the U.S not wanting to protect civilians why would they in the u._k. and even Saudi Arabia I mean why would that not be a priority I\nI'm not costing any ad hominem judgment what I'm saying is that the fact is that civilians are not being protected them to come up to the war has breached the base of the most basic norms and international humanitarian law both on the Saudi led coalition side and on the side independent un inquiries\nHave a ... produced extensive documentation of terrible breaches of international humanitarian law in other words the targeting of civilians by both sides\nAnd this is a crisis that now I came away saying that the world and it's a wake up to what's going on in Yemen and the tragedy is at the U.N General assembly there was no all night session of the U.N Security Council on Yemen the u._k. holds the pen\nA only Yemen filed but the president needs to be picked up because there is not the current debate to replace the failed U.N Security council resolution of twenty Fifteen with something that is actually a route map\nTo peace rather than the ... for\nIf we take the issue of um a refugees which obviously the higher the focus is on to the U. S. indirectly to Washington um you have said that regarding help from the western world\nThey ... moved to a relatively benign climate to a relatively hostile and we know the Trump Administration has cut by Seventy five percent the number of refugees it admits into this country and for a year how does that affect your work\nWe'll just for the benefit of your listeners are about twenty eight million refugees and asylum seekers around the world today most of them are in poor countries not rich countries countries like Jordan and Lebanon countries like Kenya Ethiopia Uganda countries like Bangladesh historically\nFor the most vulnerable refugees widows victims of torture or from children the U.S has stepped up\nAnd being a leader in what's called refugee resettlement which means bringing about on average about Ninety thousand refugees the or the U.S actually on the Reagan Administration was over two hundred thousand\nAnd those people go on to become productive members of American society the Trump Administration has festival changed the security vetting arrangements they want you to update them that's legitimate for any government to do but they've also reduce spy Seventy five percent the cap on the number of\nRefugees are allowed into the U.S and that obviously means that individual lives are affected that are off fifty thousand Iraqis who supported\nThe work of the U.S military and government in Iraq translates as and things that\nAre being allowed into the country either so there are individual stories of people who fear for their own lines who called now starts a new life so we're in the in the U.S which is part of the reason they're in trouble because I ended up being targeted because of that support for the U.S then not being allowed in\nEither so you've got this clamp down on a refugees fleeing for their lives clamp down on people who would claim refugee status because of the work for the u._s.\nKnow is it a bipartisan program of proven success remember refugees contribute more to the American economy than they take out in\nA welfare payments are proven program is being strangled and this year um we are having to deal with the fact that there was a historic low in the number of refugees allowed in only Twenty one thousand in the fiscal year that ended on September\nAnd midtown court dark swine spirits and beer offering more than four thousand winds Fifteen hundred spirits and three thousand beers along with a walk in cigar humid or that will open Sundays eleven AM to seven PM at sixteen ten church street in midtown\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.

Witness news\nThe thieves who pulled off the greatest art heist in history had a pretty simple plan they dressed up and cop uniforms and rang the bell it was one twenty four in the morning and the thieves approached the palace road entrance of the Gardner Museum\nThere'd been a keg party nearby a few revelers were still on the street and when the fate cops told the museum guard on duty that they were responding to a disturbance it seemed plausible maybe some drunk kid had gotten up to some mischief\nAfter all earlier in the evening the guards around had been interrupted by a fire alarm blaring from the museum's carriage house outside it really spoke to him maybe that's why the cops had come and so we ... them into the museum\nThat guard was ...\nThey came in and they turn so I could

first question was is that everybody who I said my partner okay gotta live\nThis is the first time that former guard the one who was on duty that night with habits has ever spoken publicly about his experience\nWondering if they might just come up behind my head with the are done with the silence or and just you know do a real quickly\nIt was terrifying night and all these years later he still rather we not use his full name his first name now is Randy\nIn Nineteen Ninety Randy had a passion for symphonic music the moody blues and the trombone he's still place makes a living at it mostly in house bands on cruise ships but back then Randy had recently earned a master's in performance from the New England conservatory of music he was trying to land gigs and make ends meet\nBut I always had to have some kind of a day job kind of thing to supplement their income mature the bills get paid and so forth\nRandy knew a couple of people who worked at the gardener and that's how we landed his security job there\nIt wasn't something that required you to have any kind of special skills knows I remember being trained to if any people were getting real close to a painting and we were told to get them to stand back a little\nSend to his job Randy began filling in on the overnight shift the pay was better eleven dollars an hour versus seven or eight bucks for the daytime shift\nNighttime when there are no visitors when you're not doing around you can\nBring stuff to read and I could bring my horn and practice I was always happy to say yes to filling in\nRandy doesn't recall any special training are specific instructions for the night shift beyond\nThe requirement that he register his presence in each of the galleries on all the floor during his rounds\nHe did that by swiping a magnetic jak he wasn't originally on the schedule to work the night after St Patrick's Day Randy with filling in for another guard who had reportedly called in sick edited told him about the carriage has to learn but he hadn't thought much of it until he saw the two police officers talking to I have to watch desk\nIt never occurred to me that they might be anything but Boston police I immediately made that connection out of this might have something to do with that alarm that went off\nOne of the uniform demand said he recognized at and asked to see his id\nHe said yeah I Do know you\nThere's a warrant out for your wrist and he told her to stand against the wall or put his arms up he does a pat down it puts the cops on\nAnd on just standing there with my job open going wow you

asking him over and over why are we being arrested why are we being arrested and he wouldn't answer so Cofer on my hands are behind my back and then duct tape starts going\nOn around my eyes so about the time that he begins putting the duct tape on he says this is a robbery and so then everything was finally crystal clear what was going on you know it was just really strange [noise] none of it made any sense and then suddenly it made a lot of sense\nI mean it's scary enough to think you're being arrested and not know why the law was going through your mind when suddenly duct tape is going around your head\nIt's very scary and I'm worried for my life [noise] um but they were immediately saying I can remember both of them saying you know follow instructions and you will not get hurt so that gave me some relief\nAnd I just felt like okay don't try anything stupid don't trying stupid go along with whatever they\nThere's nothing here in this museum that is worth my life\nThe the bond

who remember most who don't use a famous adage women hold up half the sky or in his pronouncement decades ago the men and women in China\nEqual without ever the case and if so what happened to that [noise]\nYes well I mean in the early communist era and there were a lot of changes brought about for women because I mean even even though women still had to assume that double burden of working in the workforce and and and then taking care of children and cooking and the ...\nThe fact is that the Communist Party mobilized women and said that they assigned them jobs either and the cities or said that they had to go work in the fields and so that brought women out of the confinement says of the household\nUm instead of female labor force participation was really on the highest in the world and in the early communist era and that and and the propaganda rhetoric at the time was very much that women can do whatever men can do\nUm and so even today you see the legacy of that early communist era because\nChina's seemed female labor force participation is still relatively high compared to a lot of other countries although it's it's really falling a dramatically with the onset of a market reforms um\nBut but now in the last couple of decades you've seen a huge resurgence of gender inequality as I'm with the dismantling of the planned economy so many women who have been laid off related to men and the gender gap is is rising exponentially in so many ways\nAnd that's a big part of why this feminist movement has grown is because of\nThe dissatisfaction with\nWith this huge gender gap that women\nYou know have to put themselves behind men and so many young women today feel that that's really profoundly unfair what what is the threat that the Chinese government feels yeah well I mean this is what is so fascinating because on the face of it I mean what these women are doing is actually in line with\nThe Chinese government's expressed belief and gender equality\nUm that if you look at the bigger situation of China and now the economic growth the economic miracle of the past few decades is basically over so they are slowing economic growth the workforce is shrinking and birth rates are falling and the population is aging drastically\nSo the government has decided that it really needs to try to boost birth rates and it's very aggressively pushing a particularly educated young women into getting married and having more babies\nUm but the the message of feminism is completely opposite to what the Chinese government is trying to do\nBecause these young feminists are telling other women no you don't have to get married you don't have to have babies if you don't want to but I'm In many ways I Believe that that that sexism and massage any and the subjugation of women pushing women to return to these traditional roles of beautiful wife and mother\nUm all of that is at the core of what I called China's patriarchal authoritarianism how is the Chinese government pushing that\nWell I mean it's doing a lot of different things first of all there is a very aggressive propaganda um that that is\nUp and get married and have babies before they turn thirty otherwise if they wait too long then their babies will have birth defects um and so I've seen for example people's daily articles which is a official Chinese state media that women in college shouldn't wait to get pregnant\nUm they should seize on their so called best childbearing years and they can have a baby or even to while they're still in college so propaganda is a big part of it but then there's also policies um says that the um [noise] much publicized so called one child policy recently ended\nSo China officially now has a to child policy it's being encouraging are trying to push\n'em particularly Han Chinese couples to have two children but in spite of this really dramatic policy change on on a population the birth rate still fell last year and this poses a huge crisis for the Chinese government\nAs it looks to the future um and so there's this huge confrontation now between\nThe agenda of the government which is pushing very traditional gender norm I'm pushing women into the into the home to become baby breeders on the one hand but then you have this enormous I'll swelling of I'm particularly educated young women\nWho are pushing back in every way um and so what is unfolding right now isn't just an extraordinary moment in China's history\nAnd the Internet played a big role as well more and more women went on line and we're sharing their stories but other areas I work with all the censorship going on China will well this is what is so fascinating because in spite of the intense Internet censorship would just become incredibly sophisticated\nThat these women are ... they're so imaginative that they find ways\n\n\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

in danger and conservative Tehran, Iran\nHer latest book is called here to stay it takes on the issues of Islamophobia and cyber bullying at a private school near Boston the hero is a high school junior name be Shaun he's of Middle Eastern descent and his sudden stardom on the basketball court\nHas some ugly consequences Sarah fairs on as a child of parents who came to us from Iran I asked her what she and that student be John have in common\nWe went to a similar high schools um he doesn't go to my high school it's fiction but we do go to a predominantly\nWhite an affluent um private school as you did I did which was very lucky and privileged and so we have that experience I played basketball until it was clear I wasn't going to get much taller so should um\nGive it up we both love comic books we both like women but have difficulty talking to them I've gotten a little better but he um he needs a little help he is of mixed heritage his dad his Jordanian um his mother is a Persian but grew up here\nSo you place to be John directly on the basketball court um ... is a star player he's realized to be a star player really quickly and kind of rises in in social status and very quickly but then things change what happens in a school\nSomeone doesn't like all the newfound attention he's getting and I'm One of his colleagues since right right and heat and we don't know who sent the email 'em but has created a photoshopped image of him to look like a\nTerrorist holding an AK forty seven with the ... face right All right yeah sort of shocked on yeah and a half century anonymously to the student body to the school is trying to figure out who has sent it his mother and other parents are are very upset and I'm wanting to figure out how to fix the culture of the school and make sure he's OK\nOther students are that are behind him and allies sort of inadvertently want to make him a poster child for something and he just wants to be a kid and so he's basically saying you know look I don't really want to be\nUm the poster boy for international politics right [laughter] and people have all sorts of rumors and gossip about him you know some people saying like well\nAll these kinds of questions all at once that he's never had to deal with and shouldn't have to you know kids should really have to do do you have to deal with it I sort of did the thing where when nine eleven happened and everyone was very scared\nI didn't like what I was hearing about sort of all this rage like hate crimes on the radio and\nSo I sort of made it a point to say please don't get caught up in racial profiling and the sort of thing and then when I wrote an opinion piece for the school paper they called me Arab American which I'm not not that there's anything wrong with that and you're Muslim I grew up pretty secular but yeah technically but then I had to write a follow up to that opinion piece\nSaying that's really great but I'm actually Persian Americans and this is the same as equating a Japanese person to a Korean person where so it was just kind of I think people just didn't know what to do and then started asking not invasive questions but sort of like they never really thought of it before\nYou called us polite racism and this is something to be John faces as well ... what's the difference between polite and impolite where he says I think\nMost people get the impression that you know racism terrible anyway and there's no really fully polite racism but there's a difference between painting something on your house or throwing a rock and a window\nVersus a micro aggression or saying something that sort of a little barbed or and made to some sort of other someone so\nHow does ... in the book real life to understand\nI think he's he's had to deal with sort of it's in for that have sort of had to deal with stuff before it's just never been as viral as he does in the book\nAnd he for the most part it's pretty cool and calm and collect\n'em and stands up for other people in his sphere and himself but there are other times when his internal monologue you can tell that he is really I'm hurting\nAnd I think that's important too especially for boys where they might say like you know step or yeah how's school fine you know but inside there's a lot of other stuff going on so I tried to\nTo have them have a pretty rich in our life\nSo he puts up with a polite racism and then you know you get into the idea of cyber bullying and then things become exacerbated and get even more painful\nWhen you were writing this how did you decide whether to make some of the characters that Caucasian character specifically in the book deplorable or not deplorable I mean wouldn't have wouldn't Iran experience made you decide well maybe this person is uninformed and this person is racist\nFor me personally it was really difficult to write this book because I Do want to get away from books that are sort of like where the character has to deal with Islamophobia like the character to just have an adventure or\nYou know be the hero and you know get to do stuff that other main characters get to do twenty or just like you don't want it just like the character doesn't white lady chose your person you don't want to be the ... well no but for all kids like I just want them to be able to be like I Am the basketball hero and this is you know what I've achieved\nBut I did want to sort of address this thing that really\nHas bothered me for quite some time and it's not that I think that there are certain people who can't combat racism or or get over it maybe after the book finishes\nBut for that time and space I Want to talk about things that I think young people are dealing with and maybe don't get a lot of media time [noise]\nWhat do you what's the payoff for us is just getting the book out there do you want to hear from people who recognize themselves on one side or the other in the book for better or worse\nFeel that the book doesn't represent them fully but it's just one story and one perspective I Do hope that he is a main character that maybe people were not expecting and really love\nI just want this kid to really even though he's fictional and very fond of him I didn't like making hurt a lot of times but I Know that if maybe people read about him hurting they'll hurt real people last\nIf you were I mean there's the young adult book if you were kind of work up a lesson plan for this and you wanted to conversation to be started among students what would be the theme of that conversation\nHuh I Would say what does it take to find one voice and prejudice times and how can you stand up for yourself and others when that's really difficult which is a\nGreat hope but we'll see how that pans out Sarah far as I'm thank you thank you so much appreciate it\nSarah fires on the book is called here to stay to read an excerpt go to here and now dot org\n\n[noise]\nToday the twenty Eighteen Nobel memorial prize in
