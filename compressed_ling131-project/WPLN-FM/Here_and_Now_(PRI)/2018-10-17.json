G A ... and of course we remember in Trump just set it right there Trump's that the U.S has a big relationship economically and politically with Saudi Arabia\nIt's incredibly important I mean one of the things that's been quite disturbing to me over the last couple of years is how the president has pulled America back from some of its international relationships but then also pulled back from talking about American values when you go around and that's why I spent a lotta time earlier my career\nTraveling the globe and half of the governmental baffled private organizations and you know I always felt the security\nThat if something happened to me the United states government would be there to help ride to the rescue I just think if you're working for an international organization in some part of the world today you don't feel that level of security may have felt six months ago ... was a U.S rather\nWell but Alice how would you advise working all he was president also looking for an American newspaper which\nPresident Trump gates he hates that newspaper the Washington shouldn't matter right where they go but em but Alice how how would you advise Republicans at this moment of the crown prince\nHad had other moments you know he was detained um Saudi billionaires in a hotel there are the war in Yemen there's the war in Yemen um here's Republican Senator Lindsey Graham on Fox and friends just yesterday about Mohammed been telling\nThis guy's gotta go Saudi Arabia the lifting there are a lot of good people you can choose but NBS his tainted your country and painted himself and\nNow it's just this painting Trump because there's a whiff of the fact that he has personal relations with the Saudis his son in law and daughter you know have potential business deals with them and that's it he's starting to feel like it's more personal than for the good of the country for human rights Robin\nUnfortunately it feels as though there is a little bit more than a whiff of connection between the president and the the first family and uh the Saudi officials which is a big concern\nAnd no see College of art hosting a panel discussion for the masters in instructional designer and October twenty ninth panelist include instructional designer from businesses in middle Tennessee including H ca\nLearned more at no C. dot edu slash RSVP powerful membership campaign begins on Monday when you support Nashville public radio you'll not only help pay for the programs you value you'll also have a chance to win a thousand dollar Amazon gift card three nights at okay ... more seven nights in Costa Rica\nMake a gift no W ... or\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners or W.

created the memorable dancer Ruth Peter Pan the king and I [noise]\n\nDon't make the case that these populist cheeses kept Robbins from assuming his pop replaced and hands\nIt because he was beside it as one of the country's most powerful story there's low brow so the more abstract will the tiny country down here to examine this late rushing going choreographer and cofounder of the New York city down a who hired at thirty one year old\nCompanies associate artistic director\nAuthor Wendy lesser says she's made it her vow her sworn duty to overturn the prevailing miss about Robbins her new book Jerome Robbins a life in dance and she joins us now when you lesser welcome thank you for having me Robyn just you know thinking of the west Side Story scenes that we that are now in our minds\nYou write it said that I hadn't heard that in the film version these sharks and jets snapping their fingers are like above us we're beneath them somehow and that's because Jerome Robbins had trenches dug\nThat's right and if you go back and see the movie and I have to say although I Love the ballets and I am championing of\nThem in this book I Am not saying anything bad about west side story is a master piece it's a great work and so was Peter Pan you know he really was a genius\nIn that field it's just that uh because he was so good in that field for the reasons you said his ballets got the wrong sort or not enough attention right anyway about the west Side Story family yes he had trenches\nDug into the street and you can actually go and see the movie again and see that you are lower than the dancer and I\nThink it will be fabulous well so how do we start you are familiar with the ballet world had certainly observed it um had written about it and then you started writing this book for Yale University presses Jewish lives series for the hundreds centennial a journal Robin ... birth\nCertainly knew about his works as we all would know about west side story and and the king and I\nAnd then you're bowled over by something you didn't know about I didn't either until you wrote about it John Robbins Nineteen Seventy one ballet Goldberg Variations for the New York city ballet set to across the music from box let's just listen to a little\n\nOkay so you will have all of the of videos that we talk about here at here now dot org but what ... what are we seeing in this valley what did you see that that really got you [noise]\nThe thing is that I went to that program not ever having heard of a Goldberg Variations by Jerome Robbins I didn't know he did a dance to it\nAnd I went to see the west Side Story sweet which was on the same program and to my enormous surprise Goldberg variation turned out to be an incredible masterpiece eighty minutes long with a live in a stove or on the side every kind of movement you could imagine standard ballet folks style\nQuarterly friendly formal it was just an amazing range of dance it use thirty dancers and all and it had the feeling of the music I Can't say anything better about a piece of dance than to say\nThat had the feeling of box cobra variation and I loved it so much I went back the following week and then I thought something's going on here that I don't know about I think of him as\nThe west Side Story man that Peter Pan man's fiddler on the roof man but really if he can do a ballet like this how many others could have done\nAnd you even spoke to a friend who said oh yeah I saw that back when it first came out and I remember really loving it and then feeling a little bad about that\nThat's right that was the impression I got and I couldn't figure out exactly why that would be although I knew that Robbins had a reputation as being lower than Balanchine who was the king the saint of ballet and I knew that a lot of people thought because there was a Broadway guy he couldn't really do ballet although Balanchine never thought that\nBut then I read Amanda veils and Deborah Xiao it's excellent biographies two of them and they both mentioned in relation to Goldberg Variations that Arlene crochet had panned it and that she was hit most\nAnd absolutely the most powerful ballet critic of her generation\nAnd you said you sat there stunned at the beauty of this piece for however many many minutes\nAh she called it Ninety minutes of hard labor and also called you and Robbins affects all angry man that was later but you became as you write like a court appointed lawyer you were going up from Robbins words as a belly choreographer\nAnd so let's take a listen to some of it again the pieces and we will have as much as well as we can hear another word afternoon of a fun Nineteen fifty three to the music of Davy see I'm willing to do the Nineteen fifty five Canadian TV taping of it with the original ballerina tend to feel the click handy\nRobbins muse and dear friend [noise] and this is a year before she was paralyzed by polio [noise]\nOr or [noise]\nHow is this a reimagining of

just\nA reimagining of the music better reimagining ... version that he did in the very beginning of the twentieth century the fun is the main character and he has priest is was dancing around and stuff but he's practically a solar\nWhereas Robbins imagined this as a direct [noise]\nWonderful do ... I think where it simultaneously about the ballet world we're looking at two dancers in a studio partly and then it's also\nAbout a foreign and his dream girl who comes and\nVisit him and with those two dancers tend to kill the clip and ... was it was a knockout and what are they\nThey're like they're watching themselves in her practice mirrors\nThat is what it feels like and we are the mere they're looking toward us out in the audience but they seem to be looking in the mirror as dancers\nSometimes to do in a studio so that there's this weird feeling of we're spying on them in a way\nAnd bouncing himself never took the superior attitude toward things that had to plug he was balancing loved dancers at a gathering which Robbins made and down she said it was so\nGreat you should make more make more it's like popcorn and he said like you could eat at the whole thing endlessly\nPopcorn and that's probably drove others you know off the cliff but let me ask you a little dances at a gathering this is a the dance Robin Hood Chopin music in Nineteen sixty nine [noise]\nHe had been away from the New York city ballet doing ...\nBroadway but this stance of data gathering with an instant had letters to\nA\nLot\nAnd what do we see in this day dancing the gathering starts with a young man alone on stage and sort of ended up with him [noise]\nTouching the stage after many many minutes\nI you know it's quite a long ballet of all the dancers coming in and joining him and they all get to strut their stuff and they combine in many different ways\nBut the idea is they are dancers hanging out together and so one of the things Jerome Robbins did this happen stand up beside\nWatching each other as others are dancing it's again like afternoon on a combination of\nA work that meant for us and that that it's meant to have\nWeb streaming is made possible by electronic express with a comprehensive selection of smart appliances for Katie's computers and accessories for the smart home available in stores or online at electronic express dot com code W.

what happened while you were sleeping and the news interviews and analysis for the day I had national international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nThis year and now every president since Jimmy Carter has voluntarily released his tax returns to the public but Donald Trump has not here's Trump on sixty minutes after he was elected in November\nWas a rate of the possibility of fraud and that story yes well I mean again I I Would think that you know it's it's up to the committee and the house to decide what exactly it's doing and why it searching it but I\nI think I could come up with some very legitimate arguments purposes for the committee to take this action\nWhat is the history of this law goes back to Nineteen twenty four the law that allows the house to do this to to get somebody's tax returns\nYeah so it is a almost a hundred year old law\nAnd the circumstances when it came about we're actually fairly close to our current circumstances or the law prior to this law allowed only the president to make a decision of who's tax information could be disclosed\nAt that time when the law was that law was in effect it frustrated Congress and the early Nineteen twenties\nUh there were a variety reasons two principal one where they were\nCarrying out a number of investigations of the executive branch including the scandal that became known as the teapot dome scandal involving some high level executive branch officials of the committees that were investigating wanted to examine their tax returns\nAnd because of the law they have to actually go to the president and request permission from the president to get the tax material even though they were investigating\nYou know I'm executives under the present it and so obviously Congress realized she we're not really a co equal branch of government if we have to go through this kind of procedure\nA there was a similar concern a about treasury secretary Andrew Mellon who um was an extremely wealthy and successful business person prior to going into government and like the president or did not surrender or\nPlace in a blind trust his business interests but simply or retain them while he was in office and that obviously been raised all sorts of questions in Congress is mind\nAh the the the Coolidge administrative from that time was pushing through various tax legislation just like the existing indigenous ration pushed through at the end of last year\nAnd there were issues of well how would this legislation affect you personally how would it affect your businesses you know so there was all of that going on in Congress ultimately decided to be a co equal branch of government it needed to have\nThe authority to get this information directly just as the executive branch already had\n[noise] do you think that if President Trump's tax returns are released in some way if if the Democrats take the house and they're able to get them that people who want to see them will be satisfied with what they see because what are we really going to learn from them well that's\nA tough question because obviously it depends on what people want to see and I can't really say that people will be set aside without knowing exactly what people want to see\nUm I Would think as a policy matter you'd want to see you know somebody who for example is very honest in their tax filing because that goes to the character of a person let's make sure that you first did file returns did pay taxes and paid more or less the right amount of tax\nBut President Trump for example took a big loss on real estate in one year and didn't pay taxes for ten years after that that would be as he's been saying legal it may not look good to some but it also might not prove anything that people don't already know about him\nRight so I agree with that I mean what\nIn terms of character is simply complying with the law but I think another area that would be\nFairly obvious to me would be the possibility of conflicts of interest we know that\nThe president has a lot of authority to undertake various ah relationships on behalf of the country and the question is\nWhat are the these decisions and is there some personal or business\nInterest on the part of some of the decision making going on I Would think that would be a very legitimate inquiry on the part of a number of people in the public and if they wanted to know that that would be something that might come out from an examination returns\nAnd I would add one more thing which is whether he actually made as much money as he said he did what we would find that out in terms of his yearly income yeah although I think that you know you need to be a little cautious about that because of tax return typically doesn't

sixteen there's a lot more Republican enthusiasm than it's being reported\nFrom Boston Globe reporter and editor Ben Bradlee junior just spent some time in a key county in Pennsylvania which President Trump won he\nProfiles twelve Trump voters in his new book just out the forgotten how the people of one Pennsylvania county elected Donald Trump and changed America Ben Bradlee junior welcome to here and now that you will first tell us about this county in Pennsylvania\nThis is a county ... county in northeast Pennsylvania county seat is Wilkes Barre uh it's not very prosperous fraying at the edges and has been hurting for a long time\nAnd combing through a vote in the three critical swing states Pennsylvania and Michigan or Wisconsin I discovered loser and county which is a traditionally democratic county hadn't voted Republican since Nineteen eighty eight for Bush senior\nPresident Obama want it to time President Obama\nWon it twice but its surged in the other direction for Trump and he wanted by twenty points building up such a margin in this one county that it was sixty percent of his victory margin for the state of Pennsylvania so without this one county or he wouldn't have wanted to state or perhaps the presidency\nAnd you profiled twelve people in this book how did you find them well I went\nDown initially poking around and you do what the journalists do you go to community leaders and a newspaper editors talk show host\nAnd learn who the Trump voters were and start talking to them when one person or redo to another I ended up interviewing a over the months a about a hundred in depth but it's settled on\nTwelve a who stories I decided to tell and I think that this is a window or a deep dive if you will into the Trump vote and that at least more than half the country remain shocked at a candidate is unusual was Trump got elected\nAnd there's a hunger to know more about how it happened\nAnd you talk to a number of people who all kind of had different reasons for supporting Trump you you'd you'd dipped into many different views of him one of the people that you spoke with Tiffany cloud\nTold you that Trump's simple relate a bull speak like huge big league or big league may have turned off voters and other parts of the country but it helped him connect with people in Missouri and county but I think people base\nMost of their vote for president on the extent to which they can relate to them on a human level uh how ... they are and I think that that is in the end more important than where they stand on a variety of issues and\nI think the people that I settle on a generally like Trump on most issues but really likes his style they just like to see um\nHow he gets up every morning and I'm ... has a tweet storm and I'm six or to the elites\nAnd they did not feel that he was being condescending toward them that he was talking down to them\nNo on the contrary they felt heard and listen to and felt that Hillary was talking down to them especially with her now infamous remark calling them the deplorable [noise]\nOne of the things that we were talking about during the campaign is that\nWhat Trump was saying was not what he actually met or not what many people were hearing from him um and and you talk to people here in ... county who you know they hear him say I'm going to build a wall and what they would hear is not actually going to build the wall but he's gonna he's going to beef up the wall\nYeah the interesting they talked about the importance of deep coding Trump saying that the press was unfair to them to him and would treat him or to literally by merely covering\nA what he said we would get into lively discussions about this I said well that's the press his job candidate says something in the press is supposed to report it and they said no no you really making too much of a hollow blew out of you know the Access Hollywood tape and we know what he meant that kind of thing and so it was a way of\nApologizing for him and trying to make his rhetoric a understandable [noise]\nWhat about religion this is a place that is very Catholic um and it's also a place that used to be big in the coal industry that that's gone away but how much does religion play into how people view President Trump\nIt's still predominantly Catholic not majority so there's a rising evangelical population\nTrump's um evangelical vote was off the charts he carried a eighty percent of the evangelical vote so I I talked to I'm a woman for whom Trump was literally sent by God\nShe believed that Trump was sent to cure America's political dysfunction\nAnd does she feel like he's delivered she does he's\nAppointed evangelicals to his cabinet vice president Pence is evangelical they're willing to um excuse the Stormy Daniels business as essentially much ado about nothing\nIn fact that he's been married three times they don't care for them the the most important issues are abortion and his delivering too conservative Supreme Court\nJustices what about just the overall sense of the place uh right now in twenty eight teen this is a place where there's not a lot of opportunity there are also a lot of drug overdoses\nGoing on I mean this is you could go there and just do a book about the opioid crisis in this area\nThe opioid crisis is really bad they're really bad and it's affecting the entire county\nEven if you don't have someone in your family who is a an addict I'm the ripple effect is a widespread and or the county coroner\nDown there and he is uh just overworked and a thinks that it's an enormous problem and is trying to raise public awareness about it but it's pretty bleak in Missouri and county\nAnd young people are leaving is a brain brain is not a lot of opportunity beyond\nMaintenance and uh working in warehouses minimum wage jobs\nAnd do they think that things have gotten any\nEight or has gone down in the county as it has a nationally and perhaps it's a little bit better there but a lot you know a lot of the economic promises that Trump made during the campaign he hasn't really followed through on you know he said he would repeal and replace Obamacare\nOr the individual mandate has been repealed but he's been really uh sabotaging Obamacare and there is no neither Trump for the Republican Party has come up with an alternative plan\nHe said that he would reduce the deficit by in his first or eight years\nBefore I got an up the budget he filed in February or a shows a seven trillion dollar increase so you'll Republican Party doesn't seem to care about what about these voters do they care about those things they don't hasn't been able to do they don't seem to really care in the final analysis because\nThey just like Trump I think it's it's personality over or anything else\nDo you think that the Democrats are connecting now with the people of Lucerne county I remember speaking to the liberal filmmaker Michael Moore who said you know they they didn't even try to win a place like Michigan or in the last election they didn't come here the way that Trump did\nUm there's been a lot of criticism that Democrats are ignoring these people that you've been talking to in in places like lives there and county well they certainly did and\nThe twenty sixteen and I think they would do well to listen more to Democrats a lot of the people that I talked to were Democrats are but felt that the party had left them rather than they are leaving the party\nAny thoughts on what might happen in the midterms\nWell if I had to guess I Would think the um this so called blue wave I don't know how big it will be but I think probably big enough for the Democrats did we take the hours but I'm not the Senate\nAnd the great house landscape company and

little red schoolhouse and Elizabeth Irwin high school in Manhattan\nWhich began to group the few minority students in the same home room so they'd have a place where they felt less like the other here's director Philippe Casson\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and for part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school or that felt supportive of their academic experience\nBut the parents of some of the minority students headed smelled of segregation and they worry that a gay their kids the feeling of being left out so the school end of the policy our question is it the right thing to group African American or Hispanic students together when they are the minority in school\nWe turn to Dr Beverly Tatum she's the author of the best seller why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria she's also former president of stolen college in historically black college for women\nThat ... the director of the little red schoolhouse said they're revisiting this maybe it should have been more structured but then it was very well intentioned your thoughts\n[noise] um I think it was well intentioned and certainly there's a lot of\nEvidence to suggest that there is value to give\nBlack kids time together sometimes that time together is called affinity group thing not necessarily in class time but time in a school time to talk to each other about the issues that adolescents are concerned about that can be very helpful talk about what is happening\nFor these teenagers because as you write in your book in the chapter called why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria [noise]\nIt seems are different in grade school kids are playing in the sand box with kids that look different from them and then something happens in high school was happening [noise] one of the things that's happening is the changing adolescent brain meaning that as kids move into puberty\nThey start to think in a more sophisticated way they start to recognize the ways in which race plays itself out and you know there's lots of literature to suggest\nThat a black boys in school in particular I'm more likely to be disciplined for similar behaviors and also girls are experiencing questions about what does it mean to be a young black girl and having space to talk about that is not\nA bad thing it can be actually a very helpful thing the stereotypes that we see of\nBlack women are imposed on them and so they might develop\nThat sure well if I Am a young African American students and I'm trying to understand what it means to be a black person in a white dominated society\nOne of the things that I might be thinking about is\nI don't want to be perceived as quote acting white some social scientists have said you know the black kids think doing well in school is acting white but that's not universally true if you are in a largely black school and a lot of black kids are in schools that are segregated\nBecause their neighborhoods are segregated they're going to the local school\nAnd if you are in a school like that\nThe honor students are black but if you are in a predominantly white school the honors group is largely white and most of the black and brown kids are in the lower tracks if that's what your school looks like\nThan you are likely to think doing well in school being in that honors track is so called acting why it's such a vicious cycle because very often\nThe kids are in those lower ... maybe because they come from low income families but very often there's bias on the part of the teacher that puts a child in that track when in fact they should be in a higher tractors a lower expectation\nBut what ends up happening is this sense that they don't belong anywhere else so they start to bond further with the group that they're in and in fact tracking often does result in re segregation with in racially integrated schools for the reason we were just talking about\nThe kids of color are being put in the lower ability groupings\nPerhaps because they are less well prepared and maybe that's related to family income and previous preparation but sometimes it isn't about that because there's also data that suggests that black kids who test as well on placement exams are still less likely to be placed\nIn those upper attracts you know the the the little red school so they looked at research it was probably yours in your book\nBut to read that was pretty amazing they'd have the same test scores that still not be placed so what do we do\nAbout how to address this notion that perhaps there should be some support without making it look like segregating them or again reinforcing the low expectations this brings us\nTo the Boston medical program the greater Boston metropolitan counsel for education opportunity program Nineteen Ninety four the notion of bussing kids from the inner city from troubled spots in the inner city out to the suburbs very good schools but all white schools\nIt was kind of a failure at first talk a little bit about that and then what sure so most of the children who are traveling from Boston entity suburban schools are black or Latino\nAnd often there's a sense of not really belonging they are not part of the local community and so when superintendents of these programs look at the performance of the black kids in particular\nThey often find that the kids are not doing as well as they would like them to be doing there's also may not an echo but you write another anecdote about a young girl who was in a school a majority white\nAnd the teacher was saying are you going to the dance kid doesn't want to say how we're going to get to the dance you know I I get busted school my parents don't have cars we live in the city but she doesn't say that uh-huh and to teach you get so frustrated that she won't say she's going to the dance\nThat she then ends up saying something racial she says oh come on you people love to dance which\nAdds to the racialized moment that the young girl was feeling exactly that teacher who made that comment was well intentioned but nonetheless projected a stereotype and it made the students feel even more like she didn't really ...\nIs a program back in the nineties I was very involved and uh one of the districts I was involved with decided to start a program in the middle school\nFor medical students and they set aside one period a day for the kids to meet together to talk about issues related to academic performance academic achievement as well as some of the social concerns they had wait a minute this is a little little red schoolhouse his whole room\nIt sounds like that there isn't it but what the difference between this experience and the little red schoolhouse is that they did it for a year and then they evaluate it how it worked and what they found was that the children who were having that experience improved academically\nAnd also they became more engaged socially why what are the kids say happened\nI'm at the kids said they felt more supported they had the opportunity to talk without invoking stereotypes about some of the things that were challenging them so if you've been riding on a bus from Boston for an hour and maybe there's been conflict on the bus\nYou could go to that meeting and talk about it get it off your mind and and be more focused in class or if something happened in class let's say here's an example that one of the kids provided in this study\nUm they were watching a film eyes on the prize which is about the civil rights era and some of the white kids were laughing at something that happened in the film something that the black kids found upsetting and so the fact that their white peers were laughing as though it were funny and the black as we're feeling like this is horrible\nI'm was upsetting to them rather than a walking around agitated they were able to talk about it debrief it's soda so to speak in that um [noise] time together in ways that they found helpful by the way the title of your book again why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria\nNobody ever asked why why kids are in the cafeteria their bonding in in many ways\nAbsolutely and it's also important to say as you just did\nWe don't ask why all the white kids sitting together in the cafeteria but in fact at the college level it is actually the white students were more likely to be racially isolated it is possible for white kids still to not engage with the diversity to stick to people who look like themselves\nJust such an odd thing in any high school or just about every college the entire culture is black whether it's the music comedians sit they're following or the sports figures it must be very odd for young blacks to see that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Nashville", "day": "17"}
