B. U. R. I'm Peter O'Dowd and I'm ... now authorities have taken one person into custody today in connection with the suspicious packages sent to critics of President Trump twelve packages had been discovered so far the latest address to senator Cory Booker and to the former director of national intelligence James Clapper\nNPR's Quil Lawrence has been following this story Quil what do we know about the man who was arrested earlier today\nAh his name is ... uh fifty six years old he's from uh Ventura Florida just north of Miami\nA possibly born in New York but has lived in Florida for several years he's a registered Republican he has a criminal history in Florida dating back to Nineteen Ninety One including\nA theft and fraud charges um and Joe what's perhaps the most telling about him if uh the the media reports and the ... the pictures we've been seeing off his van are in fact his is just a a\nA a political manifesto written on the side of his white van in stickers ah where he uh has a lot of references to vice president uh parents and of course President Trump or and also against George Soros\nI'm so I'm looking at his social media you can see that he's a very much involved in politics he tweeting about uh the governor's race against the Democratic candidate and Andrew Gillum down\nTheir police were said to have known about this man is he saying he had a criminal past you know what it is that led to stories directly to him\nThere had been uh some focus on Florida as where these packages had been mailed from\nA very quickly and a experts have been talking about the amount of evidence that might have been left behind because these packages included tape and plastic bubble wrap that there could be fingerprints as well as possibly DNA I'm so authorities were were moving very quickly on this and we're focusing on Florida\nAnd we can assume that they tracked from the the or possibly from surveillance cameras at at the post office where they found that some of these pathogens might have been sent from but it's early days\nWe'll do you have any idea and just how he was arrested or was he with the vehicle that um that they took away at the time was he considered dangerous when they arrested him\nWe know he was arrested at about eleven o'clock this morning in a parking lot of a shopping center and plantation Florida which is just outside of Fort Lauderdale\nUm you know there was some street shutdown around there are and there was this white van which was towed away covering stickers ah people on social media have been tweeting\nPictures of the white van because it was such a a a noticeable vehicle or people who had seen it in traffic and and taking pictures of it to send you their friends are now putting them up on social media so you can kind of a read into his character from what he displayed on his van\nPresident Trump a got word earlier today right after the arrest apparently and spoke about the investigation and the arrest or when the president was at an event for the young black leadership some and at the White House this afternoon here's a part of what he said\nIn addition to I'm supporting our journalism we are giving this so we do have a drawing tonight our final grand prize drawing anyone who gives is entered into that drawing it is a seven night trip for two to Costa Rica I don't think we haven't given away a trip to Costa\nRica you have not not that I Know of but it it looks fantastic the images are the facts may through a couple of those out later you want to do that right now get in on at W. peeling dot

critical habitat for endangered green sea turtles and monk seals\nToday it is mostly underwater hurricane lock a tour through the central Pacific earlier this month and literally white Easter Island off the map\nSatellite photos show only sliver of land where the eleven acre island once stood out from the ocean and climate scientists say a warming ocean could be to blame chip Fletcher is a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii joins us now and and chip you were on Easter Island in July\nWhen you heard that it had just been washed away what what was your reaction\n[noise] well it was quite stunning [noise] um I had not followed hurricane lock I knew it as headed north from us but it never occurred to me that that might be a\nHead into French rated shows and do damage to these very important small islands [noise] um so I was quite stunned\nMost people have probably never heard of this island we're going to post before and after pictures that here and now that orbit to tell us about it and why it was important to you\nWell it's a beautiful place\nOf ah undergraduate and graduate students and some postdoctoral researchers headed up there in July under a grant for the national fish and wildlife association\nIs loose sand and gravel it's made of uh the skeletal debris of the surrounding reef system\nAs small as it is it is absolutely critical to the Hawaiian green sea turtle into monk seals there is just not much land up there\nThis is low so it's easy for them to haul out of there is a sort of upper region to the island where sea turtles could um digs are nests and lay their eggs safely\nAnd there are only about a half dozen of these that were left but in the last month we've lost two of them one of them being deceased island which was the largest one uh that remained\nWhat are the implications for those animals nearly half of the world's remaining green sea turtles nest there and one seventh of all the Hawaiian monk seals alive today were born on this little islands I mean this this is very important for those animals will they survive without it\nYeah yeah I'm the implications for these animals are they will have to find new habitat and if you look at the photo that was taken this past weekend by government scientists who flew over the island\nYou can see a small little bit of fans still sticking up above the waves and there must be a dozen monk seals already hauled out on that so it points to the fact that this is really important land they'll have to find a new place for raising their young lay their eggs [noise]\nUm and there are fewer and fewer of these places left will they turned to the south and come to the main Hawaiian Islands that can be problematic because much of the doing area in the main islands has been developed with roads and houses\nCan they turn to the north to some of the other ... are there are some additional Sandy islands to the north but not very many huh\nYou knew this island was low lying it was Sandy ... did you expect it to vanish one day or were you surprised at the hurricane to does much damage\nWell answer is yes to both of those I figured\nThat this island under the threat of sea level rise maybe had another decade or two or three but certainly by mid century um it it would I Would be surprised if it were still in existence\nI didn't expect with a location this far north that it's due to vary a strong chance of being intercepted by a hurricane\nBut of course with climate change these weather systems are finding new pathways they're migrating away from the equator and their new areas new habitats and new human communities that are being threatened by hurricanes that that hadn't happened before\nThe twenty Eighteen hurricane season we're seeing actually is one of the most intense on record in the Pacific um or the other islands around there that are that are also in danger or their other problems that you foresee happening because of that\nYes it was and still is a very intense hurricane season and I think a earlier this week we saw hurricane strikes in northern Mary Alice islands are at one point the wind gusts approach two hundred miles per hour the average wind speed was up around a hundred and sixty five miles an hour\nAnd um you know that's just an example of what a category ... hurricane would look like even though we have no such category ... cents last year as hurricane season and\nTwenty Seventeen scientists are now thinking uh with the growth\nIn hurricanes are getting larger the wind speed stronger maybe it's time for a new category\nIs there a chance that he's down to come back someday\nThere is a chance for sort of crossing our fingers it looks as if the sand um was a moved by the hurricane to the north and north east\nMay push that sand back towards a word originally was and we might see some accretion or building of the island but our understanding of these islands is that they formed on a fall in the level around two thousand years ago\nWe are currently in a stage of rising sea level and so the fundamental background conditions for reforming the Saudi Arabian or don't exist\nThat ship flood or a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii thanks for speaking with us yeah thank you\nAnd other conversation now with connections to climate this one pertaining to the economy the U.S economy grew at three and a half percent in the third quarter of this year according to government figures out today one of the few things that Democrats and Republicans seem to agree on is that economic growth is good for everybody\nBut our next guest argues the uprising economic growth has quoted driven us into a ditch from an environmental standpoint\nAnd chasing Chowdhury is the executive director of the Brooklyn Institute for social research he says if we want to deal with climate change small incremental change won't work he says we need to rethink our system of capitalism starting with our obsession with economic growth because of focus on growth causes us to prioritize the\nWrong things there are lots of things in the short term could mean certain kinds of economic growth there's a lot more money right there's a lot more than ... GDP to be made in extra activism than there is in and sort of sustainability\nUm so actually what we need to really think be searching the conversation from and this is a huge shift it's not just a shift about policies have shipped about the way we imagine politics the way the imagine economics\nIs not so much would you we want growth do we want less wrote it what do we actually want from ... usually when people say oh I Want high growth rate what they mean something like\nOh high growth rates are going to lead to more prosperity\nUm but I actually know I can do nice pair comparison right um they are very high growth rates in China we are very high growth rates in India and yet somehow China seems to be able to turn those into slightly better social outcomes than India is\nA lot of what we associate with growth\nUm can be achieved through other means distribution on means other ways of thinking about economic outcomes than what we currently talking about\nIs this an academic exercise or do you really [laughter] half of\nIt is possible do I think it's like a hundred percent uh like it's a certainty no in fact there's like so much arrayed against it I think so often this conversation about climate change\nGets ... F ... things like oh are you like how much plastic surgery recycling how much are you can posting have you eaten more beans and meet\nRight like as opposed to like how have you worked to make an actual democratic politics more possible today right have you become part of a movement how are you doing those things those things are actually much more important believe it or not that our individual consumption choice\nWhat kind of movement I mean like one give give me one thing okay so I could not I'm not going to eat red meat any more but you're not stead of that you become part of movement that would do what\nAnyone who is emphasizing any movement that is trying to move the needle\nTo give more power to popular sovereignty and less to Capitol less to the sovereignty of of concentrated wealth and money is going to not necessarily cause all the changes that I Am saying but it is necessary but what kind of movement give us an example\nYou can think of to sort of a tendencies one is the sort of rise above sort of reinvigorated left or whether you associate that with\nA democratic socialist America or other movements um that is a very important part of the conversation another would be very local organizations but with a sort of very grand division or this will be groups like cooperation Jackson, Mississippi who are really trying\nHum sustainable society from the ground up meaning look\nOh meaning that they are working you know both to set up a sort of\nUh we need folks to ah to pitch in for all of a these technological newfangled or a Oldman dependable methods to get you this programming\nAbsolutely it it it all goes your dollars we have receipts you know we have receipts for the big ... that was a really really really large uh uh item that was on our list but it was an important item like Sony says it's something you rely on everyday wanting you support that today six one five seven six zero twenty two or go on line you can make it easy WPN ... dot org\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of doubling you'll be all our Boston and from your NPR station\nFrom posters Smith printing posters on wrinkle resistant fold double fabric that transports flat for conference presentations posters Smith provides a service to research communities worldwide learn more at posters ... dot com\nAnd W.

Mm Mm\nMusic is refunding phrase music is good but the monitor for the album hit the top of the charge earlier this year we spoke with Bill for example about the album this spring he's appeared on more than two hundred albums more than forty as a bandleader so why go solar this time around [noise]\nBut that's been a challenge for me to play a loan from the first moment I picked up a guitar there's this social aspect with you know I've always been a shy person an awkward but\nWith that guitar it was like this magic wand that she should\nBring every one together and so all along but guitar has been about interacting with other people it's never been\nI Know there's you know there's just the tradition or whatever with especially with with the singer songwriter the loan troop adore when it first you know but it's something that sort of\nHanging out there in front of me that I Try to I'm just trying to get it together to do that you know like when I was in school I had to take a speech collect that like talk about a nightmare situation\nIf you get only of hadn't interact with you\nYeah yeah I mean to do the longest I've got that in my hands and everything is cool\nAnd so then why another solo album I mean what you're trying to kind of force yourself in here to get another level\nYeah I don't want to make it sound like that either it's because over the years it's become\nJust another aspect of what I Do I mean I the first time I tried to do a solo concert was it was in the early eighties I tried to play something alone and it was really just\nSo uncomfortable and it was a drag and I swore I'd never do it again but then I thought no I got to get this together so a year later I tried it again and then I and they kept getting\nBetter and after a certain point it was like wow I can actually do this and it started to feel like [noise] like music\n[noise] well it seems like every time to talk about I think for\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the sun like this what comes to note or [laughter] sounds backwards the inspiration\nFor the notes because you say it's it's a tribute to the musician the platelets in your life and you don't usually it's just a\nA melody just a very simple [noise] you know I'd\nSay not writing it but then\nOne thing that happened on this album there's this song that begins and ends because\nCalled pretty stars and then they just shine and that was something I quote unquote road\nThere's been times that book in the album ... and then made dish or anything when I wrote it I recognize that it was a very very common court when prior to the recording of this album I was\nPlaying at this club called the stone in New York and I was playing some of the music that I Would record and I played that song and a guy at the club one Ninety said oh I Love\nJessie J what what do you talk about I Know sometimes just to be played view this recording\nAnd it was like oh my God that's a saint ... almost exact same malady and then I checked it out and that\nWas like you know it's just an old traditional strong like I'd probably hurt the key to treat you play it when I was five years old or something something monsters and making them I like to be in trouble now but I think it's a you know it's like a public domain kind of\nThing and then there's so much music floating around I don't know where it comes from whether I'm writing it or am I remembering it or what is it\n\n\n\nOh\nI'd love it if you talk about track for which is what do you want to listen to\n\nWhat you're hearing right now is just one record that I played on the guitar that was\nCaptured frozen and sustained and then\nThe other processing so they're sort of a drone\nDown\nThat was originally from the guitar and then that's going to like a fire drop auto\nPedal that's all that shit [noise]\nAnd then I'm using that as the backdrop for\nJust the one I saw all over the tar sands\nNa\nNa\n\n\nNa\nYou know I was trying to stay in the state of not being sure what was going to happen you mean as you're playing or ... yeah well the composing is you know happy now these are\nPieces [noise] they've never feel like they're finished anyway but what I did to prepare for the album was actually played six night at the down in New York every night at brought in a pile of music and I tried to play things that I wasn't familiar with\nEither old compositions of mind or new ones\nAnd I tried to keep myself just off balance for the whole week\nAnd that's what I wanted to continue on into the studio I didn't want to have it all figured out like mapped out what was going to happen I didn't know what instrument I was going to play I didn't really do anything when I went in there\nYou know for companies you're thinking would in your younger days hide behind your instrument that takes a lot of confidence to now go in and not know where you're going to end up and put yourself in a stranger unusual or difficult uncomfortable place intentional\nBut that's when this really happened so I mean that's the thing about me\nJump off a cliff ... you\nJust start flying ... that's the best feeling with music for me is when you can take these chances but actually jumping off a cliff but like what's gonna happen if you play the wrong note if you know you get all the thrill but you don't get banged up too much\n[laughter] what a song would they'd like us to go out on here\nThere's that one Monica journey which I wrote for my daughter\nFirst time I recorded the song was\nWas just about a month after she was born it was my first trip being away from her\nThis

W a set of what people might say it's really sort of the opposite of what people might say the repeal in with one of the stations that actually started NPR um and to this day the NPR board is made up of member station so it's like\nThere is this whole structure of this foundation there's NPR with his Seventeen international bureaus\nBut it's all supported by stations and the stations are all supported by you our listeners and I just feel like there's that's a beautiful model\nIt really is and it is again it it sort of sounds big in Grand\nBut then you kind of break it down and it really does come back to listener supported community members who support the station you do that by calling six one five seven six zero twenty ten or by visiting W.

I'm ...\nI'm Peter O'Dowd this is here and now one person has been arrested today in South Florida in connection with suspicious packages sent this week to prominent Democrats\nCNN and people critical of President Trump we will be watching as that story develops throughout the day\nThis morning to more packages were intercepted want to dress to New Jersey senator Cory Booker\nThe other to James Clapper the former director of national intelligence and it brings the number of potential mail bombs to twelve and now just eleven days from the mid term elections many Americans are talking about the need to lower the temperature in national politics\nAnd joining us now there's a ... a month to narrow NPR's lead politics editor high demand co pay their so\nObviously we're going to be keeping close track of this story and learning more about who the suspect is who has been arrested what we know for sure though is just how devices these crimes have become in American politics and I wonder if you can tell us why\nWell I you know I mean polarization has been at an all time high for quite some time uh you know you look back at a couple of different arrows and American history maybe the Nineteen sixties and the civil war I come closest or worse than than today but there is not much in between\nUh and you know President Trump let's be Frank has been somebody who has created the sense that the press is the enemy of the people\nHe continues to say fake news at his rallies and a point the finger at the pen that we're all kept in at the rally is a behind the riser is I was at a rally in Houston people were very nice to me going in\nA happy to take my questions a lovely people to chat with and talk to by the end in through the middle of a ... of just anti\nWhat comes to be seen and President Trump has been somebody who has been a take no prisoners you know I'm kind of politician for anybody who disagrees with that\nBut to medical the president's started this week by calling for unity and then he's come to this place of that you're describing now and I want to hear from a White House press secretary Sarah Sanders who was speaking on Thursday\nPulitzer Prize or that I could not have been more presidential yesterday when he spoke directly to the American people condemn this violence let's not get lost in who is responsible for this heinous act\nIt is the person who made and set the suspicious packages let's not forget that that is ultimately the person that is responsible and will be held responsible by this administration now clearly\nThe president thinks he's being unfairly linked to the person who did this but why hasn't he been able to stick to that message of unity that he started this with\nI mean it's pretty typical pattern of President Trump's I mean this is somebody who anytime he has criticized or becomes the sort of a focus of criticism\nThat doesn't mean that we're going to be going away at least for a few minutes we're not sure how long from our

prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump let's bring in Carrie Johnson NPR justice correspondent Carrie\nOr tell us about this man who is in custody now in Florida\nNPR's identifying him as Caesar say he's fifty six years old from South Miami as you said and his background includes a long wrap sheet a number of charges for related to drugs and fast and also they charge in two thousand two\nFor a threatening to throw place project or discharge and explosive device he also has a bankruptcy in his past and we also know he's a registered Republican\nYou said that he has a disparate long criminal record and the police were aware of him would do we know what led them to him at this point in this investigation\nAnd we are going to wait to hear from the Justice Department the FBI the postal inspectors and others about what exactly are led authorities to this man's so quickly this is a remarkably swift investigation is President Trump has already said this morning\nWe do know that a number of devices were not exploded so they were in ... in essence a mother load of evidence for the FBI lab in Quantico the FBI lab has been looking at whether there was any DNA are fingerprints on those devices we don't yet know whether this aspect may have left those traces which led authorities to him so quickly\nCan you talk about the fact that these bombs did not explode a was one of the big question leading up to this arrest was it on purpose that the suspect with ... you know just a bad bomb maker or was it um you know something else I'm sure that something investigators will be tracking\nA ... a authorities are likely to shed a little more light on that at the news conference I suspect but it's important to note that um as of yesterday the NYPD and federal authorities were advising anyone who came across such a suspicious package one of those manila envelopes\nTo treat it as if it were dangerous and to not touch it and not handle it call histories and at the local level are called the FBI so it's not yet clear to me whether\nThis person or if he is in fact the uh the bomber or wanting to hurt somebody and just didn't know how or whether there was some other uh issue at play in his making\nThese devices are once again we're talking to NPR's Carrie Johnson and waiting for federal officials at the department of justice to\nGive a news conference on the latest on the investigation into the male bombings and it's happening at the bottom of the hour carry a the a ... do they expect that they're going to be making anymore do they have any idea of the men they arrested today was acting as as a lone wolf\nAttorney general Jeff Sessions yesterday said that he is I'm expecting to bring to justice any and all people involved in it right now we know that Cesar ... the only person in federal custody I think it's the ... are going to be looking for a while yet to see if he had any help\nAny assistance whatsoever we don't yet know the answer to that question what\nAbout the white van we saw pictures of it on the TV all morning long do we know that it belongs to the suspects because of course there were images of\nThe president there were also you know stickers bashing CNN visible in the window I mean it's very early in his investigation but do we know anything about why investigators ah came and got to that than\nWe do know that these are sad was taken into custody in or near an auto zone business and that shortly thereafter people with ...\nWe're seeing securing this white man and transporting it up possibly to evaluate it for ... century purposes or other purposes authorities have not on the record yet connected that van ...\nIs there any notion at this point as to whether or not he was considered armed or dangerous at the time or any uh arms apprehended\nOut we don't yet know the answer to that\nQuestion we do know that there was a massive manhunt underway for this individual that involve federal and local authorities across multiple states and we do know he is in custody now we have no reports of any law enforcement officers injured or hurt in any way in connection with that apprehension\nOkay Carrie Johnson NPR justice correspondent stay put if you will were awaiting this press conference from the Justice Department are but for now let's turn to the political side of this of course it's a major part of this story a Republican strategist Allison Stewart is with us now Alice welcome to you\nThank you Peter great to be here and we also have democratic strategist and host at hill TV Jamal Simmons\nA speaker or ... or ALS want to start with you know have a suspect in custody ... what are your thoughts going into this it has been a very politically fraught past couple of days\nIt has been and it's been a very tense time and of course we can all say our our greatest gratitude and thanks to\nThe FBI and law enforcement and those who put their their lives on the line to to make this apprehensions so swift and I bring bring about a a sense of calm and and of course look we're in a very politically charged climate and it's a very uh an intense time in in our politics I\nI think if we're looking at this through the political lens ... we have to\nGive some credit to the president this afternoon who who did say that this is a time for Americans to unify\nAnd while we don't know the cause of this or the motive of of this is a this is a time to bring the nation together and the president was was wise to say that anyone involved in this will be brought to justice in the face the full extent of the law\nAnd to rightly claimed and called this despicable a despicable act\nOf political violence and it's time to have peace in the United states\nYou know I'm Sorry I interrupted you do want to bring you into this conversation do you think the president can do that can unify the country right now\nI really want him to a really want him to try um I had been support it so far but every time he is spoken out on the she'd give words that are about something a little like so\nAnd then ... minutes or hours later he does or says or something that is to blame on the victims let the media\nOr you know tries to lessen this layer make light of it in some way and I think\nThe president is job right now and not with all his job is to bring people together I Would love to see the president\nUm do something where maybe called President Obama may be called President Clinton and awkward has is health and made sure that the FBI\nAll the other sources of disposal protected it you know image toward the attorney general Jeff Sessions called ... older to make sure he was going to be okay but this is a moment we're supposed to reach out and not just with words but\nAlso with actions with\nThe president has has not apparently reached out to any of those who do home the the the male bombings their bombs were addressed\nUm but I Wonder if you could tell us about the suspect we don't know a lot about him but if you were to believe the pro Trump ... stickers on the windows of his than he is apparently a Trump supporter so how would you\nLeaders of the party to address\nIt more than anything it's important that we not jump to conclusions and not speculate prematurely what his motives were but as you say looking at that van with a lot of the the photographs you saw\nAnd there was also that sticker on there with mention of CNN and it was not in a favorable term\nAnd I am a contributor CNN I met that building where this happened the other day or at least once a week and it it's frightening but I think from a Republican standpoint we need to send the message\nThat a while we can disagree politically we need to do so in a non violent way and we need to do so in a calm way and\nUh the best way to show if you're disappointed with the way things are in this country is to go vote and let your emotions be heard at the ballot box and I think it needs to be consistent and I will say\nThat in my view the call to end the race to the bottom starts at the top and it needs to be a farm in a consistent message and as your most said it needs to not be Justin word but also in action we're we're in and you're saying starting at the top meeting with the president a drawl absolutely how do you think Democrats you deal with it\n[noise] well I think Democrats will be the same way that is no time to play all the things I wa disagree with the rhetoric that the president has been using for the last year and a half a couple of years regardless of the media lock her up and all the chance all the things that we are only call to the mall I disagree with those\nI'm willing to say maybe he didn't know maybe he didn't understand the impact of those words maybe even if you did you never thought anybody would take\nWeb streaming is made possible by Lipscomb universities online degree offerings designed for ambitious

Lipscomb dot edu slash on line\nOr of actually creating a law that accurate divide is going to explode a this is obviously a ways to terrorize people are just sort of get back\nAt the other side is there is some sort of political motive which of course we don't know exactly the details yet so I I think that's that's um probably the the big I'm a motivation there\nOkay I was with us if you can NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson let's bring you back in uh we are awaiting this press conference from the Justice Department just remind us who is uh that we expect to hear from it and what are some of the unanswered questions that we're still waiting for\nYeah this is quite a line up we're waiting to hear from including the attorney general of the United states Jeff Sessions the FBI Director Chris Wray the U.S attorney in Manhattan Geoffrey Berman and not important because that's where we think\nThis individual ultimately will be prosecuted where he will face justice several of those devices were recovered in New York and we know the FBI is New York field office has been particularly active we have a\nWe have an official from the FBI is New York field office William Sweeney we also have the NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill\nAh we have the postal inspectors we have the secret service and somebody from the Capitol police as well so this is a murderers row of law enforcement it's very rare you see that many of these top officials on the stage in fact I have a question whether all these men are actually going to fit on that time the age of the Justice Department\nAnswer unanswered questions did he have any help did he have any help and are there other devices out there\nAs we speak I've gotten an email confirming that Tom's dire a prolific democratic donor has confirmed that he was addressed to package and there may be other such devices out there we've got to find that out a law enforcement desperately is going to be hunting for those things because\nThey fear they're dangerous even if they don't go offer detonate um they do contain material that could be problematic and law enforcement wants to wrap their arms around all those devices out there they also want to find out whether this man had any help\nAnd what he was planning next if anything ask for motives it's not clear right now there is a a social media account that's been linked to the suspect fifty six year old she's there say are from South Florida\nIn that Twitter account he has gone off after a prominent Democrats including some of whom have who have been an address the use of e suspicious packages and that's one hand test to his motive but of course law enforcement is going to be digging ever deeper for more evidence and more information\nThat's NPR's Carrie Johnson I'm ... and just to to reset for the audience who are we stand our thirties arrested the south Florida Man this morning in connection with a wave of suspicious packages addressed this week to political critics of President Trump law enforcement has confirmed that that man is Cesar ... fifty six years old as an address in Davey Florida\nAnd has a criminal record also has some ties to New York\nUh the arrest followed the discovery of three more suspicious packages and Carrie Johnson you just mentioned the Democratic fundraiser Tom Sawyer has said that he was the recipient of or at least the intended recipient of one of those packages did he issued a statement as well did he say anything about the package or how he found out that he was targeted\nYeah through a spokesman he said I'm it's confirmed that a suspicious package mail to Tom Sawyer was intercepted had a male facility in California he says\nWe're thankful every one we work with is safe and sound that's our first priority but he says were seen as systematic attack on our democracy and the rule of law\nOne isolated incident in Florida\nAnd he's talking about the need for people to come together and rebuild\nA democracy for each one African American I'm trying to find some unity ah during this very dark period where many prominent Democrats had been at that um recipients are intended recipient of these suspicious devices that was the last few days\nRight I'm just thinking that if you are a prominent critic of the president and you have not yet been targeted but perhaps you could be because of positions\nThat you've taken and again we don't know fully know the motivation but this so far though the people who've gotten these packages had been critics of the president I'm Kerry have you have you been hearing from people who who are concerned that they could be next door that they're taking precautions in case they are\n[noise] I have been hearing from people former officials in the federal government and the Obama administration\nWho are trying to be more mindful of how they handle mail where they open mail and I'm being basically on the lookout for one of these suspicious looking on yellow mental envelopes with patenting that we've seen on the news for the last two days\nOf course on some of the targets a were intended recipient of these devices are really well known the attorney former attorney general Eric Holder\nThe former CIA director John Brennan\nThis morning in New York another package was intercepted intended for the former director of national intelligence Jim Clapper and another one this morning in Florida intended for New Jersey democratic senator Cory Booker the list just kept growing and growing and it's not clear to me that were done yet without\nHave all those packages for all those people that you just mentioned where they all exactly the same so that you would continue to know what to look for a ... in in the mail string\nAh for the vast majority of those packages the FBI or local police are both have confirmed that these were similar looking packages\nYou know the images that you have seen\nNPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson I Wonder if we can bring back in the loop William Hunter former FBI special agent to teachers in the criminal Justice Department in Radford University in Virginia a loo continue their yeah I'm here yes\nSo you've seen on TV a lot of CNN had described as as Kerry just did what the packages of looked like\nIt at what point if there are packages that are are more and more packages to come at what point um can you identify those is coming from either this suspect or somebody connected with the suspect or maybe somebody who's a a copycat as often happens in cases like these\nYeah yeah it's it's extremely difficult I mean you know it's obviously a easy to get\nSome of these materials that that it's a lot of materials or other town and so it's really going to take a a a close look by law enforcement to confirm whether or not it is I'm the same suspect or a copycat 'em so you know we're talking about um review of ... the FBI\nA lab all back in the field office looking at the actual forensics a so it's not going to be an easy call a quick\nCall until it's actually you've had a a thorough look at these things\nAt what point will you feel that the threat is over\nThere the threat is over yeah\nThat's that's a great question I mean I I think as a as a couple of games so ... got a a a charity stores you show 'em if he's willing to talk and that's a that's a big gift um\nYou know you can have a sense of of house for ... ... you know what his lowly age what else is out there the other thing is just physical evidence and the electronic evidence\nIs you get in and with a search warrant and you're able to take a look at is I'm a computer histone records that late give you a really good\nJust a ton of evidence at his house or this caller business and that's going to give you an idea of how extensive the threats are so I Would say within the next\nYou know twenty four hours you're going to have search orange ... you're going to have a ... Asian or they should have a good idea of how solid this has gone with this particular suspect but then there's a whole question of\nAgain isn't working with someone else a tracking down and he gets elites or other associates that made a healthy\nThat's ... special agent Luke William hunt a NPR's Carrie Johnson it looks like it'd be like very soon\nTo the Justice Department for this press conference about the arrest that happened today just very quickly we know that there was a a white van with all sorts of political details apparently pro Trump ... cents details on the side of it do we know for sure if this vehicle is directly tied to the stuff that he was arrested\nHere's what we do know law enforcement is proceeding on the idea that it is somehow connected to this aspect that they have not said it is his definitively on the record I expect we're going to hear a lot more about that in the next two minutes or so when it's a news conference start as law enforcement decides to tell us\nWhat if anything this individual is charged with and how they know that\nAnd does he says the individual you're talking about a fifty six years old of daily Florida where he is he right\nNow he is in federal custody I he was taken into custody in South Florida and the likelihood is that he as authorities are trying to find out more from him about whether he had any help whether they're additional packages out there and and any number of other questions they want to know to protect public safety we\nHave gotten a warning that this press conference with attorney general Jeff Sessions is going to be getting started within the next few seconds to say thank you dilute William hunt former FBI special agent thanks very much for your insights pleasure good to be here and Republican strategist Alice Stewart's hum we uh we want to thank you to please hang tight\nBecause we do expect to hear from attorney general Jeff Sessions in just a moment\nFor [noise]", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "26"}
