Jimmy Kimmel and\nAh Trevor Noah that uh it doesn't really feel like Murphy Brown is saying anything new um when when the show was originally doing this kind of commentary a gift\nWe're talking this way and there weren't a lot of sitcoms that were caught talking very directly about things that were happening in the world now all of that has changed and I think a swift Murphy Brown feeling a little out of step with the times\nWell what about the idea also that this is yet another TV network show that is going for the ... factor and bring back something that was there before\nYeah um I mean in in a way this could feel like a like a step too far uh some some of the other ... boots I'm from the way the viewers responded to them you had a sense that there was sort of a open up demand amongst fans when Roseanne came back\nWhatever you think of stars and bars politics um there's the audience responded by paying attention to the show and you had a sense that\nUh fans had kind of missed it and and with will and grace on NBC that revival the same thing now CBS is a little difference CBS has done a lot of revivals of shows\nThat are sort of thinly veiled a revival is you know they have a magnum PI they have swat they have mcgyver and all of these are just kind of an excuse to take really predictable and run of the mill a procedural adventure stories and and and slapped the veneer of the show a over it so\nI'm a you know those have been under the radar in a way to get decent ratings but they're not the kind of phenomenon that will and grace\nAnd um and and Roseanne where I think CBS was trying to do that kind of phenomenon with Murphy Brown but the show had minutes syndication for a long time so ah you know I don't think a lot of younger people leave a familiar with the show and because the the the ... version of it\nI'm Still a little awkward and kind of old school I I think it's going to have a hard time finding new fans\nThat beer TV critic Eric Deggans thank you thank you\nAnd again to our top story today the Senate advancing Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination to a final vote tomorrow\nBut the allegations of drinking and sexual misconduct lobbed at Kavanaugh has prompted soul searching at the kinds of elite prep school he attended ... decades ago colleges have been taking a hard look at\nHow they may have committed a culture of drinking and sexual misconduct most has changed significantly since back then but as NPR's Tovia Smith reports some say there's still a ways to go\nTo many alumni of elite prep schools the picture Christine Blasey Ford painted up the drunken debauchery she encountered as a student is painfully familiar\nI was deeply shaken and I just posted as anybody else having these really bad memories come up\nAlexandra less God's graduated from the national cathedral school in Nineteen eighty eight with many memories she wishes she could forget\nThere was a drunk girl in a room um and there was a boy in there with her and there were other boys lined up outside the door and my friend recalls hearing I'm next time next\nIt was such a toxic culture of power and privilege she says many guys didn't even try to hide it and schools knew how bad it was in Nineteen Ninety the Washington Post reported that seven of them including Georgetown Prep work Kavanaugh went\nCentered joint warning to parents about the excessive drinking and sex ed unsupervised parties\nThey called it a recipe for disaster\nGeorgetown ... current president declined to comment but in a recent letter to parents see bad to reevaluate school culture and to quote work with the guys on respect for women John Paul free is headed school at Philips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts\nThis has been a call to every educator I think and I think any school that isn't some gauge to him soul searching those making a mistake schools\nAlready changed dramatically since the eighties Paul for he says drift\nLarge stand by a student body that's no longer so exclusively the privileged and powerful and he says students are now schools on what he calls a culture of consent and respect\nIt is changing but it's still a problem on campuses and I certainly can't say that we are out of the woods yet\nThen did just three years ago saying all been school in D.C had to ... college yearbooks after discovering seniors at the elite all boys school had included crude and success slurs\nAnd diversify trust and independent wealth management firm offering an integrated approach to the investment trusts estates and philanthropic needs of individuals' multigenerational families institutions\nAnd retirement plans learn more diversified trust dot com [noise]\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

that's according to the Labor Department which also\nHundred and thirty four thousand jobs last month Michael Reagan a senior editor at Bloomberg News he joins us now and Mike Hi Germany will start with a number of jobs added a hundred and thirty four thousand that was actually below expectations but continues a long long long streak of job growth tell us more about what we learned in the report today\nWell right as you mentioned it was below estimates are the economists in ah the Bloomberg survey had forecast about a hundred and eighty five thousand jobs so this is about fifty thousand below that but it's a very tough month\nTo get right because of Hurricane Florence um you know a lot of companies\nThat might have been planning to hire would postpone it and a lot of companies were just you know more or less laying people off temporarily because of the weather so they're actually about three hundred thousand people a away from work to do the bad weather\nSo it's you know most economists are kind of looking past that disappointment in the number of jobs added due to the weather um and it just assuming that the same trends we've seen of of pretty healthy job growth a is still intact\nAnd what about that unemployment rate the lowest level since Nineteen sixty nine\n[noise] absolutely and uh you know a Larry Kudlow today saying he he wouldn't be surprised to see it go even further I mean it just goes to a show as you said this economic recovery is still ongoing um since two thousand and ten a the the nation is out of jobs every single month Ninety six months straight\nUm and it just does not show any signs of slowing down at the moment\nWhen we were just talking this week about the fact that companies are having a hard time finding seasonal workers for the holidays because the unemployment rate is so low people are able to get\nJobs I this is totally anecdotal but I was at a coffee shop this morning huge line not nearly enough people are are ... are we at the point now where the issue is that companies just can't find enough people that want the jobs\nI you know to to give you an addict out of my own I just noticed that a lot of my friends nannies are are quitting because the employment prospects for them or are good so what does it all sort of adds up to this notion that the employment market is very strong now\nA ... it's still not doing what a lot of people were afraid it would do is which is overheat the economy and cause wages to accelerate aggressively hum that's not quite the case yet um but it's it by all accounts are very very strong job market\nWhat did we learn today about wages\nSo they continued to increase the year every year a gain in average hourly hourly earnings was about two point eight percent\nI'm so nice gain but again not so strong that it makes you worry about in overheating of the economy that would start to\nA turn things the other way cause corporate profit margins to to shrink and that sort of thing it's still sort of steady as she goes uh considering the trends we saw a first for many years now uh back back through the uh beginning of the recovery from the recession\nWas going to be interesting to see how the Federal Reserve takes this news and we're already up to a to into court two to two and a quarter percent interest rate on the federal funds rate will see Mike rigging of Bloomberg News thank you thanks German\nPresident Trump is counting those new jobs numbers on Twitter and they're starting to Connie also came up in his rally yesterday in Rochester, Minnesota where he threw his late into one of the most highly contested congressional races in the country for an open seat in Minnesota is first\nIs supposed to be a democratic state I\n\nDon't think they have a very big surprise I don't\nThink that that's why the Republicans in ...\nThe in both are vying to fill a seat left open by democratic representative Tim Walz who's running for governor so that district is where we turn for this week's district profile cast and Richard is senior reporter for Minnesota Public radio she joined us from Rochester and cats are in uh Minnesota went for Hillary Clinton and twenty sixteen\nBut the first district went for President Trump so tell us more about the district itself\nWell it's kind of a funny district if you look at it in the long picture um it's been traditionally conservative and Republican it's very rural so there's a lot of you know smaller agricultural communities and the district outside of Rochester remain Kato which are sort of the city hubs\nThat being said during the Obama administration Tim Walz won his reelection pretty handily up until twenty sixteen when he was almost defeated by Republican Jim Hackett darn and of course the district went handily for president Donald Trump at the time\nRight well so let's take a look at the two candidates the Democrat Dan Feehan worked in the Obama administration he's an Iraq War vet a member of the Democratic farmer labor party which is aligned with Democrats and in this reason as he built himself as an independent voice\nEvery hour you can put any differences aside and come together accomplishment fruits and that's exactly what the farmers today\nI'm not taking over that means nothing reader corporation\nCatherine Richard tell us more about seeing [noise]\nWell I think the first thing that people should know is that he's a political newcomer you know he's never served in public office before um he hasn't lived in Minnesota since he was a teenager actually and his opponents are frequently point that out so he's moved back to the district around\nUm I think what you're hearing there is his willingness to work across the aisle which is really important in this district which you know in the best case for Democrats as a moderate just starting to go so you hear him running a pretty moderate campaign and it's really an echo two of the types of campaigns that Tim Walz ran here\nWill not at the Republican Jim ... and his reason add he talks about growing up on a farm in Minnesota doing a lot of reading which of course he brings to his thoughts on Washington\nWashington wins or government are so certain rather than a Trump Jim points\nTo ourselves in the system rip out the regulations Obamacare and ...\nSo Catherine we hear him aligning himself with President Trump what's this on on that\nWell he has been aligning himself with Trump's views before Trump was really even on the scene remember he's run for three times for the seat so he has been running on a very similar platform for far longer than Trump has been you know campaigning\nUm and I think that plays well with certain aspects of the district and ... is playing very well this time because of the fact that the district favor Donald Trump in the last election\nI think that things to know about how good are that are interesting or that his dad actually held the seat and so he moved to Washington DC when he was a teenager\nAnd lived there for a long time and actually worked there for a long time so just like his opponent Dan fan he has lived outside of the district for quite awhile worked in various administrations worked on Capitol Hill and has more recently come back to the districts to run again these last three times\nSo those are the two candidates cats or I'm going to ask you about another thing that President Trump said last night that jumped out he really dissed for Minnesota Senator Al Franken for in the president's ah words kind of quitting after Franken was accused of inappropriate behavior\nBe that many felt was kind of minor compared to some of the the accusations we've\nBeen hearing about in the me too movement but Franken pulled himself out of politics and the president seemed to be saying he was kind of a a coward for that\nYeah it was it was an interesting point that he made and I'm Still sort of sorting through what he was getting out because I'm One\nOf a wet rag he he took responsibility for what he was doing and he\nLeft office of course under great pressure from his own party let's not forget that and this is being set against the backdrop of what's happening in Washington did today which is this you know big discussion about whether judge Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court and whether he is taking responsibility for his actions\nBut of course keep in mind that when Frank and laughed we you know the governor here appointed a Democrat to take its place who's now running for reelection and it's effectively opened up a potential seat for Republicans\nSo on one hand he's criticizing it seemed Franken for leaving so quickly but on the other hand it's presented in opportunity for his party most fascinating but how is the whole cabinet debate\nImpacting of it is this race or is it just falling along party lines [noise]\nYou know I think generally it's falling along party lines when I spoke to people who are waiting to get into the rally yesterday this is something I asked them about all of them said you know we want him to talk about judge Kavanaugh we support judge Kavanaugh\n\nThis is Ninety point three WPN National Public radio Ninety One point five WTO ...

thank you thank you\nWell as we continue to follow everything with Brett Kavanaugh at the U.S Capitol today a number of Senate races are in the balance with four weeks or so to go until election day let's get to our Senate tracker series\nThis week we're looking at the race in Nevada where Republican senator Dean Heller is facing a challenge from democratic congresswoman Jacky Rosen and joining us now from Las Vegas is Joe Shannon hosting senior producer at Nevada public radio Joe\nHi how ya doing doing well and let's start with the Democratic challenger Jacky Rosen a relative newcomer to politics compared to hell her she was president of her synagogue before Democrats are back in twenty sixteen tapped her to run for Congress where she is serving her first term what else do we know about her\nOh just a quick uh bio she's sixty one she's the mother of a college aged daughter her husband's a radiologist she lives in Henderson which is a city adjacent to Vegas and she moved here from the Midwest after her parents moved here this was back in college\nShe was a waitress at Caesar's Palace she had a degree from a community college became a computer programmer and then she got on to the national scene really by surprise\nWhen former Senate majority leader Harry Reid asked her to run for the house which she won and twenty sixteen beating Danny Tarkanian in a really close race\nAnd we remember that Harry Reid represented the state of Nevada let's listen to one of the ads from Jacky Rosen that's airing on TV just kind of going on the offensive here it opens up with a shot of one of those inflatable Gombe type things you see outside a car dealership blowing in the wind or and then she equate that to Dean Heller\nThey call them senators mindless because Dean Heller beds with the political wins first promising to vote against the plan to repeal Obamacare because it would hurt in Nevada Dean Heller from Nevada ain't no\nYou're right now actually supported the piece of legislation to ensure that we should ... America's goes but then\nDean Heller got pressure from his party leaders\nFrom President Trump loud and clear this was the one we were worried about you weren't there but you're going to be held her work\nIs promise and voted for repeal deciding to stir how\nHow big of an issue is that flip by Dean Heller\nIt's a pretty big issue in those ads have seemed to be making I'm quite a mark here you know this was the vote about a year ago maybe a little bit more\nHeller initially at the start of the summer said no he was for keeping Obamacare or the Affordable CARE Act\nAnd then he changed his tune and it was such a huge change that Nevada house representative mark ... who is also a Republican was quoted as saying hey it's pretty clear you change your mind you probably ought to tell people why\nOr just for the record neither ... nor his campaign has ever agreed to come on our program to talk about that or any other issue\n[noise] what about Dean Heller um here's one of his ads\nI don't have time for politicians talk but don't deliver stop\nMe what you're going to see you and just doing\nDean Heller and get things done forty pieces of legislation\nPart is a vast amount of money on\nHow to live and kept that predicted the sexual assault Dean Heller is our voice\nPower boy I'm\nInteresting to note that all the people speaking in that ad are women\nYeah that really really stand out look I I don't trust poles but by the latest CNN poll of less than a week ago he's losing big with women women preferred Jacky Rosen by fourteen points over Heller fifty two to thirty eight percent that's a huge drop from the summer when ... was at about fifty percent with women\n[noise] what else do we know about ... other than the fact that he's sort of straddling between supporting his party and you know voting against his party occasionally\n[noise] yeah no that's really the kind of become a central issue although he ... until this race he was a modest not quite a centrist but just sort of you know he would always vote unreliable issues against Yucca Mountain for instance um\nThis is the nuclear waste site in Nevada\nYeah about Ninety miles north of here there's a mountain where they want to store the nuclear waste or for the country or the health care issue he seemed reliably sort of in the middle it's\nSort of when I'm Sheldon Adelson the billionaire a got involved she's been called a peacemaker by the New York times he he called ... and and said you know uh don't opposed Trump on this um that's what the hell are seem to change his vote and um the Adelson in turn have given to his campaign war chest\nIs adults in a huge player still in Nevada politics huge huge\nPlayer he's worth tens of billions of dollars maybe the most maybe the richest men in the world um oh yeah he's front and center you need\nHim on your side in order to hold office there\n[noise] you know this will be the ... election to see if that is just is case\nUh any sense of how the cabinet or a nomination fight is playing with voters in Nevada\nWhen Heller said that sexual assault allegation against Brett Kavanaugh was a hiccup it did explode across the social media landscape here um\nAnd and of course that CNN poll I just talked about showed a huge drop with women supporters for Heller but I haven't seen a poll asking a direct question of how women feel about Heller in the aftermath of the Capitol hearing what\nWould you say is the biggest issue for voters in Nevada this November", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "05"}
