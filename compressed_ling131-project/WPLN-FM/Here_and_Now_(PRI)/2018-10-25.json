Waltzer rooms\nWell so first of all clarify for us because driving around this is driven home we're in the panhandle people might be picturing you know Miami Beach and thinking these are second homes are beach homes not\nRight this is a part of Florida where we have a lot more\nRural people a lot more low income people and so these these are even people who maybe don't have any insurance on their homes they are homes that have been handed down for generations and so since they have no mortgage and they really don't have room in their budget for insurance they don't have that insurance which will make this recovery even more difficult they don't have\nThat way chipped to begin rebuilding their homes\nWill and rebuilding was what because with so many things down a incomes have been cut another big challenge is joblessness that's looming 'em and you heard from Nikki Gilmore a Walmart manager in Mariana who said people are showing up for work even though they have really trying circumstances let's hear\nWe're getting some permanent called one that gives them is the ... floor we've got here they don't have anything\nAnd so I've got like driving a system as we call him Dr seuss loss is allowed\nAfter three days he's in here without through the small immigration you're describing like he's just ready has a job that he can recover from and a lot of shows you that there's more calls\nWhen he says we got air he means is he conditioning air conditioned right how are people getting by they have no income I think that it's\nTough I'm hearing from people who who are very concerned about eight Gilmore had opened his door and it wasn't open to the public but he was allowing his employees to come in and just help with the cleanup process or that they could get a paycheck many of these people are living paycheck to paycheck there is some unemployment like specifically storm related unemployment assistance available\nOr as a fisherman who maybe don't have a good way of tracking what their income has been and so they don't have a good way of applying for that assistance yeah\nBut running water mostly back in some places it's not drinkable communications as we have discovered are still pretty spotty um it's just really ...

potentially maybe Fifteen thousand years ago some of the earliest occupation\nNot only in Florida but in the new world wow we're kind of just getting to the the good stuff as we get through the earliest policy material and get into the end of the ice age the end of the terminal place the same material\nWill be looking at things in the twelve to fourteen and it's like I said as much as Fifteen thousand year old rage\n[noise]\nBuckets are lined up shovels gently push to cross the tips floors scraping away thousands of years with every layer careful exacting work you never know what you might have been finding stone tools just somebody knocks a big flake off it was really sharp on when it so they took a little on what a piece\nOf amber or another hammer stone perhaps interest sharpened it up a little bit more a drill the tip of broken off of that and we're probably guessing again in the five six thousand year old range part of today's excitement has been that we had a little lens of charcoal and as we\nDug it out this morning it started to have some structure to it Tom said perhaps corn cob a corn cob shouldn't be in nine thousand year old ... here but it's conceivable\nSo so that'll be the that'll be the excite me this afternoon as removing this little pedestal that's got quite a bit of charcoal and\n[noise]\nThe scraped material is dumped into the buckets and poured out over what looks like a screen door laying on its side on legs now move over here to a a a screen everybody knows that this looks like it's framed and you're brushing that stand truly looking\nFor a fun flakes of little pieces of stone that the there were when they were making a projectile point\nWhen you put it right and it's up [noise] these are tiny tiny they're taking\nIn I'm a ... and sharpening on arrowhead for a project to a point and make these little tiny flakes\nOkay you sound went down there a larger ... larger when it's a half a quarter of an inch long yeah and it's big yeah that's a ...\nI didn't know that's what they were doing with it\nThere is there is a may have for the call these primitive arts festivals where people are making arrowhead today and this is a Denver ties that is what's on the floor after they get through making a same during a point that this was probably ten thousand years old [noise]\nI just touch something ten thousand you know right this is cool\nBut not me it wasn't my head that Dr heading to just wipe out a few hundred years of history with one there's so many ways to mess up [laughter] [noise] [laughter]\nIt's funny but the reason he slipped may not be artifacts are most beneficial to archaeologist they reveal their story best when they're found where they were left and\nStorms like recent hurricane Michael can disturbed that\nIf you stand in a place long enough you can feel the San ... a little bit and it's because you know it's no into problems and agitation\nYou think that's the rain as you are you shake your fist at the elements that are just now\nIt importantly [laughter] um\nBut these things are thousands of years old so they've been shifted\nSure if they are in place and not currently excavated and that's really why we were so very concerned is that we have an open excavation pit almost\nNot seeing the light of day for the better reporting on those years we've we've made it vulnerable and so we covered those were tarps stand by the whole thing and we we are awful awful lot\n[noise] and so they continue the work that was started by an angel devoted his life to saving the history beneath Florida soil and found this site when a sewer pipes was laid\nThe original work was done by the state archaeologists Kelvin Jones just along the sidewalk outside the large in Nineteen Ninety four and that's when some of the most important earliest ones were made\nCalvin Jones isn't he the one who got a wheelbarrow of low delivered to his home and\nHe's the one who realize that there was some ancient tool in that who said wait a second yeah he yeah the Jackson has and he's the one who said wait a second this dirt is more than dirt as part of this ancient burial site you know\nThey had a delivery of Sirte and within the ... there were artist\nThat [noise] that is archaeologist Barbara clause of the Florida public archaeology network\nAnd we've traveled to the place where Calvin Jones got his loan and realized it held treasures it's now the lake Jackson Mountains archeology state park in Tallahassee some beautiful carpet of lung leading to grass covered hills fries like the facts of green elephants one bigger than the others [noise]\nOkay we walked across that vast lawn and there it is I mean uh how how high near would you say this ...\nThis is the tallest up to seven mountains it is thirty six feet tall these mountains were built basket by basket load of dirt\nAnd let's just backup what exactly is the mound this\nSite is actually part of what's called the southeastern ceremonial complex which is the south eastern regions version of the Mississippi in culture known by many as the mount builders\nOver time they would build these mountains and their leader would live on top of the mountain and hot when that person past they would then be hurt or buried in the mountains and their home would be burns and then they would cap it off with more soil\nAnd then the next leader with live on top of it so over time it became taller and taller and you can actually see those different layers of soil if you were to kind of cut this mound and half you would see evidence of that you'd see the charcoal from the burn holes you'd see the burials in the mountains\nSplit us climbed the mountain and didn't feel kind of [noise] I don't know you're walking on someone's funeral pie or is that\nIt's a place that you you have to respect um people lived and died here just as we live and die today to definitely a very respectful kind of foreboding place\nI feel that but we are going to climb the stairs to the top of it as a as a leader would've done hundreds of years ago so here we go [noise]\n\nAre there native peoples who are direct descendants of the people who lived here the\nDescendants of the people who live here where the Appalachia Indians that were here during the time of the Spaniards arrival there are still living descendents today most of them live in Louisiana\nAnd come over for educational events and things like that\nSo we are not climbing the the wouldn't stairs up\nThe mound um which is covered with wildflowers it's actually quite pretty I Know there's concern about how these ancient sites might have been impacted by what was the third largest hurricane you know in the country's history but I'm thinking since the year one thousand a de\nThese mountains and we're right on top now these mounts have whether whether it a lot\nYeah I think the biggest danger to the mountains would be trees falling over because they take their root ball with them and with that of course they take part of the ...\nWhere rainwater can wash away parts of the mountains\nHere we are we're at the top of this man we have all this growth so the leader of a community we get higher and higher and higher above the people I'm looking now on the big long where they'd all be living\nThis was strategically placed over here to our east we have Lake Jackson I always tell people you're looking for archaeological sites you look for your basic needs food water and shelter there are other states similar to this throughout the south east all the way up through the Mississippi Valley up into Ohio even when they were excavating here at like checked and\nThey were finding copper brass plates or ... ... we don't
