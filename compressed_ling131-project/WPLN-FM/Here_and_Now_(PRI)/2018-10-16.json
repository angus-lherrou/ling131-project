throwing shade at President Trump in fact that's the title of his book shade a tale of two presidents Pete Souza joins us now to talk about a welcome back to hear now\nThanks for having me on Germany and when you left the White House or did you have any idea that you would become more part of the public conversation\nNot at all it's it's just something that at it as the days and weeks and months went by and twenty Seventeen\nIt became apparent that I had a voice where uh I and I needed to use it in a way just to demonstrate what is happening is not normal and I thought I was able to do that on Instagram using my photographs and commentary\nAnd how did it start\nIt started somewhat accidental I had seen a picture of the new Oval Office on January twenty first there twenty second and it was ... you know golden ornate and I thought it looked like a Saudi palace more than\nThe oval office so I posted a picture of a President Obama with the the red curtains behind him and I wrote a caption that just said something like\nKind of like the old curtains better [laughter]\nAnd I guess it was a double meaning and my mind but I didn't know how people would react whether they would get it and in that very first post\nSomeone a said that I was throwing shade on new a new president you didn't even know what that term it I didn't even know what that term that after you know I started oppose the war and then I heard that the term shade again and I and I figured I better look it up\nYou also posted when when President Trump made a lot of news talking about how his inauguration crowd was the biggest in history and a lot of people showed photographs to prove that that was not the case you posted on January twenty first twenty Seventeen the biggest crowd in history was really on January twenty two thousand nine\nHuge in all caps with a picture of the national mall with a lot of people\nI mean I kind of picture says it All right right\nIn that case maybe more than any other that that that the picture was what prove what was true\nYes I Do you get any negative feedback on your Instagram feed\nA a little bit very very few though I mean if you go through the commentary there's a very rarely is there a negative feedback and and what's interesting to me is\nIf I'm if there is uh my uh it's ground followers\nAre have my back and they they ended up coming back to these people and they often point out to me\nUh people that that they feel or just bought maybe I don't know if they're rushing bots but people trying to stir up trouble not really interested in my Instagram feed just and saying what they want to say\nA ... in this book I you've got a often either Trump tweets alongside\nStory alongside your Instagram post is one I'm looking at right here\nA President Trump said on may six twenty Seventeen the reason I'm staying in Bedminster New Jersey a beautiful community is staying in New York City is much more expensive and disrupted meetings exclamation point you wrote stuck in meetings at sunny lands in rancho mirage California twenty sixteen and it's a picture of President Obama golfing\nRight I mean let's just let's I well I don't understand why the the ... the United states can't be honest\nI mean just say you're staying at bed Bedminster because you want to play golf ... and ... to just lie about golf I mean it makes no sense to me so that was sort of just a you know somebody in cheek folk poke I guess what's\nThe one that you're most proud of that you like I Can't believe I thought of that\n[noise] ah the the [laughter] I after I correct myself up sometimes when I when I come up with just the right picture in the right comment I guess\nYou know a Trump is always saying you know it's a witch hunt and it's a witch hunt I don't know how many times he's he's written that an exclamation points in all caps ah in regards to the FBI and investigation um [laughter]\nAnd I and I found a a picture of a a a young girl dressed as a which had a at a Halloween party\nAnd I just I think I wrote I'm a you know another kind of which I I have to admit that I correct myself up [laughter]\nThere's another one uh where you've got a picture of President Obama giving the state of the union on the same theme of a President Trump saying that he has more of an immigration and he said forty five point six million people watched the state of the union his state of the union\nThe highest number in history Fox News ... every other networking you Instagram forty eight million people watched the twenty tends to the union address on television just saying\nYeah and that was one where I ... it didn't sound right when I saw his tweet and so I had to kind of look it up [laughter] uh and and and and verified it with two or three sources that in fact President Obama's it was a two thousand ten states union was the largest and in history\nSeems like there's another theme in here which is that President Trump has gotten into a lot of high profile fights with world leaders and when that happens you show a photo of President Obama very happy with these other world leaders having a nice conversation with them\nA yeah I mean that's been pretty easy to [laughter] ... you know you mentioned uh another one that I really liked that I correct myself up over was\nWhen he started I'm tweeting about Kim Jong ... and ... and calling him little rocket man and rocket man and you know my button is bigger than your button all this kind of stuff [laughter] and I posted a picture of President Obama with a child I was a John Gray and I said there's only one rocket man\n[laughter] what is President Obama think of what you're doing\nUm you know he didn't know I was doing a book because I didn't want people to think that I you know I was doing this in a coup boots with him or that he was going to have any input I just saw him a week or so ago and now the the book is actually printed\nUm I told them that I was doing this book and you just you know he he didn't say that much about it\nOr at least that you can repeat to me on there\nAre no he he really didn't say that much about it I think he knows what I'm up to\nThe U.S ownership of all the photos that you took when you were in the White House or do you have to clear these by somebody else before you post among the surround\nNo these are all a pictures that one\nSo there are considered public domain so anybody can use them there was another guy that has a has a book out of all Obama pictures and they're all mine and but he's allowed to do that so\n[noise] so what do you want to do next who do you want to photograph next or do you want to have a job like you had when you were taking pictures every day of President Obama already or do you wanna do something else\n[noise] no I Want to do something else that's sort of the theme of maybe my next project is trying to figure that out a search for what kind of photography do I want to do but I definitely want to do new photography and I want to move away from 'em at least us politics for sure\nHow come [noise] um\nBecause I don't think that I'll ever have the kind of situation that I had with President Obama where I had a dynamic or a person to a photograph every day um someone that I had you know admired\nSomeone who gave me incredible access and I think I Would just be frustrated I'm trying to photograph politics when I Know that I couldn't get that kind of access to someone else at least I don't think I could\nAnd and and I've never you know I I sort of ended up as a political photographer it was never\nSomething that I had aspired to do it just things just sort of happened uh because I took a right turn in ... instead of a left turn 'em and so I Want to sort of explore\nSome other aspects of photography that I that I just don't get to do that much now\nTeaches at one more question for you um you know everybody now takes pictures with their phone you can tell when you look at a Pete Souza photographed that it's a really great photograph compared to what most of us are able to do although some people are great amateur photographers\nAnd the Franklin theater

experiment a grouping all seventh and eighth grade students of color together in home room\nAfter the parents of the minority students objected he'll caffeine is director of the little red schoolhouse first what was your thinking and trying this\nAh we know that there are ways in which being a student of color in a predominantly white school is a challenge and if there are ways where we could create a larger group of students of color within a classroom where there were white students and students of color that that would be supportive of them and that ultimately it might help their academic achievement ... well\nYou said that are part of this was based on you know research just listen to that tend to isolate these minority students it was an attempt to give them what some feeling of almost ...\n[noise] I don't know about special in this but um our white students are comfortable in their\nClassrooms looking around and seeing themselves in the schools teachers\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and for part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school or that felt supportive of their academic experience\nWill you refer to this and the schools handbook which says research points to the academic an emotional benefits to being in a classroom with others who share racial ethnic linguistic and cultural identity what what's that research\nThere there's research and this is a working with um some of my colleagues at the school that shows that\nUm those students who feel that there is some sort of stereotype threat I'm so there are some assumptions being made about them based on their identity and that as they are getting older and their their sense of self their racial identity is developing\nThat being part of a larger group having colleagues um is supportive of their development of their academic success\nThat's hard to argue but why not do it in the way many colleges do and have an African American club or an African American society or you know something like\nThey could go to so we have affinity groups um for students and for parents to things about that one you have um students to have to\nJust their identity or some other activity with a broader group of friends and it puts them in a tough spot and that's really hard for school age kids and I think that we shouldn't minimize the impact and the energy that it takes\nFor a let's say an African American students was one of the few African American students in his or her class to feel fully a part of that group and and they're devoting a lot of energy to being fully there as opposed to just focusing on the academic or intellectual experienced or having\nLook research also suggests that when teachers and students have different cultural exchange and let's say the teachers away and the students are black\nThen they have different schooling experiences and that affects the minority students negatively it at home with a place where it's it's much uh you know this much lighter exchange between the teacher in the student is not a place for each to learn from each other\n[noise] so it is and some ways what you're talking about is the real tension for us right there are benefits to a diverse conversation and they're also benefits to these affinity experiences and our job as an institution is to find ways to me both those and even though there I'm sort of at a conflict with each other from time to time\nYou know this isn't unheard of in twenty love in a public school in Lancaster, Pennsylvania this is a high school had its junior class divide itself for several minutes everyday along racial gender or language lines probably the same reasoning that you were giving for people to feel a sense of not being other you know\nBeing with but you know any time there's a grouping of minorities in particular it just feels like segregation literally a segregated hung on that you had you know what do you read about the wisdom that\nWe do and I have to do things about that one if you you know as people learn about our school or know about our school the idea that we would you know I'm actively group people in a way that we're taking away their civil or human rights as ridiculous given the school's history as a\nA a place where people came so that we could fight for justice which is what we've done for nearly a hundred years [noise]\nI also think it's important to know that um you know these were students of color and some of their white classmate in a classroom with both white teachers and teachers of color\nHaving a parallel experience to the other home room and the the suggestion that this was like a segregated school from\nYou know way back when is is ludicrous\nYou know we should say the little red schoolhouse founded in Nineteen Twenty one always seen as a progressive school [noise]\nSo what happens now uh you've dropped the homeroom experiment so how do you move forward\nWe will be doing what we have done and quite frankly what it what a lot of independence schools do which is to have race be one of the\nComponents of a student's identity that we think about when we're putting class placement together and we've entered into a community conversation with faculty and parents and students alumni\nTo continue to look for the best way to meet the needs of all of our students students of color included so that we can have all of our students have the full Hillary I experience I'm going forward\n[noise] by the way el R. E. I. that stands for the little red schoolhouse and Elizabeth Irwin high school there in Manhattan\nUh where you have ended this idea of grouping minorities together in a home room when the kids say\n[noise] um some kids remain somewhat confused by the need um other kids feel super supported so a lot of conversations with students coming forward\nAnd it's still a casting director of the little red schoolhouse in Manhattan they'll thanks so much it's been a pleasure and tomorrow we'll speak with an African American educated who says there are times to group kids have\nWeb streaming is made possible by Lipscomb universities online degree offerings designed for an ambitious learners students can earn a bachelors or masters degree yet their pace wherever they are learned more at Lipscomb dot edu slash online how will you choose\nWhat is a very good question I she ... the picture that makes me laugh out loud and I didn't have to think about why I just that's how I Do my job as a technique\nWell let's take a look at them and by the way we're radio so you can go to hear now dot org and follow along we'll try to describe his ...
