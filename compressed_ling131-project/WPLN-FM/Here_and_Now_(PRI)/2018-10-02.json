shutters will ... will have the opportunity to vote no on the politics of personal destruction while the alternative vote yes on the far nominate\nBut at the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary committee Dianne Feinstein told reporters today that a vote that soon wouldn't give senators enough time to weigh the information uncovered in the FBI investigation into allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh\nNPR lead political editor Domenico Montanaro is here ... and they're you know this has followed a pattern of investigations over the decades it starts out as one claim a claim of a\nSexual attacks series claim and now it seems to be about what judge Kavanaugh said about his drinking in high school and college so many people coming forward to say you didn't tell the truth you can't lie under oath so first what are you hearing 'em as these friends come forward is this swaying Republican senators as we're hearing about the drinking\nA so far and not really a you know at this point Republican senators are sitting back and waiting for the FBI investigation will be concluded and to try to have a vote this Friday\nOr as you noted there with Mitch McConnell saying that there will be a vote this Friday and that they anticipate that that Brett Kavanaugh will be exonerated through ah through what is a limited FBI investigation\nAnd President Trump initially said the FBI investigation could be a blessing in disguise but that was when the FBI had been instructed it seems to interview just four witnesses three who might have been in the house when a sexual attack took place and then a second accuser\nNow the FBI has been getting broader latitude do we know who else they're talking to\nWe don't know exactly but the White House can set parameters for the

here and now this week the Trump Administration announced that it had reached a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada a revision of NAFTA the north American free trade agreement\nJoining us now to talk about that and more is Larry Summers the former secretary of the treasury under President Clinton former top economic advisor under President Obama and president emeritus of Harvard University Larry Summers welcome back to you know\nGlad to be with your Germany and let's start with this trade agreement the new U.S Mexico Canada trade agreement what do you think of it\nNever seen so much ado about so little I thought the old trade regime between Canada Mexico in the United states was a good one and this one's not very different\nHow it could possibly be worth major alienation of major\nThese are ...\nRelatively small changes the vast majority of NAFTA is continuing\nAs it was this has been a major diversion from the important domestic challenges facing the United states\nAnd the important international challenges but I'm happy with the new agreement principally because I was happy with the olden Raymond and I can't imagine why someone who was profoundly troubled by the old agreement\nShould be happy with the new agreement\nSo this is more in the nature of a publicity stunt than an international diplomatic act\nSo when President Trump said this is proof that my strategy worked that I put pressure on Canada and Mexico and I got what I wanted and our dairy farmers are going to be in better shape now you say what\nI say any changes are tiny compared to the overall economy\nThe ill will we have created with respect to the Canadians and the Mexicans will have costs that will exceed any benefits\nThe ability of North America to remain unified when we face very serious challenges from Asia\nHas been constrained\nThis has been a the most short sighted of strategies for the most negligible game\nDo you feel the same way about what's happening these heavy trade with China right now I think there are\nMajor issues in the U.S China trading relationship it seems to me the strategies we used to go after them have\nBeen quite problematic they emboldened the strongest in most hostile to the United states elements within the Chinese government they encourage the Chinese on a road\nTo self sufficiency and independence from the United states\nWhich ultimately will reduce our leverage an influence they fail to mobilize the moral and political force of the entire international community which is surely the most effective way to influence\nChinese behavior I think that any conscientious American administration would be addressing issues about Chinese trade practices and in particular ones relating to intellectual property but I don't think\nThe strategy or the tactics has been well calculated to maximize long run American interests\nAnd what about President Trump's argument that us coffers are filling up because of these terrorists that were collecting a lot more money on everything that is being brought in from China they're all kinds of ways of raising\nIf you want tariffs our taxes they are taxes this fall principally on the goods that people buy\nAnd the inputs the companies need in order to compete that's why their taxes that are particularly regressive and particularly inefficient and so there's something\n... and that prides itself on its tax cutting focusing on cutting the taxes for corporations and raising the\nTaxes on uh the ordinary goods the toys that parents by for their kids have Christmas so are you surprised then that Republicans who have long campaigned on being taxed cutters and being against taxes are not speaking up about these tariffs\nI've stopped being surprised at Republican craven this in front of\nPresident Trump is clear and you know I'm an economist not a politician or a political scientist\nBut it's quite clear that a Republican congressmen and senators are in great fear of a primary challenge sponsored and supported\nBy President Trump and President Trump may not have a majority within America\nWith him indeed his approval rating suggests that it's well under fifty percent but he does have a big majority within the Republican Party\nAnd he's prepared to ruthlessly use that to impose party discipline and therefore he is able to a\nRally Republican congressmen and senators who value their survival as political leaders more than their previous convictions to stand by his side\nYou know the book has moved somewhat out of fashion but John Kennedy wrote a great book called profiles in courage about senators who were guarded their\nCore beliefs as being more important to them than their reelection I just wish we were seeing more profiles in courage or in the Senate these days on trade issues and frankly on some other issues as well\n[noise] what do you think of what the fed is doing right now they just raised interest rates again inflation is up above two percent unemployment below four percent right now or is it possible that the fed is keeping interest rates too low right now or what do you think\nI think the fed is right to recognize that any error and letting inflation rise a little bit too much is likely to be a reversible error at any error in terms of tipping economy into recession\nIs likely to take a very long time to reverse\nI'm One who believes that we have a very different economy than we used to therefore I think the approach that's being pursued is okay and I would not be one or to criticize it certainly not one to criticize it on the grounds that we should have even more rapid increases in interest rates than we do I\nI have an interesting theory that I just heard from somebody in the banking industry at a major bank and and he was saying\nThat the unemployment rate may actually be getting so low that they're going to be a lot of people hired for jobs that they shouldn't have being paid too much money and that's where inflation is going to come from what do you think about that\nPossible uh there is some evidence that\nAt the end of expansions\nThere's a tendency for productivity growth to slow and that may be for the reason you're a companion suggests that ah when laborers in short supply some of the people hire are a bit less a qualified\nBut it seems to me that what is striking is\nFor inflation is perhaps that's because of the price discipline posed by foreign competition posed a buy a technology so I think it would take quite a lot to generate a substantial acceleration in America and inflation\nI Want to ask you about one more thing which is that we're talking as the stock market is at record highs a lot of people are worried that you know we've been in an expansion for a long time now that the recession is on the way what are your thoughts at this point about that\nParticipants design their own doctoral program engaging the specific topic issue or passion across multiple disciplines

morning what happened while you were sleeping and the news interviews and analysis for the day I had national international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nIt's here and now and we've spoken here over the years about early retirement\nA couple who sold their home traveling in staying in other people's homes to save money\nDollars and live off investment income with is now a name for this called fire financial independence retire early and fire is on fire inspired in part by books like your money or your life\nAnd stoked on blogs podcast and read it message boards sharing ideas like how's hacking you buy a home rent down all the rooms you crash on the couch\nOr work at a place with free food Scott ... and his wife Taylor are on fire they were earning a hundred and sixty thousand dollars a year living in a beach town driving a BMW and then\nLet's let Scott ... he joined us from Bend Oregon Scott welcome\nHi thanks for having me well nice to speak with you and I understand you heard a pod cast with one of the gurus of this movement Mr money moustache this is\nPete asked me what was it that he said that made you and your wife so a roughly change your lives she moved you started saving you would a term intent to retire what what what did you hear\nInitially what was so intriguing to me was he sounded so optimistic and um for someone who's living on twenty seven thousand dollars a year which is how he was introduced on the podcast\nThat was very interesting to me at that time I was actually looking for my own million dollar idea to kind of get out of the stresses that I felt from our spend the lifestyle\nTalked about the stress as you are creative director at a creative agency and I'm imagining the homes got nicer and the cars got nicer and the clubs you belong to that nice or is that what was there that kind of escalation going on\nThat's exactly right it was this unintentional lifestyle creep we originally moved into this little five hundred square foot apartment in this little beach town\nIn our our costs were much lower than and you know as we got older uh and we had a baby or you know some of our knees were were changing but also our taste\nYou know we found ourselves eating out quite a bit we found ourselves are moving to a larger three bedroom apartment and you know we moved there when the recession was in full force but fast forward a couple of years and things were gaining steam and rents were going through the roof and you know I'll be honest\nMy financial literacy wasn't in top shape at that time and so to hear that someone was that happy living on twenty seven thousand dollars a year as well so intriguing to me in the beginning\nWell the other thing that happened is that your wife Taylor she looked at a retirement calculator [laughter]\nSo uh once I started going down the rabbit hole and learning about some of these tactics and strategy is from is from now my friends but at the time my my heroes I implemented the retirement calculator kind of understand our situation and when I first plug the numbers into what current spending was\nIt looked like we would probably be retiring in our eighties\nAnd uh and when I ran some models on what I thought we could live on reasonably based off of some major life changes uh I realized that we could probably retire in about ten years if we really stuck to it that is what put her over the edge\nOkay so this sense that you could be unburden from the cost of your own lifestyle that you could get out of maybe a rat race you've gotten into did you not like your job\nYou know it's funny I personally really like my job and for me it's not about work for me it was about a spring myself from\nThis idea of mandatory labor you know there's passions that I have that may not necessarily coincide with earning a lot of money or earning money at all and to have the time to pursue that felt like more like the type of life I'd want to live so when I realized that there was a potential for that I mean it was intoxicated\nOK so a couple of days first of all when you say this mandatory labor many of us just said you mean a job which is you know how the world turns around that what'd you and your wife did just to keep the story going it's it's a major part of this FIRE movement it's called arbitrage you move you had to move to a a less expensive towns here in Bend Oregon\nCall out something that I'm seeing from a lot of these people who are in the FIRE movement\nA lot of you seem really creative so you are making a documentary about your FIRE movement and you're writing a book about your FIRE movement haven't you just replaced your creative director job with film director author [laughter]\nYou know it's funny I I've I've now met a lot of people in this fire community and the one thing that seems to stay very relevant truth that you know you don't meet a lot of people who are just straight up retired doing absolutely nothing right I haven't met anyone that's been like that\nAnd we should say there's different levels or this is according to our reading there's lean fire where people are extremely frugal fat fire where people have a more typical standard of living but they save and invest breeze to fire you work part time at like a Starbucks [laughter] so you can\nGet health insurance but the infamous yeah yeah the interesting part talking about that because\nThis isn't like decades ago um when Scott and Helen Nearing two incredible people\nDecided to live off the land and kick the rat race and they wrote a book called simple living I Can't recommended enough that the whole goal was not to make too big footprint seeing that this isn't really that a lot of this is people who are working very hard to play the investment game\nAnd have enough investments that they can live off their investments which is very different\nYou know then kind of a hippie getting out of the rat race\nOne of the the main draw for me was the ease at which the investment strategy takes place and when I found out about index funds these low cost index funds\nAnd how much money you could save by not having a financial adviser your especially betting on the stock market which in its history has always gone up now it goes through these big Gibson dives\nAnd if you can ride those wave that you can ride those lows you'll end up on the right side of that when I realized it was as easy as set it and forget it that was really really a a nice entry point for me\nWell in part of this in order to do this as a sort of a goal or in the FIRE movement of Seventy percent savings\nThe whole framework is really flexible if you increase your savings rate by ten percent you're ten percent better off\nMy wife and I made it to a Seventy percent savings rate and to be completely honest with you were absolutely miserable and we'd go to great lengths to get there the reason why we made the film and wrote the book is we're trying to share our story with people so that they can understand what it's like so that they can eliminate the excuses that stopping them\nFrom some of the changes you made to help save that money that even though you're miserable what were some of the things you were doing\n[laughter] yeah I mean one of the things that we did was we set a whole ah you know adventure up to to go and find a new place to live we wanted to make sure that\nOur quality of life wouldn't suffer you know there was a lot of different things that we implemented but part of that was since we're on the road for your we we actually we went and spent some time living with our parents for a couple of months to save as much money as we possibly could get them a little bit of time with their new granddaughter\nAnd we thought that'd be a nice combo punch what we found was that are being in our mid thirties with a two year old living in the basement of our parents' house maybe it was a little extreme maybe a bad idea\nAnd then on top of that I think there was a lot of unknowns are leaving a community behind that we we invested in that we loved leaving our friends leaving what we knew um and I think we we kind of dealt with that stuff ah while we were living in the air and space and\nBy the way people have pointed out this isn't something you can do if you don't have parents you can move in with or if you have a huge student loan debt or if you don't you know if you don't work in an area where you can read a high salary and then turn around and invested in your future so it's it's not for everyone\nBut it just so here you are doing this and\nWe'd like one million one point two million one point five million invested that seems a lot of money but you're potentially going to live Seventy more years [noise] I mean have you ever thought about that\nOf course we definitely thought about that and that's something that you know we were definitely a nervous about and asked a lot about in the beginning\nAnd there's a couple of things about it I think the first thing is the whole premise of financial independence and your investments making enough that it can sustain you is based off of this thing called the trinity study and it essentially a works out the math to be about Ninety eight percent chance that you won't run out of your a\nPrincipal a investments over the course of Thirty years if you draw four percent off of that and the idea is that the stock market continues to grow and if it continues to grow that has in the past and you can always tip a little bit off of the top\nAnd you'll never run out of what you had it at the end of the day one of my dear friends in one of my favorite uh you know fire pie casters her name is Paula ... we were asking her this question

canvas and we got really lucky because they were saying oh you're just like not shall we had three years ago there wasn't a shows ...\nLet's talk about some of the work wink\nWink nudge nudge

Smith\nAnd it is on a weekday which Kavanaugh sort of tried to downplay the extent to which are his friends got together for beers on weekdays there all these ways in which ah that event reinforces even if that wasn't the day on which\nAn incident had occurred it reinforces that such things did happen over the course of that summer\nWhich is something that a cat and I went to great pains to deny\nKevin as your book has also become the focus of scrutiny this is Senator Sheldon Whitehouse reading from Kevin ... country\nHave you I don't know if it's ... or ... how do you pronounce that refers to flatulence we were sixteen okay [noise]\nAnd so when a your friend mark judge said the same for the same thing in your book page back to you at the same meaning it was ...\nI don't know what he did but that's my recollection and we want to talk about flatulence such a sixteen year book page\nOn 'em game Philip bump that's not what this means well it's\nSort of unclear one booth means in that context right I mean I I I'm not really a booth truth or if you will on this particular subject I mean there's you know in high school you have little terms that you use with your friends and and they can very pretty wisely\nBut it seems pretty clear that the broader effort the Kavanaugh was undertaking there was two each time there was a pretty obvious a reference to drinking that was made in your book he tried to redirect away from the fact that they were talking about drinking heavily\nYou know he he said that the beach week routes club which is pretty obviously right a reference to him drinking Latin and vomiting was a function of him having a weak stomach so whatever the definition of booth is however it relates to drinking the fact is that the euro country makes very clear that drinking was a big part of his high school experience\nAnd just by the way I mean of course it's crowd source but the Urban Dictionary says the move to reverse anal sex or this is Sheldon Whitehouse later talking with Kevin uh about another term as your book devil's triangle here is devil's triangle\n[noise]\nDrinking game as it played three glasses and a triangle and you ever played quarters you know okay so ... what\nAbout that one and again I'm going to refer to Urban Dictionary uh and it says now because of what's happened in the last few days that are just devil's triangle is made up game of quarters with three cups arranging a triangle the rules are unknown because the inventor of the game Brett Kavanaugh could not explain them under oath\n[laughter] right so uh this is again this this is a bit of flying it's not really clear what the intended usage was at the time they are all sorts of a suggestion is about it but one thing that I Will notice I went back and I looked at Google has the tools allows you to search a books that they have ... I went back and look to contemporaneous news reports\nYou know news ... likes to talk about flying high schoolers are using I saw no indication of either booth or devil's triangle the the way in which Kavanaugh alleges they were used were actually contemporaneous uses of those tariffs\nSo we're we're we're diving pretty deep into\n... in an area that sort of hard to evaluate a objectively and categorically a but it seems pretty clear that no one besides Brett Kavanaugh says the devil's triangle is the thing that he said it was which is sort of ironic given that the whole thing is meant to refute an allegation that he says only one person had made\nI Want to play one more clip from the hearing this is senator Amy club which are pressing cabinet and his assertion that he never had memory lapses resulting from drinking or you're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much that you didn't remember what happened the night before are part of what happens\nIf you're asking about yeah blackout I don't know have you\nCan you answer that question\nThat's not happening is that your answer yeah and I'm curious if you have\nI have no drinking in order to our okay thank you so Chad ... who's a former classmate of Kevin ... says Kevin has not told the truth about his drinking at Yale or is it plausible for him to tell senator corporate charter that he's never had memory loss from drinking\nAh I I mean it is it plausible I suppose theoretically it's plausible but we have a lot of contemporaneous evidence from people that knew him at the time who said he drank a lot too when he drank they're often times in which he appeared to be in the past hated ah and there are lots of suggestions or from people who knew him then that\nIt is hard to believe that he never would have been blackout drunk given how much he drunk and I'll heavily drank and of course this is the central central point if it was the case that he with some regularity and high school\nUh gotten drunk to the point that he can't remember his actions that may influence\nThe story that he says which isn't he doesn't he never I I did what Ford alleges it's quite possible he doesn't remember what doing what for legit so it's very important for him to establish that he never got blackout drunk because if he can establish that then that bolsters his defense of this event never happens well\nAnd also you know this is a person who wants to be a a justice on the Supreme Court and\nThere are big questions here about whether he was telling the truth under oath to these senators this is a Jeff Flake the senator the Republican senator from Arizona and Chris Coons a Democrat on sixty minutes over the weekend a talking with Scott Kelly of CBS if\nJudge Kavanaugh is shown to have lied to the committee nomination job or are you advising them\nSo they're they're both saying that that lying to the committee would be a problem I mean how how is this all playing out a among the people that you're talking to at this point well\nThis is one of the move sort of fascinating things here is the extent to which the sort of obvious white lies of him\nOr trying to downplay for example as your book injuries are sort of given a pass we sort of established as odd spectrum of these sorts of false words that are are going to be considered a disqualifying for Kavanaugh and that the European countries may not necessarily fit into that category so it's\nA well sort of have to see this is all politics right I mean flakes assertion that that would be disqualifying will be absolutely heavily loving by the fact that he needs to consider what the politics are of the decision that the ... and so to the extent that we can say hey Kevin all said this thing about the yearbook which isn't exactly true", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Nashville", "day": "02"}
