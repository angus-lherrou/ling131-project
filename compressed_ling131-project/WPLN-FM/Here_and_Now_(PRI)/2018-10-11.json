mothers did before to ... the woman you are qualified\nTo Judaism you're going to be absorbed in ... and ... what what was called trend in on the joke is if you ...\nYou know do do do do that you have to ... when you're ... you're going into the the ... so I'm a big deal to her as a show to do that I think I'm I Am living within six months to Colombia\nI think we should be able to do with another dumb Britain would come up with ... boots on would do it\nLet's bring and Jill rep logo who is a reporter who's been covering homelessness for Cape BCC here in Pasadena Hi Joe Hi Jeremy and when you're listening there to Michael and Elizabeth uh you hear people who are educated you can't see it but they're well dressed but they're homeless\nYeah to me what their story really illustrates is you know what experts say is it it's so important to get people how quickly you know on demand talked about sort of thinking in to that hopelessness\nAnd when people go on how it's for a long time that just gets worse and worse than a lot of the things that people complain about street homelessness you know they associate things like alcoholism that comes from the trauma of being on the streets for a long time how bad is the problem in California right now\nWe're getting example I you know up until a few months ago there were about two hundred people sleeping in tents and a plaza\nRight next to the main courthouse in orange county and next to city hall in Santa Ana so you know people start if every day when they walked past it I Can't ... has since been clear that you'd be hard pressed to find somebody who doesn't encounter people pretty much on a daily basis sleeping in parks are asking for money on sidewalks and is it getting worse and if so why\nThe single biggest reason is or the lack of housing I mean first of all yes it's getting worse\nAnd the lack of housing in Southern California and especially the lack of affordable housing you know a lot of people haven't yet recovered from the recession even though that was awhile ago now but rents have risen sharply and you know people more people keep moving into the area and there's just not enough housing for everyone let alone\nRent and and the second big factor is that local governments haven't gotten really serious about addressing homelessness until pretty recently a there is historically been a lot of pushback against shelters and housing for homeless people and that continues today\nAnd there's a lawsuit in orange county uh currently before a federal judge in California tell us briefly about that\nIn this case came about when Orange County officials talked to clear out a very large homeless encampment I'm up to like Fifteen hundred people that have been growing for many years along a flood control channel kind of right smack in the middle of the county\nIn orange county alone there are four house races ranked as competitive by the cook Political Report\nAll of them are currently held by Republicans in this traditionally conservative county but President Trump's approval rating is low here creating an opening for Democrats in the thirty ninth district ed Royce is retiring after twenty five years in office the Republican running to replace him he's young Kim one of his staffers\nAnd what ended that said throughout the entire thirty ninth congressional district as a congressional staff that that the community I Know these are the people that I'm running to represent that just personal to me\nThe thirty ninth district is two thirds non white Kim would be the first Korean American woman ever elected to Congress but Democrats Gil Cisneros a Latino and first time political candidate who bankrolled has campaigned with lottery winnings hopes to turn the district blue she\nWants to protect I Want to protect the border that's one of the reasons I served in the military was defending our nation but we don't need to do that by building a thirty billion dollar wall is probably going to end up one has done costing fifty billion dollars\nA prominent Republican is also leaving an open seat in California's forty ninth district which includes parts of southern Orange County in northern San Diego county\nAfter narrowly winning his last re election Daryl I sent is leaving to join the Trump Administration as the head of the U.S trade and development agency he's endorsed Republican Diane Harkey to replace him\nWell I mean for ... replacement that function and Washington DC I've worked in the legislature I've also worked on the board of the nation and very very minority conditions 'cause I'm a Republican and very very democratic state\nHer opponent is Democrat and first time candidate Mike LeBron\nWhat's happening uh with uh the Republican Party in what Trump is that consistent undermining of the Affordable CARE Act and I see it all as a you know my travels throughout this district I speak with so many people who are one medical emergency away for not being able to pay their rent\nIn the other two races incumbent Republicans are facing tough re elections in California's forty eighth district Dana Rohrabacher is fighting off Democrats were labeled improvements favorite congressman for a buck or has advocated stronger ties with Moscow and wants to put his muscles were just unbelievable\nYeah my constituents want us to work with Russia where we can and the American people want us to work where we get rather than this unrelenting hostility and push towards you portray Russia and the United states in conflict\nHardly router hopes to become the first Democrat ever to win the forty eight [noise] and you know what\nWe are going to not only flipped the forty eighth district but we are going to wash across this country a blue way for all of America [noise]\nAnd in the forty fifth district Republican Mimi Walters is seeking her third term\nI think that the American public had seen what Congress has accomplished look at more people today has a money more money in their pocket um jobs are being created a we have higher wages\nWalters opponent Democrat Katie Porter couch endorsements from progressive senators ... Harris and Elizabeth Warren her former professor\nReal multinational corporations in this country that before this tax dollars were paying zero and my opponent Mimi Walters voting for this tax now which is going to fall particularly heavily on families in her own distracting the forty fifth district in orange county\nOrange County went for Hillary Clinton in twenty sixteen the first time that a Democrat won the county since FDR but that doesn't mean it's turning blue for good Jody ... is a political science professor at fortune college in orange county since she thinks first of all we're still\nA Republican county ah we're becoming last Republican as old white guys die and as the young people or\nUm those demographics are shifting but we went for a Clinton because people didn't like Trump not because Republicans in orange county suddenly found love for Hillary Clinton and what do they think about Trump now [noise]\nSo a number of people who didn't like him have come around partially because they didn't have another choice I think one of the reasons that I'm Republicans in orange county didn't like Trump was because they didn't like Schwarzenegger or\nAnd they had that experience and an outsider who said that he could clean up the capital and didn't understand the government and failed pretty spectacularly in getting what Republicans wanted so I think it was just that they had had experienced that a lot of Republicans across the country hadn't ...\nWhat it Orange County think of President Obama will certainly the Republicans didn't like him and spent eight years hating him\nPretty uh vehemently uh but um [noise]\nI you know it it wasn't because they left Hillary so what are Republicans hoping to do in the upcoming election\nSo Republicans are hoping to hold on\nYou know it's going to come down to three things it's a Trump it turn out and its taxes are there are a lot of people who are supportive of Trump and and now I guess I've got to add to Kavanaugh factor of driving people to the polls for and against Kavanaugh but it's all going to come down to turn out\nFor the Democrats to get all four of those seats [noise] um it's going to have to be the perfect wave and I think polls are really over estimating the Democrats' chances of getting all for what are the Democrats need to do this to remember\nSo the Democrats need to turn out and they didn't need to turn out in a really big why\nUm I think the story of two thousand and Eighteen might not be the huge victories that the polls are predicting but I think when we look back I think she thousand in Eighteen is when the Democrats realized\nThat they needed a farm team that when you look at the four Democrats that are on the ballot for Congress not one of them has held elected office before\nNot want the Republicans have all held elected office are are holding elected office so they've got experience they've got a ballot designation that people trust and right now Orange County I I think\nAlmost every single city council is majority Republican so we haven't seen the Democrats have a big farm team to choose from\nWhen they have this opportunity [laughter]\n[noise]\nDemocrats may not have a farm team but President Obama feel so confident about their prospects here that he visited last month for a campaign rally that was before the fight in Washington over the confirmation battle for now justice Brett Kavanaugh\nOutside of shopping center in Huntington Beach Orange County voted Laurie he'd told us She's been trying to oust Republican members of Congress here for years way before Kevin I was in the picture\nI can about it as a negative opinion is that in saying my vote by vote the so already my vote prior to\nMinds may not be changed but ... says the cabinet confirmation is likely to motivate Democrats to turn out\nParticularly women who are energized and galvanized them so I think turnout is going to be really hot because of that I don't know on the other side I don't know if Republicans who feel like the process was unfair to have an ... I don't know if there'll be galvanized out it's not as much\nA recent poll by Berkley I. G. S. shows Orange County Democrats tied with or beating their Republican opponents sometimes by wide margins although in orange county a quarter of all voters have no party preference here's Richard ...\nI'm not voting party line vote and whoever was represent the people love to politicians not policy not control [noise] lower taxes and you want to\nKeep our money there are also people like Greg Diamond's food doesn't know who represents him in Congress\nOr when you have to read about it for\nMuch\nPolitical scientist Jody Ball must as many voters may not know the candidates' names\nYeah I think there's a lot of party\nAffiliation that they're going to go on\nDo you think that part of that though is that things are pretty good in California right now and you pay more attention to who you're voting for when things are not good and then when things are fine when you're good we got it you got a job you you know in New York ...\nYes no I absolutely think that I think that you know part of low voter turnout is satisfaction that people are not a you know roaming the streets with pitchforks and trying to get big changes\nBowman says there is one area where many Orange County residents are not satisfied and that's on the issue of gas prices which are hovering around four dollars a gallon there's a question on the ballot next month across the state the black voters if they want to repeal the state's new gas tax and vehicle fees\nThis is Ninety point three WPN Len Nashville public radio Ninety One point five WTO ...

Edgar says the sanctuary state law goes too far\nWhen you look at this it's really the difference between the boundaries of separation of powers between local jurisdictions state jurisdiction in federal from our perspective we wanted to go and take an option to say hey look we have the right to do this and that's when the ACLU came in and said we don't think you do have the right so now we have an outside group that's actually going and challenging us on that issue\nHow do you respond to some of the opponents of this who say that by not having a sanctuary city or sanctuary state policy that immigrants are going to be less likely to work with law enforcement on major crimes reporting things et cetera because they're afraid of deportation\nYou know what I I don't see it that way I think that um if you talk to people within a especially around loose telling me to stay in the north Orange County area\nYou'll see a lot of the immigration population that may not be legal\nThankful for what we're doing because we feel that uh or they feel that basically by us not abiding by the sanctuary laws what happens is these people that are bad actors that are illegal that get put in jail and then are not released back to the federal government come back into their communities and continue to terrorize their community\nAnd so from their perspective they are very thankful I think a lot of this this is the politics and the soundbites versus the reality of what's going on in the ground\nEdgar met with President Trump earlier this year he's been in regular contact with the White House since the move by his city has been called racist and seen a phobic I asked him about that\nI don't think this has anything to do with racism um I probably the best example and the ... for example I gave us my wife is from Iran\nShe came when the shah was overthrown she is a Christian in Iran she basically had to get asylum in Paris for two years and wait in turn to get into the United states that so you know that is\nThe way immigration should work and you know I don't have anything ah but love for immigrants and I'm actually I'm with my wife is an example I mean this has nothing to do with um it'd be an anti immigrant or racist\nMore than a dozen cities in California has sided with was telling me to us in ...\nAssistant special agent in charge of ICE's homeland security investigations in the LA area or a chest I he said the sanctuary state law is having the unintended consequences of complicating investigations into serious crimes like human trafficking\nI feel that this has become a political issue and it really should be that it should be a nonpartisan issue and so public safety issue which is ... is here to protect our national security and to protect our neighborhoods\nAnd if they took a minute to actually learn what we did I think they would be where we're very we help immigrants more than any other agency that I'm aware of a lot of these\nImmigrants come across illegally are abused I'd met with a I've been on several interviews with women that were raped multiple times getting up here in our agents are the ones that help\nThese immigrants that are coming up here they tried to get the information from them and we go after the bad guys that are terrorizing these people when they're coming up here they take their life savings and they do very bad things to them or they were talking about criminal organizations that are doing those\nDetails says his division of ice has become collateral damage in a political battle over the country is broken immigration system but other cities in orange county see it differently go a few miles down the road from us Alameda and you'll find Santa Ana which declared itself a sanctuary city long before the state passed its sanctuary law\nDivvied ... is a city councilman there\nWe believe in the dignity of all people the city of sent on or a heads up about eighty percent\nLatino about fifty percent of the residents of our city were born in another country so\nAre the issues of immigration direct impact us directly and being a sanctuary city ensures that we send a message to all of our presidents\nThat they're going to be treated respectfully a with dignity and at the city is here to serve them well we we spoke earlier with the city manager from Los Alamos who said I'm not anti immigrant in fact I'm married to an immigrant and that's not about racism why um why I'm doing this [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't hold back my ah laughter there if if it is\nFrankly a pretty shallow a response there was no need for the city of telling me to take the position that they did other than to send a political message are they are wanting them and other cities like them or wanting to send a message that California's is not\nA welcoming of immigrants and that's not the position that we've come far beyond that I Would hope\nAnd we believe in the dignity of every person who answers our city and that's what it means to be a century city and when President Trump says that you're giving safe harbor to criminals you say what\nThat he is a liar and has no idea uh about the laws and and the law of the land he oftentimes talks about a violent criminals and\nI Do believe that any violent criminals should be held accountable the city's downtown I Believe that any violent criminal should be ... held accountable they should be arrested they should serve their time\nHowever if you are only\nCrime quote unquote is leaving your country out of desperation looking to be able to survive being able to provide for your family that's not something that I see that uh the city should be looking to arrest somebody for\nSo what do people in law enforcement think well it depends on who you ask this is the chief of police in Santa Ana David Valentino\nI think some people misinterpret a sanctuary for being you know soft on crime or looking the other way that's\nThat's not what my mandate is tomorrow officers um we responded ... responded criminal behaviors irrespective of your status\nSo when representatives from ice state makes their job more difficult what do you say that the so federal authorities\nHum are you know that they have the mandate to um to enforce federal law we do not and so we're just like lanes of traffic right um where our local I'm a police entity and we provide police services to the folks live here um they have their mandate to enforce federal law in there and they do that so [noise]\nUm the other pieces it has to do with community trust and I know there's\nThere's a large part of the dialogue there on what does that mean so the demographics of our city are such that we want people to feel comfortable to college for help if they're not calling the police who are they common right\nSo um the ideas um to reinforce the messaging that we're not interested in in what the residency status we're going to respond and it's just the folks to call for help\nSo that's the chief of police in Santa Ana this is Don Barnes the under sheriff of Orange County\nWe were in one of the largest jail systems in the nation and we've always had a relationship with ice prior to this regardless what administration Bush Obama and now Trump\nWhen there's somebody in our custody roughly just about temp less than ten percent of our inmates at our custody for local crimes not for ice issues or here undocumented of that ten percent ice only really wants to about one percent of those individuals those are the ones that place it detain are on\nSo it isn't everybody in our custody it's just a small population of inmates who ice has said they want that we can no longer communicate if we can communicate we release them back in the community\nSo you'd think S. B. fifty four is making this community less safe\nI Know it is making the community last day\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have WVU are Boston and your NPR station from home advisor matching homeowners with home improvement professionals for a variety of home projects from minor repairs to major remodeled homeowners can read reviews of local pros and book appointments online at home advisor dot com\nAnd staples with printers printer ink and toner cartridges for home in business\nAnd in store print shops for customized presentations booklets in manuals more at staples stores or staples dot com staples\n\nThis year and now California Senator Dianne Feinstein is up for re election in November and her opponent is a fellow Democrat in twenty sixteen estate changed its primary rules allowing the top two vote getters to advance to the general election regardless of party\nPoll showed that state senator Kevin daily own is a long shot to defeat Feinstein who's been in the Senate since Nineteen Ninety two we invited both Feinstein and daily on to join us Feinstein declined Kevin de Leon accepted welcome to hear now thank you very much for the invitation\nSo standard Feinstein one forty four percent of the vote in the primary versus your twelve she is well known she's well funded and the polls looked pretty good for her why do you think you can win this race\nActually the latest poll has a has a ... eleven percent there's two polls one at eight percent one at eleven percent\nAnd win that election took place on June fifth um where she's secured forty four percent of the boat to my twelve percent there were thirty two candidates on the ballot if you open up the ballot um it looked like the white pages do so many names um and many pages I was actually the last name on the ballot for the U.S Senate\nSo our goal was always to give them to talk to us so we can juxtapose are are complements our our vision and our values for California\nSo the two latest independent polls now hold us a at eleven points and eight points are respectively so we still have a solid shot to uh have a new voice or an you change a representing California today none of the past\n[noise] well I I did notice that in one poll by writers it says and the ...
