Jeremy Hobson it's here and now it is a day of fast moving developments in Washington where senators are reviewing the FBI's investigation of sexual misconduct accusations\nAgainst Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh undecided Republican Maine Senator Susan Collins praised the investigation as thorough Arizona Senator Jeff flake said the investigation had produced no new corroborating information against Kavanaugh\nRepublicans had for initial vote on the nomination tomorrow joining us now NBC senior politics editor Beth food we Hi Beth hey Jeremy and what do you make of what we're hearing from Collins and Jeff Flake and what about Lisa Murkowski and other undecided Republican\nWell our team caught up with Lisa Murkowski on the hell not long ago and she said she's revealing the information she she really didn't give\nMuch indication of where her a vote would go but look with with senator Collins now saying calling the investigation thorough a Senator Flake saying it predicts no new cooperating information if he said that's a sign that they essentially got what they needed to vote yes for this nomination it's it this FBI investigation\nHowever uh a brief and not conclusive as it probably was given how few ah we've learned that not that many people were interviewed and the whole thing just took place over the course of a few days it was enough to get these undecided Republicans some cover and and and probably enabled them to vote yes\nWell and in fact Ford was not interviewed by the FBI for this year with Kavanaugh a Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley said it showed no hint of misconduct by Kevin up but Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer disagreed areas\nWe as many fears that this was a very limited process that will constrain the FBI from getting all the fat [noise] having received a thorough briefing on the documents those fears have been realized so\nThat's the message from Senate Democrats where did they go from here or do you expect the Chuck Schumer and die and find center going to be talking to Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski and Jeff Flake to try to get them on their side\nWell they've got a problem in their own a

that we're finding each other again Denny Mason joins us from ...\nThank you it's wonderful to be on the show\nWell how did you come to this story this time in history\nIt began as a very different different novel I'm a psychiatrist and I was very interested in spared psychiatric history in the Nineteen twenties and was writing about a psychiatrist at the time and I thought that this character of course needed a back story and that most doctors that time and have a back story that involved the first World War\nAnd so I began to read about the medical experience in the first World War and\nAs I was reading that I began to encounter this anecdote of how the ... army was so Eli prepare that\nThey began to recruit a medical students sometimes dentist sometimes ... to serve very important roles and fuel hospitals on the front tending to knock the numbers of men\nAnd this was at a time when I had recently finished medical school\nAnd all of a sudden to imagine this colleague across time hundred years ago leaving his medical training and being asked to perform medical responsibilities if you saw on credit for something that resonated with me and the place I was in at that time\nWell I mean he he's issued an army issued medical manual that off the advice on building latrines soothing blisters with whale oil and providing moral instructions a soldier who misses the comforts of his wife\nAnd what happens when he gets there is he hears about Louis that might be teeming with maggots just horrifying ensuring clumps state team they stirred like embers these are life as well on every last clothing and every stitch and seen\nThat came out upon our comes grainy like wet meal just\nDisgusting because of the ... you know these moist dressings and amputations which he had no idea how to do and entered this nun who teaches him all of this where did you find her\nSo originally I hadn't imagine having the role that you eventually had in the story I had thought that measures would arrive at a hospital and of course there'd be some medical stuff then there'd be a nurse would provide a background role but much like ...\nI found when I encountered her she ended up picking over the story and she has very forceful force in the book and I realized eventually but she was going to be the central figure in the book\nSo something from your imagination not from history and here's a scene where she first\nDealing with Lucia through again has arrived at this place he doesn't know what he's doing and she says wash your hands come with me now we operate we'll start with had moons and amputate the split this leg this elbow that for arm that I'm over there we can let the and this soldier Lou should ask smelling like that she says he'll be dead by morning\nDon't worry

your most irresistible creation actresses all over Hollywood should be jockeying to play her heart in the inevitable movie adaptation were you thinking cinematic Lee because it is I felt as if I was seeing a film as well as meeting story\nI don't think I was thinking explicitly cinematic way I think that I'm very drawn to visual images at the time period offers up some extraordinary physical settings\nBecause this takes place on the Eastern Front it's different than the world war one that I had all grown up imagining in the trenches and muddy field so ... of Belgium\nThis is different these are these large landscapes across which there's this encounter not only with these modern military armies but also very traditional ones soldiers on horseback current Lance is this is part of what drew me into the story these very rich visual images from the time\nIn fact at one point is lost in the ...\nBattle on the front it's kind of insane making did you see accounts like that\nA lot of the accounts that I read and I'd say many if not most of it comes to the war accounts of battle\nAnd in that moment when Lucia stumbles into this classic Russian classic advance in a group of Hungarian has ours he realizes that despite the fact that at that point he's been on the front for almost two years he hasn't really seen war itself and the rest of\nThe book really looks at this other aspect of for what's happening on the home front what's happening in the hospitals what's happening to people after the fighting is over\nWhat's happening to their mind as we know it was the beginning of people starting to understand that there was this psychiatric torment they called it nervous shock\nSure so as a psychiatrist I've been aware that one of the signal injuries of World War one\nIs shell shocked and yet at the time it was this great mystery to doctors men beginning to come down with wounds that couldn't be seen as best some new kind of\nVirus is is a reaction to\nThis new kind of artillery and particularly potent explosive it's being used in the war that was an initial\nThought that there was something about the high explosives that was used during the war was actually sending microscopic particles through the Gulf or the scan it into the brain and causing an injury to the brain but efforts were made to understand what was causing this\nThis new disease and then most acutely how to cure\nAnd here's what we see Lucia sorry Dr mature because he is viewing this as a problem to be solved Margaret than none is doing this as a human being who is suffering\nIs this something because you said you relate to a lot to lose just do does this something that transition you went through as a doctor\nIt is I imagine it's a transition that many doctors go through and that when medical training begins most of us have very little experience of illness in my own medical training I found that the transition over from the pre clinical years into the thirty year when you begin to go into words and meet people\nIs very disorienting one because for the first time you're encountering the disease that you've learned about in people who are suffering and they don't obey the same rules that you've learned about in the first two years it's much more complicated and beyond the impact of the disease on the Oregon\nThere's even more importantly the impact of the disease and the person and then beyond that and the impact of them on their family and those people who care for them and that and increasing realization of the many ripples that result from illness is something that looks just go through\nA we just want to touch on the some of the absurdist notions there was the daughter and old professor in Vienna who steals an alleged murder made from a museum

day I had national international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nThis is here now retailers prepping for the holidays got some good news this week the national Retail Federation expects holiday spending too\nEconomy but there is a downside the low unemployment rate will make it very hard for stores to find seasonal workers ... senior innovation reporter at W. B. or he joins us now I ... I ... and tell us more about how much people are supposed to spend this year how much they're expected to spend this year and how that lines up with pastures so the projection is about\nSeven hundred and twenty billion dollars in November and December and that excludes cars and gas and spending at restaurants are really just sort of those gifts around the holidays that would be about thirty billion dollars more than last year and just for perspective a spending usually does grow year over year but the\nAverage growth rate in recent years has been about three point nine percent so somewhere between four and five would be above average\nAnd how does that line up with the fact that we've talked about mall vacancies being at high levels about big department stores having problems like\nMacy's right so the trend is undeniable I'm In Cyber Monday last year was the biggest online shopping day in history and meanwhile the foot traffic in brick and mortar stores on Black Friday was down by two percent so I think the overall spending increased can help the retailers to do both and I think one really interesting experiment this year\nIs way fair the online furniture retail or they are experimenting with temporary\nBrick and mortar locations in those shopping malls but interestingly they will just be showrooms you can actually buy them there you see them in the physical space in that order\nOn line is it the ... model or where you can go and try things on but you have to actually go on line to buy it um what about this idea that it's hard for these places to attract seasonal workers\nQuite so we just saw a Amazon a couple of days that could increase minimum pay to Fifteen dollars an hour and that increasing it looks like it will be the norm this holiday season\nThe market research firm weak field of research published a survey last week of a thousand retailers and reported that the average hourly wage this holiday season is going to be Fifteen dollars and forty cents that's a big jump from an average of eleven and Seventy cents last year\nAnd the minimum wage just above seven dollars an hour or nationally what about the trade war and terrorists is that going to have an impact on how much we're spending on gifts\nCould other Retail Federation says it's concerned about those tariffs has an estimated what the overall impact will be but of course we've been hearing for months from businesses saying that the ... the tariffs especially on Chinese imports could make their costs go up and therefore they would have to pass those along to consumers\nOne more thing account big economic news today and probably driving the markets lower today is that we found that the yield on ten year treasury notes US government bonds reached its highest level since ... eleven what's going on\nHere right so uh it was up to about three point two percent that's the highest since uh two thousand eleven as you said this is another sign of confidence in the U.S economy hard to know exactly what goes on in investors' minds but of course they are weighing the risks versus reward and the treasury notes considered a very\nSafe investment that's why the interest rate is typically lower than what you might be able to get in the riskier stock market\nBut if that interest rate takes up a little bit maybe people don't want to take so much risk in the stock market\nAnd maybe mortgage rates and other things also start to pick up even more ... of WB or thank you so much to be with you\nWell as we heard earlier vice president Mike Pence took a hard line on China today

you know about that at big you know Ninety seconds and uh back in two thousand six with Trump and I was like I just don't want to write a tell all because it would be a very very short book\nBut then you know I really didn't have an outlet to tell my side of the story obviously I went on sixty minutes and hope to do that and the interview was over three hours but once it was edited down it was only fourteen minutes and some of the really key things that I wanted to express you got cut out everybody knows what happened but nobody really knew how or why\nSo like you people haven't gotten the full picture of who you are\nCorrect and like I said housings transpired and why they happen the way they did and the way things unfold that so I just rushed the book and it was it was just my way of putting having complete control um although you know I'm Still sure that people are just going to jump straight to chapter three and I read\nIt might make a joke about that in the book but let's let's start with what you talked about at the beginning you grew up in\nBaton Rouge Louisiana you describe a rough childhood your mother would leave you alone for days without food or you say you were repeatedly raped at the age of nine and you were called the liar when you tried to report that sexual abuse to a guidance counselor\n... ... what are you were able to know about you and your life that you don't think that they do already know\nUm basically what I just said that\nI don't want to be defined by one single evening with someone that uh I met and just thought it was going to be a crazy night with a goofy TV star obviously I had\nNo inclination as anyone else that he was going to be a politician you know I just started the book with the background because I kind of wanted everyone to get a a feeling for\nWhere I came from but I think that like the most important thing that I wanted to get across is that\nI was established and my industry as a writer and director and a feature dancer [noise] um I had this completely different life although in its own right very extraordinary and so I just wanted people to know that there's a lot more to me than just that night\n[noise] what made you decide to finally come out and say this is what happened\nI was fine when saying nothing at all if I wasn't I Would have never signed a non disclosure I'm not stupid [noise] um and if I was going to do that I Would have asked for a lot more than a hundred and thirty thousand dollars once again I'm not stupid I just wanted to go away I didn't want it to affect my family or my young child\nAnd I had a pretty successful career I'd moved behind the camera was starting to be really known and respected as a director I directed the mainstream things music videos lived in small town in Texas was very happy with you know I'm doing air quotes\nNormal friends so this was the last thing that I Want it to come out\nBut then somehow it got leagues and Michael Cohen started running his mouth and then they wanted me to sign additional statements that were completely false I was fine was saying nothing but I didn't want to lie in the meantime the story was exploding everywhere and people were attacking the left and right and call me names and\nI just wanted to set the record straight and I just want it to be able to tell the my side of the stories of people to understand where I was coming from\nAnd at the same time all these other women were coming forward\nAnd I just felt one day that it was the right thing to do so I did it\nWhat do you want to happen to Michael Cohen\nUm I think we're about to find out on what is the December twelve\nHe was the kind of the orchestrate of this and the one who most importantly and if you read the book you'll understand what I'm saying he's the one that blew it you know I was totally fine with saying nothing at all I was actually thrilled and then he's the one that's already happening he broke the nondisclosure ...\nStop he just continue to do so\nI think he's going to get what he deserves but on the other side of that I also am starting to have a little bit of admiration respect that he did finally come clean and I met the moment that I got the call I was actually overseas in Europe when I got the call that he admitted that\nI was telling the truth was a huge moment for me because I'm used to being called all kinds of named to have a pretty thick skin being\nIn the adult entertainment business you know but being called a liar was was really hard because I knew I was telling the truth\nWhen you make clear in this book that you were worried for your safety all along still are\nRight that was my other reasons for signing the nondisclosure which we all knew it was kind of a crappy deal I'm was because there would be a record and so I figure it's nothing really happened to me because there are people who knew about this nondisclosure now my fear lives mostly with just sort of\nCrazy fans not you know directly related to the government or anything like that\nBut you've got body guards now\nI Do I have to they're awesome\n[laughter] but what is that what does that like I mean to to now be in a situation where you've got to have bodyguards all the time because of coming forward with your story\nIt was very overwhelming at first you know I was used to being able to travel alone I was used to be able to go to the bathroom alone [laughter] that's gone but over the last several months you know I have adapted I've gotten used to it and we become friends and it's just the way that it is [noise]\nYou describe in this book when you first met President Trump in Lake Tahoe back in July of two thousand six and you\nSay your first impression of him was that he was run of the mill insecure which I find happens a lot with people with money that they didn't earn themselves they're harbored this inner self esteem problem that they try to mask by over compensating\nAs you've been thinking back about that moment and as you've seen him as we all have over the last couple of years\nUm as it shaped the way that you perceive to him at the beginning at all\nNo not not much I still stand by that feeling you know ask anyone I'm not personally nominate checks but I have a lot of friends and his business that that's what they do or that's part of their job and they will tell you that their\nBiggest paying and most unusual clients are CEOs and presidents have company is and people at high power um and then the other thing about that is that people who grow up very\nPrivileged and spoiled for lack of a better word lack of social skills because no one's ever told them now\nAnd I think that was pretty obvious and still holds true today how would you describe him today\n[noise] I don't know I Would have to I mean I haven't talked to him and twelve years I think that he is a different person um at least the night I hung out with him he can make complete sentences\nOr there's a report on the wall Street Journal this week that alleges that Trump personally directed an effort earlier this year to stop you from publicly describing your alleged affair within ... how do you respond to that\nI found out about that the same time you did I think it was yesterday just reading news on line it's the first time I've heard of that honestly and it doesn't it doesn't surprise me that it happened it just surprises me that I'm just not finding out about it\nThat actually brings me to another question which is how how much do you have to pay attention to the news that where you are you reading the news a lot more than you used to\nUh actually the exact opposite from around the ... ... for like the first couple of months I was obsessed with reading everything and I can't tell you the last time I actually had a TV on in my hotel room it just adds unnecessary stress and it's the same thing over and over and over\nNot following politics closely\nWas in the news stories and specially staying away from anything about me\nWhere you're coming out with this book just a month before the midterm elections do you want this to influence the way that people vote\nThat was not my intention at all that was literally how fast can get done how fast can get print that how fast can this happen it was not a strategy at least not on my part maybe the publisher is smarter than I thought but I don't think so I don't think it was actually part of a master plan\nWhat do you what happened in the mid term elections or do you do have a view on that\nYou know I Do I think that it's going to be very interesting like I said I've watched everything ... I don't want to jinx anything so I'm just going to wait and see\nOkay I Want to ask you about one more thing or that's in the news right now which is that President Trump has been talking at these rallies about Brecht cabin on Christine Blasey Ford and her testimony and he just a at a campaign rally mocked Christian ...\nAnd Jefferson street cafe the latest addition to the bongo family paying tribute to the historic neighborhood near Fisk and Tennessee State universities Jefferson street cafes between a coffee bar food and baked goods more information out Jay Street dot cafe [noise]\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

so long since we've talked to you I Know I like ever since the last time we spoke and or at least since the last time I've been to this NPR studio they've completely redone it oh wow I suddenly are\nOkay but the music will still be incredible because it's coming from you this is the first one polo and pan to French DJ [noise] this is their song [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nSo they're saying they're sweet them why should they just see on which is following me under the ocean I can tell us about this one [noise] you know this album care about bipolar on and it came out last year but then it got re released this year in the states with five additional tracks and that's when it sort of came on my radar\nUm it's got a very tropical kind of feel that route the album\nUm and I know we're in the fall now but it's been a while since I spoke to you so I just want to catch everybody I'm er I'm classic ... this this is the sound of the summer I um it'll you still use it next summer too but\nWhen I'm screening albums to looking for stuff to play on my show if I can find [noise] three or four songs on an album\nI'm really happy and that's what I consider that to be a good album or this care about album though has Seventeen tracks and I think I've played something like fourteen of I'm On my show already\nSo basically like every every track on this album is great and that is like an unheard ratio for for my show to be\nInto that many of the songs but there's so many different looks I mean they have they have like some songs inspired by Brazilians some but there's some daytime disco there's some club ready house cut some ambient songs that kind of run the whole gamut and what would you say is the genre overall\nI Would say sort of like tropical electronic I mean I Would say this you know they've definitely got an ear for a pop\n'em but it definitely is more electronic driven and or if I were to Johnny comparisons between other bans I Would say it's sort of like disclosure meat school side\nOh I like that and that's great we had to a site on the show actually they're great um yeah let's listen to the next one you brought up this is the Swedish group ... boys are this is called sports [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nYou tell us what's going on here\nYou know what I Am not completely going on but I've seen a couple of different interpretations of this particular\nSong and some people they're saying it's a commentary on male hyper\nMasculinity um when I first heard it I just thought it was a really goofy fun track 'em and it's one of those songs like it it reminds me when I was little kid I wasn't allowed to watch Miami Vice before I went to sleep 'cause it would give me a way to fire up before bed and this song so that has the same effect\nOn me every time I hear it and obviously\nPlenty would you say it's like a good lesson to do you like to listen to\nThis song is an unbelievably find lists I yes I mean like it is or after the after you get through the hook the first time you'll be you'll be chanting the hook on your own the second time it comes around and every other time\nAs the song moves on to become the belief singers fashion Murphy becomes more and more on him um and sold it via your face or just a blob puddle [laughter] um well people people can\nGo on our website and listen to the entire thing out here now I Hope they I really hope they do okay\nOr the next one is from Ireland uh this is mavericks saber who just released this new songs drifting period at which\n\n\n[noise]\n\nI liked that a lot of beautiful voice [noise] absolutely I mean it's such an an orthodox delivery to and I think that's the first thing that really caught my attention with this song or the beat is really simple really funky but more than that it's just sort of the way he sounds on it was just kind of other worldly who is maverick saber\nHe's an Irish R. and B. singer I'm I guess he's been releasing record since two thousand eleven I Know a lot of people had been fans with him for a while I just sort of caught on to him with Tucson drafting\nA but he's also on the label of Georgia Smith who was sort of a an up and coming R. and B. singer from the u._k. and he's appeared on one of the Georgia Smith a peas the project eleven ... and I think that's where a lot of people may be heard maverick saber for the first time\nOkay ah the next one that you brought us is Wolverine\nA this is from Diana Gordon [noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nWhat do we know about this one Diana Gordon just released her first ET as a solo artist but she's been around the music industry for a while and she was written for Mary J ... she had three songs on beyond says lemonade album\nIncluding sorry daddy lessons and don't hurt yourself and she had a previous career as an ATM singer under the name winter Gordon but I feel like this is\nThis is Diana Gordon kind of doing her own thing sort of sort of a reinvention of Diana Gordon I guess but clearly multi talented person yeah I mean she she definitely knows\nI mean sometimes when the singers things you can sort of feel their heart and soul and sweat if experience in their voice and to me this is one of those instances\nUm she's just sort of recalling her upbringing and sort of you know it's also very aspirational at the same time\nThe last one that you have brought us is albatross this is from Westerman\nRecords that India is the way they or ... years [noise] but those are the\nYou risk jak there\nWhich we know about this one so albatross is the first single from west demands forthcoming ...\nAnd uh it is a solo artist named will Westerman a so he performs under his surname and he's been kind of just releasing tracks for the past year or so I think he's put out to eat peas and this is the first single and the forthcoming E. pi\nAnd he's had a longstanding partnership with the producer movie and he
