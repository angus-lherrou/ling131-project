like I'm Out in young I'm Jeremy ... it's here and now secretary of state Mike Pompeo said this morning that he wants to give the Saudis more time to finish investigating the disappearance of Saturday journalist Jamal ... before the United states decides how to respond\nTo get support for all their number two we have long since Nineteen thirty two old along strategic relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia that continue to be important counterterrorism partner\nOr they have custody of the two holy sites are there and important strategic alliance of the United states so we need to be mindful of that as well\nThe United states also has important economic ties to Saudi Arabia and joining us now to talk about that as Robin far as that host of the podcast full disclosure Robin let's start with oil how much oil does the U.S import from Saudi Arabia\nBut that's about Thirteen billion dollars of imported Saudi oil and that's a now about four percent of the dollar amount consumed it's actually not that much when you consider all of the developments in the U.S shale patch this game has completely changed over ten years\nAnd what about us government bonds we've been hearing in recent days that the Saudis own a lot there one of the biggest foreign buyers of us treasuries\nYeah look it was last clocked at a hundred and sixty five billion dollars of US government debt this summer which sounds like a lot but then you look at the likes of China and Japan which have more than a trillion dollars each\nThese are the two biggest foreign holders of U.S government's securities they could if they wanted kind of pulled us hostage on that but it cuts both ways the Saudis\nThey really can't do it a oil shipments our dollar denominated for the most part they need a stable dollar they are very threatened by too strong a dollar so it's a situation where you really have to put it in perspective\nAnother important part of the relationship that has come up is arms or the president of the United states has mentioned that the Saudis by billions of dollars of arms from the U.S he says a hundred and ten billion that number is disputed but then we heard this\nFrom a a fan of President Trump's evangelist Pat Robertson who spoke earlier this week on the seven hundred club\nWhen an arm of the everybody on a piece of this like one of the honor Nineteen billion dollars is huge and they normally are a lot of jobs and I don't think a lot of money coming to our coffers and um it's not something you don't want to blow up willy nilly\nSo Pat Robertson they're telling President Trump maybe not to go too tough on the Saudis if it is found that they have something to do with a ... death\nSaudi Arabia still counts for less than one percent of the United states international trade through this summer and when you look at arm's you see that hundred billion dollar figure bandied about it's actually three point two billion dollars of defense exports I think the president and the secretary of state to kind of want to secure this great relationship and that\nTrump went to Riyadh he posted the Saudi prince here and he had these enormous sales and that stuff that he could

power could be out for weeks and we're learning how far inland the storm reached some of the Tadic\nRodney and Jason is emergency management director in Jackson County Florida he's in Mariana where there was three deaths\nAnd Rodney at you in our north inland from the Gulf Coast what happened where you are\nRight we we took a direct hit it with any of those who was ... and a cat three little cat for which is somewhat unusual for inland hurricanes but this is becoming the norm although a lot of places and people realized that this stole it does affect people that deep\nAnd when you got stole all of this magnitude living as fast as it did it held together a lot better yeah and that's why we got such an impact\nWell and the impact included you stand your home was\nDamage in pretty much it it it is destroyed the the structure stood the house basically over pressurized and blue part I'm a roof often we're hoping to get some some adjusted on it today\nYeah well I'm Sorry to hear about that but we know you're you're in good company they're just give us a thumbnail of what Mariana looks and feels like\nIt does look like a you know I have a I spent Twenty one years in the military and if it's the damage is it just off the scales bat and buildings down almost every tree has been affected snapped off halfway up and it's a landscape I've never seen people coming back that have used to live here and come back so they don't recognize a town well\nThe county appraiser Carlin the cocktail the Tampa Bay to be in that she's guessing that Ninety percent Ninety percent of the homes and businesses in the whole county ... county were down and she's using tax rules an aerial pictures is that you sent\nA sense that we ... we had a crew go out and take a look and they gave us estimation that approximately five hundred and eighty two structures that they were able to look at were\nSeverely damaged four hundred plus ... completely destroy so you're looking at a thousand structures have been just damaged or destroyed\nSomeone with Gulf Power spokesperson said this isn't to restore that had to rebuild the entire electrical grid and we understand is a patchwork of city and a cooperative utilities\nAnd then after big storms in two thousand five and six utilities were told to do more to be turning improve the power lines me you know maybe I'm put some of them underground to prepare for these storms do you think there was a failure to do that or do you think anything could has been done\nRight I can say personally and professionally that the power companies did everything they could do\nI can tell you on a critically but they do an unbelievably awesome and difficult job\nAnd they have had very aggressive programs to bring back those trees to upgrade the grid and I see people putting power lines underground and yes that is is a good idea but it also causes his own unique issues when you do that but no the power companies have been I mean I can tell you have done it absolutely awesome job upgrading thing\nWhat are some of the issues because I I think we heard in one report that horizon is out in one area but it's because they're underground cables were affected\nAnd that's happened because people don't realize fiber does run the twin towers and our biggest problem with that was that the towers stood the cables stood it's just they were so much to breed them they could not get back to ensure the propane tanks refill for the generator so the generators stopped so they were not transmitting\nNow you've got the personal here but also the professional what do you think should happen a measure to improve communications among the utility companies and another to fund a study on storm response failed in the state legislature and twenty Seventeen\nDo you think the state needs to get back to you know some form of high level or the emergency convening on what to do going forward\nWe're looking at an infrastructure in this country that is fifty some of it's a hundred years old we need to take a very hard and fast look at all are critical infrastructure issue we've got to do to fix it\nLike asking Romney just briefly um does there have to be more of an acknowledgement that that something is happening because of climate change\nI I don't know if it is so much climate change is it is is just a natural process that occurs over the years\nYou don't think this is I mean you're looking at an hour inland from the coast right in a town wiped out and you know every scientist worth their mental saying that and this is a direct result of warming waters\nAnd and I'm I'm sure there might be some issues with that but I'll be honest with me at my level it's not a question of climate change is a question of changing the climate\nI can almost guarantee this will change the climate among community and editor in this area\nWell uh Rodney ... and they're in Jackson County in Mariana Florida we wish you the best case I get very much Mm

Chamber Players [noise]\n[noise]\nVery familiar tune that this was actually made famous by the Nineteen fifty five movie the lady killer is about a group of these that rent an apartment from a widow in London and they say they're a string quartet that just want to use the room to practice or this is a song that they play I've heard this and a lot of movies since that tell us about it\nIf anybody's ever said they haven't heard anything of Luigi ... and they have in the day for his peace and in our time it became famous in the Nineteen fifties in that film but I understand it in the late Nineteen century\n... there were arrangements that were made this piece went viral and it's time you could say there were range means for\nA mandolin for piano for saxophone for ... choir with Latin text added\nSo is this piece has been popular well before Nineteen fifty five and the fun thing about the lady killer as soon as they use in the film\nThis was a word that's written for a string quartet to find Lynn's viola cello was an additional cello\nNo there's a joke about the film it's either an error in the film or it's an additional joking that these crooks posed as a string queen tech with an additional viola and not with a cello so somebody should've been onto this these guys are walking around without a second child has\nYou know the other film that it's in one of my favorites is Ferris wheel or stay off this is what they play when they go into the fancy restaurant in Chicago and try to get in [laughter] whether or not supposed to be but it's it's\nBeen in a lot

McFerrin is being Bobby ... and ...\nFor our time if you like this piece you should know that Luigi ... wrote over a hundred string quintet this is one simple minuet from one quintet so there's a lot more there to explore\nHe was writing these for the younger brother of the Spanish king dome release and while he was doing it he was writing string quartets for royalty and playing the additional cello himself so he was doing this too that he could play along with them and then he would also right\nString quintet sport depression king who was a cellist so he had a lot of opportunities to write to stream queen tests and string quartets in addition to other cheaper music\nWhat do we know about what influenced book or any who influenced him\nWhen he was a cellist early on he learned the cello he also learn singing his father was a double bass player\nHe and his father were playing in orchestras and he ... he said he couldn't make a living just by being a cello virtuoso they had to compose music so he began to compose music\nAnd he ends up getting very wealthy patrons who demand a certain kind of music and that seemed to influence his writing chamber music rather than say a president at the time\nWell let's get to another from ... and this is the cello concerto in gene major performed by the Canadian ... orchestra and honor bills ... on the chosen dusted by Jean\nWhat you're going to ... or something you have to admire\nThis it's it's a lot of playing and then the can sure does there's a lot of virtue wash declining as well and I think those two things sort of defined book Corrine in many ways he was a virtuoso and wrote\nParts for a cellist in his country or does and he's also known for having been gifted in writing melodies kind of wonder if he if he would've ever written

has her eyes on the sky once again today she is launching a new initiative called look up for one day today genocide wants people to upload photos of the sky and record their reactions to what they see me jealous and joins us now to talk about a welcome to hear now thank you\nSo you're asking people to download this app sky fee and upload photos tax videos audio recordings of themselves experiencing a the night sky what are you hoping that will do\nWhat we're asking them to share what happened when they look up at the sky daytime are nighttime for twenty four hours around the globe\nYou know just the simple act of connecting through looking up going outside looking up\nWill help us to understand maybe a little bit more about each other so just a tiny bit more connected around the planet so you know some people will look up at the sky and they will fill love they'll fill whole fill fill some people may feel afraid they may feel wonder are expensive and how they express that\nIs what we want to capture and we want to have a shared with people in real time so it's not just you're going to\nTake these photos and you've got to put them up we're going to display them to the world in real time on a digital globe that people can spin and they can look at they can expand they can go to different folks around the world so I can no\nIn Houston, Texas what someone is thinking in New Zealand\n[noise] so I I have to say I love looking up at the night sky and in fact in the last couple of Marjah guy period yeah nice guy right in a nice guy well but but in the sky period and and in the last uh you know a couple of months we've been able to see for planets or every single night to Mars Saturn Jupiter and I'm Venus\nAnd I've I've taken great pride and telling people about that but the other feeling that I often have when I look up because I live in a city is disappointment that I can see more because of there's the light pollution\nBut what I I guess the thing is what do you see and and I and really it's the idea of for one day why don't we stop looking down because so many times when we walk around the world we're not looking out we're not connected we're looking\nOur feet let's start looking up and be more expensive if we're in a city and we have light pollution at night we're still seeing something we're still seeing the buildings were saying what people are where even seen our impact\nOn this planet and so we want to know what you what that makes you feel you know what we're trying to do and I know a because I'm an astronaut people think we're always talking about stars but it's really about our planet when I was up in space\nI saw the earth when it was day and I saw the earth when it was night and each time there's this censure marine layer of light that is our atmosphere it's this planet that warms us in cools us and enveloped with all we need\nWhat we have to do is recognize that our home is on this planet and then while we are connected to the greater universe which I very much felt I felt like I Belong to this universe I also belong to this planet\nAnd we have to figure out how to share it we have to figure out that we're earthlings\nWill so it sounds like the the words you're not using here but you're implying is you want people to pay attention to climate change\n[noise] well I Want people to pay attention to climate change pollution but to war because here's the thing\nToday we have these incredible technologies to address so many problems we have so much knowledge but we don't use them\nAt least effectively because I don't think that we really see ourselves is connected that we really don't see that what I Do\nIn my country in my backyard has any impact on this planet so yes climate change but also a huge amount of plastic right the size of the state of Texas in the Indian Ocean the fact that we have enough energy\nAnd we grow enough food to feed everyone on this planet yet we waste it and at the same time whenever there's a hurricane when there's a disaster\nWe really care about each other but that carried only happens\nWhen we're come face to face that I can see someone simultaneously on the other side of the earth and so we want to do this in a fashion where people have an opportunity to look up to the sky something that's common to all of us look up and just say what do you feel when that happens\nI think a lot of a human about astronauts like you think that you have a different view of space because you've been there but what I'm getting from you know as you also have a ... view of earth that's the only a handful of people have [noise] no I actually\nHave a view of earth that I think we all can have that view of earth is what happened when I was a little kid when I used to look up\nAnd and imagine that some child on the other side of the earth was looking at the same thing I was looking at and I wonder what this was like and so it felt really really comfortable it felt really good to me to know that we were connected that way\nWe were calling the ... that we have that's completely afraid we're calling it a ... ... is a sky selfie and that sort of like our connection between the sky you know humanity and the universe all in one\nOkay well we have you and and again people can go to our website here now dot org and learn more about what what you want them to do in terms of this app sky fee but I just want to ask you a couple of questions why we have you because you were in space you're the principle of one hundred years starship project which seeks to enable interstellar human space flight by Twenty one twelve\nOr do you think that we're going to need to leave the earth and the next hundred years\nSo let's I Want to hear your starship is about making sure the capabilities for human interstellar flight exist with\nRadical innovation pushing our knowledge pushing the uh the technologies and our capabilities in terms of energy in terms of uh the governor has in terms of\nYou know human biology and health and using something that's really difficult like interstellar flight to do it but here's the thing we will not if we don't figure out how to live on this planet\nWe can forget about anything else and even if we're able to get five hundred people on Mars what five hundred people or we get a sense right right who gets to decide\nI Would rather us understand and make sure that we're keeping this planet well they're counting on a plan B now what's fascinating and what's incredible about space exploration is it has really changed fundamentally how we see ourselves we know so much more about our planet\nThrough being able to look back down at our planet from satellites we know more about the earth because we've been able to study Venus we've been able to study Mars and understand how planets form in what could happen to them yet at the same time the balance that we have\nIs taking that knowledge that we live on a planet we live on our own space ship\nAnd the only thing that's happening is we have to figure out as a crew how to live together that means that we don't foul our planet through\nPollution but we only do that if I understand that what I Do changes what happens to other people that we understand that we have to live on this planet in our behavior makes a difference\nThere are now are a number or a small number but a number of African American women who have\nGone into space but you'll always be the first ... what does that mean to you\nSo it it was really interesting to me because not only was the first African American woman but I was the first woman of color in the entire world to go up in the space and it's a little girl growing up on the Southside of Chicago there is no way that I Would have imagined that by the time I got old enough to go into space that I Would be the first anything\n[laughter] because I would've thought that we would have had lots and lots of other people going up\nBut being that being the the first one was covering the world is going to say what I realized that my responsibility is including other people\nBoth in yes being space explorers whether it's being
