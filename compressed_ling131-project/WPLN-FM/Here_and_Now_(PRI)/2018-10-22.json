I'm Peter O'Dowd I'm Jeremy Hobson it's here and now Saudi Arabia is going ahead with its glitzy investment for um tomorrow despite the absence of high profile speakers who pulled out and made the outcry over the death of Saudi journalist and us residents ...\nBecame them says he died in a fist fight and so I decided consulate in Istanbul on October the second\nMany people doubt that explanation Turkey's president ... are the ones who has details of what really happened will be revealed and a speech that he will make tomorrow joining us now is Jane Harman president of the Wilson Center and a former Democratic congressman from California\nGerman welcome back and you think the u._s. should consider new sanctions against Saudi Arabia over this\nI think condoning murder is something we should not stand for our foreign policy is based on values and interests and values that we have in this country a rule of law and a freedom of the press or both of which were violated in this case I Believe\nA an interest that we have are working with allies like Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia has been our ally\nAgainst things like a Iran's malign behavior in in the region and surely Iran has been engaged to proxy terror groups in malign behavior especially targeting Israel but also elsewhere I mean a Saudi Arabia claims that Iran is meddling in Yemen\nAnd Yemenis targeting Saudi Arabia and that's why Saudi Arabia is in Yemen but at any rate uh I don't see how a condoning what happened even though we have an incomplete a picture of what happened\nIs in the U.S interest and therefore I think that a sanctions against Saudi Arabia if we have proof that there was a murder here are appropriate but I also ah suggest that perhaps the thirty three year old crown prince\nA has a some some growing up maturing to do and that it might make sense from the Saudi point of view which is not something the U.S would dictate\nA to have a a you know some kind of a adult supervision are there are so that excesses in his behavior\nWould stop happening I think that would be in Saudi interest I think that the the war in in Yemen has created the the largest could see Manny ... humanitarian catastrophe that we currently she and I think that this episode especially if\nThere was a Saudi cover up and plot ah to to do this is a really shocking and in every sense\nBut do you think that the Trump Administration which has been watching the war in Yemen go on for years now and and hasn't put the pressure on the Saudis to uh stop it that this is going to change President Trump's relationship for example with the crown prince Mohammed bin ...\nI think the Trump Administration wants Saudi Arabia as a good ally in the middle east and also as a good trading partner I think those are two agendas that it has and ah I'm not at all\nTo step up and contribute a bit of money\nYeah yeah absolutely I actually joined the public community station in D.C and I realize this

pledge back here and now I'm\nThis is here and now over the weekend the Philadelphia Inquirer gave its reluctant endorsement to New Jersey is democratic Senator Bob Menendez than it does is facing a challenge from Republican newcomer Bob you get in\nThe paper writes that this was a dismal election with bad choices which brings us to our senator record this week Joe Hernandez has been covering this races report WHYY in Philadelphia Hi Joe\nA German so Sen Menendez trial for federal corruption ended in the midst trial last year he's been trying to change the subject ever since a at a recent campaign of and he told voters this election is not about me it's about you and our country has that been working out for him\nAh it's been a struggle for I think it will be fair to say she has been struggling to break into the lead in this race he is in the lead by um you know some recent public pools but it's been hard for him and that's surprising in New Jersey which is largely a\nAnd he has been trying to draw attention to the ethics issues associated with eminent as Syria's on Fox News earlier this month\nWe've been over four hundred campaign stops already event meeting with the Jersey the every location in our state they want change they're embarrassed by this guy you know he violated federal law abused the power of his office\nJob despite all of that are there have been some Democrats high profile Democrats who have been sticking by Menendez Hillary Clinton was just there for a fundraising event how would you describe the support that he has among Democrats nationally\nNationally he's getting some support from the party to Senate majority pac just dropped several million into the race to cement Menendez is lead and in New Jersey Democrats largely are standing with him um uh you know top leaders in the party here senator Cory Booker his colleague in the Senate\nThey're all standing by him and I should note that the his corruption trial ended in a mistrial so he was not found guilty by the jury he was however admonished by the Senate for ethics violations so when ... says he was guilty of violating federal law that's what he's referring to and\nWhat about Bob he he's a former executive at a biotech company that developed cancer drugs and he's been criticized for raising prices on one cancer drug here's Sen Menendez speaking to USA Today\nAnd at the end of the day is a question about\nWho's judgment you want sitting in the Senate fighting\nBob you can raise the price on cancer patients last year alone not once not mice with three times for those cancer patients politically need\nNow he has blamed insurance companies for some of the costs of the drugs that his former company makes he's called for changes in how drugs are priced but when you look at hue again as a candidate he's also pro choice he's pro marriage equality um tell us more about him\n[noise] well it's true that his company or the company is called ... and they're based in New Jersey they did raise the price of their blockbuster cancer drug revel in that they've doubled it in less than a decade you would say that\nMany patients are vast majority of patients didn't actually see that price increase when it came to their bills because it's got to go through insurance companies and all that but the price of the drug did go up\nCell gene has also you know uh settle a lawsuit from a whistle blower who said that the company was advertising drugs for causes that weren't approved by the FDA\nBut you're right that ... is trying to run a moderate Republican campaign he's pro choice\nHe he's been talking a lot about women and and the equity of pay for women but he is also tied to Donald Trump he spent a hundred thousand dollars on the campaign to elect Donald Trump he he went to the the Republican convention so\nYou know he doesn't have a record voting record for people or journalists to look at he's ... he's the first time a political candidate but he has supported Trump and the Republican Party in the past\nFrom the voters you're speaking with how much is Trump factor compared with Menendez is ethics issues\nYeah you would think a Trump was on the ballot this year because people keep keep talking about him it keeps coming up in my conversations with people\nBut so do Menendez has ethics issues and and for a lot of people they see you know ... tied to Trump and Menendez tied to his trial and they're trying to decide on the lesser of two evils that that is you know the calculus for many people in New Jersey this year\nIt's been a long time since New Jersey had a competitive Senate election\n[noise] yeah um you know it's been about forty years since the state elected a Republican to the Senate New Jersey is pretty pretty reliably democratic in that way I mean you know we had a Republican Governor Chris Christie for eight years\nNew Jersey is quite blue when you look at you know voter registration and things like that however these races do happen um you know New Jersey\nAnd and ... them for a long time Republican Congressman Frank will be on does retiring this year after decades in Congress so it does happen but it's surprising this race it's surprising how close it is because of ... support and the party and just as you know popularity previously\nThat is Joe Hernandez of W H where I was talking about the Senate election in New Jersey Joe thank you you got to\nKnow now that our next story might not be appropriate for all listeners it's estimated that hundreds of thousands of boxes of rape evidence or sitting on shelves police agencies across the country are waiting DNA testing DNA evidence can help identify sex offenders by matching their DNA with the federal database\nSome state legislatures are trying to reduce the backlog including Washington state but as Anna ... why rock of member station WBUR democracies and K. U. W. reports progress is for\nThe Washington state patrol the state's police agency estimates there are between eight thousand and ten thousand rape kits that haven't been tested\nEvery one of those represent survivor who's\nWeiss wasn't hurt who didn't have justice and also potentially very dangerous offender still on the street\nThat state representative Tina or wall a few years ago she sponsored a bill that passed the legislature it required that every kid be tested they didn't solve the problem now there is a bottleneck at the state crime lab\nRecently in Seattle and the city of Tom water two cases emerged of men who continued raping women as their DNA sat in the testing cue\nThat's increased the urgency to fix this problem we're looking at how other labs like in Ohio had been able to process them more quickly this year Ohio was able to nearly eliminate its backlog around fourteen thousand rape kit [noise]\nAt the crime lab in rural central Ohio the rooms are set up like a well equipped high school chemistry labs along narrow corner doors\nSo this again this is the biology lab during the laboratory supervisor Christians labor stands in front of the ruins glass window on the other side a scientist is testing a rape you can see the white box that's close to the window sill with the paper bags\nRape kits are smaller than a shoe box\nThey're filled with materials and Q tip like swabs of body fluids collected by a nurse after rape\nThat this lab robots help test those samples for DNA these are robots they have names like a B. I. Ninety seven hundred and tea can the robots do three times the work of one scientist their key to the labs efficiency\nSo is another word you might be unfamiliar with guys and sleeper explains that they basically\nDid a hack us on using a Japanese productivity philosophy called ... rape kit testing follow something like an assembly line and the idea was to examine each step to make it more efficient sleeper says it worked\nIt used to be that it could take a scientist a day an entire day to work a rape kit um and now it can take an hour two hours for them to open it do minimal screening take their notes and cut the samples into tubes and then move it along to the next step\nThe Ohio labs were essential and providing evidence from many sexual assault cases testing the catch helped uncover three hundred serial rapists and solve over one thousand crimes including the case of lives Garcia\nGarcia was raped at home in Cleveland in two thousand and four\nI was looking in the mirror I was like oh I did a really good job with my here this morning then I noticed that the door was opening so that's when I turned my attention to the door\nA stranger in a ski mask walk\n[noise] over a decade later that man is now in prison for life without parole DNA testing helped link came to the rights of Twenty one women\nGarcia says getting justice helped her move forward those kids sitting on shelves do nothing for us for us women in the process of our healing\nOr a small price to pay for the kind of value you get at National Public radio the number six one five seven six zero twenty ten W.

I Can't even remember a time before the smartphone existed\nAnd that's a time when social life is very important where teams are forming their identity when what really shapes and a lot of times is the time that they spend with their friends\nAnd how they spend time with their friends has fundamentally shifted to go on line social media and texting and away from hanging out with each other in person\nDo you see people in this generation who shunned this way of life\nWeb streaming is made possible by him capital advisors for Louis ... classic management new name and location get the same team of professionals providing financial planning a customize portfolio management too young and seasoned investors alike more at Nashville money manager dot com\nAnd it it is become it has become a normative to spend hours and hours a day on the phone to always respond to your friends taxed instantly to want to be the first to post the lights on Instagram poses so it's a real cultural norm that shifted\nAnother thing that is different about this generation we we've been hearing that the generations are becoming more diverse in this country but generations ear I Jim is actually even more diverse than the millennial generation\nYeah absolutely so they are the most diverse generation in American history\nAnd that's reflected in these big um surveys that I work with whether asked about um their experiences with um people from different backgrounds so say high school students of course because the high schools they go to a more diverse much more likely to um have friends of other races and ethnicities to hang out with people from different backgrounds\nThat's definitely more common among ige and then it was just say ten years ago with the millennials\nWe mentioned nine eleven how do you think U.S foreign policy has shaped this generation\nWell\nThat's hard to tell from the the data that we have because um you know foreign policy arguably it's changed the most in the last few years with the Trump Administration and we don't have that survey data yet\nBut the U.S has been at war for the entire lives of many of these people\n[noise] true um but because there's not a draft road that hasn't had a direct effect on the majority of the country\nHowever companies marketing to this generation in a different way than they have to the millennials for example\nYeah they they do have to market to this generation differently because there's this such that big a generational shift I think a lot of them are picking up on the same trends that show up in these big surveys such as\nI Jen is really interested in safety is not something you usually associate with teens and young adults but in our conversation and what they say in um you know they're in their attitudes and in their behaviors\nYou're very interested in physical safety and what they call emotional safety and I think that's something companies are starting to pick up on\nAnd um I think is well that there's a lot more awareness around stress and anxiety that um companies are realizing as another theme um with this group\nSo we're just a a couple of weeks away from the mid term elections do you think that many of these potential voters will actually vote Generation Z people\n[noise] I Wish I could say yes I'm\nBut statistics from past elections and what they say about their attitudes toward getting involved in politics and government in voting are not encouraging so in these big surveys Eighteen year olds are now less likely to say that they're interested in government or social issues\nOr politics Dan teams were say Twenty years ago why do you think so um well I think because there's so many other things to do\nThere's always the possibility of a\nYou know something new to see on I'm On social media or a new game to play or a new series to watch on Netflix and you know I think some ... I saw that in some of the interviews that I did a lot of teens you know say well you know we have all these other things to do while we pay attention to the news I only do that if I have to do that for a class was very common response that I heard ...\nInteresting I mean I've had some many conversations with people who are in this generation and I always find that yes they they are definitely\nPhones their mobile devices the Internet in general um but they're also often really smart I I'm quite impressed sometimes when I speak with them\nSo absolutely that definitely smart I mean they've they've had access to all of this information and um they're they're quick thinkers and there's actually data showing that IQ has has gone up over the generations tell I think ... is definitely not the issue\nSo obviously a generation Z is going to have to deal with some of these problems on their own as they get older and and and even right now what can those of us in the other generations due to to assist in any way with some of the problems of this generation\n[noise] well I think we do need to be aware I just how\nSevere um that mental health crisis has right now among teens and young adults\nSo there's a little awareness around that but not half as much as they as there should be\n[noise]\nThis is Ninety point three WPN Len Nashville public radio Ninety One point five W ... in Ninety One point seven W.

S. seeking asylum but it is happening right before the midterms what are the political implications\nFor the political implications are pretty big because this is the president's go to issue and he has really grasped onto the caravan he's even said that the caravan and Kavanaugh will be the two most important things about the midterms\nHe is not only said without evidence that they are criminals he's even said that there are terrorists uh he's repeated some of the a commentary on Fox News that they are members of ISIS or al ... somehow\nIn the group of people who are traveling to the border by the way they are about last time I checked there about three thousand miles from the U.S border but he's saying that Democrats are funding them so this is an issue that he thinks\nEnergize his base it's what he started out when he came to\nRape is this is his go to issue\nA lot of Republicans would prefer that he focused on the economy and the strength of the economy right now here is a President Trump speaking to reporters outside air force one on Saturday\nWe'll look it up again a very major tax cuts for middle income people to do that it'll be sometimes just prior I Would say that have ever have made your tax guy we are going to be putting in [noise] that are studying very deeply right now around the block a\nMajor attack for middle income people\nNow Mara Congress has not even in session a right now and November is coming right up ... what do you make of this\nHe's just making it up as he goes along there are no plans to put their congressman session as you said they can't vote on this\nBut he said it's going to be major it's going to be for middle income people why because the tax cuts that they already passed or not popular Republicans thought they'd ride these the tax cut bill to victory in November but people don't buy it but are in the polling Republican Party polling has shown that people think the tax cut when mostly to the rich but this is\nWhat President Trump does you know he used to call this truthful hyperbole and some of his books\nYou know he's talked about liberals rioting for sanctuary cities even talked about how the arms deal to Saudi Arabia he started out saying it would produce forty thousand jobs in America now he says it will produce a million jobs he said Democrats want to give luxury cars to illegal immigrants I mean he's just improvising\nThe kind of local journalism that we provide give us a call at six one five seven six zero twenty ten or you can go on line at W.

more than two hundred and Seventy Nigerian girls were abducted from their school in ... book in northern Nigeria the kidnapping provoked worldwide reaction including from first lady Michelle Obama who had this to say the following month\nLike millions of people across the globe my husband and I are outraged and heartbroken over the kidnapping of more than two hundred Nigerian girls from their school dormitory in the middle of the night\nBut then what happened to those girls some managed to escape right away Twenty one were released in October twenty sixteen and in May of twenty Seventeen eighty two more were released\nTheir stories told the new HBO documentary stolen daughters kidnapped by Boko Haram it airs on HBO tonight and joining us now is writer producer Karen Edwards welcome\nHigh and producer Sasha Achilles with us as Well hi Sasha I think he is so the girls that we first meet in your documentary of the ones who were released by Boko Haram and living in a compound apart from their families\nAnd their captivity was the one thing the government didn't want you to ask about wasn't it\nYeah it was a part of the condition of the access we hosted the kid the access with the government's consent it was the only way to do it\nBut they were adamant that we shouldn't speak to the bells of outlaws has happened to them during the three is that they were held by Boko Haram why am partly a\nI mean they was you know the government's his cane that they control the narrative but also we the girls were released in may we started filming with them in the government's safe house in early July\nSo it was they had only been out of captivity [noise] for about six weeks so it was quite well they um with still processing what had happened to them\nSo that was part of it it wasn't for us when counsellors to push them into reliving and telling his what had happened\nThat we tried to give them the ... in the space to if they wish to buddy clearly anytime we were alone with the goes the government minders and security shut them down quite quickly so to vote I think the government will say I wanted to manage how\nThe rest of the world on Nigeria see the ... time in captivity because they were held the three is this little ... down and they were really well\nWhat do we know about their time in captivity and what would what it was like\nWell they they um low they was free to speak to his ah they did give his diaries discreetly it and they kind of make it clear that life wasn't goods that they were forced to marry if not they would have the\nWell the coldest and the full bug her um treatment ... ah and in the film what we do is the uh the does that that you book goes who had taken would actually just the tip of the ice but there are thousands of delve in Nigeria have taken by Boko Haram who are free to speak\nCar um treatment is so through the testimony we get a sense of what happened to the book goes as well\nSo such a let me bring you in because ah you know the idea that they were forced to marry there's one girl in your film who was married had a kid ah with\nSomebody from Boko Haram and it's sort of difficult to tell the emotions that she's dealing with with this kid she's I still love love my son he's he's my baby but he's even though he's a Boko Haram baby\nYeah say what we were told by a lot of the goals that we interviewed who and all and the sound is that you kind of had two options in the forest either you marry a ... full you become a slave\nAnd if you're a slave then you know life is not taught us so it's a question of kind of survival and in a way even if you end up marrying a soldier or the golf felt like they you know we're rights\nAnd and we're supposed to be that why it say she as she says I was two months pregnant when I ran away and when we first met ... like see\nShe did tell us I don't love my baby as much as I Love the two little boys my baby of reminds me of what happened to me\nNow you mentioned the boys we we we see these two boys in the film who actually were kidnapped as well er and ended up being made into child soldiers\nYeah say one of the untold stories is the number of boys and men who have ... have been kidnapped or killed during this will\nSay well ... has been conducting children but I Will say oh the men and uh some of them are forced to pick up arms and fight\nAnd then when the military engaged with ... and they tried to take back territory they will kill and harassed or people who look like soldiers and so a lot of men have been killed in this fight in the process of trying to eradicate Boko Haram\nIt's kind of amazing watching how terrible the situation is and and as you report so many people have not been kidnapped but they're just flooded their towns out of fear of book around they're living in these tent camps um that this isn't getting more attention\nGlobally yeah is functioning I think all the focus is being on Syria and yet the famine in the north east of Nigeria\nIs just terrible it's a very widespread and high level and they all will running two towns in these that golden id Pete come a intently displaced people\nAnd that's why they have to run to his ... you know they don't just could not then the un and destroyed villages and it's just not safe to live up there anymore even though places like my degree which is kind of\nA one of the the main towns it's incredibly dangerous but also safety by numbers on whether the food aid is going to see how if you want food and he wants to live that's why you have to run\nAnd that their their outcomes but then a lot of the uh uh loves internally displaced people end up living within the community so despite the fact that the heights can die as some fair towards people who have escaped Boko Haram but they will sit and incredibly welcoming to the numbers displaced people\nWho have come to made a very well let's talk\nAbout that the the people who have managed to escape from captivity by Boko Haram they tried to go back into society and everybody thinks that they're somebody that they should be suspicious of\nYeah I mean I'm made a gory\nWe'll would say it that it's it's controlled it's militarized it's controlled ... Nigerian military and their constant infiltration of suicide bombers to come into the city so when we with that like the second to last night it happened to be the end of Ramadan that was six suicide attacks\nIn one night and you just never know who to trust because Boko Haram uses young mostly young women as suicide bombers they stopped them up and send them you know towards checkpoints where they manage to make it into bits of the city\nAnd say there is a lot of fear because unlike a kind of normal front line ... ... you just don't know why this is coming from and where and when I said as a lot of mistrust [noise]\nWhat about the girls who are now out of captivity and looking to the future and and try to have a hopeful future of the government is making it possible for some to attend college including some who managed to escape let's listen to one of them from your from\nI'm ... and has it changed my life now all of the nation ... he's All right ...\n\nDo you see a bright future for some of these girls yes\nI think ... so that your book girls who are are in a un American universities I dropped the American University in Nigeria which is ... older two girls who were released and negotiated full and uh the escaped goes who on the nights that to\nThe kidnapping happens so Jones in Seventy six were kidnapped fifty seven of them during the long journey on the back of trucks to some of these various kind of jumped off the back\nYes we are giving away a Amazon gift card valued in a thousand dollars to you know how much money if I did it by so many things in that and so we're doing that are also um there's trip to North Carolina\nI this is smoking and that's all right it's on the tennis ...\nWell but I'm worried about the Qatari go on the one that I Am dying force again you can call six twenty five seven six zero twenty ten WB I meant that Oric\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

the networks new experiment in advertising socks replaced most of the three to four minute commercial breaks in prime time with nine sixty second breaks in a pair of five and a half minute blocks of branded content\nHere's a promo for a block of branded content that ran after Family Guy to\nMore or less off after we're the only rarely do we have fought for skin they listen to ... take on prime time with a five minute we can't we can't say whether they\nThe Sunday Edition sponsored by Google visuals race\nHere now media analyst John Carroll joins us now and John that we just heard there that ad sounds like pretty much any commercial that I Would hear on TV so what what's going on with the ranking behind us\nRight that's an ad for an ad basically it's promo for a block of brands of content or the overall thinking here Fox believes and many people do that\nAudiences are allergic to advertising so they're trying to do two things they're trying to reduce the number of traditional spots and also trying to reform at some of the advertising into branded content which is marketing package as entertainment or new ...\nAll right let's take this first change Fox is calling it the nine ... nine second sixty seconds ... be nine sixty second breaks jazz pods jazz parts what's that mean\nThe jazz is just a and Z which means traditionally the first and last commercials in a regular commercial pilot so what they're doing is they're basically putting these in sixty second units which are actually a second year this has got a promo in there but they've got a countdown clock to make it a to ease the pain of watching it\nIs also the goal of this branded content because people don't like watching the ads that they're trying to ease the pain\nRight right so brand new content is really adds in sheep's clothing so last night for instance after Bob's Burgers there was a six minute block of brand new content there were these spooky vignettes sponsored by Skittles and M. and m's and ah and other Mars candy ... brands and and basically it's due to a website with more of that kind of content\nIt's OK Fox says the new format reduces commercial time in primetime by fifty percent but then when you start to add in that brand new content that you just talked about over all the marketing starts to float back up again so what's what's the financial model for this\nThe financial model is to charge more for the jazz pod so they could be double or triple the ...\nUh they're hoping that that will make up for the reduction in volume advertises like this they're not sure yet they have they they believe that having fewer ads on the air is worth something they're not sure how much it's worth so this is still pretty tentative right now\nOkay so traditional TV spots might be decreasing on Fox but advertising is not going away as if we ever really thought it would\nRise right as they say the sports broadcast you can't stop advertising you can only hope to contain\nJohn Carroll here and now media analyst thanks very much and I get so is Fox re thinks the future of advertising Americans are also rethinking their relationship with the automobile\nRide sharing and now car sharing have disrupted the taxi and rental car industries\nThey're also pushing some people to reconsider car ownership altogether and that is the goal of our next guest Sam ... is founder and CEO of a company called get around it allows you to rent your own personal car to other drivers\nAnd he joins us now from San Francisco for our latest installment of view from the top conversations with business leaders\nSam your company wants to build up a rental market for under utilized cars and that's because for most of us are cars just sit unused for most of the day in a parking lot\nYeah well I mean if you look at the dynamic for example here in the United states we have almost turned fifty million passenger vehicles and they sit around for pretty much twenty four hours a day\nAnd so get around really allows us to address this problem of car overpopulation by using their cars we already own source that are buying a car you can rent one from someone living nearby\nSo what's your goal I mean do you hope that someday there will that old cars will be shared\nYeah we fundamentally believe that that has to happen needs to happen and that you know where we are today with personal car ownership of the entire ecosystem needs to be disrupted and and that will move to a world where personal private ownership is actually no longer the majority but the minority and that every car will be assured car\nOkay so let's talk about the specific how get around works are right now it's available and what Seventy cities around the country correct you get an app you see what cars are around you and then what\nYeah so you ... you can look at the cars around you you can find that when you like the rent for anywhere from an hour or two you know multiple days you'd pick that car we run a real quick check instantly to make sure that you know your driver's license is valid and then instantly you have a car you locate it from the phone a lock the doors and try one\nAnd you can rent some pretty nice cars by the way\nYes you can you know you can get anything from a previous to a Tesla to a Porsche people share all sorts of ...\nWell let's talk about the competition because there is a lot of it there's a ... a which has one point seven million monthly active users car to go as something like eight hundred thousand there's your company and then there's the old man of the group Zipcar which has been around probably the longest do you think the markets too crowded\nNo we think this is a massive opportunity to disrupting a trillion dollar market which is car ownership and so the main competitor here is people buying cars the more you can shift people away from ownership towards access to more of this market gross for all players\n... well some of your competitors might also be something like ... or lift um Cox Automotive recently did a survey that said that those companies and sought customer's increase by Seventy seven percent since two thousand and Fifteen but car sharing only increased by Seventeen percent\nWhat what do you think about that I mean are people really that eager to rent their car from a stranger when they could just jumping to lift\nYeah so I don't know the methodology on the Koch study um I I certainly know what we've seen and it's been much much higher than Seventeen percent increase in businesses twenty Fifteen so you know I think that the way we think about that and what we hear from our customers use that people are looking at moving\nWeb streaming is made possible by the ... school of music and empty and install twenty Eighteen performance lineup between silhouette student ensemble faculty guests musicians symphonies or can't do performances and opera full schedule available at Blair dot Vanderbilt dot edu\nThere's two companies to offer a more complete shut out for solutions to the marketplace so you believe people really do want to live without a car I think if you offered them mobility and equivalent level as you get today from ownership that's absolutely true you know\nThis summer you got a big injection of cash three hundred million dollars from softbank the Japanese from what's your plan for the money\nIt's pretty straightforward I mean we plan to continue doubling down on expanding into new cities are both the United states and her nationally and then you know we've been very fortunate to partner or some some great companies like to remember so it was continue investing partnerships and expanding our or Russia or partners\nWell speaking of ... me neither company is also that are looking into self driving cars right so what kind of opportunity do you have if cars are driving themselves\nIs a great question and it's something that we've since day one and\nSort of very aware of in practice I taught him was cars a trove of to the idea of getting around which is if you're going to drive itself\nWould you really park at twenty two or twenty three hours a day you'd probably the other people use it and maybe you'd start with friends and family are colleagues but eventually strangers just makes sense\nSo we really see the rise of autonomy as it begins to become a more prevalent as something that makes our marketplace more fluid allows those carts be used by more people with different use cases and in fact as autonomy comes around it actually opened a lot more opportunity as to what can be done\nThrough a you know a marketplace I get around checking people or owners of vehicles with um you know companies and individuals that need access to\nI'm just thinking how that would work let's go Fifteen twenty fifty years down the road a ton of a Shia colds are here and they're here to stay [noise] would I just call a vehicle from somebody's parking space that isn't being used to have it come to me then drop it off and then they would go somewhere else\nYeah I think you can imagine that but I mean in the world were for fifty years out in the army as sort of a mainstream technology I think you think you're actually in a world where\nYou know the cars you know today is different the foreign factors of those cars have changed and you know fundamentally we're talking about a sort of a fluid network of cars that will be operating in around cities and outside of cities in suburban areas\nUm any of those cars might be self driving but they're fundamentally not you know self cleaning or self maintaining until there's a lot of infrastructure and sort of network functioned is required to sort of operate those vehicles and that's very close to even what we do today right we help owners",
