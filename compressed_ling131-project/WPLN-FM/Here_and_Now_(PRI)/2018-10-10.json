hour meteorologist Jeff Hoffman with the Florida public radio emergency network is with us now from Gainesville, Florida Jeff a hundred and fifty five miles an hour that's the same wind speed that we saw from Hurricane Maria when it hit Puerto Rico or as a category ... storm\nYeah and it's also the same Wednesday that was further now analyzed by Hurricane Andrew I'm that exact Wednesday and of course the scientists will go in and figure out to be a lot of forensics down on the storm Jeremy a we know now to historic storm never in our at least recorded history has been a storm the strong hitting the Florida Panhandle\nUh so yeah our hearts go out to those in the path of it right now and instill in the next twelve hours jam and we have a long way to go and many more residents further inland and portions of Florida and even Georgia that are going to experience some severe impacts from Michael\nWell what can you tell us about what Michael is doing right at this moment\nWell um we know that there's been ground truth already from the wind speeds we've had a lot of visuals of that\nAnd reports of that I'm I'm really concerned for our listeners who might be further inland and thought this was going to fall apart um it's coming across the Florida Panhandle in a pretty low terrain area and it's moving fast enough that we're still probably have some hurricane force

fourteen lives and injured twenty two including Julie ... who was shot twice after her co worker opened fire during an office Christmas Party\nSix months later we met pious at her home where she

keep renting\nWe've been following her recovery ever since pie as recently left San Bernardino for Flagstaff, Arizona to start over Julie pie as joins us to talk about it Julie it's great to talk to you again and why did you want to move to Flagstaff\nWell through the county I got a medical retirement my husband decided to retire and we just wanted a new start we needed\nA fresh a fresh start over ... ... because of what happened a couple of years ago yeah it was just really tough being there I became separated from the county when I got my ah medical retirement\nSo I'm On my own with medical and doing things and we just decided we wanted that kind of a smaller town a safer atmosphere and ah just quieter calmer life\nAnd what do you mean by your on your own with medical\nWell once I separated from the county and like I was required to resign um from my job and then once the resignation took place than I Am a responsible for all my medical care from here on wow and how is that working out financially [noise]\nUm well my husband has ... health insurance so for me personally it's it's okay for some of my co workers have had to do the same thing um you know they are paying for their own health insurance on their own now and it's a it's tougher\nSince we talked last I've had\nI think five surgeries and seven hospitalizations\nWith each hospitalization with each surgery I had to wait for the county to approve any kind of treatment\nAnd often times they would deny and that's really that's like a punch to the guy that takes the wind out of sales so I Would rather take care of my own rather than waiting for them to approve or deny treatment\nWe heard so many people and we have after every single tragedy like this politicians come out and say we're going to be with you all the victims will help you out do do you feel like you didn't get that help\nAbsolutely that's correct but our county was saying we were county family and that you know they'll take care of us were county family really what they want my my impression if they want to to sweep us away we were\n[noise] you know we were a stain on the county um even for that second anniversary they did nothing there was nothing they ...\nThere was no memorial there was no there was nothing\n[noise] now you have started taking classes in graphic design or you're fifty three right now yes and so I was doing a career change\n[noise] it's different it's something I really enjoy so we'll see how it goes it may or may not lead to anything it may just be something that I that I Do on my own that I enjoy it may not be a real real career change I met you might just enjoy this retirement and\nUh spending time with my family and walking my dog and exploring Flagstaff northern Arizona area how're you doing physically after all those surgeries\nI think I'm doing better now I'm and I'm having the opportunity to go bike riding now and do much more um activities mentally here it's much better because it's a whole new space it's a whole new start\nFrom our interview originally had interviewed a Gary ... who is a sergeant with the San Bernardino police\nAnd he got a hold of me and we've been doing law enforcement presentations with Gary throughout the United states so that's actually been very healing to be able to talk and to talk to law enforcement about what happened and to get their perspective and they like to hear from the\nFrom the victims and survivors point of view and you met because of our story yes well he actually heard me on the on that um interview\nAnd reached out to get a hold of me and then we connected and um since we've been excellent you know really really good friends in fact he just came through Flagstaff a couple of weeks ago we had lunch\nGroup [noise] and what do you tell people when you go around and talk about shootings\nSo we tell them our experience they want to know what they can do better and there's a few things that they learned each of us\nHad such a different perspective in that room I'm where I was shot one of my best friend she's the one who made one of the first nine one one calls my supervisor who's doing this also he was our our chief of our department and he\nGives his perspective from a supervisor position watching the entire thing but also feeling responsible for everyone in the room so each person sort of has their own net chip\nAs what they experienced and what was running through their mind and how law enforcement and really how they can improve their responses for the victims side [noise] I Know quite a few of my co workers all they solve with law enforcement they're boots\nAnd in their mind they thought this was the bad guys coming to shoot them and so you know the law enforcement hadn't really thought about that that just the shoes someone sing issues alone would make people assumed they were bad\n[noise] uh I recently met a I'm a teacher from Parkland high school in Florida who run into the building to help save people during the shooting and after I found that out about him\nI didn't know what to say to him for for several minutes I sat there and I I I just didn't even know Detroit thank him doing a great job or or whatever when people meet you and find out what you've been through\nWhat are those interactions like\nUsually they're surprised that I'm outwardly not more injured that they can't tell from looking at me with my clothes on and just walking around that I was shot twice I think they expect to see someone ...\nLooking more emotionally crippled if that makes sense so typically they're more shock that I went through that and I'm standing there looking kind of to normal to them\nIs it difficult for you to talk to them about what happened\nIt's not now I think a thanks to these presentations and I've done it's actually been really healthy to repeat the story and just said the story to become um\nMore\nMaybe I don't know natural or it's allowed me to remove myself a little bit from it I think it's actually it's been very healing for me\nThere have been so many other shootings since we last spoke ... have your views changed at all on or have you developed any idea about what could be done to stop this from happening\nNow I I it's so frustrating to me and\nIt just always seems that at the ease of obtaining weapons here but especially these the weapons like the air are Fifteen and\nThese weapons that are made to hunt human beings really that's what they're made for they're not made for going in sport shooting or hunting it's made for hunting humans\nAnd it's

PCC Hi Mary ... so let's start with the governor's race Jerry Brown is not able to run again because of term limits the race is between his lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom\nA Democrat and Republican businessman John Cox Scott you just moderated the first and possibly only debate this week on ... D let's listen to a little of what Gavin Newsom said first\nThe California Dream is predicated on social mobility\nThe richest and the poor state we have to mind that gap we have to address the issue of cost of housing we have to address the issue of affordability broadly we have to address the issue of homelessness and we have to tackle the vaccine issue of health care and the issues related to health care that are devouring the state budget\nAnd here's Republican John Cox\nI have a vision of this state being affordable unlivable for people or I think we can do that if we get rid of the special interest influence in Sacramento uh the interest groups that have habits Sacramento a benefit from the status quo\nThe status quo isn't working for average working California's they can't afford to live here and that's why they're leaving\nSounds like they both agreed that California is getting to be an affordable for a lot of people ah Scott knew some has a big lead in the polls just Cox have a chance well it's tough\nThe math is tough for him the last time a Republican won a statewide race in California two thousand six his name was Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd the Republicans have just seen their share of the electorate shrinking there now literally a third party in California Democrats are about forty four percent of the electorate\nA decline to state independent voters no party preference voters twenty seven percent in the GOP now down to about twenty five percent just a quarter of the electorate so in order for somebody like John Cox when you have to have a lot of appeal to independent voters in some conservative Democrats and so we just really haven't seen that yet in the polling I mean it's just a tough\nPlace California is for Republicans to win statewide\nIf new some wins a merry will be basically like another term for Jerry Brown or different\nYou know I'm Governor Brown has been very aggressive against many of President Trump's policies and these indicated he'd pick a similar approach especially on issues like immigration health care environmental issues I knew some support sanctuary cities for example he backs California to coming at zero carbon emissions state\nAnd but there are a couple of areas where he's indicated he'd be willing\nAnd one of those areas as early childhood and during the recession state funding for programs like in St toddler care and pre school was severely cut and those have not been restored under governor Jerry Brown use and has indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily there and we're seeing that issue reflected in TV ads that he's running as loud as\nWell as you mentioned Jerry Brown has gone up against President Trump but the the state has sued the Trump Administration more than a dozen times over everything from environmental issues to immigration President Trump slam California right back here he is earlier this year at an event touting his plan for a border wall\nSo I think of it is a ... job running the state of California and you know I have property in California I Will say I don't think too much about my property anymore but I have great property taxes are way way out of whack\nIt was such a move pretty soon and then if you don't have safety meaning if you don't have this kind of wrong the drugs are boring through in California than doing\nScott a there are several congressional races in California that are up for grabs this year how is President Trump playing in the state as voters or prepare to go to the polls next month\nWell in like a lot of blue states Jeremy a Donald Trump is not popular in California I mean Hillary Clinton got more than three million more votes than Donald Trump did and he's still way underwater last statewide poll showed him in about thirty percent approval rating maybe a little higher among likely voters\nSo uh I don't I'm not sure the Republicans who are running the incumbents running for reelection or the challengers or the newcomers running for open seats necessarily want Donald Trump out here\nUh their problem in these really close races is going to be appealing to independent voters and Donald Trump does not do well with them he is not going to be helpful to these Republican candidates are in persuading them to vote for for the Republican congressional races\nAnd Mary ... what are the issues that those independent voters are thinking about this is a state that at like the rest of the country right now has a pretty low unemployment rate if anything the problem is people can't find the workers that they need to fill the jobs it's not like that that that's a major issue but obviously affordability is big well what else\nI Ford ability homelessness here in the LA area we're dealing with a massive a homeless crisis that's an issue that we've seen play out in the governor's race and also in the congressional races\nAnd you know there are just as she is an affordability that I think a lot of these new party preference and others at which is what we call the unaffiliated voters here in California I care really deeply about\nUh let's talk about the Senate race in California that's going on long time Senator Dianne Feinstein is facing another Democrat\nBecause in California the top two vote getters face each other in the general election state senator Kevin daily own is the one facing Feinstein and Feinstein is weathering some criticism for her handling of the Kavanaugh hearings she's the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee here she is a during the hearings\nThis isn't a political battle for power as some that said this is a serious undertaking with serious allegations Scott ... ah\nMaybe [laughter] certainly she's been ahead and every poll she won every single county in California during in the June primary\nUh you know I think Kevin deli on just hasn't been her challenger the Democrat from LA just hasn't really gotten a lot of traction he doesn't have a lot of money the media are paying a lot of attention to this race Feinstein so far has refused to debate to give them sort of a platform to get some attention\nUh and and so it's it's really hard that said you know I haven't seen her above forty four forty six maybe forty seven percent of the polls\nSo uh and and and because there's two Democrats at the top of the ticket a lot of Republicans may skip this race\nI'm not sure it's going to help Feinstein because uh those are people who if they had to pick one of these two Democrats they would probably go with her she is more of a centrist than her opponent\nOr so it's possible certainly uh it's it's not entirely clear how this cabinet things playing for her I've heard women very strongly defending her that she was re spending Christine Ford and and you know so they're not critical but well you know I haven't seen Broadway\nBut one thing that one thing that we one thing that we have seen is that I'm In Saturday Night live has made fun of the fact that a lot of the people on both sides of the aisle during those Kavanaugh hearings were pretty old she's eighty five years old he's fifty one\nUh he's talked about that he's careful about it but he used to listen to him talking to us about the fact that he says he's going to have a new generation of leadership\nI think that uh she subscribes to country club rules are in a Washington that are ah grossly outdated and no longer apply to a to California and to the rest of the country\nMarry the age issue is that on voters' minds\nAnd you know I think it is first time especially for younger voters here in California\nAnd they land arguments are certainly resonating most with the progressive side of the Democratic party here you know if we re bind or rewind back to twenty sixteen\nBernie Sanders' presidential campaign had a very active group of supporters in California many of them are young people getting engaged in politics for the first time some of those folks are resonating more out and looking for a change in the Senate race\nBut as Scott mentioned at the polling indicates you know strong favorability for Feinstein ... watching as the head she seems to have a pretty substantial question right now but we're still you know little little over a little less than a month away\nRight and Scott there's one thing we haven't talked about that has come up in our conversations here in Southern California which is that there is a measure on the ballot to repeal a gas tax that may actually play a role in getting people out to the polls", "show_name": "Here and
