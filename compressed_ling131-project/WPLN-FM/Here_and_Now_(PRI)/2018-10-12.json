officials found new is made of bed sheets and a litany of other health concerns\nThe inspector general's office at the department of homeland security published a heart harsh report this week detailing problems inside the building a private company runs for immigration and Customs Enforcement of houses up to two thousand people waiting for their immigration cases to be decided\nJoining us now is ... she's a reporter for the Los Angeles times and she's been covering the story pull him a welcome thank you this was a shocking report to read inspectors found new is made of bed sheets in Fifteen cells how is that possible\nUh well that's a good question and you know I think that the reason that the office of inspector general issued this management alert\nSaying these sort of more issues that need it to be addressed immediately because you know a year ago\nA man killed himself at a detention center using bed sheets and there have been to other attempts also using a bed sheets so I think when the inspectors with the office of the inspector general walked through Adelanto on this a surprise inspection and found that\nThese nodded bed sheets were just hanging from from vents and so many cells I think that was a sense of urgency is needed to be addressed\nShould we imply then that that many people inside the facility worst suicidal or could they have been for some other reason making those choices\nYeah I I don't think so um you know people are told\nThe inspectors that they use them for various reasons they said that they would on for all the\nThe bed sheets to give themselves privacy that they would use them as sort of clothes lines but they were also told by one man that he had seen suicide attempts using these new says and that the guard sort of laughter them off and then call them suicide failure is when a\nWhen the attempts weren't successful so uh so now I don't think it was the case and every person's case but it's clear that that this has happened before and that officials were aware of that\nAnd it wasn't the only problem inside that building by any means what else did you find [noise]\nRight so the other things that the office of the inspector general highlighted that they found during this unannounced inspection in May of this year was\n... you know one of the big things and this has been an issue in Adelanto for years since it opened back in two thousand eleven was a question of untimely and inadequate medical care\nUm and then the other problem that they highlighted was improper and overly restrictive a use of segregation and and you know the thing about immigration detention is it's supposed to be\nWhat they call civil detention it's not criminal detention it's not supposed to be punitive and nature and so there are national standards that sort of govern how that's supposed to happen and so when you're using\nDisciplinary segregation in ways that are more punitive a that becomes a problem\nWhere we also learned that doctors stamp their names on patient records without ever seeing the detainees a dentist said that he didn't have time to do ... and the detainees could just use string from their socks to foster teeth I'm as what is the last day about what kind of medical care they're supposed to be receiving\nImmigration detention is governed by ah what are called his performance space national detention standards and that governs everything about medical care that detainees are supposed to receive and obviously this care is supposed to be timely you know it's supposed to be adequate for these detainees who\nI on the care that they're given inside these facilities and in Adelanto in several a government inspection reports over the years again since it opened in two thousand eleven the facility has failed to meet the standards of this is not the first time that that this has been an issue\nWe should point out that I Belong to is owned by a private company the GEO Group and it's it's very very common for the federal government to contract these detention centers out to private companies you mentioned they have a history of problems\nAnd gift featuring unique gifts for all

I Would say that it is it's it's it's pretty reliable in terms of what they leak to Turkish pro government media um there's just not strange communication strategy with this government hearing techie where they don't really speak directly to\nForeign media for example they and they actually have a ... kind of communications department but they do leak through the state media so I think what's happening at the moment teachers that\nThe Turkish government is maintaining a study more cautious approach except for example hockey has welcomed in Saudi officials here\nTo be part of a joint Saudi ... investigation or the Saudis have proposed\nThat is the tux playing nice and saying that we're going to we don't want to blow up on different my relationship at this stage about they all lead King I'm a incriminating evidence on a day to day basis and that forced tightening the screws on the Saudis and try and get the ... western backing for the position that question about that joint committee the Saudi\nTurkish investigation has to be how credible it can be if it includes the Saudi Government\nYeah and and I think it's sort of basically being compared to for example if Donald Trump was to set up a joint signed the crimes inquiry with the Russians I mean I I really think that they say is kind of um a a diplomatic nice city on the positives of the tax entertaining the Saudis on this but they are pretty clear that they have got the evidence to back up their espresso allegation\nAnd there is some more irony here as well the turkey is pushing a case that a journalist was murdered on its soil while at the same time the country is one of the world's biggest jailer of journalists or are people noting that at all the biggest\nJailer of journalists I mean yes it has been noted particularly by Chuck E. ... such as a spot and\nYou know that said at techies not treating journalists in the same way as they ... a journalist is alleged to be treated and that it's not even know murdering hey we're talking about\nUh how tech is locked up journalist which is obviously a also an attack on press freedom in completely unacceptable by in a ... attack on on on a liberal values but but uh yeah there is some distance do between the two cases I think\nHere in our country a mission that this case is threatening us Saudi relations which have been very very close over the years but from your perspective there and his stumble how much is this case threatening the diplomatic order any across the region well I think that turkey is very aware that it\nYou know the relation with Saudi Arabia is important it doesn't want to destroy that relationship at this stage bought a I think that you know clearly ... he's not going to sit back and simply accept what is in effect of ...\nIt it won't support from the U.S and from the western governments in and taking a tough line towards the towards the Saudis and speaking of diplomacy there's\nOne other breaking news story want to ask you about today a U.S pastor Andrew Brunson held in Turkey in prison in Turkey for two years has been released today by the Turkish government uh what are we learning about that\n[noise] yeah this is a country that produces more news than it can can see him ready and the American pasta Andrew Brunson he was detained in the ... the failed coup here in twenty sixteen accused of supporting terrorists groups\nOr he has family the American government is always have always had that's completely baseless and they put pressure on the tax to release him president Edwin has always maintained he could not to interfere with the independence of the tech is traditionally which is seen as laughable abide by critics of of tacky and what's happened today is that he has finally being released\nA he was sentenced to two or three years one month Fifteen day sentence which basically a corresponds to the time already spent in custody Andrew Brunson will finally be able to go back to the U.S and and uh it was the source of must've friction between the U.S in an ... governments\nThat sanctions tariffs and the plunging of attack his car and say that as well and I expected to east to some extent and it will be seen most likely as a diplomatic victory for the Trump Administration the BBC's mark low in Istanbul thank you so much pleasure\nNow back to the U.

more likely to get cancer Alzheimer's and die in a car crash\nAnd yet many of us just can't sleep even knowing that\nAnd students topped the list as homework sports clubs bravado many get just a few hours a night well now some schools are taking action Dr Charles ... is chief of the division of sleep in circadian disorders at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston they have a sleep matters initiative he\nAlso teaches asleep class at Harvard University and because of the successor that class Harvard now has a mandatory online sleep class for incoming freshmen and it's going to be extended to upper class and as well\n... is with us in Studio welcome thank you very much you were just telling us at Harvard was so pleased with what happened when the freshman students took this online course before coming in why would they pleased about what what happened that they want to know extend this online course to all the students\nWere they were pleased by first of all the response for more than Ninety percent of students took the course students were actually lining up to fill out the questionnaire about their positive responses to the screener emitter collision program\nWell what are you fighting against I mean anyone who's been in school knows that there is almost a you know leave to the last minute part of this where kids are working overnight but we understand that in some schools now including Harvard some other group study groups meet at ten or midnight\nOr one o'clock in the morning yeah ah and there's a course one of those popular courses or computer science courts that has actually hackers on where the students are scheduled to work all night because part of the corps and then they have their other responsibilities I mean\nThe football team has been getting up at four thirty in the morning to be lifting weights or just after five and then they may have another class that has a evening classes so the students are being pulled\nIn many different directions may cause problems shots are do let's say the clock in the morning or nine o'clock in the morning and that just is just shut up for the students staying up all\nThe extend this to all young people because not everyone goes to college and not everyone is staying up late in high school because they're finishing their science project they have phones and they have their social media that's keeping kids up\nAbsolutely in fact just a light the predominant wavelength that is driving that light that we're seeing on the screen using the blue part of the spectrum which tells the brain but it's daytime it's like the blue sky\nAnd that resets a circadian rhythms and and it makes it actually more difficult for us to fall asleep\nAnd it does so it kind of an insidious manner because the internal clock auctions the strongest strive for waking just before what would be ... so during evolution a we couldn't see during the night time\nAre waking signal so we would get our act together and being a safe place when it got dark and we couldn't see anything well that worked great at that time but now we have through artificial light exposure shifted our circadian rhythms by four or five times zones westward\nJust by the light that we get exposed to between dusk outside and when we decide to switch off so much\nWell this last week we talked about some of the health issues that arise just not sleeping enough we read Matthew Walker is terrific book why we sleep which is now in paperback we've seen the national geographic channel sleepless in America you're featured in there I mean not sleeping really can be fatal\nWell I mean you you talked about the motor vehicle crashes a nearly seven thousand people a year die in sleep related crashes on our nation's highways is responsible for one out of five car crash injuries and deaths\nWell any Matthew Walker his book you know he he lists the problems that can be causing including the car crashes but he also does a\nFun thing where he does a fake ad for a new miracle drug that will make you live longer enhance your memory make you more attractive because it keeps you slim protects you from cancer dementia\nAnd ward off cold and flu it lowers your risk of heart attack and stroke not to mention diabetes are you interested of course he'd sleep absolutely get sleep keeps you then keep sleep keeps you\nHold your leisure appetite I mean if you're not getting enough sleep for example when you get the flu shot you only have half the antibody response if you're sleeping let's say less than five hours a night or you have a three hundred percent increased risk over five year period of Cal suffocation of the coronary arteries which leads to heart attacks and other adverse outcomes\nAnd lay down right now in just prepare for the grim reaper but how do you can say this to students and it's part of the culture to see who can stay up the latest\nWell part of the programs are we caught sleep one on one very interactive program in which\nFor example there's a dorm room and the students can click on a coffee cup in the dorm room and find out that caffeine has a six to nine hour half life and many people are not aware of that then that they may take a cup of coffee after dinner and not realize that six hours later they still have half of that caffeine on board\nSo they get information I click on their sneakers and they find out that if they\nTake up on sleep they can improve their reaction time if they're on a sports team they'll shorten the turn time and swimming they can get more\nAll free throws in and one of the things that students don't realize is it is not just the amount of sleep but consistency in the timing of sleep so students have irregular schedules\nThere do as well academically and one of the reasons we think that underlies that is if you have an irregular schedule usually\nThe internal clock shifts you later so when we studied Harvard students we found\nThat those who have irregular schedules even if they got this same duration of sleep and inconsistent times they were shifted to California time even though they were studying here in Boston and that meant that if they have a eight or nine AM class that would be happening at five or six AM biological time on their internal clock so it's no wonder\nThat they don't do as well and those classes because when they take the test or where they're trying to pay attention it's the middle of the night\nWell so how do you change school life so that kids can sleep money maybe an obvious thing is not have a steady group but when am I right\nSo when I had been teaching a freshman seminar every year at the end of the term the Fifteen students in the summer has to make it had like talk in which they make a case for what they think could improve sleep healthy for example\nThat there should be an eleven our interval one student argued between the end of the last scheduled activity school sanctioned activity and the first\nAnother student or suggested that assignments be due to the clock in the evening rather than at nine o'clock in the morning\nSo looking you're working we're talking to you most specifically about students but you've got to sleep matters initiative from Brigham and Women's Hospital and you know there are specific groups of people who need help shift workers\nFirefighters who took his probably twenty four percent less likely to report in injury you have as many disability days I mean you can trace how life is just better from injuries to work output because of sleep and we'll post some of the sit here now doubt or\nThe thing I was excited about that is that a lot of people have given up on firefighters and said well they work twenty four forty eight hour shifts there's nothing you can do to help their sleep\nAnd we implemented a simple program of sleep health education and wellness for the firefighters took about an hour canoe in detail so we did a sleep disorder screening for example for ten minutes they fill out a few a validated questionnaires way identified if they are at high risk for sleep apnea\nOr chronic insomnia or other disorders in order for them to treatment turns out that one out of three men in one out of six women\nHave sleep apnea and that means that even if they set aside the time for sleep is you can't breathe in sleep at the same time you're not going to get the rest of that you need\nAnd when we first came to present to them\nThey made fun of the whole thing they brought pillows to the sessions or getting everybody say oh I got to have my sleep session and so on but then when we started showing them the information we feel that this is a it's a right for people to have this information to understand\nThat untreated sleep apnea for example after Eighteen years only fifty eight percent of them are still alive as opposed to Ninety four percent of their without sleep apnea because it increases the risk of cardiovascular death by four hundred and twenty percent and we've had\nAmazing feedback from people say oh my God this this changed my whole life by depression was resolved I didn't stay on medications anymore my marriage I came back together it can really

reported that the Syrian Army backed by Russian and Iranian allies was poised to mount an offensive to take a blood back which is expected to be a bloodbath\nBut Russia and turkey struck a factual

reporting trip and it live on the regime side ... line soldiers in foxhole pretty remarkable and Jeremy uh some of those deadlines for leaving are right about now so what did you see are the rebels

course have a stake in saying it's going well a ... up to now they appear to be moving and\nHappened is that if the if let's say it's a a Syrian group that rose up you know against the Assad regime during the Arab Spring before radical groups came in from elsewhere and you know kind of fill the vacuum there if it's the Syrians what happens when they start leaning that area aren't they going to be targeted\nThe estimate is being used by the un is Ninety thousand men who carry guns are into an all of that Fifteen to twenty thousand a boy you Michael die Haji hobbies I think that this ... this

stumbled across him but from your reporting it seemed like you want it around wondering where did these people go they either have become refugees in these and mostly empty towns or had been killed\nWhile I Wonder that retail muscle yet another and to tell us what what was happening to these guys and I had to conclude that probably most of them are over the border in Turkey the Turkish border isn't very far from it liberal and I think some will be dead and others will be inside the city itself\nAbuse or ... you know the way it was used by the regime in the last couple of years is that as they did a show old older to deal with rebels in different enclaves um to give up and they offered them a way out whether they would be passed up to his lip\nAnd that's why they why that's why there are so many guys up there yeah I Am in some cases that families as well um I think though that if you drive ... areas we did and we talked to a lot of people you to get an idea about the way that\nThe war to in the hot out of the country it has done so much not just physical but in terms of what it does to people's minds and also\nThe way that it's um it's just destroyed the fabric of everything if you're if you're in the central Damascus it looks like nothing ever happened but when you go out of Damascus and you go to places like the area rounded lipped than you can really see walked the war has done in terms of absolute devastation on disaster\nSo much think happens now because it's not just the Syrian diehard rebels who are being funneled into this\nA demilitarized zone and the Islamist militias along with them that have you know taken advantage of the situation there you have the courage who've been fighting the Assad regime as well the U.S back Kurd and now we have Turkey's president airline threatening to expand his country's military efforts in parts of northern Syria\nTo take on these us that Kurdish fighters look people anticipate that the Syrian forces backed by Russia and Iran will take back it lived there will be the end of the sort of the civil war\nBut you've got a you know U.S interests Iranian interest Russian interests a Turkish interests what do you anticipate happens now\nA century the dangers of all of that or is that some of these guys can stop bumping into each other in a bad way so Syria is not guaranteed peace once if you like
