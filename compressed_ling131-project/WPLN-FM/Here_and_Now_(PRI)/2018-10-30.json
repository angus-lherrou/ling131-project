G. of Ohio we've actually had him on the show before talking about the opioid crisis but a ... he apparently likes to pass out his wife's cookbook when he campaigns at state fairs tell us more about him\nOn some of those recipes are mighty good [laughter] anyway yeah Mike DeWine is pretty well known to people he has a big every year he has a big uh ice cream social down in his home town and a lot of people now and you know from that but he's he's very folksy\nMike DeWine was a former U.S senator he's also served at the state level he was a with our governor our former governor Voinovich a back in the nineties um and served with him or so but he has been\nVery staunch up against the Affordable CARE Act in fact on his first day in office he went in with some other states and\nFiled against a a\nFiled in a lawsuit against the Affordable CARE Act he comes out now he's saying you know I like this idea\nOf having protection for um you know these pre existing conditions but he still says there are problems with the Affordable CARE Act that need to be fixed\nAri let's listen to what they sound like a as they're debating um this this clip that we're going to play here they're talking about a measure on the ballot called issue one which would emphasize drug treatment over prison time here is the one who thinks it's too soft on criminals\nOr are you telling me that we're not going to let out ... it's my turn it out raising my children to get out it's my time you're going to get out shy proud of it was like\nOK here's Cordray getting a word and\nWe are the worst Steve in the nation the Trump Administration CDC report should we have the highest increase in November of last year and he stays in the nation All right so\nWhat we're doing right now is not working what am I for um for anything that will change what we're doing now\nExplain what's going on there obviously Ohio as we've talked about is a place with one of the worst uh situations when it comes to the opioid crisis\nIt sure is we're losing fourteen Ohioans a day or because of opioid abuse and and it's gotten out of hand\nAnd one of the things that we are that issue one that\nThey were both referring to speaks to is it would\nTake some of these low level drug crimes and take people who were uh you know sent to prison on those and it would you know allow them to come up and and make the case to get out but you know as Mike DeWine would say um you know the other side of it is people say well you know you can get the treatment but uh\nYou should be getting that treatment and also getting the punishment for doing crime this is just going to open the doors to more problems so\nThere is a real debate here on uh how you actually treat people who have these low level drug crimes and um how you get treatment for them\nIs that likely to be the opioid crisis is that likely to be the big issue for voters or order people what's on their minds\nWhat seems like the biggest thing on people's minds these days is health care um a lot of people are like the Affordable CARE Act and even like the wind would tell you that I'm even though he's been fighting against it um Ohio is one of the states that expanded Medicaid\nAnd because of that a lot of people who have opioid problems have been able to get treatment through it and um you know they all like preexisting conditions there trying to parse out where they stand on the Affordable CARE Act and where they keep all of it or would they only want to keep part of it\nWhat's the polling telling you\nWell at the beginning it seems like maybe Cordray was a little bit\nShows is that that it's you know very tight and we've got eight million voters or we do have in this election that can vote and um we do have some interest as far as early voting numbers they're up over where they were at the same point in twenty fourteen it does seem like there's a race here\nNow a governor's races are especially crucial this year because who gets elected in November will be in office when states redraw the district maps in twenty twenty and the governor could either approve or veto those maps is redistricting a big deal and Ohio\nIs a big deal it's always a big deal\nThat Ohioans have approved at that ballot box they've approved a new redistricting measures we don't know exactly how those are going to fly out we know the process certainly though we can be assured that whoever wins is going to have\nA a good good opportunity to get in there and help draw those lines and I have some effect on it\nHas joined goes who covers politics at Ohio public radio talking about the governor's race in Ohio Joe thank you thank you\nRepresentatives from the Indonesian airline lion hair have announced they'll meet with us plane manufacturer Boeing to discuss what caused a seven thirty seven ... a plane to crash into the sea early Monday morning the plane went down just minutes after taking off from the Indonesian capital of Jakarta\nInvestigators believe that all one hundred and eighty nine passengers were killed in the crash and it turns out there were concerns about whether the aircraft was safe to fly just one day before the crash joining us now says Kaplan from airline weekly Hi Seth\nFletcher and we know that shortly after takeoff the crew for this flight decided to turn around and return to the airport in Jakarta but then the plane suddenly lost altitude and disappeared from radar what do we know about what might have brought this plane down\nWell a lot of it has to do with what you just said which is information from the day before people are saying that the plane was essentially going a radical you doing things that we don't usually experience during flight my first thought was well you know what about whether what about turbulence but it sounds like\nSomething more than that something perhaps to do with air speed indicators and a very early you have to emphasize that right now but you\nKnow if that the played into this uh you know the pilots just not knowing exactly how quickly the aircraft was going you could have had a stall and this wouldn't be the first time that that has happened you're my mind goes to a\nA crash that some people might remember off the crush of the coast rather uh Brazil back in two thousand nine Air France flight for four seven yeah\nUh and and in that case you sort of had a confluence of a few different things a mechanical issues some bad weather pilots maybe not reacting properly but uh you know as much a cause of anything else was what are called the ... tubes a which measure help measure the air speed weren't functioning properly in the pilots\nUh you know didn't know that they were basically stalling the aircraft so are the very early indications are perhaps something like that based on what seems to have happened day before but I have to emphasize we don't know exactly what was happening on on that health related flight\nNow when you hear about a brand new airplane and this was a brand new are planted flown fewer than eight hundred hours before crashing on Monday a brand new airplane it sounds like a good thing but then you wonder you know maybe they haven't tested it out enough and and there may have been a problem that didn't come up yet and here we are\nAs it's so new I ... and and yeah you know legitimate to say that on the other hand you know we've all flown on on brand new airplanes and in fact you know this this max eight is is the newest kind and there are already hundreds around the world of flying\nIs here in the U.S airlines like Air Canada and west jet just north of the border and and you know of course this is also very rare for something like that so sure at this point you ... you could construct all kinds of ah you

S. and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham says he will introduce legislation that mirrors what the president wants to do\nJoining us now is Alan Gomez who covers immigration for USA Today Hi Alan archer and birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment which ah reads all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and of the state where in the reside\nSo how could President Trump or undo that by executive order\nTo very good question though um you know you just read the fourteenth amendment that was preceded by the civil rights act of Eighteen sixty six and both of those were affirmed in Eighteen Ninety eight but as the U.S Supreme Court\nWho to throw in one more quote wrote the fundamental principles citizenship by birth within the dominion was reaffirmed the most explicit and comprehensive terms\nSo it's a pretty high legal hurdle to to climb when something is in law in the U.S constitution and upheld by the U.S Supreme Court but um there have been some conservative I'm sort of anti immigration groups in recent years who have seized on the freezing you said so\nUm they're claiming that somebody who was an undocumented immigrant in this country is still a national of their home country they're claiming that people who come here um through birth tourism so a Chinese think of a Chinese national coming to the United states when they're pregnant\nGiving birth here just so that their child has US citizenship and then returning back to China they're claiming those kinds of cases um do not fall within the fourteenth amendment um but as we've heard from those from the amendment\nAnd from the Supreme Court it's very very high legal hurdle to climb\nWhen there are many who will look at this and say we're a week before the midterm elections and this is just a political move that he wants to excite his base even if he doesn't have any intention of actually doing this or he knows that it will go nowhere in the courts\nYeah the timing is incredible because it's not just this I mean you look at the fact that he has been hammering on the migrant caravan coming up through Mexico for weeks now I'm declaring it a national emergency and just this week that his administration announcing that they're going to send five thousand\nActive duty military troops down to the U.S border to stop them that's on top of already Twenty one hundred National Guards men that are down patrolling the border to stop what is now about thirty five hundred migrants um that are trying to make their way up\nI'm so there he's really seizing upon immigration I mean this is a strategy that worked for him obviously in twenty sixteen and when they're trying to combat what many are predicting will be this blue wave in this midterm election\nAnd Farm Bureau health plans of Tennessee when it comes to financial protection for healthcare costs no one can predict the future but everyone can prepare for it for plans for individual families or to supplement Medicare Farm Bureau health plans has got you covered\nAs a journalist it feels great to meet a deadline under pressure now you've helped Nashville public radio meet it\nSo to everyone who answered rock hall and gave to the station ...

six he served through booms and recessions he's now Ninety two we asked him about the recent volatility in the stock market\nWell I think it's basically the combination of not what the fed is doing

him whether the tax cuts it already had their impact on the economy or whether there was more to come\nThe impact has been really quite significant but it's already completed\nHe did say the impact of the tax cuts on the deficit is concerning and could lead to inflation we also talked with him about the economy more generally he writes about it in his new book capitalism in America a history which he co authored with Adrian ... rich I asked Alan Greenspan if there are two economies in America\nWho have more than two\nIt's more directly related\nTo a structure of economy for example the so

surge that this country experience from Nineteen Ninety eight to two thousand for it increasingly looks like a brief interruption of a much longer term decline rather than the dawn of a new era of tech driven growth why do you say that\nWell when you look out into the future all we're slowing down our rate of growth and productivity\nFlying well basically because fear you know when to deal with fear it is very difficult to classify\nBudget can you can look at the consequences of it on the consequence is basically a suppressed level of innovation and therefore of capital investment\nAnd to some of the nation to take risks in the book insulin I might add discussing what are the lowest the long term outlook is all about\nOh we say about the issue the aging of the population and its consequences on entitlements and so having a significant measure of deterioration over the long run the reason for that is what the data on a critically show\nIs that your title minutes which are mandated by law a gradually having an extra bleed\nNews and the economy dollar for dollar on so long as I've happens we have to borrow from abroad which is our current account deficit and uh we're now built up and a trillion dollar bet to foreigners\nBut what this is causing this\nIs largely the demographic issue the fact that the population is aging\nRight now the official actuaries of the Social Security system say in order to get our Social Security and retirement funds and balance they'd have to cut benefits by twenty five percent and definitely into the future\nTo do you think they should do that\n[laughter] first of all do I think it's going to happen\nI don't know but this is one of the reasons why inflation is the major problem out there\nSo long as you don't do it could cause the debt overall total government that go over a rise indefinitely and that is an unstable situation when\nYou say inflation ... it's a big problem out there and we've been talking about this for years that inflation is actually remain very low for the last many years\nBut that's correct and in fact it's been at the lowest in American history and that's all the more reason to be concerned about for example interest rates and fifth century bc Greece when not terribly different from wherever they are today\nSo the presumption is that interest rates will rise for no other reason that they're below the long term human nature to determine stability\nWhat do you say to people who say that you kept interest rates to low or during the dot com boom are All right afterwards and that that helped lead to what we saw back in two thousand eight\nReason we've kept rates low as you point employment rates so what's the fact that productivity was rising at a very rapid pace and the dot com boom was no moving through the economy the latter part of the nineties\nSo the reason we did move is that we didn't see that the signals were there and indeed the unemployment rate kept falling oh well below the usual expectation of like four percent\nBut with productivity rising as rapidly as it did it change the numbers and indeed uh the unemployment rate kept falling below four percent with no impact on inflation\nSo if does low interest rates were not a a a cause of the financial crisis in your view what was what do you think led to that in two thousand\nI think that what we specifically learnt strangely for the first time in two thousand and it is there a two conditions as quiet for a crisis\nWonder is there a toxic asset like a\nSecured ties to mortgages but the critical issue is how those mortgages financed and what they are financed by leverage that that's the dangerous signal\nYou see anything like that right now [noise] nope not in any area\nEither one of the general now that that was a very extraordinary period in court narrowed it it would have been wholly inappropriate for the Federal Reserve to keep breaks down during the period of very low unemployment that was what the period was there I\nShe recently who said that one of their concerns was that unemployment is so low right now I'm that they're going to be a lot of people who are hired\nFor jobs and paid more than they should be paid and they're not actually qualified because it's a job seekers market right now that that the people that want to hire are having a difficult time in many cases hiring people and that that it's going to lead to lower productivity and potentially inflation what do you think about that\nWell basically it's not lower productivity but it it's an issue when you get to sort of tight labor market wage rates begin to rise of necessity\nFor wage rate rises which affects the cost of production and hence induce corporations to start raising prices basically because their costs are going up\nThat's where the problem is that hasn't really been growing up\nI Want to ask you about one more big thing that you talked about in your book or an as the issue of creative destruction um first of all explain what that means\nMore creative destruction is a process by which people do two things they continuously unrest but the investment is displacing\nOlder clip but more importantly it engenders unemployment and uh\nIt's to process ... is a necessary condition for growth and standards of living\nYou have to let bad things happen in order for the overall picture to be better in the future\nWell because the very nature of progress economically this report in the book\nAnd ... offering a comprehensive selection wind spirits spears look at it in ... he was on ... road Sunday to

services are being held for a number of the victims of the shooting at the tree of life synagogue there were eleven in total\nJoyce Feinberg aged Seventy five Richard got fried was sixty five years old rose mowing gr Ninety seven Jerry Rubin a witch sixty six\nCecil Rosenthal was fifty nine years old David Rosenthal fifty for Bernice Simon was eighty four Sylvan Simon was eighty six Daniel Stein aged Seventy one Melvin wax\nEighty eight and are being younger was sixty nine they all spent time in the squirrel hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh which has been in the news because of this tragedy it's leafy streets and historic houses much of the population is Jewish\nBut it's also Mr Rogers actual neighborhood it's we're Fred Rogers lived when he was making a show a show we wish we had to help us through a week like this\nWere British ... is executive director with the Fred Rogers center she's with us\nFrom ... Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh that's where Rogers was born a he moved to grow hill when he got married uh Roberta thank you for joining us and you knew Fred Rogers what can you tell us first of all about his time in squirrel hill\nWell then this is really sad day in the neighborhood [laughter] um I Know that John I'm afraid enjoyed the community that diverse than the diversity in the community and scroll hill\nAnd um he loved walking down the streets and\nI'm noticing the trees and then the various temples and synagogues and churches um that all made him feel at home um that they grief that delicatessen [laughter] and he often commented that he could hear yet ... Hebrew and it doesn't have a language is spoken\nAnd walk down the street that community\nHe actually learn the Brittany pay get gas or do you think that part of the Mr Roger's neighborhood that we saw on television was based on scroll hill\n[noise] um\n[noise] the magic neighborhood I think I'm certainly had some of the philosophy of the squirrel hill neighborhood um you know I think that it was ... and ... make believe but I think what came through with the way people cared for one another\nWhich certainly I think with reflected to him is through the ... community and\nWhere he grew up during the time he made his show there were not mass shootings are in the news the way there are today but there was certainly violence\nOr we're reminded of Nineteen sixty eight after Robert Kennedy's assassination that word assassination came up in a special that Mr Rogers I did and the puppet Daniel tiger had this question for lady ...\nIs is that the nation me\n[noise]\nHas used that word a lot today\nAnd I didn't know what it meant\nMeans somebody getting killed in a\nSort of surprised way what happened you know stand killed that other men\nI Know and a lot of people are talking about it right now too many people are talking about a lot of people are scared about it you know [noise]\nI talk about some other day he like [noise]\nThat sound courtesy of the Fred Rogers company laid ... lady Evelyn goes on to change the subject to a picnic but Daniel tigers says he doesn't feel like a picnic a she says that's okay\nWhat do you think Fred Rogers talked kids about how to handle difficult emotions like the ones that I'm sure many are experiencing right now after what we just saw in Pittsburgh\n[noise] I think one of the things that he taught us all is that it's All right to have these feelings to be a fad and to feel angry and to be afraid and there's nothing wrong with those feelings but that it does help if we can talk to someone so for children the message was that\nA grown up there to listen and I think that the message to grim naps where\nIt's listening to the children is very important and letting them tell us what they understand about it and helping them\nTo learn to make sense of what they see and one of the things that Fred often said was that his mother always told him in times of crisis\nOr to look for the helpers and I think certainly in the Pittsburgh area of what we saw where all the helpers the the emergency response team the police officers the firefighters the ambulances the doctors the nurses and everyone um have surrounded this community with caring\nAnd that's one of the things I think we can help children recognize and identify with that they identify with\nThe helpers and not those who who uh cause destruction\nI've seen that line a lot on Twitter in the last couple of days looked for the helpers yes [noise] as part of that same special that aired in Nineteen sixty eight Fred Rogers actually address parent's directly about violence lets us and\nI've been terribly concerned\nAbout the graphic display of violence\nWhich the mass media has been showing recently\nAnd I played for your protection and support of your young children\nIs just so much that a very young child can take without it\nDo you think Fred Rogers would be telling parents um right now to do with their kids\nWell I think one of the things that it probably is helpful is for all of that is to find time and space to be together away from me ... where we can talk\nAnd share um are comforting of each other so I think that's an important thing but I think one of the messages that Fred Rogers gates was that we have to figure out how to make good mashed attractive [laughter]\nI think that um dwelling on on the final instead of course undermines that message\nStill looking for the helpers helps the see the good that is still around us Frank glad you said that we have one life to live on this earth and we can spend that time encouraging people to demean this life and be hateful or we can spend that time\nCreating a encouragement and spaces where children ... and others can use this life\nI'm In very meaningful and creative way [noise]\nThat were British ... what do you think Fred Rogers and you knew Fred Rogers before he died in two thousand three what do you think you would think of what happened in his neighborhood over the weekend\nWell I think she would be horrified by what happened in ... and he would he would be concerned about the children she would be concerned that they may be afraid and they may be angry and they may see the reaction to the adult\nAnd so it's important for us to help children learn the feelings on normal and manageable but find ways to talk about it and find ways to express their anger and find ways to express sadness I'm In ways that are not harmful to other people\nUm and I you know I think that they're comforting neighborhoods um I think he would also said we need to turn to our neighbors and\nNeighbor and the greatest sense of the world everyone who lives on this planet is a neighbor um and reach out and and to provide support\nTo our neighbors to people of all backgrounds from all faiths of all races I'm so that we can live together on this earth and very productive ways\nWhat's this been like for you living right they're outside of Pittsburgh\nUh it's um but it's been very hard I've been a meeting and talking with some of the teachers um in early childhood programs to make my own background to try to develop an early childhood and so I've been
