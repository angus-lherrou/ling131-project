right to the to more than one million people convicted of a felony\nIf it passes amendment for would restore voting rights to former felons upon completion of their sentence unless they were convicted

people have those opportunities they wouldn't be going back to prison and our community would be better for the\nWhite has already cast a ballot in favor of a madman for something that as a form of selling himself he can only do because he successfully petitioned the state to restore its voting rights he says it helped him feel like a part of society again\nWhen I was able to finally returning home and try to rebuild my life partner that wanting to be a part of the community couldn't happening I was able to vote\nIn twenty eleven governor Rick Scott rolled back reforms put in place by his predecessor Charlie Crist making it harder for a non violent felons to gain their rights back\nHis administration has also granted fewer felons clemency Scott has approved restoring voting rights to just over three thousand people compared with more than one hundred and fifty thousand under crust\nThat means today more than one point five million people in Florida more than ten percent of the adult population can't vote because of the past felony conviction Eddie Kane is one of them he's been out of prison since two thousand three Canaan remembers how it felt to go with his family to the polls on election day unable to cast a ballot\nI sat at a car that he hadn't even going to be able to feel deprived I felt ashamed of failed ignorant there was a real bad Philly a thing that I've I haven't even forgive him or suffer feeling like that\nCain says he wants to get his rights back but the process was intimidating and he knows it could take years\nAll of us deserve a chance to show that we can live decently we still live amongst other people so I made a commitment um not to go back to prison but I also want to make a commitment to be a productive member of society\nRichard Harris and the Tampa area lawyer says not all felons deserve that chance\nWe should not assume that all one point five million felons a and everybody shooting in Florida State prison system or have suddenly become good wonderful model ...\nHarrison the founder of Floridians for a sensible voting rights policy a group that is against amendment for he said there are a fair criticism is that the current process service during voting rights but getting what he calls blanket clemency where the constitutional amendment would be wrong and potentially dangerous\nClemency is not an entitlement it is not a right it is an act of mercy by the state of Florida\nAnd it ought to be decided on an individual case by case basis with due consideration for the seriousness of the crime the nature of any harm that was caused a in a whole lot of other factors that we think reasonable people would think would be important but\nSome law enforcement officials say the current system is making Florida less safe Leon county sheriff wall to make Neal agrees with Harris and that it's appropriate to take away some rights from violent criminals\nOr as relates to other things like ah you know a sexual batters who are those keeping them away from kids in the way from schools and and those kind of thing I Believe those are appropriate steps to take but just the a fundamental right to vote there is no proof that are taking their right to vote away\nDeters them from any other crime whatsoever\nMcNeil points to research from the states on parole commission that showed ... who's right to vote was automatically restored under Governor Crist were less likely to commit new crimes he says taking away someone's right to vote only serves to diminish their sense of being a citizen\nWhen people feel like they're hopeless and there are shut out of the basic fundamental rights as a citizen then they're more apt in my opinion to give up and turned to a life of crime or because there's no alternatives left to him\nSort of went to prison for buying crack cocaine from an undercover police officer while on probation he says when he got out not having the right to vote made him feel powerless\nAre used to have ideas about who I wanted an office through nurtured and things were never go to Bob ... show really made me feel lifted us citizens it kind of made me feel like we're not sure what we're\n... recently got his rights restored and while he's proud to have the right to vote he says he's not sure how to use that right you haven't made up his mind about whether or not to vote in November\nIs kind of like a ... for me it was kind of like a book of this part of a book lists I'm not a political either and I'm not sure we'll are willing to do a drug test me for that and like I say I'm not sure\nSeveral recent polls have shown public support for amendment for above the sixty percent threshold it would need to pass but if it fails voting rights advocates have another strategy or group of former felons is suing the state in the case currently before a federal appeals court\nSupporters are hoping they won't have to fight that legal battle much longer if they win at the ballot box in November\nFor here and now on Chris Bentley in Tallahassee\nWell another legal battle here when all the way to flip Florida Supreme Court in a decision about who has the right to a point to three new Supreme Court justices\nTo replace three retiring justices who helped make the decision about their seats governor Rick Scott said he should replace the justices before his term ends but the Supreme Court ruled that is the incoming governors responsibility so we the Democrat Andrew Gillum or the Republican Ron descent as will shape the future course\nA hearing that decision the head of Florida State Republican Party said the stakes were November's election just got higher let's bring in WFSU news director Lynn had her Hyland\nNice even person I'm explain this decision will you know what was behind the thinking\nWell it it comes down to a matter of timing the governor is usually sworn in by noon on that day and you know the justices also retire at the same day but technically they get the hang out a little bit longer till about five or midnight so really by the time their terms or up\nIt's already a new governor is in office and that's part of some of the the consideration that did go into this there's also some previous cases in unrelated issues that also tend to lend themselves to\nSort of an incoming person being able to make certain appointments so all of that came in to basically say governor Rick Scott you don't have this appointment power it's now in the hands of the incoming governor\nI it's very different but I can hear president or former president Brock Obama saying Rick Scott I sympathize with you he of course I wanted to do his Supreme Court justice but staying in the state of the three justices who are retiring by ... Lewis\nPicky Quinn 'em all part of a you could say a liberal bloc of responsible for many this course for three decisions is the fourth record how important is this\nIt's critical of this is the same for three court that has overturned the legislature on issues like abortion issues like um provisions on voting restrictions on voting that the Republican led legislature has wanted to do in the past that they cut it\nI'm the same court threw out congressional redistricting maps so this court has often thwarted the legislature when they've wanted to put in policies\nAnd the legislature has responded by calling you know the Supreme Court activist judges that's been a term that's been floated around so a lot of there for three decisions have really come down on some of these hot button social issues\nAnd that's been a big sticking point the point of contention between Republican leaders and this particular Supreme Court though the makeup of this court matters because these are issues that aren't going away the Florida Legislature under\nBeen talking about it today Ron sent is a spokesperson warned and he's the Republican or that or the Democrat Andrew Gillum would bow to pressure by out of state radical groups to pick 'em up these activists judges that you just referred to ... factoring into that campaign\nWell it's certainly playing a role in the conversation um but I don't think it's sort of raise and to a level where most people are actively thinking about you know who whoever gets the governorship will make the way\nEighteen thousand to go yeah we got it but I Am not a mathematician but you know you're exactly right give or take about fifty bucks a so we want to thank Carol and Laura and Christian and Carolyn and all the folks\nWho within the last hour have been coming in and making their pledges support or becoming members of Nashville public radio in Des BPL and we really appreciate that support we'd love for you to do the same you can do that on line at W.

Democratic candidate for governor Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum was given free tickets to the Broadway show Hamilton as a gift from an FBI agent posing as a developer something Gillum still fiercely denies he\nIs one of the breakout star as of this election season leading the Republican candidate former congressman and Iraq\nDissent is by as many as twelve points in the polling the two had a contentious to our debate on CNN on Sunday and we invited both men sit down with us this week only Gillum accepted he\nIs the first African American democratic gubernatorial candidate in Florida's history probably as most progressive he supports hiking the state's corporate tax rate to fund education raising the minimum wage and he is for a single parent health care system\nWill have more in a minute on the new reporting on alleged gives to Gillum against something he denies and what he told us about the accusations but first we started our conversation with him this week on his stand on Medicare for all\nI said I've endorsed a Medicare for all at the federal level and I encourage them to move diligently to get that done Florida could not go there alone we would need a federal solution here and at the very least we would need\nA conservative states coming together to negotiate a prescription drugs\nAnd others on behalf of its citizens and so what is within my power however is to expand Medicaid which is what we've committed to doing for over eight hundred thousand of the most medically needy people in my state\nRight now or a Republicans have refused to expand Medicaid for that group\nCosting the state six billion dollars that we could bring down from the federal government\nThat right now is being given away to other states while we've got one in five people in my state going to emergency rooms to access healthcare that's unacceptable I mean Mr dissent has said that to a cancer patient when asked how she was supposed to get access to health care is that you could always go to an emergency room\nThat response in my opinion is just qualifying for any one running for governor of the state of Florida\nLet's talk about crime you are the mayor of Tallahassee which is the biggest city in Leon county that is right which has the highest crime rate in the state we were traveling in a young African American who is also coming to Tallahassee as we were flying here said to us you know I I I think this is a problem\nHe's had his Tallahassee is the eighth largest city in the state of Florida and were twenty eighth in crime\nMustard is experiencing a five year low in our crime rate\nThe missile defenses described community as one where people are sheltering themselves in homes in avoiding the streets and he's it clearly has never spent any time in Tallahassee regular everyday working people in my state recognize that communities are going to have crime they know that\nThe question is what if communities do about it\nAnd what we've done about it in my city is Wi Fi or fifty new law enforcement officers over the past four years we brought down our crime rate we instituted restored of justice practices created reentry program so that folks who are returning citizens to our community get the opportunity to reenter society and have dignity around their work\nThis categorization of a high law this uh you know ... this is Trump be in politics it is not based in reality I Want to ask you about President Trump\nYou know in your debate with Ron dissent is you said he was a stupid for the president you may know Bo's about how you felt about President Trump and his lieutenants with ads of leadership well an absence of leadership as you as you put it\nPresident Trump's polling numbers they bumped up is it may be a mistake in a state like Florida to call your opponent astute first of all that you know the kind of language that we expect from others\nI'll tell you I Will take my chances I Am sick to my stomach or at the national at the state at the local level people normalizing the behavior that comes out of Washington DC I refuse to do is\nUh I'm teaching my kids what it means to the golden rule to treat people like you want to be treated our president goes around making fun of handicapped individuals rift\nObjectify women and I have a daughter uh and so uh I'm prepared to take my chances calling the president out for what I Believe it's completely inappropriate behavior and Mr descent as\nHe is sucking up to the president he does a consider himself in a print is that Donald Trump if we're ever going to restore decency and commonsense to our body politic more people have to join me in decrying this kind of ...\nA racist Xena phobic and sexist language out I'm never going to make apologies but trying to create a kind of society in a kind of get a community where my kids will be proud to grow up in\nIran to answer that if you're this strongly speaking out against the president as governor how do you work with the ministry nation how all this money and they need for the environmental plans that you have for this day\nUnfortunately for most of the center of this is not Russia or we don't bow down to the president we work with\nA take for instance under governor Rick Scott he disagreed vehemently with President Obama President Obama in spite of that vehicle disagreement\nTried to send the state of Florida two point eight billion dollars to build high speed rail governor Rick Scott said no thank you we don't believe in Obama's stimulus money as much as I disagree with the conduct\nAnd the qualifications of this president if he tries to since load a to point eight billion dollars\nI'm gonna take that money and I'm all put that money to work for everyday Floridians went on governor my differences aside from the president he's going to find a willing partner in me who's willing to help him on infrastructure help on transportation Rick Scott Knight who again don't agree on a lot politically\nDuring this last storm hurricane Michael we spoke every day on the phone\nTalk a little bit about the environment which has been hammering your region your opponent Santas is now positioning himself as a Teddy Roosevelt conservationist he says he wants to sell reservoirs to restore water flow and prevent those toxic algae blooms he supports a ban on fracking drilling off the coast\nCertainly different from your Republican sitting Governor Scott\nMy opponent can say anything he wants to end an election year but I have to measure him by his six years in Congress someone who voted to undermine the environmental protection agency someone who voted against the clean Water Act thirty three times\nAs the mayor of Florida's capital city we broke ground on a one hundred and twenty acre solar farm tripling the amount of solar energy that we produce and the city of Tallahassee where we sit above the ah Florida an aquifer\nAnd where we noticed through our spray field operations that we were contributing to hire nitrate levels and what color springs we took the necessary steps to begin treating that water at the new church she every level almost portable level\nTo reduce the number of nitrates going into our groundwater when we get elected governor we're going to have a governor who believes in science put some teeth back into our department of environmental protection where we have deregulated across that agency allowing the biggest polluters to write their own rules\nIs they're going to come a point where people like you have to say to people we can't afford to have you wiped out time after time\nWell listen you go to a issue that is going to be hugely at the top of our agenda\nAnd we recognize that we are highly susceptible to the impacts of global warming and sea level rise\nAnd so we've got to start building are more resilient state and yes that in some cases will mean that there are parts of our state we're not going to be able to continue allow growth to take place already insurance an actuarial studies are showing some of these areas that are going to be under water\nThat's Andrew Gillum narrow Tallahassee democratic gubernatorial candidate here in Florida now again thanks so much for speaking unless\nOf course take care\nMonday and as we said yesterday the Tampa Bay times reported that attacks from Gillum his old friend and lobbyist Adam Corey\nShows that a man they both thought was a developer\nHad Broadway tickets for Gillum and others including Gillum brother now the textbook Corey reach Mike Miller and the crew have tickets for us for Hamilton tonight Gillum replies awesome news about Hamilton Mike Miller turned out to be an FBI agent part of an undercover investigation into corruption not focusing on Gillum\nGillum says his brother had it in the ticket he assumed his brother pay for it here's what he told us in our conversation\nTell us about the FBI investigation according to New York times are just going to ... there was a lobbyist friend of yours that was actually a friend as many of your friends are from your student government days in in college this is Adam Corey who introduce you to

watch we've talked about the governor's race between the Democrats Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum and the Republican former Congressman Ron dissent is there's a tight race as well for a Senate seat\nNot on the ballot but on people's minds Donald Trump in a hurricane here's some of what we're hearing [noise]\nBecause here the Democrats and\nAmong Republicans some of the road\nGermany or agree with\nIt and you're\nTo secure\nThat Wendy Alaska in Miami also with her Miami their rosy Patel a Jake Bernstein an Alexander Trujillo healthcare President Trump\nCan the sitting governor or the Republican Rick Scott unseat longtime Senator Bill Nelson is a lot going on to lift convene are Florida politics round table\nTo talk about it all and Ricky Acevedo an anchor for Univision special correspondent for fusion joins us from W ELL are in in Miami high Enrique Hi Robyn\nI'm getting closer to you I'm In your state I'm Glad [laughter] and we're the here in Tallahassee Ryan daily a reporter for WFSU Hi Ryan hey Robin thanks for having me aren't well we want to start with you because we want to get to that governor's race um the Democrat Andrew Gillum as we said\nHas been fending off these charges that he took tickets are handled it I mean Hamilton makes it into this race and his share of a vacation that a couple of friends took\nA you know just one trip that he took these as gifts from developers it turned out to be an FBI agent and a and as an ethics commission investigation he is not the subject of that investigation now the Tampa Bay times yesterday broke the story of the text\nIn which a Gillum friend a lobbyist told him about this Hamilton ticket or that the developer heads for them Gillum responds awesome\nBut he is insisting it even today he thought his brother paid for that ticket is it's just going to hurt us this sticking his far ahead of dissent isn't some polling\nRight yeah I I think it's important to remember that this is part of that state ethics board investigation I talked with a Gillum lawyer Barry Richard back in September who said he he doesn't expect this investigation to be concluded by the time people have gone to the polls anyway\nSo I think what it's all going to hinge on when it's all going to come down to and you'll see this tonight in the gubernatorial debate here in Florida\nThat or it's going to come down to how Andrew Gillum answers these questions so I mean almost undoubtedly\nThe dissenters camp is going to try to use this to point to uh dishonesty inconsistencies in the story I think I think if you are I'm On the Gillum team you are hoping that he uh you know sticks with his story um and again it's going to come down to how he answers a question\nAnd it's really an important race because uh you know they couldn't be more different he's a progressive I'm a chair a disastrous on Fox News earlier this month\nKnow I have a positive relationship with the president of the people in the administration Florida has a lot of needs from our military footprint our transportation or water resources what's been a big problem here and we need to work constructively what the federal government Andrew Gillum is running on impeaching Donald Trump I don't know what for ah but\nVoice or with the federal government and and I will be able to do that\nAnd Ryan so how is President Trump playing out in this race\nWhile I mean I think you need to look no further than the Florida Republican primary\nUm to to you know get a sense of how Trump affects races here in the state um you could say the same just got the Trump bump so to speak in fact there is a pretty good sound bite of Trump's and ah\nYou know I'm slightly paraphrasing here but I sent a tweet and being being the fantasy was up by you know however many points and and I I was actually a downtown where the Gillum campaign was are awaiting their primary night results\nThe Republican primary was decided\nWell before the Democratic primary that was coming down to the wire so I think any time you know we've seen that President Trump can be a wildcard stepping into races tweeting support for a candidate\nWell Enrique as they don't let me bring you in here because the president also has pulled a wildcard in these couple of weeks leading up to November six elections and that's this and he calls it the caravan of uh some say refugee some say undocumented immigrants making their way you know to Mexico to the U.S border\nThey are going to have like twenty five miles a day at this rate they will not even reached that border till December the number who reach it but the president has been positioning this as a you know almost an attack\nOn the border how's that resonating where you are in Miami\nThank he's been able to position this as an attack on Democrats blaming them for what's happening where the care of and then saying they're all for open borders I think this is one of those um ... it's certainly a politically charged caravan at a very convenient time for the president\nBush said the the issue of immigration front and center which you already was to be honest uh in in this election along with health care and and the economy\nUm I Do think it could be one of those X factors coming to the election Robin and I'm ... would really see the impact all the coverage and all the attention this carbon has had in the last couple of days and they will have a in the run up to your mid term election\nUh we'll see that on a ... or ... depending on the turnout both parties I think it really is a a turnout election\nWell let's be clear this is a cabinet are reportedly was organized by a church is that it happens quite often it's it's just that this one has come up on the radar and the last one that was of this size\nA group of people um you know organized by churches to try to seek refugee status in the United states in the last ... they got so much attention\nThat CNN is reporting that just three people\nUh were accepted into the country so there is that but I just and just to underscore this Enrique we we you know people are Latino Hispanic voters do not all vote in a block\nUm you will have people who will be of you know coming from the same countries will resent people who are coming across the border and we've been talking to construction workers or builders who are desperate for some of those people they're seeing on the screen to come work here\nAnd that's an excellent point and Florida's a great example Robin you see a Cuban American community a traditionally a very conservative a very broad Republican there they have been very pro Trump\nOr Trump wanted to state in two thousand and sixteen now you have Puerto Ricans to many of them who are already in Florida before money about all the security Maria\nOver the Puerto Ricans have seems ah coming to Florida and that are um some of them have read registered to to be part of this midterm election and and they will certainly play a role in the result\nUh for for the governor race and and and the Senate race oh it's it's very interesting and yes the Latino community is not a monolithic communism different interests and and different agendas\nI Want to turn out to the Senate race or the Democrat Bill Nelson the incumbent has held the seat since two thousand one but some polling shows that\nCandidates had to debate earlier this month on telling them do fifty one let's listen to a little of that first Governor Scott\nCenter Nelson and Andrew Gillum will kill the economy they like high taxes um Andrew Cuomo said he wants to raise taxes forty percent [noise] Sara Nelson voted for tax increases are higher taxes over three higher tax higher taxes over three hundred times\nAnd Here's Senator Nelson responding\nWell the governor keeps coming out with one whopper after another uh apparently you never got your mouth washed out for soap after tell them why because you keep on going on on every part of my record\nHigh daily from his you here in Tallahassee always colorful but who's on the edge here and I especially with\nThe hurricane that just hit I every time I turn the TV on icy Governor Scott in a little kept visiting you know some terrible you know disaster where a school's roof has been ripped off I mean he is seemingly everywhere so who's who's got the edge here yeah I I mean\nAre you know there was a the latest Quinnipiac poll released I think yesterday had Nelson's lead a at about seven points I mean a hurricane recovery obviously inherently political\nUm you know I think Rick Scott being the governor he he had the advantage invisibility and the response to hurricane Michael but Senator Bill Nelson the I think to his credit he visited emergency operations centers in Bay county here in Tallahassee", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Nashville", "day": "24"}
