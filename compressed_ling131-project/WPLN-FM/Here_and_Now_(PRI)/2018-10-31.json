here but ah every indicator light here points to a democratic victory the question is how big a victory will be\nUm I Am still one who thinks there will be a new things like not just the house but also some governors' mansions and state legislatures that we cannot predict that will turn out in Democrats' favor John\nWell first of all in the Republican side the more we if we can get Nancy Pelosi on all the stations all day long we're we're all for it because it seems to fire up our base at least quite a bit but I look historically we know that whether it's a Republican or Democrat president in two years into their terms\nThe other party does well I I think there is no reason to believe that history is not going to repeat itself\nThe question as to what level I Do think that the house majority is certainly in play I Would not be terribly shocked if the Democrats won the majority on the other hand I Do think the Democrats are going to lose seats in the Senate\nAnd so it's going to result in a a sort of mixed I'm a control of government and what that's going to resolve this even more gridlock that we'd than we've ever seen in recent history and I think we're going to see the house particularly decide that their real goal in life has to be a thorn in the side of the president\nAs a journalist it feels great to meet a deadline under pressure now you've helped Nashville

here and now in two thousand three writer John D'Agata wrote a powerful essay about a young man who committed suicide in Las Vegas\nJon ultimately submitted that is said to the San Francisco magazine the believer and the first launch a seven year holy war over fact they gotta an essay is said facts 'cause he flew it it was the impact of the story that mattered\nHis fact checker Jim single took a binary approach something was a factor or wasn't and facts were sacred soon single produce Ninety pages of an accuracy which the two turned into a book with email exchanges like the following limited by our colleagues\nSingle questions John and the time John said it took for the poor young jumper to hit the ground John D'Agata said it was nine seconds that the car and said it was eight yeah\nBudget that it doesn't seem like it should be a big deal though it's only a second and I needed them to fall for nine seconds rather than eight in order to help make some of the major themes in the essay work John changing details\n... is one thing but it seems a tad unethical to fiddle with details that really directly to the kids' death I don't\nThink it's unethical particularly because I wasn't alone in assuming his fall took nine seconds for a while as parents also as soon as he had fallen for nine seconds\nBut now you do no better so should make change\nNine is to enter grow a part of the essay at this point and I admit that I'm wrong about nine later on anyway\nSo the answer is not changing it would ruin the say it would ruin it to make it more accurate yep\nWell now those emails have been turned into the Broadway play lifespan of a fact with powerhouse actors body kind of al as writer John D'Agata\nHarry Potter I mean Daniel Radcliffe as fact checker Jim single and cherry Jones as an editor referee the to the seven years of fact finding has been condensed into twenty four hours in which the three are trapped in an apartment like caged cougars\nBattling sometimes physically over the meaning of fact as a deadline looms which side will win will editor cherry Jones publish it you know find out [noise]\nWe met up backstage with all three before recent matinee\nAs veterans of the stage can you feel what we felt in the audience last night people on the edge of their seat it's like I don't want to try to outdo the critics here was describing this but I came up with a pistol every few journalism yeah thank you it feels like we're at almost a fight or a or a debate\nYeah I mean first of all I have to have I just have to take him on me I'm just really acknowledge the I just was referred to as a veteran actor in the company they see for the first time ...\nAnd yeah I mean I I've never done a play before but I have an argument at the center of it just feels that going backwards and forwards every night is really special unlike some nights\nI'll feel the audience finding me particularly irritating it is a moment ... some of gyms ... like make the audience go oh this guy's being ridiculous but actually like the notes in in in my head they all know ridiculous until I find like as far as you up to go okay I have to I have to try and win this even more\nDo you feel that because there was a guy behind me last night I don't know if you guys could hear that she kept going yeah we did when you would make a point did did you feel that\nSometimes we do like any good player you know the events of the players have to be the biggest events of the characters on stages lives in a sense and I think it works best when the three of us are fighting for it with all our lives\nThe cherry explain your character because the character isn't in the book but there is an editor\nWell it's funny because Jim single engine to God who we've been seeing a lot of cars they come to the show many times in fact last night when I said the first line of the play is Okay Jim single I hurt people actually left\nAnd it was when I left the theater last night Jim single was standing there with thirty ... thirty of his relatives who've flown in from\nAll over the country and and I when I opened the books at which they kindly gave us for opening night Jim's comment was man we could use to\nUse your character as this sort of what the soul of the argument\nI don't know if it's a ... she's the soul of the argument but she's the one who has to make the decision and she's so desperately wants to publish it because she really thinks it will help at this moment in time\nBut at the same time she is a journalist and Dana damn it every night as I come down to the moment is to play were decision has to be made\nYou and your character have not made up their mind\nThe moment I reach for the phone how it's who convinces me other so often you if you publish Illinois all every night now the head guy that's got to be talking about post show\nI Know what the bill wrote in my book thanks for having John's back oh I can\nTalk about that when your character John to God I was saying things like yeah there are thirty one step closer to thirty four is a better number so I like that number my\nHead was exploding you can't do that it's bad for all journalism whether it's an essay or news\nFor me to it as a piece of writing in the newspaper\nIs no different to the fact in fact oh my God we're having a play\nOr the difference in ... or an artistic peace being written in the desert you know what would you say about the Greek history what would you say about in cold blood\nI Would say Daniel you're smiling Daniels character gym would say if it's thirty one strip clubs you can't make it thirty four 'cause you like the way that number's sounds you've obviously to say your character is not a bad guy we're in real life\nGuide anyway he's just he's a writer as an artist but in real life he he has said that the real writer who said oh my God I'm like the devil spawn to some people\nJust destroyed here and they continue to do so um but I don't think it's fair John does it work for the Washington Post he was not writing articles for reading articles for\nNew York times you use the looming dating the lives of people who normally would never be written about that follows it a long line of traditions why all of a sudden because we're in such a controversial time we're going to just stay at all these artists you can't do that anymore\nBut that brings us to present day and you're all aware that there's a moment in the play where your character John ... has a line and most of the lines are straight out of the real life interactions\nAnd there's a whole world effects to choose from the wrong stocks getting the way of the story and your test us as their own facts what does that mean exactly what\nYou gotta be aware that we have a presidential ... person Kellyanne Conway who spoke of alternative facts you're not in cherry\nInteresting because there is a beautiful speech about the importance of facts and democracy and it frequently gets applause\nThe argument is basically that if you were reading something or watching something and you find even one thing to be untrue in at the whole thing can fall apart for you and your trust in your relationship without saying\nYou know there's one point in the play where it would debate about the length of time this person fell for it and that's one of those moments where the audience is kind of going oh come on clearly you are going to follow this you know to different methods you know Jim\nWants to publish this essay he is convinced that by making it drew a you will also make it more beautiful inherently\nYeah but it is irritating and certain point Jim single start to feel like one headline said a little bit crazy\nI think Jim's fighting in the play is that he can't differentiate between the things that are really like you know that's the case of picking your battles he becomes more and more infringed as the argument between him and John gets more intense you'd\nDo both become the divided United States in a way and you know over this issue of facts and cherry again there you are\nIn the middle talk about the physicality on the stage I mean there's there's heat up there\nThere is and in fact I left a little more heat happening last night I was slow on an entrance\nStrangling each yes yes I'm writing on winning that fight [laughter] I saw the U.S strangling Daniel okay yeah\nIt does go to those extremes because these two men care so much in it is in that sense where we are as a nation right now of of what facts mean to I hate to say the either side and I just can't believe we're talking about our country that way but\nThen you you actually got a taste of this she went to the New Yorker and you were a fact checker for a day barely

day I had national international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nThis year and now we've talked a lot about what next week's elections mean for control of Congress but voters will also be casting ballots for the representatives at the state level so what's at stake in state house races around the country seems to\nNational Conference of state legislatures high ten\nOh thank you for having me on and when you look right now at the state legislatures are Republicans control sixty seven\nOut of the Ninety nine there isn't by the way that they're Ninety nice because one state Nebraska does not have both the house and Senate they only have one chamber but the Democrats only control thirty two why are Republicans so dominant at the state level\nWell well what the straight answer that they've been successful in previous elections they've earned candidates that have\nFared well and and you know they they they did quite well and the Obama presidential mid terms and really had a ... they've had three consecutive strong elections\nAnd four consecutive strong elections so in the states if you factor in both the legislatures and governors as well um it's more Republican than pretty much in American history a you know there were a few more seats in Nineteen twenty Nineteen twenty eight but in terms of chambers and legislatures this is the most Republican dominance\nIn the state governments in American history\nAnd what is the consequences of that what does that meant for Republicans to have that kind of control\n[noise] well they run on issues like are lowering lowering taxes uh they certainly also run on issues like immigration reform some of the social issues around abortion rights and things like that I'm so they have a they have done exactly what they said they were going to do they have been very aggressive on\nImplementing a issues around a abortion and and certainly on taxes and spending in terms of cutting taxes and a and lowering taxes\nAround the country so uh you know the states have been active in policymaking on issues like education public safety health care\nAt a time when Washington has really been gridlock and we've had very little policy coming from Washington on the federal level and so the Republicans have really put their premature on those policies in the states\nThey also get to at least every ten years draw the maps for congressional districts which gives Republicans an edge if they've got the control of these state houses\nThat is correct in in a handful of states there's some sort of a commissioner of\nA group that does it outside of the legislature but predominantly it's the legislatures that draw the U.S congressional lines\nAnd in most cases their own state legislator line that's another reason the Republicans are in such good shape and the states is that they had a very successful state election cycle in two thousand and ten\nWhich meant that they were in control of many state houses for the twenty ten cycle of redistricting and they took full advantage of that by the way the Democrats also take full advantage of redistricting when they are able to do so it's not a it's not one party necessarily doing that\nAnd um and so they drew lines were quite favorable and those have held up throughout the decade but yes the the twenty twenty cents is right around the corner and this is kind of the first election to tease it up and of course the twenty twenty ... election itself will be the big for redistricting\nRight but this one uh about an eight to the people who are elected this year are going to play a role at least that many are going to play a role in drawing those maps in two years\nThat's all right Jeremy that there are over eight hundred legislative seats that will be filled and less than a week from now I'm by legislate tours legislative candidates who will be directly involved and redistricting as well as\nThirty four governors who have for your terms we're going to be elected next Tuesday and you know that has a an effect that goes beyond just two years or policymaking in the next legislative sessions in two thousand and Twenty one\nBut I'm a redistricting can have a lasting impact throughout the rest of the next decade\nSo what are things looking like this year or what are the Democrats' chances of taking back control of some of these state houses\nWell from the very beginning we knew that this would be a democratic opportunity year they would have the wind\nFor a variety of reasons Republicans control about fifty six percent of all legislators seats and as you pointed out um almost two thirds of all the legislative chambers and legislatures around the country so they're sort of in a tough position where they're basically playing defense around the country\nAnd there's also this very strong historic trend about a strong of a trend in politics as you'll find anywhere which is it since Nineteen hundred so going back twenty nine mid term election cycles the party and the White House loses seats in state legislatures twenty seven of those twenty nine mid term elections\nSo the party out of the White House is almost always looking to make a ground to gain seats in legislatures as well as in the U.S house and it looks like that's where it's going to head this time\nDemocrats are running more candidates and they've run in Thirty years um they have raised a tremendous amount of money unprecedented amount of money that they're printing into\nLegislative campaigns around the country so ah you know Republicans are not exactly mailing it in there fighting hard for the uh the majorities that they have in ... and states legislatures but um but it's really the the Democrats who you know sort of have the momentum\nUh when we'd been traveling around the country talking about congressional races I I've been surprised although maybe I shouldn't have been that a lot of people don't know who their member of Congress is they do know that they're going to vote\nFor either a Democrat or Republican or in many cases but what about state legislators do do most people know who they're voting for did they just end up voting party line\nWell sad to say most of them do not know who they're voting for me they might sort of here the names or if they're a target voter they're certainly getting inundated with mailers and in some cases TV ads even you know widely broadcast TV ads and some of these legislative races\nBut you know despite the fact that legislatures budget over three trillion dollars in public money tax money every year and despite the fact that they're setting policy on education and\nAnd a criminal justice crime and punishment on health care on immigration on the environment I'm very few people know who their state legislature who are is and and who those candidates are in fact it's less than Fifteen Percent so it's ... it's it's you know probably not much better for the U.S house\nUm so you know we would encourage people these raises are extraordinarily important not just because of the outcome upcoming redistricting but also because of what states do\nAnd um and then to your point it then it does sort of turn into something of a referendum on the parties\nAnd one of the biggest issues for legislative candidates is is President Trump\nSo give us an example of a state house race uh that's really tight somewhere in the country and a sense of what's at stake\nWell there there are number of them and there are several state Senate swear just a ... a change of one seat will change control of the chamber in Maine and Minnesota\nIn Colorado and Minnesota there's one special elections and it's for all the marbles whichever party wins that will control the Minnesota Senate in right now the Minnesota houses Republican um there's a race for governor so that that's also and about so um [noise]\nYou know this one race which has had seen close to a million dollars in campaigning it's a heavily Republican district but if it goes one way or the other you know that party will control\nHow much do the parties get involved in these races that the parties in Washington did they jump in with their money and say we want this person to when we want that person to win\nMore than ever so particularly on the Democratic side the Democrats learned from getting show lacked in two thousand ten and by the way that was Brock Obama's where we got shellacking down ballot in these legislative races and of course they paid the price because of the redistricting advantage Republicans had so in this\nWeb streaming is made possible by Williamson medical center offering a reminder that with deductibles being met and time off over the holidays now was a great time to schedule a surgery that's

fairly commonly in pivotal state legislative races and that is being um supported heavily by national party operations\nAnd so it's not just the Democrats they've just increase fairly substantially from where they were just a few years ago there now paying a lot more attention\nTo the state races but both parties are going all in on these races\nYou said President Obama said ...

I. mouthing young I'm Jeremy hops and it's here and now it is Halloween it's also six days before the election President Trump hits the campaign trail again today\nHoping to talk immigration after visiting Pittsburgh yesterday to pay respects after the synagogue shooting Democrats across the country are making their final pitch to voters many focusing their message on healthcare\nWe're joined now by NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson high ... high there so you were about to join President Trump in his latest campaign pushy is heading to Florida or one of the things people have noticed about his schedule a leading up to the midterms at this point is that he seems to be focused\nMainly on Senate races as he given up on Republicans keeping the house\n[noise] I don't think he's given up I think Republicans are engaged in the mad scramble to keep their losses in the house as low as possible but the president has been going to red states states where he's popular he doesn't he isn't campaigning in blue\nDistricts where he's not popular and it just so happens that this year the Senate battleground is a bunch of very red states that he won where his approval rating is very high and they're just happens to be Democratic Senate incumbents are running for re election in those states so that's where he's focusing\nMeanwhile he's been talking as we've been talking about the last twenty four hours or so about ending so called birthright citizenship he said today on Twitter that it will be ended one way or the other even though\nIt is protected by the constitution and constitutional scholars have said it would not be possible for him to ended by executive order we remember that it was a week ago ... that he was talking about passing a middle class\nPolicy appeals work for voters\nWell he thinks they worked for his base don't forget\nImmigration is the number one issue it's the number one culture war issues that he thinks energizes his voters that's what birthright citizenship is for he also was sending fifty two hundred troops to the border even though that caravan is mostly filled with women and kids and it's hundreds of miles away from the U.S border\nBut the ... ten percent tax cut 'em gambit is defensive and he proposed that because the tax cuts that the Republicans already passed\nIs so unpopular and middle class to people and the Republicans own internal polls show that people think it was a tax cut for the rich and not for them\nIs so huge appealing to his base but can Republicans do what they want to do in these midterms just with the base\n[noise] well that's what the president's theory is it's always all about the base with him\nAnd the problem for a lot of Republicans in these affluent educated suburban districts is they need more than the base they need independent voters and they've been struggling a members of Congress in those districts have been struggling [noise]\nWhat about the other big story of this week which is of course the the terrible I'm shooting in Pittsburgh and a following up on the pipe bombs that were sent to some of the ... the president's critics\nYou put the fun in fundraising things for hanging was during the fall membership campaigns the listener is the most important part of what we do your generosity inspires this spring you even\n[noise]\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.

is the only state that has this kind of commission which bundles together a number of issues into one yes or no question Danny Rivero of W ELL around explains\nIf you live in Florida on election day you'll get the option to ban offshore drilling and also been vaping in the workplace\nOr you can vote to change the state college system and also give more deaths benefits to the families of first responders and members of the military these two items on the November ballot or the product of the Florida Constitution revision commission\nAnd the voter has to make a terrible choice\nEllen freedom was on the ... commission Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight\nDo I vote for the thing I don't like in order to get the thing I Do like and that's just not fair and not acceptable\nI think that what the constitution revision commission did is it packed things that they thought would be popular along with things that they really wanted but so I wouldn't be popular\nThat's all Broward County is top administrator Bertha Henry's use it to particularly on a question that would do three things at once mandated State Department of veteran affairs mandate estate anti terrorism office and something Henry's not happy with force every county to have five elected government officials including sheriff in supervisor of elections\nThe amendment that's on the agenda if it's sandwiched in between motherhood Napa by\nThe commission has been putting seemingly unrelated questions together on the ballot since it was first formed in Nineteen Seventy eight but the way freedom than some legal experts at this time has different\nTwenty years ago the decision about who would be on the commission came from a mix of Democrats and Republicans them in an almost even split between the two parties says Ellen Frieden\nAnything that got passed through that constitution revision commission had to be seriously debated compromises had to be made and it had to be something that was agreeable on a bipartisan level\nBut this year every appointment was made by Republicans are Republican appointed officials and that can make things look political even if they're not ... as was on this year's commission on a committee that helped write the language voters will see she says politics were not play just plain logic\nSo when we first started meaning we all came to the table with ideas of how things might be grouped and everything really had in a somewhat of an access or natural connection\nGame as offers the example of amendment ... which would ban offshore drilling and vaping at work\nBut if you look at it from a let's make our environment more friendly and and and protect our state and protect our citizens\nI think that you can kind of see why they would have fit together I Can't say that personally I agreed with all of the group beans and my voting record would speak to that but for the most part I did and I thought that we put things together in a way that it made sense\nCameras says there's another reason for grouping amendments in some places ballots are nearly twenty pages long this year so the commission want it to stop voter fatigue\nJust make the shorter and easier for people\nThere's just one rule the commission has to follow according to the ...\nAmendment need to be clearly understood by voters Timothy McClintock is a professor of constitutional law at the University of Florida\nThat it needs to clearly state cheap purpose it needs to be comprehensible I saw the more you windfall ... different disparate subject that can really be a challenge there\nThe Florida Supreme Court already ruled that one bundled amendment was not clear enough for voters there was about charter schools and it didn't use the phrase charter schools\nSo that was removed from the ballot three other amendments were in jeopardy of being tossed off the ballot until this month when the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that they would stay justice Barbara party in the ... the questions were improperly bundled and they didn't give voters a clear choice of what they're voting on\nBut the legal filing that was used to make that argument was the improper vehicle Justice Party and they had two words for people looking at these questions on the ballot voters be where for here and now I'm Danny Rivero in Miami\nWhether you're a voter in Florida or another state you may also have ballot measures to weigh in on on election day this year there are a hundred and fifty five statewide ballot measures in thirty seven states\nSixty four of them are citizen led initiatives there an example of direct democracy letting voters rather than legislatures decide policies and laws joining us now is Josh all tick who's the project director for the ballot measures project at ballot PDF Josh welcome\nYeah it's good to be here thank you and how does the number of statewide ballot initiatives this year compared to other years overall\nThe total number a statewide measure is has been decreasing over the last decade or so there's been a trend towards fewer and fewer button twenty six twenty Eighteen there's been a resurgence specifically in citizen initiated measures measures they get on the ballot through a senior trip protection signed by registered voters and\nIn those citizen initiated ballot measures if they get past do they become law or is it something that just gets refer to the legislature to make a decision about\nThose have gone to the ballot for final approval from the voters on there a couple of exceptions for example in Nevada there was a measure that has to get approved again and twenty twenty if it passes and twenty Eighteen um but these measures are going to the voters and voters have the last say on them\nSo what kind of issues are we talking about here I see that a lot of them have to do with elections and voting\nYeah that's one of the the biggest trends are seeing in twenty Eighteen or things like redistricting systems are adding commissions are changing the requirements for redistricting\nMarijuana is another topic that's been on the ballot a lot you know in recent years has been a trend and it's sort of continuing this year I other election policies related measures things like voting requirements voter id campaign finance an ethics is another big issue in North Dakota South Dakota Missouri\nHow difficult is it to get some of these initiatives onto the ballot\nThat process varies by state the number of senators required as usually based on a percentage of voter turnout either for the president for um the governor for me to secretary of state and the total number varies from a little over Thirteen thousand a small state like North Dakota to over half a million in California this year\nThe costs on average was a million dollars a little over a million dollars and twenty Eighteen for these initiatives\nSo does that mean that it is mostly big organizations who get behind these things and get them on the ballot or it could have just be Jane Q voter\nThere are a few sort of really true grassroots volunteer efforts but for the most part if these things are crossing over a million dollars either have to have a rich individual and industry or a special group but a national interest group that's behind you to provide the funding to get these on about\nCan imagine that in some cases state legislators would be happy that something is put to the voters so they don't have to make the call themselves and in other cases they might not be happy because it ties their hands yet in general in\nBetween citizens or a registered voters and the legislature the the backers of these initiatives generally use the initiative process as\nA sort of a method of last resort if they're not getting what they want done in the legislature and they see an opportunity that voters might approve a policy that the legislature has either not acted on or has opposed um but there's always some exceptions that prove the rural and there are cases where\nPolitically connected people go to the initiative process and that could be for for a variety of reasons but for the most part the citizen initiative process of used when the policies are being approved in the legislature\nNow sometimes to voters decide on something and then the state uh either dragged its feet or decide that doesn't want to go through with it or in Maine last year sixty percent of voters approved a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid to cover tens of thousands more people but the governor there all the pages block implementation\nAnd there's an ongoing legal battle over it or how often does that kind of thing happen\nAs you see the initiative process habits resurgent so as you see more initiative you see the number of instances where that conflict I was talking about implicit boils to the surface\nThe response to twenty six the initiatives was\nIn many cases to either repeal or I'm changing the initiatives if possible in some states allow that some don't or to pass restrictions on the process and then the sort of a third response we've seen is an effort to compromise and twenty Eighteen with an issue proponents instead of\nLetting it go to the ballot and letting it be to sort of hard battle trying to find some sort of deal they can make where initial prominence withdraw and the policies still gets at least some sort of advancement if it's not the full effort that the addition opponents want it\nWhat is the thought about how useful a ballot questions are\nDirect democracy is is really important in the u._s. um every state but Delaware it's a forty nine states require voters to ratify constitutional amendments\n\nFunding\nFor here and now comes from the listeners of WVU

Russian interference in the twenty sixteen elections or possible collusion with the Trump campaign\nIt's about allegations mothers office has referred to the FBI that women were offered money to make fun of sexual misconduct claims about him\nNPR national security editor Phil Ewing joins us now feel this is weird though what do we know so far about this story\nIt's a very weird story it if it's a hoax that appears to be a hoax within a hoax so are there were these allegations that came into in boxes in Washington of reporters including NPR\nFrom someone who calls herself a woman in Florida who had allegedly been offered money to make these false charges against Muller and what may be the cases that woman actually\nDoes not exist and that those false charges were in fact false charges about false charges what isn't clear is whether this was intended to embarrass the special counsel's office or just to embarrass the journalists who had been sent this email us they tried to investigative report\nOn it or is it possible that these women 'cause I Want to be clear this woman was trying to alert um did that neither was to that she was trying to alert Miller's office that someone was trying to take him down\nWe're not aware of any contact but between the women involved here in a special counsel's office that it it's all been done through journalist intermediaries and they've reached out to the special counsel's office to ask about this and when it became aware of those uh outreach attempts then that's what it refers to the FBI and\nWell they are too conservative media personality shakeup will inject Berkman who I said to be linked to the story to tell us more about that\nThat's right wall is the young man who writes for the website gateway pundit Berkman has a show on Newsmax TV which is owned by President Trump's friends supporter Chris Ruddy and what they've said is the special counsel investigation is itself a hoax that it's illegal and that it's unfounded\nAnd they want to expose what they call the crimes or the finality involving the special counsel's office in Miller himself and that is the background for these accusations or a legit accusations this week involving\nA period of misconduct by Mahler um they appeared in these emails to news organizations and also on gay we punted yesterday Tuesday in the form of a so called intelligent ... intelligence report\nThat was linked to a so called ah intelligence agency which in its way was kind of a parody of the Steele dossier a which by the way is partly unverified a because no one knows which things into their true and which things\nLooking at this on line that this alleged intelligence agency was made up of a series of suspicious linked in pages and the profile pictures of the people who had those pages where people like actors or models not real human beings\nOkay well now my head is officially exploded and we have about less than a minute left so our ... is the speculation that these conservative personalities might have been behind paying these women just say something about ... I mean what what what is the possibility here\nThere may never have been any women at all and those are payments are those accusations were themselves just a trap to try to get reporters\nTo talk about them or none of that is clear however we do know the special counsel's office as as as the FBI to get to the bottom of this and if it doesn't there are criminal charges or there are some kind of report from the FBI we may learn what the real story was that was taking place\nIn a bottle in other words if somebody was masking a masquerading as a woman saying that there were sexual misconduct allegations about Miller and she was with the money and exact and someone had made that up\nThey would be in trouble NPR national security editor Phil Ewing in Washington we will follow this thank you thank you\nWell meanwhile earlier this month a federal judge in California block the Trump administration's plans to end the temporary protected status TPS for immigrants from Sudan El Salvador Haiti in Nicaragua\nThat ruling men that an estimated three hundred thousand immigrants didn't have to have an immediate threat of deportation but many of them had lives are already turned upside down during the ... plus months when they believe they'd have to leave the United states he\n... is one example of that she's a TPS holder from Sudan it say recently war torn country but she left for other reasons of fears of her personal safety and until a few weeks ago was prepared to lose her temporary protected status on November second\nWhich had been the deadline she joined us in the studio welcome thank you for having me and how long have you lived in the U. S. under this temporary protected status I have been here since Nineteen Ninety seven so it's twenty ... Twenty one years yet I'm I'm not going to ask at age but it feels as if that would be\nA good deal of your life yes that's a big chunk of my life and you haven't returned to sit in during that time now so I Know you can't talk about why you came here because you have an asylum case that is correct\nWhat kind of life had you created here in the United states\nUh United States has been very kind to me\nI was able to phase out my kitchen I have a master's degree from addicts from Brandeis University I worked with the department of public has a as a healthy Decatur for Eighteen years\nAnd right now I work with western governors the ... an online a school that is based in you looked at right now um and what can we see him as an ... called the house so we provide a guide to make a technique I help on line for just yes\nWell and we should note that since it's a sensitive subject for TPS holders did the government didn't pay for your education you pay for that yourself\nSo having crafted that life you know find yourself in embroiled in an asylum case whether or not you can receive asylum in this country and you were under this threat of deportation what did you think when you heard that your status would be ended and lost terrifying\nCertifying ... ah it it's um I have been here for Twenty one years and when you live in a place for that long it becomes home humans alive ... gets I don't have kids but I Know so many of the biggest holders who are raising up gets here a\nCommunity here and becoming so I think the estimate is close to four hundred thousand people\nUnited States from different countries yeah\nYeah do I understand you you actually started to prepare for having perhaps to leave by the end of this week that you shut things down I mean what did you do thinking you might have to leave it is that true 'cause um I\nUsed to on that it's ... it's a dream that I wanted for so long and I was at which I keep that dream in twenty Fifteen I bought a restaurant and ah\nWhen it has been cancelled I had to take steps that I didn't think I wouldn't need to do which is I had a ...\nAnd so there are some because I wasn't sure if it even able to be here demanding satirist on\nUm I was terrified that I'm going to also lose my job right now I was interested in because I'm with GPS a deadline everything stops so driver's license work everything that you have stopped with a constellation of ... as\nIt was a roller coaster and it was really terrifying\nSo you've already sold your business you say is your dream and then you were looking ahead and thinking boy on November second I Would lose as you said my license everything that enables me to function and possibly your other job which is working with this on line university yeah\nSo that had to be a a frightening time to can you understand I mean President Trump and the Trump administration's rationale for terminating temporary protected status for Sudanese immigrants like yourself\nIs that Sudan is no longer a dangerous place to live according to them the less civil war is over\nYou say what this even on my might be over in the headlines but the situation is a ground is not that is not that great\nAnd again you were here throughout a time where you could not have gone back at all I'm no legal up until this change in American policy\nOr you were part of the lawsuit that resulted in the ... decision being blocked he took this before that judge that overturned that November second date but there could be another date are you still living in fear that you know any day now this could happen\nYes because that just decision it's a temporary relief and gives a judge decides that case and um this is not to find a solution", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Nashville", "day": "31"}
