I think we are all here yes yes Justin Paul hello there even less than ten hello\nBench I understand that this is all based on something that happened in your high school\nIs not directly based on something that happened in my high school but there was a student who I didn't know particularly well and she passed away and everyone in the school community\nAfter his death really began to sort of claim that they were closer with him and they actually were ah myself included and I was struck by this and when I met Justin in college we began to talk about how\nSimilar phenomenon like ah our generations response to nine eleven we knew a lot of people who would inserting themselves in this tragedy or pretend that they knew people that passed away and they might not have um and we were so captivated and curious by why our generation in particular\nFeels the need to kind of\nPublic we mourn and be a part of community by any means necessary and we wanted to explore that\nFurther well but in this case Evan Hanson a he's a kid that just\nGets it every day trying to have a better day in fact he's in therapy and part of his um assignment in therapy has been to write a letter to themself gear Evan Hansen your kind of telling himself that how he's going to have a good day\nAnd what happens is that this young man Connor also a troubled classmate but he presented kind of a bully he finds one of the letters takes at home after he killed himself his parents\nThink that it's a letter he's written to Evan Hansen your editor Hanson and so he they think their best friends and for Evan Hansing kind of gets caught in this did that spirals out of control and also kind of changes him Stevenson\nThis idea that he suddenly finding respect from people and an entree into school life because there's this false idea about him that's very compelling\nYeah well I think he makes that decision ultimately to just kind of keep going with this story because everything he's always wanted comes true but it's also about the people around him are ... by the story as well my mom she feels as though he's giving something to them\nYeah the young man's family they want to embrace this ... you know best friend of their son who course isn't I mean it's just heartbreaking and it's also heartbreaking to hear evidence mother a struggling single mom when she finds out Evans been taken in by Congress family because she can't give him a lot of things that they can\nIt was very [noise]\nI'm Sorry I'm Sorry I'm not [laughter]\n\n[noise] you have to how you were able to put those feelings into a song [noise] what's it like now there's a ... novel you don't have music to get across these characters\nIt's true I'm enjoying that we talked a lot about at the beginning of the process with vowels which was\nYou know how do you take the would become sort of temple moments on the musical how do you take that in translated into a book yeah it is an interesting process of how do you get inside of characters head in the same way that a song does and that's why I think it does work so well as a novel because the book\nAllows us to get inside these characters heads to really ...\nSong does so I think it does translate well and uh and same token we also felt like we want to just to be a different experience from the musical and so we weren't slaves ... every time there's a huge song moments we have to have a big moment in the book and we have to capture that huge thing because we want this to be his own experience and to live on its own\nNow really any uh ... this is very special to people all these characters and especially ... really means something to young people then he's in your hands\nI'm Glad I didn't speak to you before beginning the novel yes lots of sort of hands still sort of hands in fact it was the sweaty hand line I'm In ... first monologue and the show that I was like this is me I can write this\nBecause we should say Evan also had sweaty hands\nThat's right he's trying to will his hands not to be sweaty by by even thinking about them being forty [laughter] they're becoming more sweaty I've been through that rabbit hole before here I felt like I knew how to do this or emotion I knew how to do it at the same time I did think it was sort of an unfair challenge given the popularity\nAnd the intensity with with which people had attached themselves to heaven and the other characters\nWell talk more about this notion that you're writing about suicide you add that I'm imagining be careful not to romanticize this\nFor sure um suicide is something um that I have experience with let's just say I know um was the other guys have stories of their own so I was definitely sensitive to that fact\nBut we all wanted to know more about Connor the guy's definitely that was a a um a goal of there is in a in a mission they gave me tell us more about Connor we have these ideas of him can you make these work\nOkay I can I say I can make some of this work really it started with just finding his voice at one point they said like we we want to give Congress some happiness in the show we're only seeing just this small glimpse of Connor and it's torture it's the him taking his life\nI'm In the book we get to know more about life before that and part of his life he did he did he ever experienced joy I'm or was it all you know I'm darkness\nThey don't wanna give anything away but I have to say we actually find out ... and we find out this crushing thing that happened to him yeah some people may not want to know that\nYou know this is Steven yeah I think that's definitely a a tension that we felt in the creative process was how much do we want to know obviously you leave the show wanting to know more about Connor but do you really want to know more about counter or do you want to imagine more about Connor and I think what we found in the book um especially with vowels treatment of it\nIs that we learn many reasons why Connor goes the way he does and Evan goes the way he does\nAnd it was important to us that it not feel mano causal I'm like there's this one thing that that um you know is the reason Connor is the way he is or Connor does what he does\nYou know and I I I think it's pretty successful and that\nAlso feel like a cautionary tale for our times\nOf what it's like suddenly get swept up in media ... and his friends become a you know since ... interviewed by everyone across the country it's a cautionary tale you know what can happen when suddenly or you don't even know what you're doing it and you're on a national stage there's that\nBut a bench pass it and I just didn't ... I understand that while you debated what to do how much to do more in a book than you did in the musical your fans we're already doing it than fiction they were they were writing about\nThis is Justin you know that that was something that was inspiring to us in terms of doing the novel adaptation was seeing that there were a fans around the country around the world who had never seen the show maybe they shouldn't do the cast album or read watched a clip on line or something and\nThey were beginning to create their own stories with these characters and interactions that might have been between evident Connor and and I'm a particular curiosity about Connor which is you know partially what inspired us people wanting to engage with these characters and that's what gave us the confidence to do this and the first place\n\n\n\n\nFunding for here and now comes from W.

originated increase it calls for new physicians do swear to abide by ethical standards Phillip ... is one of the doctors behind this new version\nIt's still the general principles of caring for patients first not doing mischief knowing one's limits keeping confidences but continue to this day\n... is professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at George Washington University School of medicine and health science he and his colleagues wrote the Hippocratic Oath for humanitarian workers based on what Nineteen agencies told them\nThe way we turned it to humanitarian ideals was by basing it on the resilience training but we were doing\nSo we were eager that people take care of their team and take care of themselves recognizing that there's a cascade of care that has to occur if people are going to take care of refugees they have to take care of themselves first they have to take care of their teams\nThey have to make sure that they stay with them there are areas of expertise\nOne of our colleagues at George Washington tells a story of when she was working in Africa\nAnd as a psychiatrist she was asked to do a Syrian section on a pregnant refugees so the the temptation to go beyond one's expertise is really difficult uh in in desperate\nSays you're saying that in this Hippocratic Oath you're able to give her permission to say I can't\nRight that's exactly right so defining the limits of one's expertise what one can do safely without the resources that one needs is one of the key principles of this work do you think\nThis is something that actually the humanitarian aid workers will really refer to or is it just kind of nice to have the guideline there\nIt's a it's a great point uh our hope is that it can be kind of a unifying project for the folks that we work with uh we've had a translated into Greek already were making a gift of it to the groups that were going back to work with a next month so we're hoping it'll have some traction\nOne of the things that you and your colleagues have noted is the potential culture clash as Muslim refugees and they are mostly Muslim enter a Christian region like the shores of Greece up pretty much in his white community\nHow has that caused problems and how are you dealing with that\nBeen impressed that the people who work with the refugees have their own immigrant stories so there's a shared experience a shared humanity\nThat even those who are more Western European generate that they show when they're working with folks from North Africa the middle east\nSo we learned that many of them\nHad grandparents great grandparents who were part of the genocidal exchange of populations in the Nineteen twenties\nIn the fall of ... they were refugees from Asia Minor everyone seemed to have an immigrant story they have married someone from outside Greece needs ... workers you talking about that's right\nGrants that one sounds and therefore this kind of work takes on a shared the humanitarian motivation\nJust have one more question um I have known him for quite some time and I know you're as you said Greek American you go to Greece quite often because of the refugee crisis\nBut I Wonder what it was like for you to be in one of the cradle of modern medicine implementing a very different kind of hypocritical for a very different reason from what the original one was drawn up for me personally what is this like for you\nIt's an opportunity to take the expertise that I've learned here in the states to get back to the origins of all my family's migration in the Nineteen fifties so my family left Greece after er during the civil unrest there after World War two\nAnd to be able to go back\nAnd offer what our cat we were just there in September [noise] talking to folks in so long ago ... above the work that we do um the recruiting help from the Greek psychiatric community so being able to collaborate in this way it's been both professionally I'm personally fulfilling\nPhilip can tell us thank you actually so\nThat's Dr Phil ... who is part of the George Washington global mental health program that's drawn up the Hippocratic Oath for humanitarian aid

questions about these ... trees yes there are a one of the biggest questions we have is what precisely was the purpose of the floor we know it's edible\nBut he says where people eating it because it was a delicacy or because they were starving with medicine\nColeman wonders if these trees might reveal patterns about how tribes like do you were moving across the landscape she's an archaeologist with the San Juan national forest [noise]\nA GPS you get quite plots than each tree and then hopefully we'll see a pattern and you might show trails and all the ways\nThat mark Mitchell says they're

beetle infestation could crippled them with the fungus called blue stain or wildfires could erase them\nSome of the big fires that was out in Colorado in the last five or six years have taken some of
