Smith and one British scientist Gregory Winter are sharing the prize let's bring in Peter door how he's president of the American Chemical Society and he's in Manhattan, Kansas at Kansas State university\nUh Peter welcome at first the royals Swedish Academy said the winning research applied the principles of Darwin in a test to explain that\nSo first of all let me start out with my congratulations on behalf of the American Chemical Society to our our three Nobel new Nobel laureates\nThere they're tremendous breakthrough work in using chemistry to speed nature's own processes and that's that's the reference to Darwin in a test tube of the laureates\nThe evolution of natural biological molecules that act as the critical machinery in the cells of living organisms\nAnd when we talk about Darwin I think most people know this term natural selection is that in play here\nWell a ... being able to identify a process within a cell and to have that sell live through the next generation\nContinuing with that particular new process inside his in ... in a sense of a natural selection that will survive if that new process improves the environment for that so why is this work significant\nWell ... the ability to actually go into a simple cell as we might think of it and to do some fundamental chemistry is actually a lot more complicated than it sounds and if we do chemistry Senate Baker a flask\nWho we control of fewer of uh the the variables sun and we're able to really understand some of the outcomes that we are alternately observe\nBut you know you know living self like a a whether it's a bacterium or or or other living so it's a lot more complicated than just a simple bicker\nAnd solve the real breakthroughs here are to be able to fine tune that chemistry for a desired outcome and ultimately to have that desire to outcome occur and the next generation as opposed to waiting for the slow evolutionary processes is is really what so spectacular here and\nNow we're reading that the research can be used to create things like more environmentally friendly chemicals also pharmaceuticals what are some of the real world applications of all this\nWell to be able to use the um the molecular machinery within a sell to make chemical compounds are proteins that's what sells normally do anyway but to be able to ask that sell\nTo make a specific molecule is where the real creativity comes in so imagine being able to provide a set of instructions too simple cells\nAnd have those cells repeat that process over and over again under very mild conditions the chemistry suddenly becomes a lot more interesting because we can do some very complex chemical reactions that do them in a very clean environment\nUntil really the the sky's the limit in terms of identifying molecular systems we couldn't imagine making in the chemistry environment like a beaker but doing it in these um these organisms that enable us to ah\nTake advantage of their natural process sees an example um all the natural process are created through um a an organism like like east\nHelps our bread rise in the war on generates um ethanol or alcohol in the

does all of that meeting for science and specifically for for you and chemistry\n[noise] lower also point out that from what I can tell this was the first time the women in physics and chemistry or recognized as laureates and the same year [noise]\nUm and but you're absolutely right and the ... professor Arnold ... she's the woman's and prior to that it was stores the odds comes in Nineteen

Society where we're at the same for me personally were really advocating for\nBroadening the participation in the chemical science is specifically um for folks from all different backgrounds and perspectives and frost recognizing the the fact that professor Arnold work has has risen to these levels is just it's just fantastic\n... is president of the American Chemical Society he's there at
