I guess you you started out as a as a public defender I\nI did um I became a public defender immediately upon graduating from law school and what was what was the idea behind that you thought I'm going to be a public defender and I'm going to help people who are defendants and criminal cases [noise] that's right\nAnd I like lots of people had no idea what was going on in the system and my daughter in law school [noise] um I joined the criminal defense Connecticut and why you and step into Manhattan criminal court and never was able to look away again this is Robyn Steinberg what\nI saw so shocked me that I thought this can't be happening in our country and we can't possibly think this passes for justice [noise] um and I committed myself to then becoming a public defender where I spent most of my career [noise]\nThere's a story that we tell ourselves about our justice system that it's blind but it's just everyone is treated equally under the law but it's not true [noise] what\nWould you begin to realize very very early on as a public defender is how we defined crime policing occurs in this country who were prosecuting in our state local courts\nIs deeply deeply defined by class in by race and so I just wanted to fight for each and every one of my clients as hard as I could\nBut definitely you were pushing up against an enormous expansive criminal legal system that was not just crushing my individual clients but their families and their entire communities [noise] here's more from Robin Steinberg on the stage and\nAfraid I'm a ... fundamentals of the American psyche that it is enshrined in our constitution\nAnd yet in America\nIs addicted to imprison live from slavery is a massive ... it always has been we all know the shocking numbers the United states incarcerated more people per capita than almost any nation on the planet\nBut what you may not know is that on any given night and America almost half a million people go to sleep and those concrete gel south who have not been convicted of anything these mothers and fathers\nAnd sons and daughters are there for one reason and one reason only they cannot afford to pay the price of their freedom and that\nIs called nail\nHow much does it generally cost to post bail so when somebody is arrested um judges can set bail and an amount um in their own discretion\nI have seen it as low as a hundred dollars for the people that we represent and the clients that we see bail is typically under five thousand dollars but that is way beyond the reach of most families their families are making decisions about buying a gallon of milk for their children or putting that money towards bail\nI mean up on the next bluegrass breakdown it's the taking of something that doesn't belong to you out the

to better serve everyone and for animal rights lawyer Stephen Wise that means changing laws to better serve non human animals like eight years Steven wise\nTo say [noise] like to have you look at this pencil [noise] it's a thing [noise] it's a legal thing\nIn certain books you might have or the cars you own they're all legal thing [noise] the great age that you'll see behind me they too are legal things\nNow I can I can do that to a legal thing I can do whatever I Want to my book or my car\nThese great apes you'll see the photographs were taken by man named James ... who wrote a book called James and other apes and he tells his book how almost every one of them is an orphan saw his mother father died before his eyes they're legal things [noise]\n[noise] so so what is actually the difference between a legal thing and like a legal person [noise]\nWell since Roman times thing has been an entity who lacks the capacity for legal rights it can be a pencil it can be a computer can be a human being at the time of slavery the person is an entity who has to pass\nOne time it was a defined as a very narrow way\nLike you mean like ... men\nOr actually Freeman or persons\nBut slaves were not sometimes women were not sometimes children are not now not all human beings are considered to be persons\nDoes not have legal rights right and a person dies and basically now all humans are legal person speaking is more complicated than that right because like in the U.S corporations are considered to be legal person are they are indeed so it can you explain how\nThat works so a person and things are both in terms of art and and that's up to legislatures in courts as to what or who those entities are so for example\nIn the last few years the New Zealand parliament has designated a river as a person who has real legal rights and national park is real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia is a person who has real legal rights [noise]\nEven why these recent changes as positive steps or broadening the definition of legal persons to include animals that to cause he's been dedicated to for nearly forty years ever since he read the book animal liberation Peter Singer\nNow my red Peter Singer spoke in Nineteen eighty one I had a full head of lush brown hair and indeed I was moved by it because I've become a worry because I wanted to speak for the voiceless defend the defense list and I never realized how voiceless in defense was that billions of\nNon human animals are and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer and my Nineteen eighty five I realized that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals is that your side is trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them has also become legal persons\nNow at that time there was very little known about or spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or a legal rights for a non human out when I knew it was going to take a long time [noise]\nSo your objective at that time was to essentially [noise] change the designation of non human animals from illegal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your dream\nThat was my gum and uh in Nineteen eighty five I decided to that you would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Fifteen before I'd be ready to file the first\nLawsuits and that would have a reasonable chance of success them so much to be done and as I began to try to understand what the legal history was of slavery and freedom and rights that the\nOne critical legal move is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters [noise]\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Steven wise was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal rights\nTo animals came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nJane summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia now Twenty years later Stewart\nBroad James Somerset to London and after he got there James decided he was going to escape\nBecause he wanted to get a set of God parents because when they ... century slave one of the major responsibility the Godfather's was to help you escape and so in the fall of Seventeen Seventy one James Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stuart than James dropped out of sight\nAnd enraged Charles Stuart that hired slave captures the Kansas City of London find him bring them to shift the ana marry that was set sail for Jamaica where James was to be sold in the slave markets will now James is God parents swung into action\nThey approached the most powerful judge lord Mansfield who is chief judge of the ... bench and demanded that issue a common law of hideous corpus on behalf of James Somerset\nAnd heritage heaviest corpus it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against her will the dictator is required to bring the detainee enable legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty well lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat because James\nSummers that was a legal thing he was not eligible for a rare to have you is corpus only if he could be a legal person so lord Mansfield decided that he would assume\nWithout deciding that James Somerset was indeed a legal person and he should have your support person James his body was brought in by the captain the ship\nOr a series of hearings over the next six months on June twenty second Seventeen Seventy two lord Mansfield said that slavery was so odious [noise] that the common law would not support any order James\nFree at that moment James Somerset underwent a legal trans substantiate the free man\nWho walked out on the court room looked exactly like the slaves would walked in but as far as low as concerned they had nothing whatsoever in common\n[noise]\nSo inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your James Summers had of course a non human version of James numbers and\nI started to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield so how did you find your James how much time we began with those non human animals who we believe are cognitively complex extraordinarily so and that we can prove that so the nonhuman animal so we have the gun suing on behalf of\nSo far chimpanzees and elephants and the reason we started with chimpanzees is because of all the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of\nArticles that that detailed legal studies about the cognition of chimpanzees that we can\nGather in one place and bring to the attention of the court to make it clear that they are autonomous beings and that they are conscious that they are self conscious that they can use symbols that they have language like abilities that goes on an army filed a hundred and sixty\nPages of affidavits and we say altogether it shows that these are extraordinarily cognitively complex beings to the point of being autonomous and judge\nTo allow an autonomous being to be inflamed is something that grinds against every idea of justice and you have to step in and stop this [noise] so\nSo how did you identify the chimpanzees you wanted to represent and then where to even file a lawsuit\nWhat we did is we spent seven years looking at the law of all fifty states and twenty English speaking countries trying to understand what jurisdiction law would be reasonably on our side so we chose to stay in New York\n\nSupport for the Ted radio hour comes from like fuck lifelike with Norton works to help protect identities and the information on

and replacing them with a random selection of lawmakers\nSo I Would make it voluntarily once you've sent out ten thousand letters to random six of the population you may find that only ten or twenty percent of the population are actually interested in doing this of course if there was a financial incentive that much uh increase you would then\nThose who wish to interest in that you do a second random selection of those interests with making sure you're actually match the demographic profile of the country so I'm making sure you've had gender bounds you'd have fifty percent women in parliament this to me would already just changed the structure of the lowest\nYou would eliminate the national government wouldn't be a millionaires club you would have lots\n... to me that the laws that come out of such an institution would be so completely different uh but so much better for my perspective\nThat sort of wisdom of crowds idea that actually you need diversity bouncing ideas off each other to find the best solution and so if you exclude some part of the population for whatever reason than you are limiting that diversity\nBut I Wonder I mean if only the people who really want to be part of this are part of it than that already create a self selected group of people\nThere is a yeah that would be this on a self selection but it wouldn't be\nPeople who want that political power I mean there's also these are famous quotes by John how some people I'm not saying I'm Sorry a\nScratch the galaxy guy at Douglas Adams who talked with settlers and it's just I just got my dog of atoms saying are the people who want political power I specifically that people who you should not have political power\nUm by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of self selection if it's willing to you could also make it mandatory but I Would also proposed that if you pay these people two or three times the average wage the vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hand up for two years is that kind of income\nI Would of course probably\nWant to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have to change is one elected and one randomly selected in fact there's a\nA regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first a parliament in the world to instigate a one like the chamber in one solution chamber once will titian buddy I wouldn't be surprised if people looked at the ... and look at the elected\nChamber full of politicians busily back stabbing each other and engaging and the typical political power place and go well why do we need that for his chamber a but this is a path to old is the ideal\nSelection in politics has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware that it's going to be difficult to Institute these parliaments tried to say to your friends I think we should populated parliament with randomly selected people\nAnd we don't judge my neighbor gets chosen the full ... recycling box\nThe perhaps surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these modern examples isn't it does work if you give people responsibility they act responsibly don't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question\nIs not would this be perfect of course not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least is obviously yes [noise]\nI mean realistically if it's something that can really spread a global scale in your lifetime [noise]\nYeah we have our strategy or and that is yet to to get the students assemblies happening more and more often which seems to be happening now after the Irish citizens assemblies the u._k. government is now putting aside almost a million\nPounds to a sponsor eight to ten local citizens assemblies in the u._k. so I can see that the word is spreading once one of these things happens in the in the world maybe other people who take notice maybe it will spread I could see within my lifetime they're being for example\nA U.S state legislature with a second buddy selected bustle titian that would be an incredible first step\nAnd I guess I guess um you know ultimately\nWe'll battle to try to convince people and then in French powers to um to try this\nYes uh yeah it ... I'm not ... you're going to be a political changes ... seats\nAre especially fundamental political changed such as this but uh I'm hoping that there'll be a generation of political leaders potentially at a local city ... liberal who said yeah I Want to invite them to try something new I think our systems burgers and to notice the change\nRed headache he runs the ... foundation which advocates for random selection democracy you can find his full talk at ... dot com\n\nOn the show today ideas about hacking the law\nHow did you even start to think about what you wanted to do\nI did study law\nBecause of a kind of dreamy idea about what the law is\nThis is be back tomorrow he's a legal advocate\nThere's a philosopher ... who has this book between facts and norms and he says\nDemocracy should be this big open conversation about fundamental questions like what kind of world we want to build together\nWhat do we are one another where do we want to go together in law is the thing that takes the conclusions the findings from those conversations and turns them into actual\nRules and institutions that shape our lives and I I Love this idea of law as a kind of the thing that translates between our dreams about justice on the one hand in real life on the other hand between faction norms\nBut that is not the world we live in\nA lot of the rules in a lot of\nPlaces are decent\nBut there is a huge gap oftentimes with people who need those ruined the most have never even heard of them\nAnd um the systems that are supposed to enforce those rules are corrupt or broken\nHe began to see this problem when he was a young lawyer so he wanted to figure out a way to give the power of the law to the people\nHere seem like Mario on the stage\n[noise] I Want to tell you about someone\nI'm going to call them Ravi none that rubbish from a community of hurts people included out on the west coast of India same place my own family comes from\nWhen he was ten years old his entire community was forced to move because a multinational corporation constructed a manufacturing facility on the land where they lived\nThen Twenty years later the same company to cement factory one hundred meters from where they live now\nAnd he has got strong environmental regulations on paper but this company had violated many of them\nDust from that factory covers rub his moustache and everything he wears really says that if people or animals eat anything that grows in his village or drink the water they get sick\nRobbie has appealed to the company for years he said I've I've written so many letters my family could cremate me with that they wouldn't need to buy any would\n[laughter] he said the company ignored every one of those letters and so in two thousand Thirteen rubbing on the decided they used the last means of protest he thought he had left\nHe walked to the gates of that factory where the bucket of petrol and its head intending to set himself on fire\nRation the un estimates that worldwide four billion people live without basic access to justice but we've been choosing to ignore it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "city": "Nashville", "day": "13"}
