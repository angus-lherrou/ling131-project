foundation\n\nIt's that Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy rise in our show today ideas about who we are what makes us us\nAnd we've been talking about Ken as Sam Steinberg who's been explaining how a new gene editing technology called CRISPR calf nine could make it cheap and easy to create humans who are you basically it's acting like superheroes right like perfect vision superhuman strength perfect SAT scores right that I that\nI think that's that's the science\nFiction Association of what CRISPR it could allow [noise] we have long lists of gene variants associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like whether or not you're a morning person [noise]\nBut we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with things that might be desirable like having extra strong bones or leader muscles or lower sensitivity to pain or lower risk of Cornell heart disease and as those lists continue to grow\nWe now have the technology that could in theory you allow an individual to upgrade their genome\nBut why would that be the science fiction version if it seems like that the technologies are promising like if there was a in a way to make a child more resilient a painter or give us a hierarchy is you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that that technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably\nThere's a great example in the world of HIV aids so it turns out one to two percent of all humans have a specific genetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have\nEssentially masks theirselves and HIV virus can't get inside\nSo what a friend you know delivered it into a fertilized egg cell into a human embryo so that that future child even though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity\nWe might assume of course they would want that but it's still a game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just select the traits do inherit from their parents something we can already do with ... and genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would\nNever have gotten from their parents if it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against this thing where you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhancement or is that disease prevention is you know many people see\nThey divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of\nTwo different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think\nThere are many that far right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the with the HIV immunity genes use your five that's disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage\nAnd I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species functioning\nBut I mean I mean a part of me wonders sweeping during that you know you know what I mean like there's a process that just kind of sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be up and being that\nCruel [laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt\nSo I think this comes down to the question of how secret as the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted left alone\nOf course will be due in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient but when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years now we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual\nBut that individuals children and their children and their children and their children and so that's where I think you have this very radio issue of directing\nFuture evolution\nYou know even saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to a point where you could use the embryos to install things like HIV immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday gene variants associated with higher out you\nWere being a morning person if that's what you'd like to be that's where things really take off\n... ...\n... is working on a book about all this it's called a crack in creation gene editing and I think of all power to control evolution you can check out his ... at ... dot com\n[noise]\nToday show we're asking a very important question which is\nOkay do you have the answer do you know who we are\nI Know who I Am [laughter]\nAre you I have a a a an inkling of who we are\nThis is Steven Pinker I Am a professor of psychology at Harvard University and I write books on language mind and human nature\n[noise] so ... what what is it that makes us who we are\nWell there are some uh intricately complex circuitry in the brain are fabricated over millions of years by natural selection\nThat equipment is with a set of motives and emotions and mechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are\nOkay there's a lot to unpack hair set to begin to understand what Steven Pinker Jeff ed and to understand what accounts for the differences between us we kind of need to understand how far we've actually come in trying to figure this all out so Steven can you can you help us with a K I'll do my best\nOkay just to get us started human beings have debated\nNature versus nurture for hundreds even thousands of years that is whether who we are our personalities are behaviors are either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us that when we're born our minds are basically like blank slates\nAnd that all of a structure comes from socialize Asian culture parenting experience\nThat was Steven Pinker unattached age back in two thousand two in this idea of the blank slate it was especially popular in the second half of the twentieth century [noise] and it meant that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff like that\nMan has no nature from historian or ... you got that man has no instinct and the anthropologist actually monitor\nThe human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to non from Hochul a scientist Stephen J go\nWithout ... why should have been such an appealing notion well there are number political reasons why people have found congenial foremost as I get more blank slate and by definition we are equal because of the early ...\nRight then some people could have more of the others and according to this line of thinking that would justify discrimination and inequality another\nPolitical fear of human nature is that if we were blank slate weaken perfect mankind the angel dream of the perfect and all of the of our species through social engineering whereas if we're born with certain instincts and perhaps some of them like some damage to selfishness prejudice and violent [noise]\nFirst of all they're a number of reasons to go for the\nHuman mind is a blank slate and some of them just come from a common sense as many people have told me over the years anyone who's had more than one child knows that can come into the world with certain temperament fantastic to an all come from the outside [noise] oh and anyone who I\nHave both a child and a house that has certainly noticed that the child exposed feet full acquire is human language whereas the house that won't presumably because of some innate difference between them and anyone who's ever been in a heterosexual relationship knows that the minds of men in the minds of women are not English of um [noise]\nSo for years that debate about nature versus nurture has been just that\nThat debate it's one or the other but Steven Pinker has mainly argued that this shouldn't be a debate that who we are comes down to both our genes and our environment\nIt's a mistake to think that uh if there is an effect of the environment that shows that were blacks whites or conversely if there is such a thing as human nature than we are a robots and we're programmed to a or walk into walls and be completely insensitive to our environment

dot com [noise] on the show today what makes us\nUs [noise] can you explain what it means to be conscious like what is it [noise] consciousness is\nThe most familiar thing for any of us and we all know the difference between being conscious and not being conscious\nThis is and how fast he's a professor of neuroscience at the University of sex in the u._k.\nConsciousness of any kind of experience at all whether it's a visual experience of the world around us whether it's an emotional\nExperience of feeling sad or jealousy or happy or excited or from extra inches of intending to do something or being the cause is something that happens consciousness is the word that we use to sex inscribed\nAll the different kinds of experiences that that we can have [noise]\nI think that pretty much sympathy for conscious system there is something it is like to be that system whereas for something that isn't conscious very [noise]\nAnd how consciousness even happens and if we can recreate it artificially is a question that we're still trying to figure out because what's more fundamental about being a human then knowing we exist\n[noise] and I'll set explains more from the stage [noise]\nLast spring this question is so important because consciousness for each of us is all areas without that as well\nAs myself there's nothing at all and when we suffer we suffer consciously whether it's three mental illness or pain and if we can experience joy and suffering what about other animals\nMight they be conscious to do they have a sense of self and ask them teachers get faster and smarter maybe they'll come a point maybe not too far away when my I find develop your sense of it saying existence now I actually think the prospects for conscious I owe a pretty remarkable\nIn this story I'm going to tell you our conscious experiences of the world around us and about sounds within it\nAll kinds of control to the ... that happened with tree and because of all living ... [noise]\n\nI Love this idea of a controlled ... nation is is that is that what we experience is that how we experience the world that it's [noise]\nIt's a control to loose nation we are just essentially hallucinating all the time\nI Love the strike zone I Wish I could take credit for it but but I Can't but I Love the fries because it points out that everything that we see consciously or unconsciously but let's talk about consciousness for now is a construction of the bright I mean it's easy to think that we are\nIs revealed to us through the windows of our eyes more conscious perception is is basically just somebody sitting inside us go looking out there and I see a red tae Bo I see a passing\nLanded ... gainers fatter writers ahead\nReal back to reality [noise]\n\nThat's right but the truth is that both perceptions are acts of interpretation that acts of informed\nGuesswork that the brain appliance encounters sensory die so I think the ... the way I Can't think of this is that there is\nNo line in the skull and this may sound that\nOil is going on in the brain or electrical impulses whizzing around and blacks passing an out of all the oldest passing much in the in the Brian ... appears [noise]\nAnd in some sense we we've known this for a long time since meats and it's been pretty clear\nThat colors red yellow green seven colors and no objective properties of objects in the world they are attributes of of reflected light and and the brain the visual system will make inferences based on wavelengths of light about what color or something is\nA ... something as basic as color is not something that we just passively receive from the world we actively attribute it to things out there on the world and the idea of control to the nation is is just that\nWell this applies to everything and this applies to everything that we perceive\nAnd not just perceptions of things out there in the world but also to applies to our perceptions about self\nAbout body of our memories of a sense of agency about sensitive volition that every\nThing that we see is a construction but it's it's not a random construction its construction as a best guess that is reined in by the sensory ... times which is why most of us agree when we look at a table that we will say yeah I said well you see a table and we both see the same thing\nAnd that's because you don't just random constructions that constrained by the sensory data that we get and that's why I think the controlled hallucination is very appropriate", "year": "2018", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "city": "Nashville", "day": "07"}
