helping NPR advance journalistic excellence in the digital age\nIt to the Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy rise\nAnd on the show today ideas about cities and how we can build more humane ones and just before the break we were hearing from architect the Sean checker party in Michigan says designed could be part of the solution but it largely depends on how we use technology\nAnd technology was a big part of the problem and the twentieth century man when we invented the automobile what happened is the world all bent towards the invention and we recreated our landscape around in the twenty first century [noise]\nTechnology can be part of the solution is it bends\nTo the needs of the world\nAnd so what do I mean by that take the economist vehicle I don't think the economist vehicle as exciting as a driverless car I think what's exciting about the autonomous vehicle is the promise that we have these small urban vehicles that could safely coal mingle with ... and bicycle\nThat would enable us to design Jew main streets again streets without curves maybe streets like wouldn't walkway is on fire island\n[noise] or maybe we could design streets where's the cobblestone of the twenty first century something that captures kinetic energy melting snow helps you with your fitness when you walk [noise]\nRemember those big ladder fire trucks what if we can replace them at all the asphalt that comes with them with drones and robots that to the rescue people from burning buildings and if you think that's outlandish you'd be amazed to know how much of that technology is already being used today in rescue activity\nBut now\n[noise] imagine if we could design the hover craft wheelchair [noise]\nWrite an invention that would not only allow equal access [noise] what what enable us to build the Italian hill town of the twenty first century [noise]\nI think you'd be amazed to know that it's just a few of these adventures responsive\nTo human need would completely transformed the way we could build our city [noise]\nI mean the thing is right let's say we do transform cities into into these more humane places like with the help of technology or or whatever I mean there will still be some level of inhumanity in them right in right not is it possible to have no social scored at all\nYou know part of why I gave the talk I gave a tad was being cognizant of the fact that there are a lot of technologists in the room a technologist can be wonderful people but they can also be a bit a historical and what I was hoping to convey to a room full of technologists is we need them to invent stuff\nThat helps us feel more humane cities right firefighting drones and ... and the you know different kind of a wheelchair and so forth so we can look at all those codes and standards that we have to build with\nAnd change them so we can maybe have a kind of back to the future moment and think about what was great about cities before the twentieth century they could maybe inhabit our cities and the twenty first and twenty second century because technology is allowed us to change those standards um\nBut that's not the goal the goal is the standards are changing so we can design this infrastructure so we create some more social friction cities\nAt their best to our engines social friction so if you look at the Arab Spring\nAnd you saw what was happening interior square we saw what it was happening in Tunisia it's because cities tend to be the platform for social change in nations\nAnd social friction requires a kind of like my book I call it an infrastructure of opportunity this idea that you're building\nPublic spaces subway systems\nThe farmers' market places where people who are from different walks of life\nMeat eyeball to eyeball the social friction is fundamentally what advances civilization and I think that's really the heart of\nThe architect of a shock ... is a professor at Columbia in his latest book is called a country of\nCities a manifesto

have walked a mile\nNo shoes [noise] during Richard's time as mayor Albuquerque sun spike in its homeless population and lots more people panhandling and the streets and so it Richard Want it to come up with a more humane approach for how to deal with it\nSo I saw a gentleman on July Fifteen twenty Fifteen I Believe was the day I was on my way back to city hall from lunch meeting and he was holding a sign that says he wants a job\nAnd listen I'm a student and I'm not a genius but I went back to my staff and I said listen I saw gentleman holding a sign that said he wants a job why don't we do something different\nKatie rather than more complicated why don't we take this man at his word and I grew up in ... in Nebraska around a rural environment I knew there was dignity and work I saw people putting my grandparents and my parents work hard and there's just something about having a reason to get up in the morning and accomplish\nSomething that's been engrained in me since I was a child and so we just wanted to take that and present an opportunity\nTo worry about what happened in my city when we decided to think differently about panhandling and lift people up to the dignity of work\nHere's more from Richard bury on the head stage\nWe call it there is a better way because I Believe there's a better way to get the money than panhandling on the corner I Believe there is a better way to help your brothers and sisters and need then\nHanding a few dollars out the car window\nWe know there's ... work we also know that people are much more\nLikely to invest in themselves if they believe that there are community is willing to invest in them first and because we're all wired to be kind and compassionate it always feels good to have a couple\nOf dollars to someone that is a neat but if you talk to panhandlers many of them will tell you that your few dollars don't necessarily go towards feeding the body that go towards feeding addiction\nIs the Albuquerque the beautiful place where a mile high Sandia Mountains on the east the Rio Grande runs through the center of our city where there's always something to do always leads to a whole litter the pickup\nSo if you're going to have an initiative like this in your city you have to ask yourself to questions first one is is there anything left to do and you're studying then if there is no would you please give me your mayors phone number because I Need some advice\nThe second question you have to ask is this are you are solutions to panhandling working if you're taking a punitive approach I'm going to suggest the solutions aren't working and I know you're not getting to the root\nOf the problem in your city so if you have something to do you need people that need something to do the good news is is not that complicated [noise]\nSo so would you do we took an old van from our motor pool a an old dodge van but some tires on it I mean sure the brakes worked and uh then we reached out to St Martin's hope works in Albuquerque\nAnd we ask for their health or a nonprofit that works with the homeless and they do a lot of great things from feeding programs to housing programs to employment programs\nWe took a fifty thousand dollars we created a pilot program and we hired them to be the facilitators to do the paperwork to pay the individuals to work for the day\nTo do all of the functional things that needed to be done to run the program\nBut more importantly we had this notion that if you lift somebody up for the day they are naturally going to feel better about themselves about their circumstances somebody believed in them today and they may have an opportunity and may be inclined to try to reach out for some of the services that maybe they hadn't reached out for before so we wanted to make those available\nAnd the seven thousand jobs that have been created day jobs or through the better way program we've been able to impact or almost a sixteen or Seventeen hundred people

in Lagos, Nigeria\nBut kind of different is generally about writing these issues human rights for good on the rights of the urban poor\n... can you describe what goes is like like what what would I ... I went there mhm [laughter] so I guess it depends\nOn which legal she live in right and I think maybe this universe though where the where the genes up once and\nLike you can be in the same physical space but because of your identity or social occasion you it could be it's a completely different so for instance the illegals that I experience is different from the legal that my daughter ...\nSo you're driving down the fed mainland bridge and he looked he arrived you lived in the case may be and you can see it was on the fishing gentlemen that have\nNow been termed slums along the side of the bridge and you can leave the land feeling that's being done on the other side within reclaiming blood\nTeam in such a parking garage shooting and if you're going from the mainland to the island in the landscape of the season\nChanges the houses are bigger clearly more expensive the cause a nicer [laughter] there are traffic lights the work and you know I think we've got a list of which legal you experience you do see\nThe darkness and so the difference is among those class lens\nIMac inequality get only deep and over the past forty or fifty years and like us banks in part to an explosion and population growth and the changing economy\nClass has become much more than he meant it um class mobility is not as\nClear cut doors possible that used to be in my grandfather's generation it was it was easy to send\nOne or two children to school and have them access jobs and then have them in their siblings or their cousins to school and flew me sort of lift the whole family out of poverty in one or two generations it's and that's no longer possible\nBullets humanity bay except this idea from the ... [noise]\nThere's so much that is possible in Lagos so much that isn't very often the difference between possibility end impossibility simply who\nYou are belonging and legal she's a fluid concept determined by ethnic origin sexual orientation and gender but most visibly an often was violently cloth\nBefore when I became a country fish up people from the inland creek stuff has it come down to the legal is like ... and ... villages along the coast about sixty of leads and my grandfather alluded to audit clinically also arrived in Lagos\nOver time have you with any luck stress Korea as a land severe mapping out now bustling neighborhood's when they were just waist high wild grass\nHe died when I was nine and by that time my family like the families of those fish if people knew labor that's home\nAmong the euro by we haven't seen a coup wouldn't be willing to which can be translated to mean that leave us will welcome anyone but that seeing is becoming less and less true\nMany like oceans including the descendants of those fish of people who arrived generations before my grandfather and not being pushed out to make room for an emergent city that has been described as the new to buy\nIs he and he lost his last big dreams even if he does and successive governments have declared aspirations towards the mega city republics he does not exist\nUnfortunately instead of focusing on the eradication of poverty as you would expect the strategy of choice focuses on a diminishing the floor last up to buy the governor announced plans to demolish every single waterfront sentiment in Lagos\nThere more than forty of these indigenous communities all over the city over three hundred thousand people living in them by making a hundred year old fishing village where the population about three four times I just want to go and see where that potential for beach front luxury\n[noise] was one of the first to be targeted\nIt it's almost like [noise] and and and this happens all around the world it's it's almost like um city's much to hide people who are poor people who live in some places that that are characterized Islam's like they want to hide those places from the gaze of the world mhm\nYes to attract foreign investment you know you you have to look like we're the foreign investment is coming from the Iraqis anything that doesn't\nWeb streaming is made possible by electronic express with a comprehensive selection of smart appliances for Katie's computers and accessories for the smart home available in stores or online at electronic express dot com code W.

[noise] where do you think they're going to go\nThe conditions that cause us to define as such an neighborhoods are slums can be effectively improved but not without recognizing humanity and the agency of the people living in them\nAnd live off sweat public goods are rarely publicly available slum dwellers are often at the forefront of innovating solutions\nAfter being disconnected from the grid for months because the power company couldn't figure out how to collective one settlements designed a system that collects device Germany chances and goes everyone cheaper rates into the bucket\nAnother settlement created a reform program that hire local bad boys that security you know every chick at every high dollars so now troublemakers are more likely to get caught and fortunately for these and few of us end up in gazing criminal activity\nSums are an imperfect housing solutions but they also prime examples of the innovation adaptability and resilience at the foundation and the hot of every functional city\nWe have our own identity our own reason and as anyone in Las Vegas can tell you for Lakers are very often the source of the city's character without spoiling us would not\nBe known for its music charts and less energy or even the fact that you can buy an eyesore drink or a puppy so your car window [noise]\n\nShe spent time in some of these neighborhoods that that I guess to find a slums and what what's your experience for what were they like for you [noise]\nI mean I remember the first time I went in to [noise]\nOne from that's literally built on like an island of garbage huh that's sort of it's packed really tightened the and then it's layered with sawdust and then there was sort of some sort of carpeting or sound or something but then if you go into the place and you see the people\nWho live here and they have\nAll kinds of ... initiatives there making marginal profits on a daily basis but enough to pay their rent to send their kids to school to scale up their businesses where that's possible and to save and you realize from interacting with the people in particular that there's not that much that is so significantly\nDifferent about them and there are people who have economic wherewithal to live elsewhere who just don't want to because there's a quality of life that comes from living in such close proximity to your friends and your family and your colleagues in your church members of your the people you go to\nSupport for the Ted radio hour comes from the any e Casey foundation developing solutions to support strong families and communities to help ensure a brighter future for America's children more information is available at a E.

foundation helping NPR advanced journalistic excellent in the digital age\nIt's that Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy rise and on the show today\nIdeas about cities and how we can build more humane ones and just before the break we were hearing from architect ... ... says designed could be part of the solution but it's largely depends on how we use technology\nAnd technology was a big part of the problem and the twentieth century when we invented the automobile what happened is the world all bent towards the invention and we recreated our landscape around in the twenty first century [noise]\nTechnology can be part of the solution if it bends\nTo the needs of the world\nSo what do I mean by that take the economist vehicle I don't think the autonomous vehicle is exciting 'cause it's a driverless car I think what's exciting about the economist vehicle is the promised that we have these small urban vehicles that could safely coal mingle with pedestrians and bicycles\nTo main street the gang streets without curves maybe streets like wouldn't walkway is on fire island\n[noise] or maybe we could design streets with the cobblestone of the twenty first century something that captures kinetic energy melting snow helps you with your fitness when you walk\n[noise] remember those big ladder fire trucks what if we could replace them and all the asphalt that comes with them\nWith drones and robots that to the rescue people from burning buildings and if you think that's outlandish you'd be amazed to know how much of that technology is already being used today in rescue activity\nBut now it like you to really imagine with me [noise] imagine if we can design the hover craft wheelchair [noise]\nWrite an invention that would not only allow equal access [noise] what would enable us to build the Italian hill town of the twenty first century [noise]\nI think you'd be amazed to know that it's just a few of these adventures responsive\nTo human need would completely transformed the way we can build our city [noise]\nI mean the thing is right let's say we do transform cities into into these more humane places like with the help of technology or whatever I mean there will still be\nSome level of inhumanity in them right in the rights not is it possible to have no social scored at all [noise]\nYou know part of why I gave the talk I gave a tad was being cognizant of the fact that there are a lot of technology in the room a technologist can be wonderful people but they can also be a bit a historical and what I was hoping to convey to a room full of technologists is we need them to invent stuff\nThat helps us build more humane cities right firefighting\nDrones and ... and the you know different kind of a wheelchair and support so we can look at all those codes and standards so we have to build with\nAnd changed them so we can maybe have a kind of back to the future moment and think about what was great about cities before the twentieth century they could maybe inhabit our cities and the twenty first twenty second century because technology is allowed us to change those standards um\nBut that's not the goal the goal is those standards are changing so we can design this infrastructure so we create some more social friction cities\nAt their best our engines of social friction so if you look at the Arab Spring\nAnd you saw what was happening interior square we saw what it was happening in Tunisia it's because cities tend to be the platform\nFor social change in nation and social friction requires a kind of like in my book I call it an infrastructure of opportunity this idea that you're building\nPublic spaces subway systems the farmers' market places where\nPeople who are from different\nWalks of life meat eyeball to eyeball the social friction is fundamentally what advances civilization and I think that's really the heart of the architect\nOf Ishaan ... he's a professor at Columbia in his latest book is called a country of\nCities a manifesto for urban America you can see his full talk at ... dot com\nOn the show today buildings you name cities ideas about many of the challenges that cities now face\nWhen you were mayor for eight years you get a chance to meet people from all over\nThis is Richard Berry you is the mayor of Albuquerque New Mexico from two thousand nine to two thousand Seventeen\nAnd you'll meet people at the grocery store you'll meet people on the street you start having conversations you'll do deep dives and your community and you you start to become\nThink you understand you just haven't walked a mile\nNo shoes during which time as mayor Albuquerque sun spike in its homeless population and lots more people panhandling and the streets and Sarah but she didn't want it to come up with a more humane approach for how to deal with it\nSo I saw a gentleman on July fifteenth twenty Fifteen I Believe was the day I was on my way back to city hall from a lunch meeting and he was holding a sign that said he wants a job\nAnd listen I'm a student and I'm not a genius but I went back to my staff and I said listen I saw a gentleman holding a sign that said he wants a job why don't we do something different\nWhy don't we make government less complicated rather than more complicated why don't we take this man at his word\nAnd I grew up in ... in Nebraska around a rural environment I knew there was dignity and work I saw people putting my grandparents and my parents work hard and there's just something about having a reason to get up in the morning and accomplish something that's been engrained in\nMe since I was a child and so we just wanted to take that in present an opportunity\nTo worry about what happened in my city when we decided to think differently about panhandling and lift people up to the dignity of work\nHere's more from Richard bury on the head stage\nWe call if there is a better way because I Believe there's a better\nWay to get the money than panhandling on the corner I Believe there is a better way to help your brothers and sisters in need than handy and a few dollars out the car window we know there's dignity and work\nWe also know that people are much more likely to invest in themselves if they believe that their community is willing to invest in them first\nAnd because we're all wired to be kind and compassionate it always feels good to have a couple of dollars to someone that is a neat\nBut if you talk to panhandlers and many of them will tell you that your few dollars don't necessarily go towards feeding the body they go towards feeding addiction\nIs the Albuquerque is a beautiful place where a mile high Sandia Mountains on the east the Rio Grande runs through the center of our city where there's always something to do always leads to whole litter to pick up\nSo if you're going to have an initiative like this in your city you have to ask yourself to questions first one is is there anything left to do in your city they know the answer is no would you please give me or mayors phone number because I Need some advice\nThe second question you have to ask is this are you are solutions to panhandling working if you're taking the punitive approach honest ingest there solutions aren't working and I know you're not getting to the root of the problem in your city so if you have something to\nDo you need people that need something to do the good news is is not that complicated [noise]\nSilk so would you do we took an old van from our motor pool a little dodge van but some tires on it I mean sure the brakes worked and uh then we reached out to\nSt Martin's hope works in Albuquerque\nAnd we asked for their health or a nonprofit that works with the homeless and they do a lot of great things from feeding programs to housing programs to implement programs\nWe took a fifty thousand dollars we created a pilot program and we hired them to be the facilitators to do the paperwork to pay the individuals to work for the day\nTo do all of the functional things that needed to be done to run the program\nBut more importantly we had this notion that if you live somebody up for the day they are naturally going to feel better about themselves about their circumstances somebody believed in them today and they may have an opportunity and may be inclined to try to reach out for some of the service\nWanted
