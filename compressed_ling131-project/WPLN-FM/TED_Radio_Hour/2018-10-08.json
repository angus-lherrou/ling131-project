Steinberg who's been explaining how a new gene editing technology called CRISPR cast nine\nCould make it cheap and easy to create humans you are you're basically talking like super heroes right like perfect lesion superhuman strength perfect SAT scores right but I yeah I think that's the science fiction ...\nCould all well [noise] we have long lists\nOf various associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like whether or not you're a morning person [noise]\nBut we also have long list of gene variants that are associated with things that might be desirable like having extra strong\nBones or bean or mussels or lower sensitivity to pain or lower risk of Cornell heart\nDisease and as those lists continue to grow\nWe now have a technology\nThat could in theory [noise] allow an individual to upgrade their genome\nBut why would that be the science fiction version if it seems like the the technologies are promising like if there was a way to make a child more resilient to paint or or give us a hierarchy is you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that that technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably\nThere is a great example in the world of HIV aids so it turns out one to two percent of all humans have a specific genetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have\nEssentially masks their cells and HIV virus can't get inside so what a friend you nailed delivered it into a fertilized egg cell into a human embryo so that that future child even though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity\nWe might assume of course they would want that but it's still a game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just silly\nCan already do with ... and genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would never have gotten from their parents\nIf it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we are just saying hey just in case we're going to give you an unity against this thing that you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an ... or is that disease prevention is you know many people see\nThey divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of\nTwo different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think\nThere are many that far right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the with the HIV immunity genes CCF five that's disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage\nAnd I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species functioning but I mean\nI mean a part of me wonders sweeping feeling that you know you know what I mean like there's a process that just kind of has sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be up and being that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel [laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt\nSo I think this comes down to the question of of how sacred is the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted left alone\nOf course what we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient but when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years now we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual\nBut that individuals children and their children and their children and their children and so that's where I think you have this very radio issue of directing\nFuture evolution\nYou know even saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to a point where you could use it embryos to install things like HIV immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday gene variants associated with higher IQ\nOr being a morning person if that's what you'd like to be that's where things really take off [noise]\n[noise] [noise] ... is working on a book about all this it's called a crack in creation gene editing and the unsinkable power to control evolution you can check out his ... at ... dot com\n[noise]\nToday show we're asking a very important question which is\nOkay do you have the answer dino who we are\nI Know who I Am [laughter]\nI have a a a an inkling of where we are\nThis is Steven Pinker I Am a professor of psychology at Harvard University and I write books on language mind and human nature [noise]\nSo what what is it that makes us who we are\nWell it [noise] there are some uh intricately complex circuitry in the brain are fabricated over millions of years by natural selection\nThat equip us with a set of motives and emotions and mechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are\nOkay there's a lot to unpack hair set to begin to understand what Steven Pinker Jeff ed and to understand what accounts for the differences between us we kind of need to understand how ...\nFigure this all out just even can you can you help us with us [noise] okay I'll do my best [noise]\nOkay just to get us started human beings have debated nature versus nurture for hundreds even thousands of years that is whether who we are our personalities are behaviors\nAre either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us that when we're born our minds are basically like blank slate\nAnd that all of a structure comes from socialize Asian culture parenting experience\nThat was Steven Pinker attached age back in two thousand two in this idea of the blank slate it was especially popular in the second half of the twentieth century and it meant that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff like that man\nHas no nature from the historian or ... you got that man has no instinct and the anthropologist actually ... the human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to non from\nA scientist Stephen J gold ... why should have been such an appealing notion well there are number of political reasons why people have found congenial foremost is that if we're blank slates then by definition we are equal because we're all equals zero equals zero\nBut if something is written on the slate and some people could have more of the others and according to this line of thinking that would justify discrimination and inequality\nAnother political fear of human nature is that\nIf we were blind place we can perfect mankind the angel dream of the perfect and delivery of our species to social engineering whereas if we're born with certainly instincts and perhaps some of them can damage to selfishness prejudice and violence\nFirst of all they're a number of reasons to doubt for\nHuman mind here's a blank slate and some of them just come from a common sense as many people have told me over the years anyone who's had more than one child knows that kids come into the world with certain temperament and talented doesn't all come from the outside [noise] oh and anyone who\nHas both a child and a house that I certainly noticed that the child exposed to speech full acquire a human language whereas the house well presumably because of some in a difference between them and anyone who's ever been in a heterosexual relationship knows that feed mice and men in the minds of women are not English shovel [noise]\nSo for years the debate about nature versus nurture has been just that\nMhm mhm [noise] mhm mhm mhm mhm

futures will happen regardless\n[noise]\nCongratulations you've now completed the test you are all human [noise]\nWith writer and humorist they Frank got a couple of other great talks at ... dot com on the show today what makes us\nUs [noise] can you explain what it means to be conscious like what is it [noise] consciousness is\nThe most the millionaire thing for any of us and we all know the difference between being conscious and not being conscious\nThis is ... he's a professor of neuroscience at the University of sex in the u._k.\nConsciousness in any kind of experience at all whether it's a visual experience of the world around us whether it's an emotional\nExperience of feeling sad or jealousy or happy or excited a front experiences of intending to do something or being the cause is something that happens consciousness is the word that we use to sex\nInscribed all the different kinds of experiences that that we can have ...\nI think pretty much sympathy for conscious system there is something it is like to be that system whereas for something that isn't conscious very [noise]\nAnd how consciousness even happens\nAnd if we can recreate it artificially it's a question that we're still trying to figure out because what's more fundamental about being a human then knowing we exist\n[noise] and I'll set explains more from the pet stage\nThis question is so important because consciousness for each of us\nThat's my world that's myself there's nothing at all and when we suffer we suffer consciously whether it's through mental illness or paying and if we can experience joy and suffering what about other animals\nMight they be conscious she did they say have a sense of self and ask them teachers get faster and smarter maybe they'll come a point maybe not too far away when my iPhone develops a sense of its ... existence now I actually think the prospect for conscious I pretty much\nIn the store I'm going to tell you our conscious experiences of the world around us and about sounds within it\nAll kinds of control to ...\nThat happened with fruit and because of all living voted [noise]\n\nUm I Love this idea of a controlled whose nation is is that is that what we experience is that how\nWe experience the world that if\nIf it control to loose nation we are just essentially hallucinating all the time\nI Love the strike zone I Wish I could take credit for it but but I Can't but I Love the fries because\nIt points out that everything that we perceive consciously or unconsciously but let's talk about consciousness for now is a construction of the bright I mean it's easy to think that we are in our eyes and objective reality is revealed to us through the windows of our eyes again what\nConscious perception is is basically just in somebody's sitting inside us go looking out there and they see a red table they pass in\nAll game there's fatter writers hit\nThe real reality [noise]\n\nThat's right but the truth is that both\nPerceptions are acts of interpretation that act of informed guesswork that the brain applies encounter sensory data I think the ... the way I Can't think of this is that there is no light in the skull and as nice sounds that\nOil is going on in the brain or electrical impulses whizzing around and complex passing an out of all this over his passion making in the Brian ... appears [noise]\nAnd in some sense we we've known this for a long time since meats and it's been pretty clear that colors red yellow green seven colors and no objective properties of objects in the world they are attributes\nOf of reflected

passively receive from the world we actually attribute it to things out there on the world and the idea of control to the nation is\nIs just it will just applies to everything and this applies to
