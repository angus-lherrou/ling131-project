New York city clubs like the middle of the night just like begging to get five minutes of stage time and\nI didn't have time for audiences to be shy or uncomfortable with me so it's just part of who I Am as a comedian is I I get out there I get the fact I have a disability out of the way and then I Move on and I think because I'm move on and a strong funny ... way people are able to move on with me\nYeah because I think for most people like the idea of making fun of a disability is it's a comfortable like we're not used to that do you think so because\nI mean disability has been mocked mercilessly throughout stand up comedy on characters on television this millions made fun of all the time I think what they're not used to sing as someone with a disability\nWho's proud yeah I'm ashamed am talking about it in a way that they've never heard before but we have been mocked because like\nEven someone like me who managed to like get all the way through high school without ever being mocked her bully when I became a performer became pretty common place for people to do that to me [noise]\nA lot of people with the pie don't walk but my parents didn't believe in can't my father's monitor what you can do it yet you can can [noise]\n\nIf my three older sisters warm up and I was mopping if my three older sisters went to public school my parents were sued the school system and guarantee that I went to and if we didn't get aid we all got my mother slipper [noise]\n\nMy father taught me and I walk when I was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking I Know the tactic that he used this he wouldn't dangle a dollar bill in\nFront of me he said [noise] my inner river was very strong and\n[noise]\nWeb streaming is made possible by him capital

investors alike more at Nashville money manager dot com\nI was able to walk out five I had to be able to walk in order to be mainstream did to public school\nAnd um my father worked day and night to teach me how to walk and I think what's so amazing about this is the fact that he was told that I Would never walk and he decided that he was going to try [noise]\nWhat did you realize that you were funny [noise] [laughter] so my dream in life was to be on General Hospital I didn't know that it was funny I went to college\nFor drama and then I came back to New York city started auditioning realize no one was hiring me and I had a conversation with an amazing acting coach and she said to me why don't you do a one woman show that way you can stand out\nAnd I started looking at things like that and who did I see I saw Whoopi Goldberg\nAnd when I saw what would we go over that and saw like how she used comedy I was like wait a minute\nWhen I look at my TV the people who look like me are all comedians Richard prior\nYou know Ellen Rosie O'Donnell those were the people who were not typically beautiful possibly had disability you know how different races like Margaret Cho and I felt like comedy was how I could break through the fact that I was an other and still get on TV\nAnd so I signed up for comedy class and it worked out because I had no idea I was funny and it turned out on his therapy\n[laughter] you know it's interesting because like all these comedians that that you mentioned I mean they dealt with their demons or their challenges humor right\nAnd do you I mean do you see yourself doing that in your comedy the same way I mean do you do you see yourself as almost like kind of an advocate for for people with disabilities or offer Arabs and Muslims as well\nI've never tried to be an activist or an advocate I was telling my own story and just by telling my own story I was controversial I was telling people things they didn't know and this started post nine eleven in New York City\nMight find a nice town at the New York are American comedy festival to counter the negative images of Arabs and media and we\nAlways made sure that the comedy came first so we weren't a bunch of Arabs trying to be funny we were a bunch of comedians who just happened to be of Arab heritage and you know sometimes I just want to talk about beyond say I'm I named my cat beyond\nAnd people are like talk about guys are talking about several probably you know I'm like but I really just want to talk about beyond say that [laughter] so it gets exhausting\nHaving to constantly battle but I feel like more than ever in my life it's important now than I Do battle because having grown up with you know one fight in Jersey and one foot in the middle east\nI'm really worried about where we are right now in this country and when I did the dog I didn't know how important it was to say a Muslim in front of every one I really\n...\n... yeah\nI'll tell you what does scare me being trapped in a house haunted by the ghosts of the two thousand and eight financial crisis\nTend on how I built this story of an energy bars taste so good\nYou could where is that for the terrifying our

foundation dot org\nIt's the cat radio hour from NPR I'm Guy rush and on the show taped painfully funny ideas\nAbout humor and how it helps us deal with the chaos of life so we're just hearing from comedian again first shot and she and a group of Muslim comedians traveled around the country doing what they call social justice comedy and they were trying to\nOpen up the conversation about Islamophobia which at times required a little patience\n[laughter] yeah I I think one of the hallmarks of social justice comedy um as I call it\nIs that you remain delightful and I you know I get I get angry you know behind the scenes but when I'm In the middle of a situation I got to keep a delightful because you're just you're going to you know this is a lawyer to attract might be without any I mean that's the cliche but it's true yeah\nAround people and laughing with them is a is a joint shared experience\nLike a group mind that engaged in something kind of like fun and the negativity kind of get swept away\nThat trip took was the other comedians they turned it into a movie called the Muslims are coming in too long after he came out something happened back in New York police were and again it usually felt welcomed and accepted\nAnd hate group spent three hundred thousand dollars on an anti Muslim poster campaign with the MTA that's the New York city subway system was yours truly offensive not to mention poorly design I mean if you're going to be negative you might as well use a better Fox but [noise]\nOh why not macho own poster campaign right that does nice things about Muslim So myself fellow comedians you know be dollar decide it's lots of the fighting bigotry with delightful posters campaign\nWe raised money work with the NCAA for over five months got approved an end to we're supposed to go up\nA the NCAA decided to be the poster citing political content once they got a couple of those posters he was one of them do push-ups Muslims [noise]\nLet's see what the truth about Muslims they have great for a recipe for us are considered political by the MTA\nOr the mere mention of Muslims in a positive light what's considered political but it is it it's about justice so we have to change our fighting bigotry with delightful posters campaign fighting bigotry with a delightful lawsuit campaign [noise]\nBasically what I'm saying is a couple of dirt comedians took on a major New York city agency and the comedians one [noise]\nWith a very weird feeling I was like a blonde girls feel like oh let's\nSay [noise]\nMy work is meant to be fun it's meant to generate a connection and laughter but yeah sometimes I get means we sent hate mail sometimes I get voice mail saying that if I continued telling my jokes or they'll kill me and they'll kill my family and those death threats are definitely not funny but\nJust changing all danger I still think that social justice companies one of our best weapons [noise]\n\nReally took a lot about using comedy as a tool and there's a great moment of film or I think you're Birmingham, Alabama and it will like it was\nPretty successful yeah so I mean you know one of our stops in Birmingham, Alabama where we like set up a table called me about religion we are going to read a quote\nAnd you're going to tell us if it was all that the New Testament or the Koran\nDoes your guest right you got whatever like ridiculous prize is like an outdated calendar I've seen salivating already and we are salt and pepper shakers are also like chocolate and stuff like that way totally book stipulate for the girl who does not lead on her wedding night should be stoned to death a wrong\nWrong it is the man people guessed wrong on because they just assumed everything that was a violent um came from the Koran\nMary said my lord how can I have a son when no man has touched me\nAnd so we just we're trying to make the point that all of these tax have released on them so why would we hold Islam to a separate standard\nAnd where people surprised when they like when they found out what the truth\nIt you could even having that moment of like oh my God it's not a whole lot of difference between the three of them get [noise] incredible that means that you actually saw the wheels turning like people changing their mind even just slightly\nAbsolutely and I and that's one of the things that like I performed um in in red states and blue states and one thing that I found all over the country is that\nAmerican people are not built to hate you know what I mean they actually want to be friendly and they went off your coffee and they want to open the door for you and they want to\nBe good neighbors um and the one thing I've always found that I've said this before and it's so dorky but it's true is that if you approach people with love you're going to get loving return and that's what I found as a Muslim\nDoing very publicly Muslim things a little performing on stages throughout the country\nThat's when I found a way I like to look at it as you\nGet one person to laugh in a couple of people won't laugh and then over a lifetime you might get like a million people ... and does chuckles add up to some measure of of a popular shifted perception [noise]\nAnd that is social change [noise] but it takes time and it takes like millions of these\nChuckle [noise]\nMedia and the games are said she's the author of how to make white people\nLaugh and she also hosts a podcast called the nation you can find her full talk at ... dot com [noise]\nOn the show today painfully funny ideas about how humor can telescope with things that on their face\nAre very funny as this is this is Lisa this is Kevin real has suggested the writer and they said that the media that we have a few murders these patients\nSo that makes sense that she's ... she's ready to go\nOut of it was marvelous [noise]\nSo obviously being funny is what Kevin does for a living\nBut being funny is also a way he deals with like humor I think is either kind of like an invitation or a ... like you can use humor to keep people on the outside of your life and that's what I did as a as a young\nPerson when I was really struggling I never wanted anyone to see what was going on and so my defense mechanism was humor\nBut I also think that humor can be this invitation into ideas or thoughts\nAnd stories that might otherwise be too uncomfortable and heavy because there's no sort of redemptive narrative within them for Kevin humor was a way to deal with his depression\nBut at least in the beginning\nIt was more of a shield than an invitation\nWhen I was Thirteen Years old my best friend at the time in Jordan McGregor passed away in a car accident and\nIt was an experience that really radically changed my life and when he died it just ripped everything out of me and felt like I was shattered in just a million different pieces I mean it's a kind of grief that\nTo this day I kinda really struggled to put accurate words and language around it because it was just so overwhelming but that was my first experience with this really intense feeling of grief and loss and depression\nAnd then from Thirteen to Seventeen kind of fluctuated in and out of\nThese what I might call seasons of depression where it just felt like it would come in waves\nTwo three months I Would be really dark helpless place\n\nBut I was fighting that secretly middle west I didn't want people to see that I didn't think it was okay to talk about it and so that became this extra weight or you know shame and embarrassment and killed", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "27"}
