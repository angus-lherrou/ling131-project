[noise] like to have you look at this pencil [noise] it's a thing [noise] it's a legal thing [noise]\nIt's our books you might have or the cars you own they're all legal thing [noise] the great age that you'll see behind me they too are legal things\nNow I can I can do that to a legal thing I can do whatever I Want to my book or my car\nThese great apes you'll see the photographs were taken by man named James ... who wrote a book called James and other apes and he tells his book out almost every one of them is an orphan saw his mother father died before his eyes the legal things [noise]\nSo so what is actually the difference between a legal thing and like a a legal person [noise]\nBut well since Roman times thing has been an entity who lacks the capacity for legal rights it can be a pencil it can be a computer can be a human being at the at the time of slavery\nThe person is an entity who has the capacity for one or more legal rights at one time it was a defined as a very narrow way\nI mean like you mean like ... men\nOr actually free men were persons but slaves were not sometimes women were not sometimes children were not now not all human beings are considered to be persons [noise]\nDoes not have legal rights right and a person dies and basically now all humans are legal person's thinking it's more complicated than that right because like in the U.S corporations are considered to be legal persons uh they are indeed so it can you explain how\nThat works so a person and things are both terms of art and and that's up to legislatures in courts as to what or who those entities are so for example\nIn the last few years the New Zealand parliament has designated a river as a person who has real legal rights in national park is real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia is a person who has real legal rights [noise]\nEven why these recent changes as positive steps toward broadening the definition of legal persons to include animals that to cause he's been dedicated to for nearly ... years ever since he read the book animal liberation like Peter Singer\nNow my red Peter Singer spoke in Nineteen eighty one I had a full head of lush brown hair and and indeed I was moved by it because I become a worry because I wanted to speak for the voiceless descended defenseless and I'd never realized how voiceless and defenseless that billions of\nNon human animals are and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer and by Nineteen eighty five I realized that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals is that your side is trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them had also become\nThere was very little known about her spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or legal rights for a non human on one I knew it was going to take a long time [noise]\nSo your objective at that time was to essentially [noise] changed the designation of non human animals from illegal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your dream\nNot what you might go home and uh in Nineteen eighty five I decided that he would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Fifteen before I'd be ready to file the first\nLawsuits and that would have a reasonable chance of success that so much have to be done and as I began to try to understand what the legal history was of of slavery and freedom and rights that the\nOne critical legal move is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Steven wise was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal rights\nTo animals came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nJames Summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia now Twenty years later Stewart brought James Somerset to London and\nAfter he got there James decided he was going to escape one of the first things he did was to get himself baptize because he wanted to get a set of God parents because when they see a century slave one of the major responsibilities of Godfather's was to help you escape\nAnd so in the fall of Seventeen Seventy one James Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stuart than James dropped out of sight\nAnd enraged Charles Stuart than hired slave captures the Kansas City of London find him bring them to shift the anti marry that was to set sail for Jamaica where James was to be sold in the slave markets well now James is God parents swung into action\nThey approached the most powerful judge lord Mansfield who is chief judge of the quarter kings bench and demanded that issue a common law written the heaviest corpus on behalf of James Somerset\nAnd I hate to say this corpus it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against her will the painters required to bring the detainee in and give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty well lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat because of James\nSomerset was a legal thing he was not eligible for a writ of habeas corpus only if you could be a legal person so lord Mansfield decided that he would assume\nWithout the Saudi not Jane Somerset was indeed a legal person and he should have just corpus and James his body was brought in by the captain to shift there were a series of hearings over the next six months on June twenty second Seventeen Seventy two lord Mansfield said that slavery was so odious [noise] that's a common law would not support\nIn the order James Frey had that moment James Somerset underwent a legal\nTrans substantiate the free man\nWho walked out of the court room looked exactly like the slaves had walked in but as far as low as concerned they had nothing whatsoever and a common\n[noise]\nSo inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your James Summers that of course a non human version of James Harrison\nStarted to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield so how did you find your James how much time we began with those non human\nComplex extraordinarily so and that we can prove that so the nonhuman animal so we have the gun suing on behalf of so far chimpanzees and elephants and the reason we started with chimpanzees is because of all the hundreds and hundreds\nAnd hundreds of\nArticles that detailed legal studies about the cognition of chimpanzees that we can\nGather in one place and bring to the attention of the court to make it clear that they are autonomous beings and that they are conscious that they are self conscious that they can use symbols that they have language like abilities that goes on an army filed a hundred and sixty\nPages of affidavits and we say altogether it shows that these are extraordinarily cognitively complex beings to the point of being autonomous and judge\nTo allow an autonomous being to being slaves is something that grinds against every idea of justice and you have to step in and stop this [noise]\nSo so how did you identify the chimpanzees you want to represent and then where to even file a lawsuit\nWhat we did is we spent seven years looking at the law of all fifty states and twenty English speaking countries trying to understand what jurisdiction the law would be reasonably on our side so we chose to the state of New York\nOnce we understood that we decided to simultaneously file suits on behalf of all five chimpanzees who we could identify who are being held captive in the state of\nNew York and where were they being held captive\nWell Hercules in Leo were being held captive at Stony Brook university at the age of two professors had taken them from their mothers and\nWe're keeping them in a cage in the basement of the computer building and they they were being used\nMore life lock dot com from constant contact who's email marketing tools help small businesses and nonprofits connect with their customers learned more

improve human health it's that\nTed radio hour from NPR I'm Guy Raj and on the show today ideas about hacking the law and we're just hearing from Brett headache who's advocating for getting rid of elections and replacing them with a random selection of lawmakers\nSo I I Would make a voluntary once you've sent out ten thousand lettuce to random sexual the population you may find that only ten or twenty percent of the population are actually interested in doing this of course if there was a financial incentive that much uh increase you would then\nFor those who were still interest in that you do a second random selection as I was interested in making sure you actually match the demographic profile of the country so I'm making sure you had gender bounds you'd have fifty percent women in parliament this to me would already just change the structure of the lowest\nYou would eliminate the national government wouldn't be a millionaire club you would have lots of working class people lots of fulltime cares and to me the the laws that come out of such an institution would be so completely different but so much better for my perspective\nThat sort of wisdom of crowds idea that actually you need diversity bouncing ideas off each other to find the best solution and so if you exclude some part of the population for whatever reason than you are limiting that diversity\nBut I Wonder I mean if only the people who really want to be part of this are part of it government already create a self selected group of people\nThere is a yeah that would be this on a self selection but it wouldn't be people who want that political power I mean there's also these are famous quotes by John how some people\nI'm not saying I'm Sorry I'm ... got to the galaxy going out Douglas Adams ducked with settlers and it's just I just got my dog goes out and saying are the people who want political power I specifically that people who you should not have political power\nUm by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of self selection if it's willing to you could also make it mandatory but I Would also proposed that if you pay these people two or three times the average wage\nThe vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hands up for two years is that kind of income I Would\nOf course probably want to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you'd have to chambers one elected and one randomly selected in fact there's a\nA regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first a parliament in the world to instigate a one elected chamber in one school tuition chamber once will titian buddy I wouldn't be surprised if people look at the ... chamber and look at the elected chamber full of politicians\nBusily back stabbing each other and engaging in the typical political out place and go well why do we need that for his chamber a but this is a tough too old is the ideal\nSelection in politics has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware\nParliament try this side of your friends I think we should populated out parliament with randomly selected people\nWe don't judge my neighbor gets chosen the full ... separate whose recycling box\nThe perhaps surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these modern examples isn't it does work if you give people responsibility they act responsibly don't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question\nIs not would be perfect of course not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least is obviously yes\nI mean realistically is is this something that can really spread on a global scale in your lifetime\nYeah we have our strategy a and that is yet to to get the students assemblies happening more often which seems to be happening now after the Irish citizens\nAssemblies the u._k. government is now putting aside almost a million pounds to a sponsor eight to ten local citizens assemblies in the u._k. so I can see that the word is spreading once one of these things happens in the in the world maybe other people will take notice maybe ... spreads\nI could see within my lifetime they're being for example a U.S state legislature with a second buddies selected by association that would be an incredible first step\nAnd I guess I guess um you know ultimately it's a huge surely a meal battle is to try to convince people and then in French powers to um detritus\nYes ah yeah I'm not ... I think it will be easy a political changes have ... seats are especially fundamental political changed such as this but uh I'm hoping that there'll be a generation of political leaders potentially at a local to the state level who say yeah I Want to\nInnovate on to try something new I think half systems birth to notice that change [noise]\nRead headache he runs the ... foundation which advocates for random selection democracy you can find his full talk at ... dot com\n\nOn the show today ideas that hacking the law\nHow did you even start to think about what you wanted to\nI did study law\nBecause of a kind of dreamy idea about what the law is this is\n... he's a legal advocate\nThere's this last year getting ... who has this book between facts and norms and he says democracy should be this big open conversation about fundamental questions like what kind of world we want to build together\nWhat are we are one another where we want to go together in that law is the thing that takes the conclusions the findings from those conversations and turns them into actual rules and institutions that shape our lives and I I Love this idea of law as a kind of\nThe thing that translates between our dreams about justice on the one hand and real life on the other hand between faction norms but that is not the world we live in\nA lot of the rules in a lot of places are decent\nBut there's a huge get oftentimes people who need those rules the most have never even heard of them\nAnd um the systems that are supposed to enforce those rules are corrupt or broken\nOr both\nBegan to see this problem when he was a young lawyer so he wanted to figure out a way to give the power of the law\nBig Mario on the head stage [noise] I Want to tell you about someone\nI'm going to call them Ravi none the rubbish from a community of hurts people included up on the west coast of India same place my own family comes from\nWhen he was ten years old his entire community was forced to move because a multinational corporation constructed a manufacturing facility on the land where they lived\nThen Twenty years later the same company they'll just met factory one hundred meters from where they live now\nAnd he has got strong environmental regulations on paper but this company has violated many of them\nDust from that factory covers rub his moustache and everything he wears really said that if people or animals eat anything that grows in his village or drink the water\nThey get sick\nRubbing has appealed to the company for years he said I've I've written so many letters my family could pre made me with that they wouldn't need to buy any would\n[laughter] he said the company ignored every one of those letters and so in two thousand Thirteen rubbing none to decided to use the last means of protests he thought he had left\nHe walked to the gates of that factory with a bucket of patrol in his head intending to set himself on fire\nRavi is not alone in his desperation the un estimates that worldwide four billion people live without basic access to justice but we've been choosing to ignore it\nRight now in Sierra Leone\nIn Cambodia in Ethiopia\nFarmers are being cajoled into putting their film prints on fifty year lease agreements\nSending away all the land they've ever known for a ... without anybody even explaining the terms right now in the United states in India in Slovenia people like Ravi are raising their children in the shadow\nOf factories are mines that of poisoning their air and their water", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "14"}
