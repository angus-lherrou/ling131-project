explaining how a new gene editing technology called CRISPR cast nine could make it cheap and easy to create humans you are you're basically talking like super heroes right like perfect vision superhuman strength perfect SAT scores right the right to\nYou I think that's that's the science fictional vision of what\nCRISPR could well [noise] we have long lists\nOf various associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like whether or not you're a morning person\nBut we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with things that might be desirable like having extra strong\nBones or leader muscles or lower sensitivity to pain or lower risk of Cornell heart\nDisease and as those lists continue to grow\nWe now have the technology that could in theory\n[noise] allow an individual to upgrade their genome\nBut why would that be the science fiction version if it seems like that the technologies are promising like if there was a way to make a child more resilient to paint or or give us a higher accused you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that the technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably\nThere's a great example in the world of HIV aids so it turns out one to two percent of all humans have a specific genetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have\nEssentially masks their cells and the HIV virus can't get inside\nSo what a friend you know delivered it into a fertilized egg cell into a human embryo so bad that future child even though neither his or her parents have the mutation will still have HIV immunity\nWe might assume of course they would want that but it's still a game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just\nSomething we can already do with ... and genetic testing but kind of installing new\nVariance into their genome that they would never have gotten from their parents if it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition\nLike ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the thing that you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhancement or is that disease prevention is you know many people see\nThey divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of\nTwo different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think\nThere are many that far right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the with the HIV immunity genes your five that's disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage\nAnd I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species functioning but\nI mean I mean a part of me wonders sweeping\nGiving that you know you know what I mean like there's a process that just kind of sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be up and being that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel\n[laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt\nSo I think this comes down to the question of of how sacred is the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted left alone of course what we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient\nBut when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years now we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual\nBut that individuals children and their children and their children and their children and so that's where I think you have this very rainy issue of directing future evolution\nYou know even saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to a point where you could use it him embryos to install things like HIV immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday gene variants associated with higher IQ\nOr being a morning person if that's what you'd like to be that's where things really take off [noise]\n[noise] hamster in Derek is working on a book about all this it's called a crack in creation gene editing and I think of all power to control evolution you can check out his attack at ... dot com\n[noise]\nToday show we're asking a very important question which is\nWho are we [noise] okay what do you have the answer dino who we are\nI Know who I Am [laughter]\nI'm Sorry your I ever had an inkling of where we are\nThis is Steven Pinker I Am a professor of psychology at Harvard University and I write books on language mind in human nature [noise]\nSo what what is it that make us who we are\nWell it [noise] there are some uh intricately complex circuitry in the brain are fabricated over millions of years by natural selection\nThat equipped says with a set of motives and emotions and mechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are\nThere's a lot to unpack hair set to begin to understand what Steven Pinker Jeff ed and to understand what accounts for the differences between us we kind of need to understand\nIn trying to figure this all out just even can you can you help us with this okay I'll do my best\n[noise] okay just to get us started human beings have debated nature\nVersus nurture for hundreds even thousands of years that is whether who we are our personalities are behaviors are either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us that when we're born our minds are basically like blank slate\nAnd that all of a structure comes from socialize Asian culture parenting experience\nThat was Steven Pinker attached age back in two thousand two in this idea of the blank slate it was especially popular in the second half of the twentieth century and it meant that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff like that\nMan has no nature from historian or ... you got that man has no instincts from the anthropologist actually ... the human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to non from\nHochul a scientist Stephen J gold ... why should have been such an appealing notion well there are number political reasons why people are found congenial foremost is a year for blank slates then by definition we are equal because we're all equals zero equals zero\nBut if something is written on the plate and some people could have more of the others and according to this line of thinking that would justify discrimination and inequality and other\nPolitical fear of human nature is that if we were blind place we can perfect mankind the angel dream of perfect and all of the of our species through social engineering whereas if we're born with certainly instinct and perhaps some of them can damage to selflessness prejudice and violent [noise]\nFirst of all there a number of reasons to go for a human mind here's a blank slate and some of them just come from common sense as many people have\nTold me over the years anyone who's had more than one child knows that kids come into the world with certain temperament and talented doesn't all come from the outside [noise] oh and anyone who\nHas both a child and a house that has certainly noticed that the child exposed speech for require human language whereas the house well presumably because of some difference between them than anyone has ever been in a heterosexual relationship knows that the minds of men in the minds of women are not English civil [noise]\nSo for years the debate about nature versus nurture has\nBeen just a debate it's one or the other but Steven Pinker has mainly argued that this shouldn't be a debate that who we are\nMhm mhm [noise] mhm [noise] mhm mhm mhm mhm [noise]\nMhm\nSupport for the Ted radio

have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species functioning\nBut I mean I mean a part of me wonders sweeping during that you know you know what I mean like there's a process that just kind of sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be up and being that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel\n[laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt\nSo I think this comes down to the question of of how sacred is the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted left alone of course what we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient\nBut when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years now we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual\nBut that individuals children and their children and their children and their children and so that's where I think you have this very radio issue of directing future evolution\nYou know even saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to the point where you could use it him embryos to install things like HIV immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday gene variants associated with higher IQ\nOr being a morning person if that's what you'd like to be that's where things really take off [noise]\n[noise]\n... is working on a book about all this it's called a crack in creation gene editing and I think will power to control an illusion you can check out his ... at ... dot com\n[noise]\nToday show or asking a very important question is\nWho are we [noise] okay [noise] like you have the answer dino who we are\nI Know who I Am [laughter] either you're I ever had an inkling of where we are Steven Pinker I Am a professor of psychology at Harvard University and I write books on language mind and humidity\nWhat what is it that makes us who we are\nWell it there are some uh intricately complex circuitry in the brain a fabricated over millions of years by natural selection\nBetter equipped says with a set of motives and emotions and mechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are\nOkay there's a lot to unpack here so to begin to understand what Steven Pinker just fed and to understand what accounts for the differences between us we kind of need to understand how far we've actually come in trying to figure this all out just even can you can you help us with this okay I'll do my best\n[noise] okay just to get us started human beings have debated nature\nVersus nurture for hundreds even thousands of years that is whether who we are our personalities are behaviors are either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us that when we're born our minds are basically like blank slates\nAnd that all of a structure comes from socialize Asian culture parenting experience\nThat was Steven Pinker ... stage back in two thousand two in this idea of the blank slate it was especially popular in the second half of the twentieth century and it meant that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff like that man\nHas no nature from historian or tell you that you got that man has no instinct and the anthropologist actually monitor gear the human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to non from\nA scientist Stephen J gold ... why should have been such an appealing notion well there are number of political reasons why people are found congenial for most is that if we're blank slate and by definition we are equal because we're all equals zero equals zero\nBut if something is written on the slate than some people could have more of an others and according to this line of thinking that would justify discrimination and inequality another\nPolitical sphere of human nature is that if we were blind way we can perfect mankind the angel dream of the perfect and all of the of our species through social engineering whereas if we're born with certain instincts and perhaps some of them come down to south listeners prejudice and violence [noise]\nFirst of all there are a number of reasons to doubt the human mind here's a blank slate and some of them just come from a common sense as many people have\nTold me over the years anyone who's had more than one child knows that kids come into the world with certain temperament and pass it doesn't all come from the outside [noise] oh and anyone who\nHas both a child and a house that I certainly noticed that the child exposed speech for require human language whereas the house won't presumably because of some difference between them than anyone who's ever been in a heterosexual relationship knows that the minds of men in the minds of women are not English of um [noise]\nSo for years the debate about nature versus nurture has been\nJust a debate it's one or the other but Steven Pinker has mainly argued that this shouldn't be a debate that\nBoy [noise]\n\nSupport for the Ted radio hour comes from the
