been explaining how a new gene editing technology called CRISPR cast nine could make it cheap and easy to create humans who are you're basically talking like superheroes right like perfect vision superhuman strength perfect SAT scores right\nThose are the you know I think that's that's the science fiction association of what\nCRISPR could aware [noise]\nWe have long lists of gene variants associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like whether or not you're a morning person [noise] but we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with things that might be desirable like having extra strong\nBones or bean or mussels or lower sensitivity to pain or lower risk of Cornell heart disease\nAnd as those lists continue to grow\nWe now have the technology that could in theory\nYou allow an individual to upgrade their genome\nBut why would that be the science fiction version if it seems like the the technologies are promising like if there was a way to make a child more resilient to pain or or give us all hierarchy is you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that the technology is\nBecause we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably\nThere's a great example in the world of HIV aids so it turns out one to two percent of all humans have a specific genetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have\nEssentially masks their cells and the HIV virus can't get inside\nSo what a friend you know delivered it into a fertilized egg cell into a human embryo so that that future child even though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity we might assume of course they would want that but it's still\nA game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just select the traits do inherit from their parents something we can already do with ... and genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would\nNever have gotten from their parents if it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against their finger you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhancement or that disease prevention is you know many people see\nThey divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of two different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think there are many that far right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the with the HIV immunity genes CCF five\nThat's disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage and I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species functioning but\nI mean I mean a part of me wonders sweeping giving that you know you know what I mean like there's a process that just kind of sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we completely be up and said that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel\n[laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt\nSo I think this comes down to the question of of how sacred is the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted left alone of course but we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient\nBut when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years now we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual\nBut that individuals children and their children and their children and their children and so that's where I think you have this very radio issue of directing future evolution\nYou know even\nSaying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to a point where you could use it him embryos to install things like HIV immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday gene variants associated with higher IQ\nOr being a morning person if that's what you'd like to be that's where things really take off [noise]\n[noise] [noise] ... is working on a book about all this it's called a crack in creation gene editing and I think of all power to control evolution you can check out his attack at ... dot com\n[noise]\nHow can they show we're asking a very important question is\nOkay [noise] like you have the answer dean or no\nAre you I ever had a an employer who we are\nThis is Steven Pinker I Am a professor of psychology at Harvard University and I write books on language mind in human nature\nSo get what what is it that makes us who we are\nWell it [noise] there are some uh intricately complex circuitry in the brain a fabricated over millions of years by natural selection\nThat he quips us with a set of motives and emotions and mechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are\nOkay there's a lot to unpack here so to begin to understand what Steven Pinker just sad and to understand what accounts for the differences between us\nWe kind of need to understand how far we've actually come in trying to figure this all out just even can you can you help us with this okay I'll do my best [noise]\nOkay just to get us started human beings have debated nature versus nurture for hundreds even thousands of years that is whether who we are our personalities are behaviors\nAre either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us that when we're born our minds are basically like blank slates\nAnd that all of a structure comes from socialize Asian culture parenting experience\nThat was Steven Pinker unattached age back in two thousand two in this idea of the blank slate it was especially popular in the second half of the twentieth century and it meant that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff like that\nMan has no nature from the historian or ... you got that man has no instinct and the anthropologist actually want to give the human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to non from\nA scientist Stephen J goals ... why should have been such an appealing notion well there are number political reasons why people are found congenial foremost if I if we're blank slates then by definition we are equal because we're all equal zero equals zero\nBut if something is written on the plate and some people could have more of an others and according to this line of thinking that would justify discrimination and inequality another\nPolitical fear of human nature is that guy if we were blind way we can perfect mankind the angel dream of the perfect ability of our species through social engineering whereas if we're born with certainly interesting than perhaps some of them like some damage to selflessness prejudice and violence [noise]\nFirst of all there are a number of reasons to\nHuman mind here's a blank slate and some of them and just come from the common sense as many people have told me over the years anyone who's had more than one child knows that kids come into the world with certain temperament and pass it doesn't all
