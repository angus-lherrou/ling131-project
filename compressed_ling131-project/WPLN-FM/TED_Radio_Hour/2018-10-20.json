the show ideas about food a connection to it and its power to change so much\nAbout the way we live I just bought a bottle of water and on the label is head gluten free\nInterest as well and it is [laughter] this is food writer Mark Bittman truth in advertising and marketing describing\nHow over the past fifty years corn and soy and wheat have become staples of the western diet\nThing led to another corn and wheat and soy were easy to trade and easy to ship and easy to sell an easy to process\nAnd the government's through direct and indirect subsidies encouraged the growth of what we now call mama cropping which means really really big fields or hundreds and hundreds of acres at a time\nPlanted in one crop in endless rows that are all cultivated an harvested mechanically um but if you look in the late Nineteen thoroughly twenty century of it what was being grown in Iowa\nIowa was I think the country's biggest or second biggest producer of tomatoes that was a huge producer of apples I mean this is a place where almost anything can be grown in our most just in Iowa and again you can't believe ... drives through miles and miles of corn and soybeans and it's nothing else but corn and soybeans\nGot what to do with it yeah so now you know the principal uses of those two crops are animal feed biofuels Ehsan ... and then corn and soy oils for frying and highly processed food made out of corn and soy\nSo we got the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contained as many Soyuz corn products as could be crammed into it home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the tubes there were fewer meals with Tom cook breads desserts and soups\nBecause all of them can be bought and any store not that they are any good but they were there most bombs cook like mine a piece of royal made a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup cans fruit salad maybe a baked or mashed potatoes or\nThe stupidest food ever minute rice\nFor dessert store bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so I can say this now\nThis kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself and it wasn't all bad\nBy the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens they became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians we weren't all hippies either\nSome of us reading and good restaurants and learning how to cook well meanwhile food production had become industrial industrial\nSadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma it's not actually killed\nBy the seventies home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were surfing at home\nAt the same time masses of women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden so now you got your pizza night so you got your microwave lights you got your grazing nights you got your fend for yourself nights and so on [noise]\nLeading the way what's leading the way me junk food cheese the very stuff that will kill you\nGet ... and ... like what you're saying earlier ally that has to do with with the fact that like one thing we ship food all over the world right [noise] you know I think part of the problem\nIs in and this didn't go back to cooking because\nOne of the problems with the way that we think about food right now is that we expect to have any food we want within minutes\nIf you want to mango you're gonna be able to get a mango if you want it tomato you're going to be able to get a tomato well that is really not sustainable so if we start thinking more seasonally if we start cooking at home more with ingredients that are\nUm I think appropriate might be the right word man I'm Talking about more root vegetables and winter beats and turnips and potatoes and so on were really eating much more in tune with what nature is offering us and what nature is offering us is abundant it's just not everything\nSo I mean you are an omnivore you need everything but you you are a guy that a lot of people gonna let you and say okay well you you've written all these books you or a food to eat like I think of my Batman and food and so we want to know what we should kind of eat well\nI Do think you know I did this book called the basics the before six for\nA few years ago and um\nBasically it's a strategy the more plants by saying let's be very strictly vegan until dinner time and then do whatever but I you know I think that the rules are very very simple I think the rules are one defining what food is often it's things that don't have labels and you know the head of broccoli doesn't need a label because that are broccoli\nWhat food is eat only that and then within that category eat as many plants as you can as you can eat\nThat's it yeah\nWithin those rules do eat what you like to eat and you're going to have a good diet\n\nOverconsumption of animals and of course junk food is the problem along with our poultry consumption of plants now there is no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here but the evidence is that plants and I want to make this clear and it's not the ingredients and plants it's the plants it's not the beta carotene it's the carrots\nThe evidence is very clear that plants promote health this evidence is overwhelming this point you eat more plants you eat less other stuff you live longer not bad\nBut back to animals in junk food we don't need either of them for health both have been marketed heavily creating unnatural demands were not foreign craving whoppers or Skittles\nWe have to take matters into our own hands not only by advocating for better diet for everyone that's the hard part but by improving our own and that happens to be quite easy just simple formula seafood eat real\nFood [noise]\nWe can continue to enjoy our food and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals were reduced not only calories but our carbon footprint\nWe can make food more important not less and save ourselves by doing so we have to choose that path thank you [noise]\nFood writer Mark Bittman you can see his entire attack at Ted dot com [noise] um well I Know you have to leave marks thank you thank you for doing this and I say the one one of the things I really miss being paleo now for the next ... who knows how long\nIs a great recipe that you put out years ago was that pasta as typing spaghetti or deans bread crumbs\nRe only about the great use of sardines great how can you not eat pasta why the hell you can get sweet potatoes pasta which is why we shouldn't have come from a housing bust is going to Julia\nOkay so marked him as saying that that like forty percent of stuff in grocery stores isn't real food but but if you have to estimate what what percentage of the stuff in grocery stores has added sugar\nI don't have to estimate of Seventy four percent ... act Seventy four percent of all of the food in the store\nHas been spiked with added sugar in some fashion [noise] hidden in plain sight Oh absolutely\nThis is Dr Robert ... is a pediatrician and a researcher at the University of California in San Francisco so there are fifty six names for sugar I mean did you know to know it was shown on digital dimmer are that's even has the most famous now apple\nPuree or evaporated change yeah my favorite because cages so you know just healthy guy yeah what happens when you evaporate cages you get sugar\nEver let's take studies sugar how they manage to sneak its way into our diet and what it does to our bodies\nWe've replaced a real food diet where they process food diet because it's cheaper it's portable it's convenient kids like it and it's addictive\nAnd that's the story of how I became I sustain her she'd simple right you can do the same you're going to support WPN and if you

constructing something they don't have the experience but I felt about it and the brain kind of fills in the rest of the details of what they think they thought they were reaching\nOur most chefs that you talked to are they on board with with your ideas do do they think yeah it is it is about the experiences right or they or did they say that is just totally absurd it's all about the food and the
