listened\nAnd it just suddenly struck me want to I just go home and start to do things differently\nI got an a train and I just made up incredible edible [laughter] and it was a really simple model really simple um it was just like to imagine him whatever we live in a ... a neighborhood our tone a village whatever works with any scale we punted edible landscapes everywhere\nThat we could you

I'm the label is head\nGluten free injured well and it is [laughter] this is food writer Mark Bittman truth in advertising and my friend\nDescribing how over the past fifty years corn and soy and wheat and become staples of the western diet\nOne thing led to another corn and wheat and soy were easy to trade and easy to ship and easy to sell and easy to process\nAnd the government's through direct and indirect subsidies encouraged the growth of what we now call mama cropping which means really really big fields of hundreds and hundreds of acres at a time\nPlanted in one crop in endless rows that are all cultivated an harvested mechanically um but if you look in the late Nineteen thoroughly twenty century or what was being grown in Iowa\nIowa was I think the country's biggest their second biggest producer of tomatoes that was a huge producer of apples I mean this is a place where almost anything can be grown now you know just in Iowa and again you can't believe the drive through miles and miles of corn and soybeans and it's nothing else but corn and soybeans\nOnce you have that stuff you have to figure out what to do with it yeah so now you know the principal uses of those two crops are animal feed\nBiofuels ethanol and then corn and soy oils for frying and highly processed food made out of corn and soy\nSo we got the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contains as many Soyuz corn products as could be crammed into it home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the tubes there were fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts and soups\nBecause all of them can be bought and any store not that they are any good but they were there most bombs cook like mine a piece of royal made a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup cans fruit salad maybe baked or mashed potatoes or perhaps the stupidest food ever minute rice\nFor dessert store bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so I can say this now\nThis kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself and it wasn't all bad\nBy the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians we weren't all hippies either\nSome of us reading and good restaurants and learning how to cook well meanwhile food production had become industrial industrial\nSadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma it's not actually killed\nBy the seventies home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of food like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were surfing at home\nAt the same time masses of women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden so now you got your pizza night so you got your microwave nights you got your grazing nights you got you\nLeading the way what's leading the way me junk food she is the very stuff that will kill you\nGet ... and ... like what you're saying earlier a lot of that has to do with with the fact that like one thing we ship food all over the world right [noise] yeah I think part of the problem\nIs you know and this can go back to cooking because\nOne of the problems with the way that we think about food right now is that we expect to have any food we want within minutes\nIf you want a mango you're going to be able to get a mango if you want it to ... you're going to be able to get a tomato well that is really not sustainable so if we start thinking more seasonally if we start cooking at home more with ingredients that are\nUm I think appropriate might be the right word I'm and I'm Talking about more root vegetables in winter beats and turnips and potatoes and so on were really eating much more in tune with what nature is offering us and what nature is offering us is abundant it's just not everything\nSo I mean you are an omnivore you need everything but you you are a guy that a lot of people that look to and say okay well you you've written all these books you or a food to eat like I think of mock Batman and food and so we want to know what we should kind of eat well\nI Do think you know I Do this book called the basics vegan before six and a few years ago and um\nBasically it's a strategy the more plants by saying let's be very strictly vegan until dinner time and then do whatever but I you know I think that the rules are very very simple I think the rules are one defining what food is often it's things that don't have labels and you know a a head of broccoli doesn't need a label because that are broccoli we know what's in broccoli\nUm defined what food is eat only that and then within that category eat as many plants as you can as you can eat\nThat's it yeah\nWithin those rules do eat what you like to eat and you're going to have a good diet\n[noise]\nOverconsumption of animals that of course junk food is the problem along with our poultry consumption of plants now there is no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here but the evidence is that class and I want to make this clear and it's not the ingredients and plants it's the plants it's not the beta carotene it's the carrots\nThe evidence is very clear that plants promote health this evidence is overwhelming at this point you eat more plants you eat less other stuff you'll live longer not bad\nBut back to animals and junk food we don't need either of them for health votes have been marketed heavily creating on natural demand we're not orange craving whoppers or Skittles we have to take matters into our own hands\nOnly by advocating for a better diet for everyone that's the hard part but by improving our own and that happens to be quite easy to simple formula eat food eat real food [noise]\nWe can continue to enjoy our food and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals were reduced not only calories but our carbon footprint we can make food more important not less and save ourselves by doing so\nWe have to choose that path thank you [noise] food\nWriter Mark Bittman you can see his entire talk at ten dot com [noise]\nUm well I Know you have to leave marks thank you thank you for doing this and I I'd say the one one of the things I really miss being paleo now for the next ... who knows how long is a great recipe that you put out years ago it was a staff second spaghetti or deans bread crumbs\nSardines gray how can you not eat pasta why the hell you can get sweet potatoes pasta which is which shouldn't Haley of a housing process going to Jillian [noise]\nOkay so am I saying that that like forty percent of stuff in grocery stores isn't real food but they had to estimate what what percentage of the stuff in grocery stores has added sugar\nI don't have to estimate Seventy four percent ... act Seventy four percent of all of the food in the store\nHas been spiked with added sugar in some fashion event [noise] hidden in plain sight Oh absolutely\nIt says Dr Robert ... he's a pediatrician and a researcher at the University of California in San Francisco so\nThere are fifty six names for sugar I mean did you know ... ... did you know I mean ... that's even has the most famous now\nApple puree or evaporated canes your yeah my favorite because cages so you know students healthy guy yeah what happens when you evaporate cages you get sugar [noise]\nEverlasting studies sugar how they managed to sneak its way into our diet and what it does to our bodies\nWe've replaced a real food diet where they processed food diet because it's cheaper it's portable it's convenient kids like it and it's addictive\nAnd like any addictive substance Robert says sugar can be toxic especially because so many of us eat too much cares Robert Lustig on the head stage\nDoes sugar cause diabetes or everyone says well yeah but it's because of the calories sugar empty calories\nThat's the ... is not this is absolutely true sugar are ... calories so here's the way to look at the ... the prevalence of diabetes worldwide as we speak right now\n[noise] from twenty three and me a personal genetic service working to help people understand their DNA learn more at twenty three and me dot com slash NPR radio\nAnd from the doors do charitable foundation who is clinical scientists development awards support promising early career physician scientists and their research efforts to improve human health\nIt's that Ted radio hour for NPR I'm Guy Raz shuts ate food why we eat what we eat and why our food is sometimes so much more than ... but we put on our plates\nWe all think we taste food and ... and yet that's an illusion in the sense that ah most of what you're tasting the fruit you the ... the to the smoky are actually being ... by nostrils but operations wonderful ... bin ... and\nThe information I get from my nose and makes me believe as if it's coming from I ...\nThis is Charles Spence of the crust Myrtle research debauchery Oxford University [noise] what is the cross metal research laboratory [noise]\nI'm such a lab right here in the psychology department where we look at how the senses interact\nAnd gas our mouth and nose interact when we eat but said or a mouse and our ears\nWeeding experiments where we're feeding people potato chips out each time they put it into a potato chip we would change the sound they could sometimes making their own crunching ... [noise]\nSometimes quiet sometimes boosting\nJust certain frequency [noise]\nAnd rebel show that as soon as you change the sound it changed the Christmas the conscience of freshness on these other attributes that\nCharles says how our food sounds even looks can change how it tastes\nOne might call a white wine ... with an odorless tasteless food dye\nAddict on appropriately you'll find the experts the winemakers will get fooled into spelling leaving tasting what they think is a red wine all the rumors of tobacco in the dark chocolates and the stone fruit since I don't even know what they're actually tasting um it used to watch\nAll of this Charles says feeds into a larger idea\nThat how we experience our food is more than just about the ingredients here's Charles Spence on the stage\nOh here this morning there I'll tell you about the perfect meal will convince we can taste the food we enjoyed the flavors and aromas of the wind than the glass\nReflects what what's going on is created by the atmosphere in which we eat and drink out of the question is how to study how the measure is I'm a tendency among the scientists that been your guest thrown it's it's just that people like your eye a brain scanner give them something to eat something to drink see which parts of the brain light up this is that it's going to your brain on flavor or New York astronomy\nIs one problem here which is that in fact if their measures off one of these brain scan is kind of lie on your back\nWith your head climbing stale with a Cuban you'll merit pay all decreased square sin or some drink you call it to be full of your head all kind of a jolt and that ... that the brain scan alignment but it's kind of tells you something to do something useful but it doesn't tell you about the perfect meal because no one has had that perfect meal in one of those situations [noise]\n\nWhat exactly defines a perfect meal\n[laughter] I was actually a different for each and every one of us I mean it can be able to make very very simple it can be\nKnow so there are some holidays by the beach somewhere these often will stay in people's minds as us the best meals about ... what I guess has to be there is um the mood you're in on the people you're with so because of social aspects of dining a no one has ever had that perfect meal when the fighting with that part and I say\nPart of the thing about these kind of holiday meals that seem to stick with us and resonate in the end and you can never quite capture when you get a hold of me says your moods you pretty relaxed you are ... with your family and all these things come together to help enhance the experience and make it something sort of truly memorable\nYou think about like um how many times have you met her friend is just come back from a a holiday and they say oh you've got to try this amazing red wine that I tried in Greece and then you try it and you are sort of thinking\nThat phenomenon how to name it we've all learned bushes which I'm prone to solve rose a paradox that used to describe a northern Europeans um but to kill the guy for that so holidays to the Mediterranean\nNess sitting somewhere on a on the side of the sea sipping not Rosie wind blew looking into that love his eyes [noise]\n... you can hear the sounds of the sea of smells the Soviets all out and not tasteless like the best buy said while you've ever had so great that you wanted to buy a Baltimore case and bring it back to share with your friends and show a good taste you happen and you bring it back and then you're disappointed\nAnd your friends are like this is really cheap ...\nYeah and he said well how is it something about when they when they're playing with a cold and ... you know sport the wind things not about a tool we never eat or drink no way we're always\nSomewhere in a certain environments in certain states of mind\nOn all mental state and the environment both together kind of impacts what we think we're tasting and how much we enjoy it and we saw in a way to miss attributes I suppose some of the pleasure of the situation [noise] and put some of that pleasure into what we think about the food [noise]\nIn fact says Charles these ideas about how we experience to have actually convinced some chefs to try out certain methods of flavor enhancement methods that have nothing to do with the ingredients\nFor in a good mood food tastes good isn't a bad mood they never tastes good is this illusion about flavor we think we're tasting the wind the glass but our brain has about everything else the thousands of a thing of the smell of the salt in the ah the walls of the San ... all of that is play against the experience\nOn top chefs are capturing that inside a in the dishes or so that he that too much to install restaurant in the way in Switzerland when he got his tuition star restaurant\nA white tablecloths\nWas not popular on the table was no glasses or places like nothing was just a plastic car people white say what he calls me here seven o'clock hour here and everyone says restaurant now I can say well we'll tables full nothing will happen until somebody picks up seriously that plastic how\nI Wonder if they get up there for\nThe little one euro tower and it makes it moving sounded and sort of some of the first table ... there'll be laughing\nAnd then you can guaranteed within a minute you have the whole restaurant ... million cars laughing Dina's and that is the moment when the first is comes out because then he had successfully nothing more than one euro table in Homs the mood and he knows that will improve even the type of uh two Michelin star restaurant\n[noise]\nWow so aside from from a neurological perspective [noise] do we fully understand what's happening like why that's the case\n[laughter] uh no so we didn't know that it does happen but it is the case it's all of\nClassic example of just how important the environment is what we taste I work with ... Koch is if you have here in London and he's been I'm sending our question I asked for several weeks have to be living his restaurant let's say what'd you\nAnd people are convinced they can remember but in fact when you ... ... was actually on the menu that kind of constructing something they're going to the experience that I felt about it and the brain kind of fills in the rest of the details of what they think they thought they were using\nOur most chefs that you talked to are they on board with with your ideas do do they think yeah it is it is about the experiences right or they or did they say and this is totally absurd it's all about the food and the taste the food\nUh of course there are still some chefs who say no no it is just what I was taught in Colorado School days justice sourcing the preparation\nBut nothing else but it was the case so I'm In a restaurant or do you serve the food we plastic cutlery na ... silver isn't it and what does your restaurant exactly oh it's in a country man has looking at it and they just\nSitting there saying all these things on the one hand but clearly you can have a source of who just by itself it's always of on something in a certain environment and those kinda contextual factors are always that it cannot be avoided [noise] so I certainly I think there are a growing number of the younger chefs who are now\nPutting up starting up there and Venus who who I really think for the first time in history saying we don't need to just about the ingredients I'm cooking preparation techniques we really need to know about the mind those that were sitting [noise]\nCharles Spence wrote about his research on how we experience food in his latest book is called the perfect meal you\nCan see his entire talk head to head that NPR dot org\nSo let's get just a little bit more creative about what's on our plates because that's what my ...\nMy name is Marshall bigger\nAnd you are in a log in in again where's lagging Indian\nReferencing I'm very grateful for use it for now yes it is a rat can do that you were out everything is in the center of the Netherlands\nAnd in the center of the Netherlands about once a week my shell and his wife have what some might consider an unusual ingredient with dinner\nAnd it's something that's required for instance over a rice dish or I'm\nIn the vegetables or into salads that what do you buy like which ones are we have four species that are for say when the metal ends that is a locus crickets meal worms and buffalo worms\nYup ... which for the record do not taste like chicken", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "21"}
