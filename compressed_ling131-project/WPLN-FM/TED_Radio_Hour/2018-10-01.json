in cities most of your life yes I'm definitely in a city girl what did you grow up and say I grew up here in the bay area\nIn Oakland architect Liz that's my parents' Nigerian immigrant [noise] so I had experiences growing up in American\nCities but then also being able to sit in Nigeria\nWhen you were a kid what was your impression of of the big city um cities were places where they almost signified opportunity they were places where you can come and build a career on the family that my parents came from\nSense that you could you could do anything in a city you could make your way and become a certain type of person in the city\nAnd then when you look at the bay area or just you know just San Francisco for example do you mean do you think that's still true today\nI'm no [noise]\nAs we have seen things like the tech industry [noise] center even more wealth which in San Francisco\n[noise] you're too deep segmentation among hotlines [noise] you know\nThere are always poor communities in San Francisco so like that much hasn't changed I think it's just become even more extreme [noise] a family of four that earns under fourteen thousand dollars is now classified as low

about doing development and in the cities and it's supposed to just be good that we want to redevelop it\nEconomic forces are what economic forces are a sofa so happens that the people who've been

from NPR\nI'm Guy Raj and on the show today ideas about building more humane cities cities that make space for everyone and especially the most vulnerable [noise] were you um were you born and like yeah I actually watch an extra ... most of my life actually goes to your home which is\nYour home does you we became human in the world yeah your ... your dishes unable to demand a biggie she's a writer in Lagos, Nigeria but\nKind of stuff I read is generally about writing these issues human rights Moore for good on the rights of the urban poor\nCan you describe what goes just like like what what what I see what they're ...\nSo I guess it depends on which legal she live in right and I think that maybe this universe though where the where she chews up once and like you can be in the same physical space\nBut because all of your identity or your social occasion you it could be it's a completely different so for instance the legal said I experience is different from the legal that my daughter's ...\nSo you're driving down the fed mainland bridge and we look to your writer you lift up the case may be and you can see what's on the fishing gentleman that have\nNow been termed slum along the side of the bridge and you can leave the land feeling that's being done on the other side within reclaiming the legs and in order to build some sort of middle class entertainment slash parking garage shipping and if you're going from the mainland to the island in the landscape of if you can\nChange in the houses are bigger ... more expensive to do the cars and nicer [laughter] there are traffic lights the work you know and I think regard list which legos you experience you do see the darkness the of the differences\nAlong those lines\nAnd that quality get only deep end over the past and forty or fifty years and I'm like oh she thanks in part to an explosion and population growth now the changing economy\nClass has become much more than he meant it [noise] um class mobility is not as [noise]\nMe and my grandfather's generation it was\nIt was easy to send one or two children to school and have them access jobs and then have them send their siblings or their cousins to school and flew me sort of lift the whole family out of poverty in one or two generations right and that's no longer possible [noise]\nBullets humanity bay except this idea from the Ted stage [noise]\n\nThere's so much that is possible in native awesome so much that isn't very often the difference between possibility has impossibility simply who you\nAre belonging and Lagos is a fluid concept determined by ethnic origin sexual orientation and gender but most visibly in Austin was violently cloth\nBefore night job became a country Fisher people from the inland creek stuff has come down to negotiate with them and their status villages along the coast about six years later my grandfather alluded to audit clinically also arrived in Lagos\nOvertime he built any less stress Korea as a land severe mapping out now listening neighborhoods when they were just waist high wild grass\nHe died when I was nine and by that time my family like the families of those fish if people knew Lagos that's home\nAmong the euro by we have a saying equal with any one day which can be translated to me that leave us will welcome anyone\nBut that thing is becoming less and less true many like oceans including the descendants of those fish of people who arrived generations before my grandfather and now being pushed out to make room for an emergency that has been described as the new to buy\nIs he and he lost his last big dreams even in its leaders and successive governments have declared aspirations towards and make us in the republic he does not exist\nUnfortunately instead of focusing on the eradication of poverty as you would expect the strategy of choice focuses on diminishing the floor last up to buy the governor announced plans to demolish every single water funk sentiment in Lagos\nThere more than forty of these indigenous communities all over the city over three hundred thousand people living in them to do by making a hundred year old fishing village where the population about three four times I just want to go and see where that potential for beach\nFront luxury [noise] was one of the first to be targeted [noise]\nIt it's almost like [noise] and it's and and this happens all around the world it's it's almost like um city's much to hide people who are poor people who live in ... in places that that are characterized Islam's like they want to hide those places from the gaze of the world mhm\nYes to attract foreign investment you know you you have to look like where the foreign investment is coming from the Iraqis anything that doesn't look like that even though nothing looks like but I mean by definition the whole of legal through\nThe slum right let's be honest if we take\nThe technical definition of lack of\nSanitation services lack of infrastructure\nThe whole city is a slum but I'm more and more you care agencies of government officials talked about ultra modern projects and what they really mean is stuff that's like steel and concrete glass and mirrors and you look like the New York's skyline type if that's it so you can use this sort of rhetoric to\nPush out poor populations or are you this what the hope will happen but the truth is like in the end poor people to just disappear\nRight so if you push them further and further away from\nWherever it is that you want to make into a shiny\nWhere do you think they're going to go\nThe conditions that cause us to define as such an neighborhoods are slumps can be effective you improved but not without recognizing humanity and the agency of the people living in them\nAnd live off sweat public goods are rarely publicly available slum dwellers are often at the forefront of innovating solutions\nAfter being disconnected from the grid for months because the company couldn't figure out how to collect those one supplements designed a system that collects device Germany chances and go to everyone cheaper rates into the bargain\nAnother settlement created a reform program that hires look bad boys that security you know every chick and every hideouts so now troublemakers are more likely to get caught and report the police and few of us end up and gave him a criminal activity\nSums are an imperfect housing is a new one but they also prime examples of the innovation adaptability and Brazilians at the foundation\nAnd the heart of every functional city we have our own identity our own risen\nAnd as anyone in Las Vegas can tell you pull it goes under very often the source of the city's character without spoiling us would not\nBe known for its music guards and less energy or even the fact that you can buy an ice to drink or a puppy through your car window [noise]\n\nShe spent a time and some of these neighborhoods that that I get to find a slump too I mean what what's your experience for what were they like for you\nI mean I remember the first time I went into\nOne son that's literally built on like an island of garbage\nHuh that's sort of it's packed really tightly and then\nIt's layered with sawdust and then there was sort of some sort of carpeting or sound or something but then if you go into the place and you see the people\nWho live here and they have\nAll kinds of ... initiatives there making marginal profits on a daily basis but enough to pay their rent to send their kids to school to scale up their businesses where that's possible and to save and you realize from interacting with the people in particular that there's not that much that's\nSo significantly different about them\nAnd there are people who have economic wherewithal to live elsewhere who just don't want to\nBecause they're the quality of life that comes from living in such close proximity to your friends and your family and your colleagues in your church members of your the people you go to mosque with there's a sense of community that is so rich that is\nSupport for the tide radio our comes from the any each Casey foundation developing

foundation helping NPR advanced journalistic excellence in the digital age\nIt's that Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy rise and on the show today ideas about cities and\nHow we can build more humane once and just before the break we were hearing from architect the shock check her party in Michigan says designed to be part of the solution but it's largely depends on how we use technology\nAnd technology was a big part of the problem and the twentieth century ... when we invented the automobile what happened is the world all bent towards the invention and we recreated our landscape around in the twenty first century [noise]\nTechnology can be part of the solution is it bends\nTo the needs of the world\nAnd so what do I mean by that take the autonomy vehicle I don't think the autonomous vehicle is exciting because it's a driverless car I think what's exciting about the autonomous vehicle is the promised that we have these small urban vehicles that could safely coal mingle with pedestrians and bicycle\nThat would enable us to design to main street forget streets without Herb's maybe streets like wouldn't walkway is on fire island\n[noise] or maybe we can design streets where's the cobblestone of the twenty first century something that captures kinetic energy melts know helps you with your fitness when you walk [noise]\nRemember those big ladder fire trucks what if we can replace them at all the asphalt that comes with them with drones and robots to rescue people from burning buildings\nAnd if you think that's outlandish you'd be amazed to know how much of that technology is already being used today in rescue activity\nNow it like you to really imagine with me imagine if we could design\n[noise] right an invention that would not only\nAllow equal access [noise] what would enable us to build the Italian hill town of the twenty first century [noise]\nI think you'd be amazed to know that it's just a few of these inventions responsive\nTo human need would completely transformed the way we can build our city [noise]\nI mean the thing is right let's say we do transform cities into into these more humane places like\nWith the help of technology or whatever [noise] I mean there will still be\nSome level of inhumanity in them right in right not is it possible to have no social discord at all [noise]\nYou know part of why I gave the talk I gave a tad was being cognizant of the fact that there are a lot of technologists and the room a technologist can be wonderful people but they can also be a bit a historical and what I was hoping to convey to a room full of technologists is we need them to invent stuff\nThat helps us build more humane cities right firefighting drones and ... and the you know different kind of a wheelchair and so forth so we can look at all those codes and standards that we have to build with\nAnd change them so we can maybe have a kind of back to the future moment and think about what was great about cities before the twentieth century they could maybe inhabit our cities and the twenty first twenty second century because technology is allowed us to change those standards [noise]\nUm but that's not the goal the goal is those standards are changing so we can design this infrastructure so we create some more social friction cities\nAt their best our engines of social friction so if you look at the Arab Spring\nAnd you saw what was happening interior square when you saw what was happening in Tunisia it's because cities tend to be the platform for social change in nation\nAnd social friction requires a kind of like in my book I call it an infrastructure of opportunity this idea that you're building\nPublic spaces subway systems\nThe farmers' market places where people who are from different walks of life\nMeat eyeball to eyeball the social fiction is fundamentally what advances civilization and I think that's really the heart\nOf architect ... he's a professor at Columbia in his latest book is called a country of\nCities a manifesto for urban America you can see his soul talk at ... dot com\nOn the show today buildings you main cities ideas about many of the challenges that cities now face\nWhen your mayor for eight years you get a chance to meet people from all over\nThis is Richard Berry you as the mayor of Albuquerque New Mexico from two thousand nine to two thousand Seventeen\nAnd you'll meet people at the grocery store you'll meet people on the street you start having conversations you'll do deep dives and your community and you you start becoming keenly aware that as much as you think you understand you just have\nWalked a mile new shoes during Richard time as mayor Albuquerque sun spike in its homeless population and lots more people panhandling and the streets [noise] is it Richard Want it to come up with a more humane approach for how to deal with it\nSo I saw gentleman on July fifteenth twenty Fifteen I Believe was the day I was on my way back to city hall from lunch meeting and he was holding a sign that says he wants a job\nAnd listen I'm a student and I'm not a genius but I went back to my staff and I said listen I saw a gentleman holding a sign that said he wants a job why don't we do something different why don't we make government less complicated rather than more complicated why don't we take this man it is worth\nNebraska around a rural environment I knew there was dignity and work I saw people putting my grandparents and my parents work hard and there's just something about having a reason to get up in the morning and accomplish something that's been engrained in\nMe since I was a child and so we just wanted to take that in present an opportunity\nIn a story about what happened in my city when we decided to think differently about panhandling and lift people up to the dignity of\nWork here's more from Richard bury on the head stage\nWe call if there is a better way because I Believe there's a better\nWay to get the money than panhandling on the corner I Believe there is a better way to help your brothers and sisters and need than handing a few dollars out the car window\nWe know there's dignity and work we also know that people are much more likely to invest in themselves if they believe that their community is willing to invest in them first\nAnd because we're all wired to be kind and compassionate it always feels good to have a couple of dollars to someone that is a neat\nBut if you talk to panhandlers many of them will tell you that your few dollars don't necessarily go towards feeding the body that go towards feeding addiction\nIs Albuquerque the beautiful place where a mile high the Sandia Mountains on the east the Rio Grande runs through the center of our city where there's always something to do always leads to poll leader to pick up\nSo if you're going to have an initiative like this in your city you have to ask yourself to question first one is is there anything left to do in your city they know the answer is no would you please give me or mayors phone number because I Need some advice\nBut the second question you have to ask is this are you are solutions to panhandling working if you're taking a punitive approach I'm going to suggest the solutions aren't working and I know you're not getting to the root of the problem in\nYour city so if you have something to do you need people that need something to do both the good news is is not that complicated [noise]\nSilk so would you do we took an old van from our motor pool a little dodge van but some tires on it\nI mean sure the brakes worked and uh then we reached out to St Martin's hope works in Albuquerque\nAnd we ask for their health or a nonprofit that works with the homeless and they do a lot of great things from feeding programs to housing programs to employment programs\nWe took a fifty thousand dollars we created a pilot program and we hired them to be the facilitators to do the paperwork to pay the individuals to work for the day\nTo do all of the functional things that needed to be done to run the program\nBut more importantly we had this notion that if you live somebody up for the day they are naturally going to feel better about themselves about their circumstances somebody believed in them today and they may have an opportunity and may be inclined to try to reach out for some of the services that maybe they hadn't reached out for before so we wanted to make those available\nAnd the seven thousand jobs that have been created day jobs or through the better way program we've been able to impact or almost a sixteen or Seventeen hundred people and all those three hundred and sixty five of them have actually reached out for mental health services substance abuse services the things that they need to do to make improvements in their lives and so", "year": "2018", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "city": "Nashville", "day": "01"}
