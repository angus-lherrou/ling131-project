we tell ourselves about our justice system that it's blind that it's just everyone is treated equally under the law but it's not true [noise]\nWhat would you begin to realize very very early on as a public defender is how we defined crime policing occurs in this country who were prosecuting in our state local courts\nIs deeply deeply defined by class and by race and so I just wanted to fight for each and every one of my clients as hard as I could\nLike definitely you were pushing up against an enormous expansive criminal legal system that was not just crushing my individual clients that their families and their entire communities here's more from Robbins diverted on the stage\nFright um concepts of fundamental to the American psyche that it is enshrined in our constitution\nAnd yet in

about hacking the law to better serve everyone and for animal rights lawyer Stephen Wise that means changing laws to better serve non human animals like apes here Steven wise\nTo [noise] like to have you look at this pencil [noise] it's a thing [noise] it's a legal thing [noise]\nIt's our book she might have or the cars you own they're all legal thing [noise] the great age that you'll see behind me they too are legal things\nNow I can I can do that to a legal thing I can do whatever I Want to my book or my car\nThese great apes you'll see the photographs were taken by man named James ... who wrote a book called James and other apes and he tells his book out almost every one of them is an orphan saw his mother father die before his eyes they're legal things [noise]\nSo so what is actually the difference between a legal thing and like a legal person [noise]\nBut well since Roman times thing has been an entity who lacks the capacity for legal rights it can be a pencil it can be a computer it can be a human being at the at the time of slavery\nBut person isn't entity who has the capacity for one or more legal rights at one time it was a defined as a very narrow way I mean like\nYou mean like ... men or actually\nFree men were persons but slaves were not sometimes women were not sometimes children were not now not all human beings are considered to be the person [noise]\nDoes not have legal rights right and a person dies and basically now all humans are legal persons like it has more complicated than that right because like in the U.S corporations are considered to be legal persons uh they are indeed so it can you explain how that works\nSo a person and things are both turns of art and and that's up to the legislatures in courts as to what or who those entities are so for example in the last few years the New Zealand parliament has\nPerson who has real legal rights national park is real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia as a person who has real legal rights [noise]\nAnd Stephen why these recent changes as a positive step toward broadening the definition of legal person all to include animals is that the guys he's been dedicated to for nearly ... years ever since he read the book animal liberation that Peter Singer\nNow my red Peter Singer smoke in Nineteen eighty one I had a full head of lush brown hair and indeed I was moved by it because I've become a worry because I wanted to speak for the voiceless descended defenseless and I never realized how voiceless in defense was that billions of non\nHuman animals are and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer and by Nineteen eighty five I realized that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals his interest I was trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them had also become legal persons\nNow at that time there was very little known about or spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or legal rights for a non human animal I knew it was going to take a long time [noise]\nSo your objective and that time was to essentially [noise]\nChange the designation of non human animals from illegal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your dream\nThat was my ... and uh in Nineteen eighty five I decided that he would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Fifteen before I'd be ready to file the first lawsuits\nAnd that would have a reasonable chance of success that so much to be done and as I began to try to understand what the legal history was of of slavery and freedom and rights that the\nOne critical legal move is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters [noise]\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Steven wise was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal rights\nTo animals came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nJames Summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia now Twenty years later Stewart broad James Somerset to London\nAfter he got there James decided he was going to escape one of the first things he did was to get himself baptized\nBecause he wanted to get a set of God parents because when they see a century slave one of the major responsibility to Godfather's was to help you escape and so in the fall of Seventeen Seventy one James Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stuart than James dropped out of sight\nAnd enraged Charles Stuart than hired slave captures to Kansas City of London find him bring them to shift the ana marry that was to set sail for Jamaica where James was to be sold in the slave markets will now James is God parents swung into action\nThey approached the most powerful judge lord Mansfield who is chief judge of the quarter kings bench and the demand is that he issue a common law written hideous corpus on behalf of James Somerset\nAnd I hate to say this corpus it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against her will the detainees\nFishing reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty well lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat because\nJames Summers that was a legal thing he was not eligible\nFor a writ of habeas corpus only if he could be a legal person so lord Mansfield decided that he would assume\nWithout deciding that James Summers that was indeed a legal person and he should have your support person James his body was brought in by the captain to shift there were a series of hearings over the next six months on June twenty second Seventeen Seventy two lord Mansfield\nSaid that slavery was so odious [noise] that's a common law would not support\nIn the order James free at that moment James Summers\nThat underwent a legal trans substantiate ... the free man\nWho walked out of the court room looked exactly like the slaves would walked in but as far as the law was concerned they had nothing whatsoever in common\n[noise]\nSo inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your jammed summers that of course a non human version of James hammers and\nI started to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield so how did you find your James ... we began with those non human animals who we believe are cognitively complex extraordinarily so and that we can prove that so the nonhuman animal so we have the gun suing on behalf of\nSo far chimpanzees and elephants and the reason we started with chimpanzees is because of all the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of\nArticles that that detailed legal\nStudies about the cognition of chimpanzees that we can gather in one place and bring to the attention of the court to make it clear\nThat they are autonomous beings and that they are conscious that\nThey are self conscious that they can use symbols that they have language like abilities that goes on and on\nWe filed a hundred and sixty\nPages of half a day that and we say altogether it shows that these are extraordinarily cognitively complex beings to the point of being autonomous and judge\nTo allow an autonomous being to be inflamed is something that grinds against every idea of justice and you have to step in and stop this [noise] so\nSo how did you identify the chimpanzees you want to represent and then where to even file a lawsuit\nWhat we did is we spent seven years looking at the law of all fifty states and twenty English speaking countries trying to understand what jurisdiction the law would be reasonably on our side so we chose to the state of New York\n\nSupport for the Ted radio hour comes from like fuck life luck with Norton works to help protect identities and the information on devices from cyber criminals learned more life

NPR I'm Guy Raj and other show today ideas about hacking the law and we're just hearing from Brett headache who's advocating for getting rid of elections and replacing them with a random selection of lawmakers\nSo I I Would make it voluntarily once you've sent out ten thousand letters to random six of the population you may find that only ten or twenty percent of the population are actually interested in doing this of course if there was a financial incentive that much uh increase you would then\nFor those who wish to interest in that you do a second random selection of those interested in making sure you're actually match the demographic profile of the country so I'm making sure you've had gender bounce you'd have fifty percent women in parliament this to me would already just change the structure of the lowest\nYou would eliminate the national government wouldn't be a millionaires club you would have lots of working class people lots of fulltime ... to me the the laws that come out of such an institution would be so completely different uh but so much better from my perspective\nThat sort of wisdom of crowds idea that actually you need diversity bouncing ideas off each other to find the best solution and so if you exclude some part of the population for whatever reason than you are limiting that diversity\nI Wonder I mean if only the people who really want to be part of this are part of it government already create a self selected group of people\nIs a yeah that would be this on a self selection but it wouldn't be people who want that political power I mean there's also these are famous quotes by John out of some people I'm not I'm Sorry I'm ... I got to the galaxy going out Douglas Adams ducked with us it's just I just got my dog go out I'm saying\nTo see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have to change this one elected and one randomly selected\nIn fact there's a a regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first a comment in the world to instigate a wanted like the chamber in one solution chamber once with fish and buddy I wouldn't be surprised if people looked at the ... chamber and look at the elected\nChamber full of politicians busily back stabbing each other and engaging in the typical political out place and go well why do we need that for his chamber a but this was a path to this idea\nRandom selection in politics has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware that it's going to be difficult to Institute this in our parliament's try this side of your friends I think we should populate that parliament with randomly selected people\nWe don't judge my neighbor gets chosen the full ... separate his recycling box the perhaps surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these modern examples isn't it does work if you give people responsibility they act responsibly\nDon't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question\nIs not would this be perfect of course not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least is obviously yes\nI mean realistically is this something that can really spread out on a global scale in your lifetime [noise]\nYeah we have our strategy a and that is yet to to get the students assemblies happening more often which seems to be happening or after the Irish citizens assemblies the u._k. government is now putting\nAside almost a million pounds to a sponsor eight to ten local citizens assemblies in the u._k. so I can see that the word is spreading once one of these things happens in the in the world maybe other people will take notice maybe ... spreads\nI could see within my lifetime they're being for example a U.S state legislature with the second buddies selected bus audition that would be an incredible first step\nAnd I guess I guess um you know ultimately it's a huge surely a meal battle is to try to convince people and then entrenched powers to um to try that\nYes uh yeah it ... it I'm not I think it will be easy to political changes every easy\nA specially fundamental political changed such as this but uh I'm hoping that there'll be a generation of political latest potentially at a local city state level who say yeah I Want to innovate on something new I think half system's broken and unknown to see a change [noise]\nRead headache he runs the ... foundation which advocates for random selection democracy you can find his full talk at ... dot com\n\nOn the show today ideas that hacking the law\nHow did you start to think about what you want to do\nI did study law\nBecause of a kind of dreamy idea about what the law is this is like Mario he's a legal advocate\nIs philosophy ... who has this book between facts and no one [noise] and he says [noise]\nDemocracy should be this big open conversation about fundamental questions like what kind of work\nOh one another where do we want to go together and then law is the thing that takes the conclusions the findings from those conversations and turns them into actual rules and institutions that shape our lives\nAnd I I Love this idea of law as a kind of the thing that translates between our dreams about justice on the one hand in real life on the other hand between facts and norms\nBut that is not the world we live in\nA lot of the rules in a lot of places are decent\nBut there is a huge gap oftentimes of people who need those ruin the most have never even heard of them\nAnd um the systems that are supposed to enforce those rules are corrupt or broken\nHe began to see this problem when he was a young lawyer so he wanted to figure out a way to give the power of the law to the people\nHere seem like Mario on the head

a person and things are both terms of art and and that's up to the legislatures in courts as to what or who those entities are so for example in the last\nFew years the New Zealand parliament has designated a river as a person who has real legal rights and national park is real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia is a person who has real legal rights [noise]\nIn Stephen why these recent changes as positive step toward broadening the definition of legal persons to include animals that to cause he's been dedicated to for nearly forty years ever since he read the book animal liberation Peter Singer\nNow my red Peter Singer spoke in Nineteen eighty one I had a full head of lush brown hair and indeed I was moved by it because I become a worry because I wanted to speak for the voiceless defended defenseless and I'd never realized how voiceless and defenseless billions of\nNon human animals are and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer and by Nineteen eighty five I realized that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals is that your side is trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work with they had at least some of them had also become legal persons\nNow at that time there was very little known about her spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or legal rights for a non human am I knew it was going to take a long time [noise]\nSo your objective at that time was to essentially ... changed the designation of non human animals from illegal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your dream\nThat was my ... and uh in Nineteen eighty five I decided that he would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Fifteen before I'd be ready to file the first\nLawsuits and that would have a reasonable chance of success them so much to be done and as I began to try to understand what the legal history was of of slavery and freedom and rights that the\nOne critical legal move is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters [noise]\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Steven wise was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal rights\nTo animals came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nJames Summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia now Twenty years later Stewart broad James Somerset to London and\nHe got there James decided he was going to escape one of the first things he did was to get himself baptize because he wanted to get a set of God parents because the ... century slave one of the major responsibility the Godfather's was to help you escape and so in the fall of Seventeen Seventy one James\nOut of sight and enraged Charles Stuart that hired slave captures the Kansas City of London find him bring him to shift the ana marry that was to set sail for Jamaica where James was to be sold in the slave markets will now James is God parents swung into action\nThey approached the most powerful judge lord Mansfield who is chief judge of the ... bench and demanded that he issue a common law of hideous corpus on behalf of James Somerset\nAnd heritage hideous corpus it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against her will the dictator is required to bring the detainee and they give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty well lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat because James\nSummers that was a legal thing he was not eligible for a writ of habeas corpus only if you could be a legal person so lord Mansfield decided that he would assume\nWithout the Saudi not Jane Somerset was indeed a legal person and he should have just corpus and James his body was brought in by the captain to shift their a series of hearings over the next six months on June twenty second Seventeen Seventy two lord Mansfield\nSaid that slavery was so odious [noise] that's a common law would not support in the order James Frey had that moment James Somerset\nUnderwent a legal trans substantiate ... the free man\nWho walked out of the court room looked exactly like the slaves would walk then but as far as low as concerned they had nothing whatsoever in common\n[noise]\nSo inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your James Summers that of course a non human version of James hammers and\nI started to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield so how did you find your James ... we began with those non human animals who we believe are cognitively complex extraordinarily so and that we can prove that so the nonhuman animal so we have the gun suing on behalf of\nSo far chimpanzees and elephants and the reason we started with chimpanzees is because of all the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of\nArticles that that detailed legal studies about the cognition\nOf chimpanzees that we can gather in one place and bring to the attention of the court to make it clear\nThat they are autonomous beings and that they are conscious that\nThey are self conscious that they can use symbols that they have language like abilities that goes on and on\nWe filed a hundred and sixty pages of affidavits and we say\nAltogether it shows that these are extraordinarily\nCognitively complex beings to the point of being autonomous and judge\nTo allow an autonomous being\nTo being Slade is something that grinds against every idea of justice and you have to step in and stop this [noise] so\nSo how did you identify the chimpanzees you want to represent and then where to even file a lawsuit what we did is we\nSpent seven years looking at the law of all fifty states and twenty English speaking countries trying to understand what jurisdiction the law would be reasonably on our side so we chose the state of New York\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nSupport for the Ted radio hour comes from like fuck life luck with Norton works to help protect identities and

more constant contact dot com\nAnd from the doors do charitable foundation whos clinical scientists development towards support promising early career physician scientists and their research efforts to improve human health\nIt's the Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy Raj and other show today ideas about hacking the law and we were just hearing from Brett headache who's advocating for getting rid of elections and replacing them with a random selection of lawmakers\nSo I Would make it voluntarily once you've sent out ten thousand letters to random sexual the population you may find that only ten or twenty percent of the population are actually interested in doing this of course if there was a financial incentive that much uh increase you would then\nThose who wish to interest in that you do a second random selection of those interests with making sure you're actually match the demographic profiles of countries and making sure you've had gender bounds you'd have fifty percent women in parliament this to me would already just change the structure of the lowest\nYou would eliminate the national government wouldn't be a millionaires club you would have lots of working class people lots of fulltime ... to me the the laws that come out of such an institution would be so completely different but so much better from my perspective\nThat sort of wisdom of crowds idea that actually you need diversity bouncing ideas off each other to fund\nPart of the population for whatever reason than you are limiting that diversity\nBut I Wonder I mean if only the people who really want to be part of this are part of it government already create a self selected group of people\nThere is a yeah that would be this on the self selection but it wouldn't be people who want that political power I mean there's also these are famous quotes by John at us and people\nI'm not tonight I'm Sorry a scratch the galaxy guy Douglas Adams ducked with us it's just I just got my dog of atoms saying are the people who want political power I specifically that people who you should not let have political power\nUm by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of self selection if it's willing to you could also make it mandatory but I Would also proposed that if you pay these people two or three times the average wage\nThe vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hand out for two years is that kind of income\nI Would of course probably\nWant to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have two chambers one elected and one randomly selected in fact there's a\nA regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first ah pollen in the world to instigate a one elected chamber in one solution chamber once full tuition buddy I wouldn't be surprised if people looked at the ... chamber and look\nAt the elected chamber full of politicians busy back stabbing each other and engaging in the typical political out place and go well why do we need that for his chamber a but this is a path to old is the ideal\n\nRandom selection in politics has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware that it's going to be difficult to Institute these parliaments tried to society of friends I think we should populated our parliament with randomly selected people\nAnd we don't judge my neighbor gets chosen the full ... his recycling box\nThe perhaps surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these modern examples isn't it does work if you give people responsibility they act responsibly don't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question\nIs not would be the perfect of costs not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least is obviously yes [noise]\nI mean realistically you can really spread on a global scale in your lifetime\nYeah we have our strategy a and that is yet to to get the students assemblies happening more and more often which seems to be happening now after the Irish citizens assemblies the u._k. government is now putting aside almost a million pounds\nTo a sponsor eight to ten local citizens assemblies in the u._k. so I can see that the word is spreading once one of these things happens in the in the world maybe other people will take notice maybe it will spread I could see within my lifetime\nThey're being for example a U.S state legislature with a second buddies selected by association that would be an incredible first step\nAnd I guess I guess um you know ultimately it's a huge surely a meal battle is to try to convince people and then entrenched powers to um to try that\nYes uh yeah it does it I'm not I think it will be easy a political changes every easy a specially fundamental political changed such as this\nThere'll be a generation of political leaders potentially at a local city start liberal looser yeah I Want to own a unified on to try something new to become systems burgers and noticed a change [noise]\nRead headache he runs the ... foundation which advocates for random selection democracy you can find this little talk at ... dot com\n\nOn the show today ideas about hacking the law\nHow did you even start to think about what you want to do\nI did study law\nBecause of a kind of dreamy idea about what the law is\nThis is ... he's a legal advocate\nThere's this philosopher ... who has this book between facts and norms and he says\nDemocracy should be this big open conversation about fundamental questions like what kind of world we want to build together\nWhat are we are one another where do we want to go together and then law is the thing that takes the conclusions the findings from those conversations and turns them into actual rules in institutions that shape our lives\nAnd I I Love this idea of law as the kind of the thing that translates between our dreams about justice on the one hand in real life on the other hand between facts and norms but that is not the world we live in\nA lot of the rules in a lot of\nPlaces are decent\nBut there's a huge gap oftentimes of people who need those were the most have never even heard of them\nAnd um the systems that are supposed to enforce those rules are corrupt or broken\nHe began to see this problem when he was a young lawyer so he wanted to figure out a way to give the power of the law [noise] to the people\nHere say like Mario on the head stage\nTo tell you about someone\nI'm going to call them Ravi none the rubbish from a community of hurts people included out on the west coast of India same place my own family comes from\nWhen he was ten years old his entire community was forced to move because a multinational corporation constructed a manufacturing facility on the land where they lived\nThen Twenty years later the same company fails to cement factory one hundred meters from where they live now\nAnd he has got strong environmental regulations on paper but this company had violated many of them\nDust from that factory covers rub his moustache and everything he wears really says that if people or animals eat anything that grows in his village or drink the water\nThey get sick\nRobbie has appealed to the company for years he said I've I've written so many letters my family could cremate me with that they wouldn't need to buy any would\n[laughter] he said the company ignored every one of those letters and so in two thousand Thirteen rubbing them to decided to use the last means of protest he thought he had left\nHe walked to the gate to that factory where the fuck it a patch will end its head intending to set himself on fire\nRavi is not alone in his desperation the un estimates that worldwide four billion people live without basic access to justice but we've been choosing to ignore it right now in
