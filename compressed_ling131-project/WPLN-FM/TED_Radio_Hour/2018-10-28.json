New York city clubs like the middle of the night just like begging to get five minutes of stage time and\nI didn't have time for audiences to be shy or uncomfortable with me so it's just part of who I Am as a comedian is I I get out there I get the fact I have a disability out of the way and then I Move on and I think because I'm move on and a strong funny ... way people are able to move on with me\n[noise] yeah because I think for\nHe is it's uncomfortable like we're not used to that do you think so\nBecause I mean this has been mocked mercilessly throughout stand up comedy on characters on television a disability made fun of all the time I think what they're not used to sing and someone with a disability\nWho's proud yeah I'm ashamed and talking about that in a way that they've never heard before but we have been ... because like\nEven someone like me who managed to like get all the way through high school without ever being mocked her bully when I became a performer became pretty common place for people to do that to me [noise]\nA lot of people with the pie don't walk but my parents didn't believe in can't my father's monitor what you can do it yet you can get [laughter]\n\nAs

mother slipper [noise]\n\nMy father taught me and I walk when I was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking I Know the tactic that he used this he would dangle a dollar bill in\nFront of me that we have [noise] my inner river was very strong hand\n[laughter]\nBy that first day of kindergarten I was walking like a champion who had been times one too many times [noise]\n[noise]\nSo so when you were a kid I mean for sale you describe like but up until the age of five you you weren't able to walk right I was able to walk out five I had to be able to walk in order to be mainstream did to public school\nAnd um my father worked day and night to teach me how to walk and I think what's so amazing about this is the fact that he was told that I Would never walk and he decided that he was going to try\n\nWhat did you realize that you were funny [laughter]\nSo my dream in life was to be on General Hospital I didn't have that was funny I went to college for drama and then I came back to New York city started auditioning ... no one was hiring me and I had a conversation with an amazing acting coach and she said to me\nWhy don't you do a one woman show that way you can stand out\nAnd I started looking at things like that and who did I see I saw Whoopi Goldberg\nAnd when I saw what would we go over that and saw like how she used comedy I was like wait a minute\nWhen I look at my TV the people who looked like me are all comedians Richard prior\nYou know Alan Rosie O'Donnell those were the people who were not typically beautiful possibly had disability you know how different races like Margaret Cho and I felt like comedy was how I could break through the fact that I was an other and still guy on TV\nAnd so I signed up for comedy class and it worked out because I had no idea I was funny and it turned out on his\nTherapy [laughter] you know it's interesting because like all these comedians that that you mentioned I mean they dealt with their demons writer or their challenges their humor right\nAnd do you I mean do you see yourself doing that in your comedy the same way I mean do you do you see yourself as almost like kind of an advocate for for people with disabilities or or for Arabs and Muslims as well\nI've never tried to be an activist aren't\nAnd just by telling my own story I was controversial I was telling people things they didn't know and this started post nine eleven in New York City\nMy friend and I found that the New York are American comedy festival to counter the negative images of Arabs and media and we\nAlways made sure that the comedy came first so we weren't a bunch of Arabs trying to be funny we were a bunch of comedians who just happened to be of Arab heritage and you know sometimes I just want to talk about beyond say\nI'm I named my cat beyond and people are like talk about guys are talking about several probably you know and I'm like but I really just want to talk about beyond say that [laughter] so it gets exhausting having to constantly battle but I feel like more than ever in my life it's important now\nThat I Do battle because having grown up\nWith you know one fight in Jersey and one foot in the middle East I'm really worried\nAbout where we are right now in this country and when I did the dog I didn't know how important it was to say a Muslim in front of every one I really thought it was the disability that was gonna be the thing that I was championing [noise]\nGrowing up there were only six Arabs in my town and they were all my family now there\nAre twenty hours in town and they are still my family\n[noise] I don't think I wouldn't even notice three weren't Italian [laughter]\n[noise] this\nWas before nine eleven and before a politician thought it was

Catherine the MacArthur Foundation a Mack foundation\nDot org it's a cat radio hour from NPR I'm Guy rush and on the show too\nPainfully funny ideas about humor and how it helps us deal with the chaos of life which hearing from comedian begin first saw him and she and a group of Muslim comedians traveled around the country doing what they call social justice comedy and they're trying to open up the conversation about Islamophobia\nWhich at times\nRequired little patience [laughter]\nYeah I\nI think one of the hallmarks of social justice comedy um as I call it\nIs that you remain delightful and I you know I get I get angry you know behind the scenes\nBut when I'm In the middle of a situation I got to keep a delightful because you're just you're going to you know this is a lawyer to attract more be without any I mean that's the cliche but it's true yeah and what we need to do is remember that being around people and laughing with them is a is a joint on shared experience\nLike a group mind that engaged in something kind of like fun and the negativity kind of get swept away [noise]\nSo that trip and again took was the other comedians they turned it into a movie called the Muslims are coming in too long after he came out something happened back in New York ... usually felt welcomed and accepted\nAnd no hate group spent three hundred thousand dollars on an anti Muslim poster campaign with the MTA that's the New York city subway system was yours truly offensive not to mention poorly design I mean if you're going to be negative you might as well use about are fine but [noise]\nOh why not macho own poster campaign right that does nice things about my lungs so myself fellow comedian dino be doll I decided to launch the fighting bigotry with delightful posters campaigns\nWe raised money work with the NCAA for over five months that was approved and then she we were supposed to go up\nA the NCAA decided to be the poster citing political content once they got a couple of those posters here one I'm a Muslim Muslims [noise]\nLet's see what the truth about Muslims they have great for the recipe\nFor us are considered political by the MTA mention of Muslims in a positive light what's considered political but it is it it's about justice so we have to change our fighting bigotry with delightful posters campaign fighting bigotry with a delightful lawsuit campaign [noise]\nBasically what I'm saying a couple of dark comedians took on a major New York city agency and the comedians want [noise]\nWith a very weird feeling I was like a blonde girls feel like oh let's\nMy work is meant to be fun it's meant to generate a connection and laughter but yeah sometimes I get means we hate mail sometimes I get voice mail saying that if I can\nWell me and they'll kill my family and those death threats are definitely not funny but\nJust changing all danger I still think that social justice comedy is one of our best weapons [noise]\n\nSo you talk a lot about using comedy as a tool and there's a great moment in the film or I think you're Birmingham, Alabama and it will like it was pretty successful\nYeah so I mean you know one of our stopped with in Birmingham, Alabama where we like set up a table called me back religion we're going to read it and you're going to tell us if it was all the New Testament or the Koran\nIf your guest right you got whatever like ridiculous price is like an outdated calendar salivating already and rules are salt and pepper shakers are also like chocolate and stuff like that we totally book stipulate for the girl

violent um came from the Koran Mary said\nLord how can I have a son when no man has touched me\nTo do we just we're trying to make the point that all of these tax have released on them so why would we hold Islam to separate standard\nAnd where people surprised when they like when they found out what the truth was\nYeah yeah people were really surprised and you could see them having that moment of like oh my God it's\nNot a whole lot of difference between the three of them ... you know [noise] and credible that means that you actually saw the wheels turning like people changing their mind even just slightly\nAbsolutely and I and that's one of the things that like I have performed um in in red states and blue states and one thing that I found all over the country is that\nAmerican people are not built to hate you know what I mean they actually want to be friendly and they went off your coffee and they want to open the door for you and they want to\nBe good neighbors um and the one thing I've always found that I've said this before and it's so dorky but it's true is that if you approach people with love you're going to get loving return and that's what I found as a Muslim doing very publicly Muslim thing little performing on stages throughout the country\nThat's what I found all the way I like to look at it as you\nYou get one person to live in a couple of people will laugh and then over a lifetime you might get like a million people ... and those chuckles add up to some measure of of a popular um shifted perception\nAnd that is social change but it takes time and it takes

the comedian Louis losers these are\nReserved for this [laughter] [noise] she ... she is Ruth Ruth though\nWas murdered [noise]\nSo obviously being funny is what Kevin does for a living but\nGills with light humor I think is either kind of like an invitation or a shield like you can use humor to keep people on the outside of your life and that's what I did as a as a young\nPerson when I was really struggling I never wanted anyone to see what was going on and some might defense mechanism was humor\nBut I also think that humor can be this invitation into ideas thoughts in stories\nThat might otherwise be too uncomfortable and heavy because there's no sort of redemptive narrative within them for Kevin humor was a way to deal with his depression\nAt least in the beginning\nIt was more of a shield than an invitation\nWhen I was Thirteen Years old my best friend at the time in Jordan McGregor passed away in a car accident and\nIt was an experience that really radically changed my life and when he died it just ripped everything out of me and she felt like I was shattered and just a million different pieces I mean that's like kind of grief that\nTo this day I kind of really struggled to put accurate words and language around it because it was just so overwhelming but that was my first experience with this really intense feeling of grief and loss and depression\nAnd then from Thirteen to Seventeen kind of fluctuate it in and out of these what I might call seasons of depression where it just felt like it would come in waves\nAnd you know for a month to three months I Would be really dark helpless place\n\nBut I was fighting that secretly middle west I didn't want people to see that I didn't think it was okay to talk about it and so that became this extra weight of shame and embarrassment and kill\nKevin briel tells his story on the stage and [noise] he can already tell this story is gonna sound pretty different from the other ones you've heard on the show\nFor
