public defender and deadly upon graduating from law school and what was what was the idea behind it you say okay I'm going to be a public defender and I'm going to help people who are defendants in criminal cases [noise] that's right\nAnd I like lots of people had no idea what's going on and on the air John Locke or [noise] um I joined ... and step into Manhattan criminal court\nAnd never was able to look away again this is Robyn Steinberg [noise] what I saw so shocked me that I thought this can't be happening\nI frankly think this passes project [noise] um and I committed myself to then becoming a public defender where I spent most of my career [noise]\nThere's a story that we tell ourselves about our justice system that it's blind but it's just everyone is treated equally under the law but it's not true well\nWould you begin to realize very very early on as a public defender is how we defined crime policing occurs in this country who were prosecuting in our state local courts\nIs deeply deeply defined by class in by race and so I just wanted to fight for each and every one of my clients as hard as I could\nBut definitely you were pushing up against an enormous expansive criminal legal system that was not just crushing my individual clients that their families and their entire communities here's more from Robin Steinberg on the stage\nFright um nonsense of fundamental to the American psyche that it is enshrined in our constitution\nAnd yet in America\nIs addicted to imprison us from slavery is a massive ... it always has that we all know the shocking numbers the United states and crush rates more people per capita than almost any nation on the planet\nBut what you may not know is that on any given night in America almost half a million people go

changing laws to better serve non human animals like eight years even wise\n[noise] like to have you look at this and so it's a it's a legal thing\nIt's our books you might have or the cars you own they're all legal thing the great age that you'll see behind me they too are legal things now\nI can I can do that to a legal thing I can do whatever I Want to my book or my car\nThese great apes you'll see the photographs were taken by man named James ... who wrote a book called James and other apes and he tells his book how almost every one of them is an orphan saw his mother father died before his eyes they're legal things [noise]\n[noise] so so what is actually the difference between a legal thing ... hand like a legal person\nWell since Roman times uh thing has been an entity who lacks the capacity for legal rights it can be a pencil it can be a computer it can be a human being it at the time of slavery\nAnd the person isn't entity who has the capacity for one or more legal rights one time it was a defined in a very narrow way I mean like\nYou mean like ... men\nOr actually free men were persons but slaves were not sometimes women monogamy sometimes children were not now not all human beings are considered to be the person [noise]\nDoes not have legal rights right and a person dies and basically now all humans are legal persons big it is more complicated than that right because like in the U.S corporations are considered to be legal persons uh they are indeed so it can you explain\nHow that works so a person and things are both terms of art and and that's up to the legislatures in courts as to what or who goes entities are so for example\nIn the last few years the New Zealand parliament has designated a ...\nLegal rights national park is real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia is a person who has real legal rights [noise]\nEven why these recent changes as a positive step toward broadening the definition of legal person all to include animals that to cause he's been dedicated to for nearly forty years ever since he read the book animal liberation Peter Singer\nNow my red Peter Singer spoke in Nineteen eighty one I had a full head of lush brown hair and indeed I was moved by it because I had become a worry because I wanted to speak for the voiceless descended defenseless and I never realized how voiceless indefensible as the billions of\nNon human animals are and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer and my Nineteen eighty five I realized that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals as ... I was trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them had also become legal persons\nNow at that time there was very little known about or spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or legal rights for a non human on when I knew it was going to take a long time [noise]\nSo your objective at that time was to essentially [noise] changed the designation of non human animals from illegal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your dream\nThat was my ... and uh in Nineteen eighty five I decided to that you would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Fifteen before I'd be ready to file the first\nLawsuits and that would have a reasonable chance of success that so much to be done and as I began to try to understand what the legal history was of slavery and freedom and rights that the\nOne critical legal move is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters [noise]\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Steven wise was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal rights\nTo animals came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nJane summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia now Twenty years later Stewart brought James Somerset to London and\nHe got there James decided he was going to escape one of the first things he did was to get himself baptized\nBecause he wanted to get a set of God parents because the Eighteenth century slave one of the major responsibility to Godfather's was to help you escape and so in the fall of Seventeen Seventy one James Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stuart than James dropped out of sight\nAnd enraged Charles Stuart than hired slave captures the Kansas City of London find him bring them to shift the ana marry that was to set sail for Jamaica where James was to be sold in the slave markets well now James is God parents swung into action\nThey approached the most powerful judge lord Mansfield who is chief judge of the ... bench and the demand is that he issue a common law written hideous corpus on behalf of James Somerset\nAnd I hate to say this corpus it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against her will the dictators required to bring the detainee in it\nBodily liberty well lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat\nBecause James Summers that was a legal thing he was not eligible for a right of habeas corpus only if you could be a legal person so lord Mansfield decided that he would assume\nWithout deciding that James Somerset was indeed a legal person and he should be a sport person James his body was brought in by the captain to shift there were a series of hearings over the next six months on June twenty second Seventeen Seventy two lord Mansfield\nSaid that slavery was so odious [noise] that's a common law would not support any order James free at that moment James Summers that underwent a legal\nTrends substantiate the free man\nWho walked out of the court room looked exactly like the slaves would walk then but as far as the law was concerned they had nothing whatsoever and common\n[noise]\nSo inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your James Summers at of course a non human version of James numbers and\nI started to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield so how did you find your James ... we began with those non human animals who we believe are cognitively complex extraordinarily so and that we can prove that so the nonhuman animal so we have the gun suing on behalf of\nSo far chimpanzees and elephants and the reason we started with chimpanzees is because of all the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of\nArticles that that detailed legal studies about the cognition of chimpanzees that we can\nGather in one place and bring to the attention of the court to make it clear that they are autonomous beings and that they are conscious that they are self conscious that they can use symbols that they have language like abilities that goes on and on we filed a hundred and sixty\nPages of David and we say altogether it shows that these are extraordinarily cognitively complex beings to the point of being autonomous and judge\nTo allow an autonomous being to being sleeved is something that grinds against every idea of justice and you have to step in and stop this [noise]\nSo so how did you identify the chimpanzees you want to represent and then where to even file a lawsuit\nWhat we did is we spent seven years looking at the law of all fifty states and twenty English speaking countries trying to understand what jurisdiction the law would be reasonably on our side so we chose to the state of New York\n\n\n[noise]\n\nSupport for the Ted radio hour comes from like fuck lifelike with Norton works to help protect identities

getting rid of elections and replacing them with a random selection of lawmakers\nSo I I Would make it voluntarily once you've sent out ten thousand letters to random sexual the population you may find that only ten or twenty percent of the population are actually interested in doing this of course if there was a financial incentive that much uh increase you would then\nFor those who wish to interest in that you do a second random selection of those interested in making sure you're actually match the demographic profiles the country so I'm making sure you had gender bounds you'd have fifty percent women in parliament this to me would already just change the structure of the lowest\nYou would eliminate the national government wouldn't be a millionaires club you would have lots of working class people lots of fulltime ... to me the the laws that come out of such an institution would be so completely different but so much better from my perspective\nThat sort of wisdom of crowds idea that actually you need diversity bouncing ideas off each other to find the best solution and so if you exclude some part of the population for whatever reason than you are limiting that diversity\nBut I Wonder I mean if only the people who really want to be part of this are part of it government already create a self selected group of people\nIs a yeah that would be this Elmo self selection but it wouldn't be people who want that political power I mean there's also these are famous quotes ... I'm ... I'm Sorry I'm like it's got to the galaxy go oh Douglas Adams ducked with us it's just I just got my dog goes out I'm saying\nAre the people who want political power a specific\nUm [noise] by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of self selection if it's willing to you could also make it mandatory but I Would also proposed that if you pay these people two or three times the average wage the vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hands up for two years is that kind of income\nI Would of course probably\nWant to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have two chambers one elected and one randomly selected\nIn fact there's a a regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first ah\nPollen in the world to instigate a one day like the chamber in one sort titian chamber once will titian buddy I wouldn't be surprised if people looked at the ... chamber and look at the elected chamber full of politicians\nBusily back stabbing each other and engaging in the typical political power place and go well why do we need that for his chamber a but this is a path to old is the ideal\nRandom selection in politics has become so common lightly if they simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware that it's going to be difficult to Institute this in our parliament's try this side of your friends I think we should populate out parliament with randomly selected people\nWe don't judge my neighbor gets chosen the full ... separate his recycling box\nThe perhaps surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these modern examples isn't it does work if you give people responsibility they act responsibly don't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question\nIs not would this be perfect of course not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least is obviously yes [noise]\nI mean realistically if it's something that can really spread on a global scale in your lifetime\nYeah we have out strategy a and that is yet to to get the students assemblies happening more often which seems to be happening now after the Irish citizens assemblies the u._k. government is now putting aside almost\nA million pounds to a sponsor eight to ten local citizens assemblies in the u._k. so I can see that the word is spreading once one of these things happens in the in the world maybe other people who take notice maybe ... spreads I could see within my lifetime they're being for example\nA U.S state legislature with a second buddy selected bustle titian that would be an incredible first step\nAnd I guess I guess um you know ultimately it's a huge ... battle is to try to convince people and then in French powers to um to try that\nYes uh yeah it does it I'm not going to be easy to political change is never easy\nA specially fundamental political changed such as this but uh I'm hoping that there'll be a generation of political latest potentially at a local city state level who say yeah I Want to innovate on to try something new I think our system's broken and noticed a change [noise]\nRead headache he runs the ... foundation which advocates for random selection democracy you can find this little talk at ... dot com\n\nOn the show today ideas that hacking the law\nHow did you even start to think about what you want to do\nKind of dreamy idea about what the law is this is be back tomorrow he's a legal advocate\nThere's this philosopher you're getting ... who has this book between facts and norms and he says\nDemocracy should be this big open conversation about fundamental questions like what kind of world do we want to build together\nWhat do we are one another where do we want to go together in law is the thing that takes the conclusions the findings from those conversations and turns them into actual rules and institutions that shape our lives and I I Love this idea of law as a kind of\nThe thing that translates between our dreams about justice on the one hand and real life on the other hand between facts in arms but that is not the world we live in\nA lot of the rules in a lot of places are decent\nBut there's a huge gap oftentimes of people who need those were the most have never even heard of them\nAnd um the systems that are supposed to enforce those rules are corrupt or broken\nHe began to see this problem when he was a young lawyer so he wanted to figure out a way to

people\nIncluded up on the west coast of India same place my own family comes from when he was ten years old his entire community was forced to move because a multinational corporation constructed a manufacturing facility on the land where they lived\nThen Twenty years later the same company goes to cement factory one hundred meters from where they live now\nAnd he has got strong environmental regulations on paper but this company has violated many of them\nDust from that factory covers rub his moustache and everything he wears rubbish says that if people or animals eat anything that grows in his village or drink the water\nThey get sick\nRobbie has appealed to the company for years he said I've I've written so many letters my family could cremate me with that they wouldn't need to buy any would\n[laughter] he said the company ignored every one of those letters and so in two thousand Thirteen rubbing none to decided to use the last means of protests he thought he had left\nHe walked to the gate to that factory with a bucket of patrol in his head intending to set himself on fire\nRavi is not alone in his desperation the un estimates that worldwide four billion people live without
