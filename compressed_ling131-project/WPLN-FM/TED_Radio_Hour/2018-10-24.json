anything different on that day I just sat in the audience and listened\nAnd it just suddenly struck me want to just go home and start to do things differently\nI got an a train and I just made up incredible edible [laughter] and it was a really simple model really simple um it was just like to imagine in whatever we live in a ... a neighborhood our town a village whatever works with any scale\nWe punted edible landscapes everywhere that we could you just could like empty lots and just start planting stuff that Judy ... plant food Frank um and then we put pictures up that show people what's growing that\nSometimes we asked permission more often we might note\nTo see if you ... summertime you're you're going to just see fruits and vegetables growing everywhere\nSupport for the Ted

staples and from the listeners to support this NPR station\nIt's that Ted radio hour from NPR and guy Raj and to on the show ideas about food a connection to it and its power to change so much\nAbout the way we live I just buy a bottle of water and I'm the label is head\nGluten free interest as well and it is [laughter] this is food writer Mark Bittman truth in advertising and marketing and describing\nHow over the past fifty years corn and soy and wheat have become staples of the western diet\nOne thing led to another corn and wheat and soy were easy to trade and easy to ship and easy to sell and easy to process\nAnd the government through direct and indirect subsidies encouraged the growth of what we now call mama cropping which means really really big fields or hundreds and hundreds of acres at a time planted in one crop an endless rows that are all\nCultivated an harvested mechanically um but if you look in the late Nineteen the early twentieth century of it what was being grown in Iowa\nIowa was I think the country's biggest or second biggest producer of tomatoes it was a huge producer of apples I mean this is a place where almost anything can be grown up now you know I was just in Iowa and again you can't believe that drive drive through miles and miles of corn and soybeans and it's nothing else but corn and soybeans\nOnce you have that stuff you have to figure out what to do with it yeah so now you know the principal uses of those two crops are animal feed\nBiofuels ethanol and then corn and soy oils for frying and highly processed food made out of corn and soy\nSo we got the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contains as many Soyuz corn products as could be crammed into it home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the tubes there were fewer meals with Tom cook breads desserts and soups\nBecause all of them can be bought and any store not that they are any good but they were there most moms cook like mine a piece of royal me a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup cans fruit salad maybe based or mashed potatoes or perhaps the stupidest food ever minute rice\nFor dessert store bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so I can say this now\nThis kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself and it wasn't all bad by the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew where we were a vegetarian\nSome of us reading on good restaurants and learning how to cook well meanwhile food production had become industrial industrial\nSadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma if not actually killed\nBy the seventies home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were surfing at home at the same time\nMasses if women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden so now you got your pizza night so you got your microwave lights you got your grazing nights you got your fend for yourself nights and so on [noise]\nLeading the way what's leading the way me junk food cheese the various stuff that will kill you\nGet ... and ... like what you're saying there are a lot of that has to do with with the fact that like one thing we ship food all over the world right [noise] yeah I think part of the problem\nIs you know and this can go back to cooking because\nOne of the problems with the way that we think about food right now is that we expect to have any food we want within minutes\nIf you want a mango you're gonna be able to get a mango if you want it to NATO you're going to be able to get a tomato well that is really not sustainable so if we start thinking more seasonally if we start cooking at home more with ingredients that are\nUm I think appropriate might be the right word I'm and I'm Talking about more root vegetables and winter beats and turnips and potatoes and so on were really eating much more in tune with what nature is offering us and what nature is offering us is abundant it's just not everything\nSo I mean you are an omnivore you need everything that you you were a guy that a lot of people that look to and say okay well you you've written all these books you or a food to eat like I think of Batman and food and so we want to know what we should kind of eat well\nI Do think you know I did this book called the ... going before six or\nA few years ago and um\nBasically it's a strategy the more plants by saying let's be very strict vegan until dinner time and then do whatever but I you know I think that the rules are very very simple I think the rules are one defining what food is often it's things that don't have labels and you know the head of broccoli doesn't need a label because I had a broccoli we know what's in broccoli\nUm defined what food is eat only that and then within that category eat as many plants as you can as you say eat\nThat's it yeah\nWithin those rules do eat what you like to eat and you're going to have a good diet\n\nOverconsumption of animals and of course junk food is the problem along with our poultry consumption of plants now there is no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here but the evidence is that plants and I want to make this clear and it's not the ingredients and plants it's the plants it's not the beta carotene it's the carrot\nThe evidence is very clear that plants promote health this evidence is overwhelming at this point you eat more plants you eat less other stuff you live longer not bad\nBut back to animals on junk food we don't need either of them for health votes have been marketed heavily creating unnatural demand we're not orange craving whoppers or Skittles\nWe have to take matters into our own hands not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone that's the hard part but by improving our own and that happens to be quite easy the simple formula seats\nWe can continue to enjoy our food and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals were reduced not only calories by our carbon footprint\nWe can make food more important not less and save ourselves by doing so we have to choose that path thank you [noise]\nFood writer Mark Bittman you can see his entire talk at Ted dot com [noise] um well I Know you have to leave marks thank you thank you for doing this and I I'd say the one one of the things I really miss being paleo now for the next who knows how long\nIs a great recipe that you put out years ago as a pasta and spaghetti or deans bread crumbs\nSo bad that yeah great use of sardines great how can you not eat pasta why the hell I can get sweet potatoes pasta which is why we shouldn't have any of them a housing Boston's gonna Julia [noise]\nOkay so am I getting that saying that like forty percent of stuff in grocery stores isn't real food but but if you had to estimate what what percentage of the stuff in grocery stores has added sugar\nI don't have to estimate at Seventy four percent ... act Seventy four percent of all of the food in the store\nHas been spiked with added sugar in some fashion [noise] hidden in plain sight Oh absolutely\nThis is Dr Robert ... he's a pediatrician and a researcher at the University of California in San Francisco so there are fifty six names for sugar I mean did you know ... ... did you know I mean ... that's even has some famous now apple\nPuree or evaporated ... yeah my favorite because cages so you know just healthy right what happens when you evaporate changes you get sugar [noise]\nEver lifting studies sugar how they manage to sneak its way into our diet and what it does to our bodies\nWe've replaced a real food diet where they process food diet because it's cheaper it's portable it's convenient kids like it and it's addictive\nAnd like any addictive substance Robert says sugar can be toxic especially because so many of us eat too much and here's Robert less taken on the stage\nDoes sugar cause diabetes or everyone says well yeah but it's because of the calories sure empty calories\nThat's the ... it is not this is absolutely true ... are ... calories so here's the way to look at the ... the prevalence of diabetes worldwide as we speak right\n[noise] from twenty three and me a personal genetic service working to help people understand their DNA learn more at twenty three and me dot com slash NPR radio\nAnd from the doors do charitable foundation who is clinical scientists development towards support promising early career physician scientists and their research efforts to improve human health\nIt's that Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy Raj and I'm sure it's a food why we eat what we eat and why our food is sometimes so much more than what we put on our plates\nWe all think we taste food and ... and yeah that's an illusion in the sense that ah most of what you're tasting the fruit you the ... the to the smoky are actually being dictated by nostrils but operations wonderful job of ... and\nThe information I get from my nose and making me believe as if it's coming from I ...\nThis is Charles Spence of the ... research ... ... ... university [noise] what is the cross motor research laboratory [noise]\nUm ... so lab here in the psychology department where we look at how the senses interact\nAnd gas our mouth and nose interact when we eat but said or a mouse and our years\nWe didn't experiment where we're feeding people up potato chips and each time they put it into a potato chip we would change the sound they could sometimes making their own crunching sounds allowed out [noise]\nSometimes crotch us sometimes boosting just certain frequency [noise]\nRebel show that as soon as you change the sound it changed the Christmas to crunch the freshness of these other groups that\nCharles says how our food sounds even looks can change how it tastes\nOne might call a white wine ... with an odorless tasteless food dye\nAddict and appropriate you'll find the experts the winemakers will get fooled into spelling leaving tasting what they think is a red wine all the rumors of tobacco and the dog chocolate and the state and fruits and so on even though they're actually tasting I'm used to watch\nAll of this Charles says feeds into a larger idea that\nHow we experience our food is more than just about the ingredients here's Charles stats on the stage\nHere this morning so I'll tell you about the perfect meal rural convinced we can take the food we can enjoy the flavor was narrowed them as of the wind in the glass but if I was going on is created by the atmosphere in which we eat and drink out of the question is how to study how the measures have a tendency among scientists that been your guest romance\nGive them something to eat something to drink see which parts of the brain ... which is kind of your brain on flavor or New York astronomy is one problem here which is that in fact since they're measuring sophomore these brain scanners lie on your back\nWith your head climbed stale with a Cuban your marriage that periodically square sin or some drink you call it can be a swollen you had all kinds of jolt and that will spoil that the brain scan alignment but it's kind of tells you something to do something useful but it doesn't tell you about the perfect meal because no one has had that perfect meal is one of those situations [noise]\n\nWhat exactly defines a perfect meal [laughter]\nI'm actually a different for each and every one of us I mean it can be something very very simple it can be a fish and chips by the seaside or it could be on your summer holidays by the beach somewhere\nThese often will stay in people's minds as as best meals but ... what I guess has to be that raised them the mood you're in on the people you're with so because the social aspects of dining\nUm I didn't know what is it that perfect meal when the fighting with that part in the say\nPart of the thing about these kind of holiday meals that seemed to stick with doesn't resonate in the end and you can never quite capture when you get back home is as your moods you pretty relaxed you are ... their family and all these things come together to help enhance the experience and make it something sort of truly memorable\nYou think about like um how many times have you met her friend is just come back from a holiday and they say oh you've got to try this amazing red line that I tried in Greece and then you try it and you were thinking\nThat phenomenon has a name that we've all learned Bush's which I'm going to problem solve rose a paradox that used to describe northern Europeans um but to ... for that so holidays to the Mediterranean\nUh nothing from somewhere on a on the side of the sea sipping not Rosie wind blew looking into that love his eyes [noise]\n... you can hear the sounds of the sea smells the Soviets all out and not tasteless either pass by someone you've ever had so great that you want to buy a Baltimore case and bring it back to share with your friends and show a good taste you have in and you bring it back\nAnd then you're disappointed\nAnd your friends are like this is really cheap ...\nYeah I understand why is it something about when the bottles when the Arab play around with a cold and I you know sport the wind things not about a tool and we never eat or drink no we're always somewhere in a certain environments in certain states of\nMind on all mental state and the environment both together that kind of impacts what we think we're tasting and how much we enjoy its missile anyway some myths attributes I suppose some of the pleasure of the situation and put some of that pleasure into what we think about the food [noise]\nIn fact says Charles these ideas about how we experience to have actually convinced some chefs to try out certain methods of flavor enhancement and these are methods that have nothing to do with the ingredients\nFor in a good mood food tastes good isn't a bad mood they never tastes good\nIt's just the losing about flavor we think we're tasting the wind the glass but I'll bring the everything else the thousands of a thing of the smell of the salt in the uh the walls of the ... all of that is play against the experience\nOn top chef or capturing that insight or in the dishes or any of that too much to install restaurant in in Switzerland when he got his tuition star restaurant\nA white tablecloths was not popular on the table was no glasses or in a place like nothing there's just a plastic car people wait and see what he calls me here seven o'clock hour here on everyone's here in the restaurant and I can say well we'll tables the full nothing will happen\nUntil somebody picks up seriously that plastic how I Wonder if they get up there for\nThe little one euro tower and it makes it moving sounded as soon as some\nWas emitted you'll have a whole restaurant full of moving fire was laughing Dina's ... is the moment when it first comes out because then he has successfully nothing more than one euro table in Homs the mood and he knows that will improve even the type of uh two Michelin star restaurant\n[noise]\nWow so aside from from a neurological perspective do we fully understand what's happening like why that's the case\n[laughter] uh no so we didn't know that it does happen but it is the case\nIt's all of a classic example of just how important the environment is what we taste I work with ... just a few stuff here in London and he's being I'm sending our question as several weeks have to ... his restaurant\nLet's say what'd you remember yeah he said well ... flavor was a soup and people are convinced they can remember in ... when you ... ... was actually on the menu that kind of constructing something they don't have the experience that I felt about it and the brain kind of fills in the rest of the details I think they thought they reaching\nOur most chefs that you talked to are they on board with with your ideas do do they think yeah it is it is about the experiences right or they or did they say that it's just totally absurd it's all about the food and the taste the food\nUh there are still some chefs who say no no it is just what I was taught in Colorado School days justice sourcing the preparation\nBut nothing else but it was the case so I'm In a restaurant or do you serve the food remarried plastic cutlery na ... silver isn't it and what is your restaurant exactly oh it's in a country manor house looking at that nature\nSo they were saying all these things in the one hand but clearly\nYou can have as it was through just by itself it's always on something in a certain environment\nAnd those kind of contextual factors are always that it cannot be able to say certainly the ... I think there are a growing number of the younger chefs who are now popping up starting their own venues\nWho who I really think the first time in history saying we don't need to just about the ingredients and cooking preparation techniques we really need to know about the mind but those that were sitting [noise]\nCharles Spence wrote about his research on how we experience food in his latest book is called the perfect meal you can see\nHis entire talked head to head that NPR dot org\nSo let's get just a little bit more creative about what's on our plates because that's\nWhat ... does okay my name is Marshall bicker and you are in a while getting in getting where it's like an Indian\nReferencing I'm [noise] I'm very good for you to pronounce it can do that without having them as in the center of the Netherlands\nAnd in the center of the Netherlands about once a week my shell and his wife have what some might consider an unusual ingredient with dinner\nAnd it's something that we were friends is over or rice dish or I'm\nIn the vegetables or into salads that what do you buy like BitTorrent or we have four species that are for say when the metal ends now there's a locust crickets meal worms and buffalo worms\nYup ... which for the record do not taste like chicken\nThis is Ninety point three WPN land Nashville public radio Ninety One point five WTO ...

I mean this is a place where almost anything can be grown in our most just in Iowa and again you can't believe you drive drive through miles and miles of corn and soybeans and nothing else but corn and soybeans\nOnce you have that stuff you have to figure out what to do with it yeah so now you know the principal uses of those two crops are\nAn ... and then corn and soy oils for frying and highly processed food made out of corn and soy\nSo we got the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contains as many Soyuz corn products as could be crammed into it home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the tubes there were fewer meals was home cooked breads desserts and soups\nBecause all of them can be bought and any store not that they are any good but they were there most bombs cook like mine a piece of royal made a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup cans fruit salad\nMaybe baked or mashed potatoes or\nThe stupidest food ever minute rice\nFor dessert store bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so I can say this now\nThis kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself and it wasn't all bad\nBy the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians we weren't all hippies either\nSome of us reading and good restaurants and learning how to cook well meanwhile food production had become industrial industrial\nSadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma if not actually killed\nBy the seventies home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were surfing at home\nAt the same time masses of women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden so now you got your pizza night so you got your microwave lights you got your grazing nights you got your fend for yourself nights and so on [noise]\nLeading the way what's leading the way me junk food cheese the very stuff that will kill you\n\nGet ... and ... like what you're saying earlier are allowed to have to deal with with the fact that like one thing we ship food all over the world right [noise] yeah I think part of the problem\nIs you know and this could go back to cooking because\nOne of the problems with the way that we think about food right now is that we expect to have any food we want within minutes\nIf you want to mango you're gonna be able to get a mango if you want it tomato you're going to be able to get a tomato well that is really not sustainable so if we start thinking more seasonally if we start cooking at home more with ingredients that are\nUm I think appropriate might be the right word I'm and I'm Talking about more root vegetables in winter beats and turnips and potatoes and so on were really eating much more in tune with what nature is offering us and what nature is offering us is abundant it's just not everything\nSo I mean you are an omnivore you need everything that you you are a guy that a lot of people look to and say okay well you you've written all these books you or a food to eat like I think of ... Batman and food and so we want to know what we should kind of eat\nWell I Do think you know I did this book called the ... going before six or a few years ago and um basically it's a strategy the more plants by saying let's be very strictly vegan until dinnertime and then do whatever\nBut I you know I think that the rules are very very simple I think the rules are one defining what food is often it's things that don't have labels and you know the head of broccoli doesn't need a label because I had her broccoli we know what's in broccoli\nUm defined what food is eat only that and then within that category eat as many plants as you can\nWithin those rules do eat what you like to eat and you're going to have a good diet\n\nOverconsumption of animals but of course junk food is the problem along with our poultry consumption of plants now I there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here but the evidence is that plants and I want to make this clear it's not the ingredients and plants it's the plants it's not the beta carotene it's the carrots\nThe evidence is very clear that plants promote health this evidence is overwhelming of this point you read more plants you eat less other stuff you'll live longer not bad\nBut back to animals on junk food we don't need either of them for health both have been marketed heavily creating unnatural demands were not foreign craving whoppers or Skittles\nWe have to take matters into our own hands not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone that's the hard part but by improving our own and that happens to be quite easy the simple formula eat food\nEat real food [noise]\nWe can continue to enjoy our food and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals were reduced not only calories but our carbon footprint we can make food more important not less and save ourselves by doing so\nWe have to choose that path thank you [noise]\nFood writer Mark Bittman you can see his entire talk at Ted dot com [noise] um well I Know you have to leave marks thank you thank you for doing this and I I tell you the one one of the things I really miss being paleo now for the next ... who knows how long\nIs a great recipe that you put out years ago was that pasta as spaghetti or deans bread crumbs\nRe only about the great use of sardines great how can you not eat pasta or what the hell we can get sweet potato pasta which is we shouldn't Haley of kind of them a housing prices gonna Julia\nOkay something like that man is saying that like forty percent of stuff in grocery stores isn't real food but they had to estimate what what percentage of the stuff in grocery stores has added sugar\nI don't have to estimate of Seventy four percent ... act Seventy four percent of all of the food in the store\nHas been spiked with added sugar in some fashion [noise] hidden in plain sight Oh absolutely\nJust says Dr Robert ... is a pediatrician and a researcher at the University of California in San Francisco so\nThere are fifty six names for sugar I mean did you know ... in a digital\nThem or are that's even he has some famous now apple puree or evaporated Kane ... yeah my favorite because cages so you know just healthy right yeah what happens when you evaporate changes you get [noise] sugar\nRobert Lustig studies sugar how they manage to sneak its way into our diet and what it does to our bodies\nWe've replaced a real food diet where they processed food diet because it's cheaper it's portable it's convenient kids like it and it's addictive\nBut it's not just our coverage that keeps them coming back\nThere's nothing more soothing sound the boy unmistakable voice in the morning it's like toil over which would apart my hair and\nLearning how to spot poison ivy can save a lot of misery National Public radio I'm Blake Farmer\nWhatever keeps you tuned into WPN line every day if you haven't become a sustaining member now is the time it's a breeze just called six one five seven six zero twenty ten or go to W.

about the perfect meal world convinced we can taste the food we enjoyed the flavors ... of the wind in the glass\nBut if I look at what's going on is created by the atmosphere in which we even drink

be a fish and chips by the seaside or it could be on your summer holidays by the beach somewhere\nThese often will stay in people's minds as as best meals but ... what I guess has to be there is um the mood you're in on the people you're with so because the social aspects of dining or no one has ever had that perfect meal when the fighting with our partner say\nPart of the thing about these kind
