problems on hold\nThere was on oppression Olympics I Would win the gold medal I'm Palestinian Muslim I'm female I'm disabled and I live in New Jersey\n[noise]\nI remember when I was in San Francisco I remember watching your talk in the audience and oh you saw it live young the so called so when you came out and you started to talk of the audience was like kind of uncomfortable right because you\nYou were talking about how you shake like secure and but within just a few seconds you were able to disarm the entire\nYou know massive room full of people by just kind of putting people at ease which is that something you do consciously or or are you aware that initially thing they\nDo naturally because I've men stand up comedian for Fifteen Years and when I started doing stand up comedy out of the New York city clubs like the middle of the night just like begging to get five minutes of stage time and\nI didn't have time for audiences to be shy or uncomfortable with me so it's just part of who I Am as a comedian is I I get out there I get the fact I have a disability out of the way and then I Move on and I think because I'm move on and a strong\nFunny relate of away people are able to move on with me\n[noise] yeah because I think for for most people like the idea of making fun of a disability is it's uncomfortable like we're not used to that do you think so because\nI mean this has been mocked mercilessly throughout stand up comedy on characters on television a disability made fun of all the time I think what they're not used to sing and someone with a disability\nWho's proud yeah I'm ashamed and talking about that in a way that they've never heard before but we have been mocked because like\nEven someone like me who managed to like get all the way through high school without ever being monster bully when I became a performer became pretty commonplace for people to do that to me [noise]\nA lot of people with the pie don't walk but my parents didn't believe any can't my father's monitor what you can do it yet you can get [laughter]\n\nAs my three older sisters or not but I was not been as my three older sisters went to public school my parents went to the school system and guarantee that I went to and if we didn't get aids we all got my mother slipper [noise]\n\nMy father taught me and I walk when I was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking I Know they tactic that he used this he would dangle a dollar bill in\nFront of me we have [laughter] my inner river was very strong and\n[laughter]\nBy the first day of kindergarten I was walking like a chance to I'd been tarnished one too many times [noise]\n[noise]\nSo when you were a kid I mean first of all you describe like but up until the age of five you\nYou weren't able to walk right I was able to walk out five I had to be able to walk in order to be mainstream did to public school\nAnd um my father worked day and night to teach me how to walk and I think what's so amazing about this is the fact that he was told that I Would never walk and he decided that he was going to try\nWhat did you realize that you were funny [laughter] so my dream in life was to be on General Hospital I didn't know that was funny I went to college for drama\nAudition and realize no one was hiring me and I had a conversation with an amazing acting coach and she said to me why don't you do a one woman show that way you can stand out\nAnd I started looking at things like that and who did I see I saw Whoopi Goldberg\nAnd when I saw what would we go over that and saw like how she used comedy I was like wait a minute when I look at my TV the people who look like me are all comedians Richard prior\nYou know Ellen Rosie O'Donnell those were the people who were not typically beautiful possibly had disability you know how different races like Margaret Cho and I felt like comedy was how I could break through the fact that I was an other and still get on TV\nAnd so I signed up for a comedy class and it worked out because I had no idea I was funny and it turned out on his therapy [laughter]\nYou know it's interesting because like all these comedians that that you mentioned I mean they dealt with their demons right or their challenges through humor right\nAnd do you I mean do you see yourself doing that in your comedy the same way I mean do you do you see yourself as almost like kind of an advocate for for people with disabilities or or for Arabs and Muslims as well\nI've never tried to be an activist or an advocate I was telling my own story and just by telling my own story I was controversial I was telling people things they didn't know and this started post nine eleven in New York City\nMy friend and I found that the New York are American comedy festival to counter the negative images of Arabs and media and we\nAlways made sure that the comedy came first so we weren't a bunch of Arabs trying to be funny we were a bunch of comedians who just happened to be of Arab heritage and you know sometimes I just want to talk about beyond say I'm I named my cat beyond and people are like\nTalking about guys are talking about several probably talk about you know and I'm like I really just want to talk about beyond say that [laughter] so it gets exhausting having\nTo constantly battle but I feel like more than ever in my life is important now that I Do battle because having grown up with you know one fight in Jersey and one foot in the middle east\nI'm really worried about where we are right now in this country and when I did the dog I didn't know how important it was to say a Muslim\nIn front of every one I really thought it was the disability that was going to be the thing that I was championing ...\nAnd electronic express with a

humor and how it helps us deal with the chaos of life so we're just hearing from comedian and again our son and she and a group of Muslim comedians traveled around the country doing what they call social justice comedy and they were trying to open up the conversation about\nIslamophobia which at times\nRequired little patience\n[laughter] yeah I I think one of the hallmarks of social justice comedy um as I call it\nIs that you remain delightful and I you know I get I get angry you know behind the scenes\nBut when I'm In the middle of a situation I got to keep a delightful because you're just you're going to you know this is a lawyer to attract more be without any I mean that's the cliche but it's true yeah and what we need to do is remember that being around people and laughing with them is that\nIs a joint and shared experience\nLike a group mind that engaged in something kind of like fun and the negativity kind of get swept away\nSo that trip and again took was the other comedians they turned it into a movie called the Muslims are coming in too long after he came out something happened back in New York a place where and again the usually felt welcome then accepted\nGroup spent three hundred thousand dollars on an anti Muslim poster campaign with the NCAA that's the New York city subway system actually offensive not to mention poorly designed I mean if you're going to be negative you might as well use about are fine but [noise]\nOh why not macho own poster campaign right that does not\nBe doll I decided to launch the fighting bigotry with delightful posters campaign\nWe raised money work with the NCAA for over five months approved and then we're supposed to go up\nA the NCAA decided to be the poster citing political content once they got a couple of those posters here one I'm a Muslim Muslims\nOr what the truth about Muslims they have great for the recipe for us are considered political by the MTA\nOr the mere mention of Muslims in a positive light was considered political but it is it it's about justice so we have to change our fighting bigotry with delightful posters cat fighting bigotry with a delightful lawsuit campaign [noise]\nBasically what I'm saying as a couple of dirt comedians took on a major New York city agency and the comedians one [noise]\nWith a very weird feeling I was like as a blonde girls feel like oh let's\nMy work is meant to be fun it's meant to generate a connection and laughter but yeah sometimes I get means we sent hate mail sometimes I get voice mail saying that if I continued telling my jokes or they'll kill me and they'll kill my family and those death threats are definitely not funny but\nJust changing all danger I still think that social justice comedy is one of our best weapons [noise]\n\nReally took a lot about using comedy as a tool and there's a great moment of film or your Birmingham, Alabama and it will like it was pretty successful\nYeah so I mean you know one of our stops in Birmingham, Alabama where we like set up a table called me about religion we're going to read a quote\nAnd you're going to tell us if it was all the New Testament or the Koran\nDoes your guest right you got whatever like ridiculous prize is like an outdated calendar I see your salivating already and we are salt and pepper shakers are also like chocolate and stuff like that we totally book stipulates that a girl who does not lead on her wedding night should be stoned to death of raw\nFood her on it is the\nMan people guessed wrong on because they just assumed everything that was violent um came from the Koran Mary said my\nLord how can I have a son when no men has touched me\nTo do we just we're trying to make the point that all of these tax half crazy stopping them so why would we hold Islam to a separate standard\nAnd where people surprised when they like when they found out what the truth was\nYeah yeah people were really surprised and you could see them having that moment of like oh my\nAll our lives in three of them ...\nYou never know [noise] and credible that means that you actually saw the wheels turning like people changing their mind even just slightly\nAbsolutely and I and that's one of the things that like I have performed um in in red states and blue states and one thing that I found all over the country is that\nAmerican people are not built to hate you know what I mean they actually want to be friendly and they went off your coffee and they want to open the door for you and they want to\nBe good neighbors um and the one thing I've always found than I've said this before and it's so dorky but it's true is that if you oppose people with love you're going to get loving return and that's what I found as a Muslim\nOn stages throughout the country when I found a way I like to look at it as you\nGet one person to laugh and a couple of people won't laugh and then over a lifetime you might get like a million people ... and does chuckles add up to some measure of of a popular and shifting perception [noise]\nAnd that is social change [noise] but at the time and it takes eight million jobs teams [noise] chocolate

comedian relays every ... that are taken as\nSoon as we made sense that she's got a slang says she's ready for him though [noise]\nI was eventually some argue there's [noise]\nSo obviously being funny is like Kevin does for a living but being funny is also a way he deals with like humor I think is either kind of like an invitation\nOr a ... but you can use humor to keep people on the outside of your life and that's what I did as a as a young\nPerson when I was really struggling I never wanted anyone to see what was going on and so my defense mechanism was humor\nBut I also think that humor can be the invitation into ideas\nThoughts and stories that might otherwise be too uncomfortable and heavy because there's no sort of redemptive narrative within them\nFor Kevin humor was a way to deal with his depression\nBut at least in the beginning\nIt was more of a shield than an invitation\nWhen I was Thirteen Years old my best friend at the time in Jordan McGregor passed away in a car accident and\nIt was an experience that really radically changed my life and when he died it just ripped everything out of me and she felt like I was shattered and just a million different pieces I mean that's a kind of grief that\nTo this day I kind of really struggled to put accurate words and language around it because it was just so overwhelming but that was my first experience with this really intense feeling of grief and loss and depression\nAnd then from Thirteen to Seventeen kind of fluctuate it in and out of these what I might call seasons of depression where it just felt like it would come in waves\nAnd you know for a month or two three months I Would be really dark helpless twice\n\nBut I was fighting that secretly been along the way I didn't want people to see that I didn't think it was okay to talk about it and so that became this extra weight you know shame and embarrassment and killed\nThis is Ninety point three WPN Len National Public radio Ninety One point five WTO

it's Christmas Eve here at the mall you're driving around in circles looking for parking\nAnd what do you say [noise] sixteen empty handicapped [noise]\nAnd you're like God can I just feel little

I'm disabled and I live in New Jersey\n[noise]\nI remember when I was in San Francisco I remember watching your talk in the audience and you saw it live young the call so when you came out and you started to talk of the audience was like kind of uncomfortable right because you\nYou were talking about how you shake like she cure and but within just a few seconds you were able to disarm the entire\nYou know massive room full of people by just kind of putting people at ease which is that something you do consciously or or are you aware that initially\nI Do naturally because I've men stand up comedian for Fifteen Years and when I started doing stand up comedy I was ... New York city clubs like the middle of the night just like begging to get five minutes of stage time and\nI didn't have time for audiences to be shy or uncomfortable with me so it's just part of who I Am as a comedian is that I get out there I get the fact I have a disability out of the way and then I Move on and I think because I'm move on and a strong funny ... way people are able to move on with me\nYeah because I think for for most people like the idea of making fun of a disability is it's uncomfortable like we're not used to that do you think so\nBecause I mean this really has been mocked mercilessly throughout stand up comedy on characters on television that this is made fun of all the time I think what they're not used to sing and someone with a disability\nWho's proud yeah I'm ashamed and talking about it in a way that they've never heard before but we have been mocked because like\nEven someone like me who managed to like get all the way through high school without ever being mocked her bully when I became a performer became pretty common place for people to do that to me [noise]\nA lot of people with the pie don't walk but my parents didn't believe in can't my\nFather's ... what you can do it yet you can can [noise]\n\nIf my three older sisters ... I was mopping if my three older sisters went to public school my parents went to the school system and guarantee that I went to and if we didn't get aids we all got my mother slipper [noise]\n\nMy father taught me how I Walk when I was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking I Know the tactic that he used this he would dangle a dollar bill and\nTrying to make the case [laughter] my enters river was very strong and\n[noise]\nThe first day of kindergarten I was walking like a chance to I'd been punched one too many times [noise]\n[noise]\nTo show when you were a kid I mean first of all you describe like but up until the age of five you you weren't able to walk right\nIn order to be mainstream did to public school\nAnd um my father worked day and night to teach me how to walk and I think what's so amazing about this is the fact that he was told that I Would never walk and he decided that he was going to try [noise]\nWhat did you realize that you were funny [noise] [laughter] so my dream in life\nWas to be on General Hospital I didn't know that was funny I went to college for drama and then I came back to New York city started auditioning realize no one was hiring me and\nI had a conversation with an amazing acting coach and she said to me why don't you do a one woman show that way you can stand out\nAnd I started looking at things like that and\nWho did I see I saw Whoopi Goldberg\nAnd when I saw what would we go over that and saw like how she use comedy I was like wait a minute when I look at my TV the people who look like me are all comedians Richard prior\nYou know Ellen Rosie O'Donnell those were the people who were not typically beautiful possibly had disability you know how different races like Margaret Cho and I felt like comedy was how I could break through the fact that I was an author and still get on TV\nAnd so I signed up for comedy class and it worked out because I had no idea I was funny and it turned out on his therapy [laughter]\nYou know it's it's interesting because like all these comedians that that you mentioned I mean they dealt with their demons regular order challenges through humor right\nAnd do you I mean do you see yourself doing that in your comedy the same way I mean do you do you see yourself as almost like kind of an advocate for for people with disabilities or or for Arabs and Muslims as well\nI've never tried to be an activist or an advocate I was telling my own story and just by telling my own story I was controversial I was telling people things they didn't know and this started post nine eleven in New York City\nMight find a nice town to the New York are American comedy festival to counter the negative images of Arabs and media and we\nAlways made sure that the comedy came first so we weren't a bunch of Arabs trying to be funny we were a bunch of comedians who just happened to be of Arab heritage and you know sometimes I just want to talk about beyond say I'm I named my cat beyond and people are like\nTalk about guys are talking about several probably you know and I'm like but I really just want to talk about beyond say that [laughter] so it gets exhausting having to\nConstantly battle but I feel like more than ever in my life is important and now that I Do battle because having grown up with you know one fight in Jersey and one foot in the middle East I'm really worried\nAbout where we are right now in this country and when I did the dog I didn't know how important it was to say a Muslim in front of every one I really thought it was the disability that was gonna be the thing that I was championing [noise]\n\nNews\nSupport for the Ted radio hour comes from Elijah crack family owned makers of small batch Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey you logic

org\nIt's the cat radio hour from NPR I'm Guy rush and on the show tapes painfully funny ideas about humor and how it helps us deal with the chaos of life\nSo we're just hearing from comedian again first shot and she had a group of Muslim comedians traveled around the country doing what they call social justice comedy and they're trying to open up the conversation about Islamophobia which at times required little patience\n[laughter] yeah I I think one of the hallmarks of social justice comedy um as I call it\nIs that you remain delightful and I you know I get I get angry you know behind the scenes\nBut when I'm In the middle of a situation I got to keep a delightful because you're just you're going to yeah this is talk more be without any I mean that's the cliche but it's true yeah and what we need to do is remember that being around people and laughing with them is that\nIs a joint on shared experience like a group mind that engaged in something kind of like fun and the negativity kind of get swept away\nSo that trip and again took with the other comedians they ...\nAnd not too long after he came up something happened back in New York police were and again it usually felt welcomed and accepted\nAnd no hate group spent three hundred thousand dollars on an anti Muslim poster campaign with the MTA that's the New York city subway system was yours truly offensive not to mention poorly design I mean if you're going to be negative you might as well use a better Fox but [noise]\nOh why not not your own poster campaign right that does nice things about Muslims so my fellow comedians you know be doll I decided to launch the fighting bigotry with delightful posters campaign\nWe raised money work with the MTA for over five months was approved and into we're supposed to go up\nA the NCAA decided to be the poster citing political content once they got a couple of those posters here one I'm not Muslim Muslims [noise]\nLet's see what the truth about Muslims they have great for the recipe for us are considered political by the MTA\nOr the mere mention of Muslims in a positive light what's considered political but it is it it's about justice so we decided to change our fighting bigotry would delightful posters campaign fighting bigotry with a delightful lawsuit campaign [noise]\nBasically what I'm saying a couple of dirt comedians took on a major New York city agency and the comedians one\nWith a very weird feeling I was like a blonde girls feel like oh let's\nMy work is meant to be fun it's meant to generate a connection and laughter but yeah sometimes I get means we hate mail sometimes I get voice mail saying that if I continued telling my jokes or they'll kill me and they'll kill my family and those death threats are definitely not funny but\nJust changing all danger I still think that social justice comedy is one of our best weapons [noise]\n\nHe took a lot about using comedy as a tool and there's a great moment of the film or I think you're Birmingham, Alabama and it will like it was pretty successful\nYeah so I mean you know one of our stops in Birmingham, Alabama where we'd like set up a table called me about religion we are going to read a quote and you're going to tell us if it was all the New Testament or the Koran\nDoes your guest right you got whatever like ridiculous prize is like an outdated calendar salivating already and the rules are salt and pepper shakers are also like chocolate and stuff like that which totally book stipulate for the girl who does not lead on her wedding they should be stoned to death of her on\nHer on it is the\nMan people get wrong on because they just assumed everything that was the violin um came from the Koran Mary said\nLord how can I have a son when no man has touched me\nLet me just we're trying to make the point that all of these tax half crazy stopping them so why would we hold Islam to a separate standard\nAnd where people surprised when they like when they found out what the truth was\nYeah yeah people were really surprised and you could see them having that moment of like oh my God you\nKnow a lot of the three of them do you never know [noise] incredible to me that you actually saw the wheels turning like people changing their mind even just slightly\nIn red states and blue states in one thing that I found all over the country is that\nAmerican people are not built to hate you know what I mean they actually want to be friendly and they want to offer you a topic and they want to open the door for you and they want to\nBe good neighbors um and the one thing I've always found that I said this before and it's so dorky but it's true is that if you approach people with love you're going to get lodged in return and that's what I found as a Muslim doing very publicly Muslim thing was performing an stages throughout the country\nThat's when I found a way I like to look at it as you\nGet one person to laugh and a couple of people laugh and then over a lifetime you might get like a million people chuckling and does chuckles add up to some measure of of a popular and shifting perception [noise] and that is\nSocial change [noise] but it takes time and it takes like millions of these\n[noise] chocolate [noise]\nComedian again first said she's the author of how to make white people\nLaugh and she also hosts a podcast called the nation you can find her full talk at ... dot com [noise]\nOn the show today painfully funny ideas about how humor can cope with things that on their face\nAren't very funny as this is this is Lisa this is Kevin real has suggested the writer and they stand up comedian Louis in Missouri sees that are taking\nThese as we've made since she's ... she's ready for it though [noise]\nOut of it was marvelous [noise]\nSo obviously being funny is like Kevin does for a living but being funny is also a way he deals with like humor I think is either kind of like an invitation\nOr a shield but you can use humor to keep people on the outside of your life and that's what I did as a as a young\nPerson when I was really struggling I never wanted anyone to see what was going on and so my defense mechanism was humor\nBut I also think that humor can be this invitation into ideas thoughts and stories\nThat might otherwise be too uncomfortable and heavy because there's no sort of redemptive narrative within them for Kevin humor was a way to deal with his depression\nBut at least in the beginning it was more of a shield than an invitation\nWhen I was Thirteen Years old my best friend at the time in Jordan McGregor passed away in a car accident and\nIt was an experience that really radically changed my life and when he died it just ripped everything out of me and felt like I was shattered and just a million different pieces I mean it's kind of grief that\nTo this day I kinda really struggled to put accurate words and language around it because it was just so overwhelming but that was my first experience with this really intense feeling of grief and loss and depression\nAnd then from Thirteen to Seventeen kind of fluctuated in and out of these what I might call seasons of depression where it just felt like it would come in\nWaves and you know for a month to three months I Would be really dark hopeless place\n\nBut I was fighting that secretly been all the way I didn't want people to see that I didn't think it was okay to talk about it and so that became this extra weight", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "31"}
