support this NPR station\nIt's that Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy Raj and to on the show ideas about food a connection to it and its power to change so much about\nThe way we live I just bought a bottle of water and I'm the label is head gluten free interest\nAs well and it is [laughter] for says food writer Mark Bittman truth in advertising and marketing describing how over the past fifty years corn and soy and wheat had become staples of the western diet\nOne thing led to another corn and wheat and soy were easy to trade and easy to ship and easy to sell an easy to process\nAnd the government's through direct and indirect subsidies encouraged the growth of what we now call mama cropping which means really really big fields or hundreds and hundreds of acres at a time\nPlanted in one crop an endless rows that are all cultivated an harvested mechanically um but if you look in the late Nineteen thoroughly twenty century of it what was being grown in Iowa\nIowa was I think the country's biggest or second biggest producer of tomatoes that was a huge producer of apples I mean this is a place where almost anything can be grown in our most just in Iowa and again you can't believe that drive drive through miles and miles of corn and soybeans and it's nothing else but corn and soybeans\nOnce you have that stuff you have to figure out what to do with it yeah so now you know the principal uses of those two crops are animal feed\nBiofuels ethanol and then corn and soy oils for frying and highly processed food made out of corn and soy\nSo we got the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contains as many Soyuz corn products as could be crammed into it home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the troops there were fewer meals was home cooked breads desserts and soups\nBecause all of them can be bought and any store not that they are any good but they were there most bombs cook like mine a piece of royal made a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup cans fruit salad maybe baked or mashed potatoes or ...\nFor dessert store bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so I can say this now\nThis kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself and it wasn't all bad\nBy the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians we weren't all hippies either\nSome of us reading on good restaurants and learning how to cook well meanwhile food production had become industrial industrial\nSadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma it's not actually killed\nBy the seventies home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were surfing at home\nAt the same time masses if women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden so now you got your pizza night so you got your microwave lights you got your grazing nights you got your fend for yourself nights and\nSo on [noise] leading the way what's leading the way me junk food cheese the very stuff that will kill you\nGet ... and ... like what you're saying there are a lot of that has to do with with the fact that like we think we ship food all over the world right [noise] you know I think part of the problem\nIs you know and this could go back to cooking because one of the problems with the way that we think about food right now is that we expect to have any food we want within minutes\nIf you want to mango you're gonna be able to get a mango if you want a tomato you're going to be able to get a tomato well that is really not sustainable so if we start thinking more seasonally if we start cooking at home more with ingredients that are\nUm I think appropriate might be the right word I'm and I'm Talking about more root vegetables in winter beats and turnips and potatoes and so on were really eating much more in tune with what nature is offering us and what nature is offering us is abundant it's just not everything\nSo I mean you are an omnivore you need everything but you you were a guy that a lot of people that look to and say okay well you you've written all these books you are a food to eat like I think of ... Batman and food and so we want to know what we should kind of heat well\nI Do think you know I did this book called the B. six million before six for\nA few years ago and um basically it's a strategy the more plants by saying let's be very strict vegan until dinnertime and then do whatever\nBut I you know I think that the rules are very very simple I think the rules are one defining what food is often it's things that don't have labels and you know or the head of broccoli doesn't need a label because I had her broccoli we know what's in broccoli\nUm defined what food is eat only that and then within that category eat as many plants as you can as you can say eat\nThat's it yeah\nWithin those rules you eat what you like to eat and you're going to have a good diet\n\nOf animals and of course junk food is the problem along with our poultry consumption of plants now I there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here but the evidence is that plants and I want to make this clear and it's not the ingredients and plants it's the plants it's not the beta carotene it's the carrot\nThe evidence is very clear that plants promote health this evidence is overwhelming at this point you eat more plants you eat less other stuff you'll live longer\nWeb streaming is made possible by him capital advisors formerly master pass class at management new name and location yet the same team of professionals providing financial planning and customize portfolio management to young and seasoned investors alike more at Nashville money manager dot com\nDiet for everyone that's the hard part but by improving our own and that happens to be quite easy the simple formula seafood\nEat real food [noise]\nWe can continue to enjoy our food and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals were reduced not only calories but our carbon footprint we can make food more important not less and save ourselves by doing so\nWe have to choose that path factor [noise]\nFood writer Mark Bittman you can see his entire talk at ten dot com [noise] um well I Know you have to leave marks thank you thank you for doing this and I I'd say the one one of the things I really miss being paleo now for the next ... who knows how long\nIs a great recipe that you put out years ago was that pasta and spaghetti or deans bread crumbs\nRight about that yeah great use of sardines great how can you not eat pasta why the hell you can get sweet potatoes pasta which is why we shouldn't have any of them a housing process going to join\nA piece of marked him as saying that like forty percent of stuff in grocery stores isn't real food but but if you had to estimate what what percentage of the stuff in grocery stores has added sugar\nI don't have to estimate of Seventy four percent ... act Seventy four percent of all of the food in the store\nHas been spiked with added sugar in some fashion [noise]\nHidden in plain sight Oh absolutely\nJust says Dr Robert Lustig he's a pediatrician and a researcher at the University of California in San Francisco\nSo there are fifty six names for sugar I mean did you know to know true it was shown on digital I mean ... that's even someone famous now apple puree or evaporated changes yeah my favorite because cages so you know just healthy right what happens when you evaporate changes you get [noise]\nSugar [noise]\nRobert Lustig studies sugar how they managed to sneak its way into our diet and what it does to our bodies\nWe've replaced a real food diet where they processed food diet because it's cheaper it's portable it's convenient kids like it and it's addictive\nSo in a poet turn was that story about boots in diverse she might as well been talking about Monica to these\nBoots I bought them with a lie that they were not too big but it was an ally would fill them totally he'll Sunday\nAnd I did check out that episode averse to fight and other stories told through various by visiting W.

[noise]\nThis is Charles Spence across Myrtle research ... university [noise] what is the cross motor research laboratory [noise]\nUm ... celebrity hearing the psychology department where we look at how the census interact\nAnd gas our mouth and nose interact when we eat but said or mouse and our years\nWe didn't experiments where we're feeding people a potato chips out each time they put it into a potato chip we would change the sound they could sometimes making their own crunching ... [noise]\nSometimes quiet sometimes boosting just certain frequency [noise]\nRebel show that as soon as you change the sound it changed the Christmas the crunch us the freshness of these other countries that\nCharles says how our food sounds even looks can change how it tastes\nOne might color I white wine off we should be ... with an odorless tasteless food dye\nThey've done appropriately you'll find the experts the winemakers will get fooled into spelling leaving tasting what they think because of red wine all the rumors are near the tobacco in the dark chocolates mistaken fruits and so I don't even know what they're actually tasting um it is to watch\nAll of this Charles says feeds into a larger idea\nIt's more than just about the ingredients here's Charles stats on the stage\nAhead this morning to I'll tell you about the perfect meal rural convinced we can taste the food we enjoyed the flavors ... of the wind in the glass\nBut if I was going on and it's created by the atmosphere in which we eat and drink out of the question is how to study how the measures\nHave a tendency among some scientist at the New York as strong as it's the same people like your eye and a brain scanner give them something to eat something to drink see which parts of the brain ... this is that it's going to your brain on flavor or New York astronomy is one problem here which is that in fact since their measures up one of the brain scan is lying on your back\nWith your head climbing stale with a Cuban your marriage that periodically ... sin or some drink you call it to be full of your head all kind of a jolt and that ... spoiled at the brains has gone alignment but it's got to tell you something to do something useful but it doesn't tell you about the perfect meal because no one has had that perfect meal and one of those protections [noise]\n\nWhat exactly defines a perfect meal [laughter]\nIt's probably a different for each and every one of us I mean it can be of some very very simple it can be efficient chips by the seaside or it could be on your summer holidays by the beach somewhere\nThese often will stay in people's minds as as best meals but ... would I guess has to be there is um the mood you're in on the people you're with so because of social aspects of dining uh I Know one of the perfect meal when the fighting with that part in the say\nPart of the thing about these kind of holiday meals that seemed to stick with doesn't resonate in the end and you can never quite capture when you get ... as your moods you pretty relaxed you are ... with your family and all these things come together to help enhance the experience and make it something sort of truly memorable\nYou think about like um how many times have you met her friend is just come back from a holiday and they say oh you've got to try this amazing red wine that I tried in Greece and then you try it and you were sort of thinking\nThat phenomenon has a name that we've all learned versions of it's hum it becomes a problem solve rose a paradox that used to describe a northern Europeans um but to kill the guy for that so holidays to the Mediterranean\nNess sitting somewhere on a on the side of the sea sipping that arose they wind blew looking into that love his eyes [noise]\nThe ... you can hear the sounds of the sea smells the Soviets all out and not tasteless either passed by said why you've ever had so great that you want to buy a boat or a case and bring it back to share with your friends and show a good taste you haven't had a you bring it back\nAnd then you're disappointed [noise]\nYour friends are like this is really cheap ...\nYeah and you say well how is it something about when they were in the Arab play with a cold and I you know spoil the wind things not about a tool and we never eat more drink no we're always somewhere in a certain environments and certain states of\nMind on all mental state and the environment both together kind of impacts what we think we're tasting and how much we enjoy it and we saw in a way to miss attributes I suppose some of the pleasure of the situation [noise] and put some of the pleasure into what we think about the food [noise]\nIn fact says Charles these ideas about how we experience food have actually convinced some chefs to try out certain methods of flavor enhancement and these are methods that have nothing to do with the ingredients\nFor in a good mood food tastes good isn't a bad mood they never tastes good is this illusion about flavor we think we're tasting the wind the glass but I'll break has brought me everything else the thousands of single the smell of the soul to see the walls of the San ... all of that is play against the experience\nOn top chef capturing that in ... in the dishes or any of that too much then style restaurant in the very end\nType of crops has no ... on the table was an eye glasses and I play nothing there's just a plastic car people wait and see what he tells me here seven o'clock hour here on everyone's here in the restaurant and I can say well we'll tables the full nothing will happen until somebody picks up seriously that plastic how\nI Want to pick it up you know the\nLittle one euro tower and it makes it moving sound and sort of some of those type of it that will be laughing and then you can guaranteed within a minute you'll have the whole restaurant full of moving towers laughing Dina's ...\nIs the moment when the first is comes out because then he has successfully nothing more than one euro table in the mood and he knows that will improve even the type of uh two Michelin star restaurant\n[noise]\n[noise] wow so aside from from a neurological perspective [noise] do we fully understand what's happening like why that's the case\n[laughter] uh no so he didn't know that it does happen but it is the case\nIt's all of a classic example of just how important the environment is what we taste I work with a young chef which is if you have here in London and he's being I'm sending our question as several weeks have to be living his restaurant\nI'd say what'd you remember yeah and he said well ... flavor was the soup and people are convinced they can remember but in fact when you check was actually on the menu that kind of constructing something they remember the experience but I felt about it and that brand kind of fills in the rest of the details of what they think they thought they were reaching\nOur most chefs that you talked to are they on board with with your ideas do do they think yeah it is it is about the experience he's right or they or did they say that it's just totally absurd it's all about the food and the taste the food\nUh of course there are still some chefs who say no no it is just what I was taught in Colorado School days justice sourcing the preparation but nothing else\nBut I Will say okay so I'm In a restaurant um do you serve the food during their plastic cutlery na ... silver isn't it and what does your restaurant exactly oh it's in a country manor house looking at it and they ...\nSo the the St Louis things in the one hand but clearly you can never sort of ... through just by itself it's always on something in a certain environment\nAnd there's going to contextual factors are always that it cannot be avoided [noise] so I certainly I think there are a growing number of the younger chefs who are now putting up starting their own\nVenus who who are really thing for the first time in history saying we don't need to just now about the ingredients and cooking preparation techniques we really need to know about the mind those that were sitting [noise]\n[noise] Charles Spence wrote about his research on how we experience food in his latest book is called the perfect meal you can see his\nEntire talked had had that NPR dot org\nSo let's get shafted a little bit more creative about what's on our plates because that's what ... does okay my name is Marshall bicker\nAnd you are in a while getting in getting where it's like an Indian\nReferencing I'm [noise] I'm very good for you to pronounce his rag can't do that you were out everything is in the center of the Netherlands\nAnd
