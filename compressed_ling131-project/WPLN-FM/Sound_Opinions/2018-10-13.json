writer\n\n[noise]\nPlus we remember audio engineer Jeff emirate who worked with the Beatles I'm revolver and sergeant peppers we're going to revisit our conversation with him\nDid you do have a job\nThat's all coming up on sound opinions\nSound opinions is supported by Simon beer company brewers have goose IP a four star pales Sophie farmhouse ale and bourbon county branched out more at ... dot com we don't need to be the only beer you drink we just want to be the best period drink\nYou're listening its own opinions and later in the show Jim we're going to pay tribute to the late Jeff em records a name that may not be a household name uh but uh certainly a legendary or audio engineer especially for his work with the Beatles classics like revolver sergeant was lonely hearts club band and he wrote among other classes for it [noise]\n\nBut now it's time for another round of buried treasures Gregg is one of my favorite shows right indeed indeed what's buried treasure if this was a recording that we define\nAs something that's probably under the mainstream radar you probably haven't heard of it or a week collect bees we try to do the show every once in a while and turn you want to great music that deserves a wider audience Greg you get to go first [noise] you're going to start off\nWith a an exploration of garage rock one of our favorite genres ever since the sixties right every band that want it to be you know we just talked about the Beatles were there was a lot of bands cropping up all over America that want it to be the Beatles playing music in garages\nAre in that tradition is carried on a long and glorious history in Chicago or the last decade we'd ... we've had a a ton of these really great garage rock combo in other words these are veterans from that scene that are forming his band ... are two things that make each other's stand out from the past\nParticular is writing a deeper more introspective ally lyrical than you would expect from the typical garage rock band the suicide of an older brother ah has really informed a number of the lyrics on his arm and it's impossible\nBut Mitch a that vibe that melancholy tragic by that that courses through a number of these suction but it's not a downer at all this is a great band\nAnd I think the or the other distinctive feature of this band is the um a keyboard smearing McCain uh she plays one of those ... says\nHe got married yeah you're ... you're not there for you to play with my band or I don't know why\nAnd what I like about it is a Easter is does not use the uh the ... as just sort of a little accent that its own over driven now need instrument in this band and some of the heavier rock or is it really blast into the forefront\nThe song I'm going to play though is is more on the contemplative side it's just got a haunting melody to it or you ... you hear the the bands gift for a hoax or as well as that\nSort of the underlying tone of melancholy it's something from the band eaters unsound opinion\n\nUm [noise]\nUm\nThat it's either it's with a song called something one of my buried treasures\nLoving it Greg does what ... do you just turn me on to them I Would say that they are more of the late era a garage where it's not just tear it up fake R B a ... right I mean there's a lot of psychedelic and yet reserve me up a psychedelic seeds\nI'm going to go all the way to New Zealand for my first buried treasure a band called the batch\nUm you know I my favorite band from the UN since ... this is a wonderful a really a energetic pop punk band with a sort of in the uh you know shiny a psychedelic almost at times by\nI think of the great Courtney Barnett rocking the shells or the cleaning or other great kiwi bans ripe um and I don't make that Courtney Barnett comparison lightly the leader of this group Elizabeth stokes is really smart\nOr almost novel lipstick songwriter uh sometimes I think I'm doing fine I think I'm pretty smart than the walls become band\nLine from a song called future me hates me and I loved that whole concept\nOf you as as as someone a young person trying to find your way in the world and you're looking ahead and take some day maybe I'll get it together and that person's going to hate the person I Am now wow that is a lot to pack into a this explosive guitar driven\nKnow we're not ugly drummed\nA pop punk song I just I just love it the bats from New Zealand future meat hates me [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nThat is the bats with the title track from their new album just came out in August future me hates me car park record\nThat isn't great title or if you write a story of my life and you know the other thing about this record Jim uh you know we talked about the sophistication of relative sophistication of what the teachers were doing the same thing with the best that those counterpoint harmonies really got me yeah I kind of a cut above on this record up the next thing I Want to go to is\nOur girls from the u._k. bragging to be specific a coed trio led by a woman named ... Nathan she's also a member of a band called big moon\nBut our girl her other band sounds nothing like the big moon is kind of more of a ... down beach in more uh atmosphere or a or a girl is a is a trio in which a Nathan's guitars right up front a lover sort of under state of very conversational\nVocal style but you got a real feel for hooks as a guitar player not only looks but also the ability to crank it up you know you get\nFrom these kind of eerie mood pieces it just sort of explode you know when you least expect it so that dynamic plays itself out this is a really really good a debut album is called strangers today and here's a track from it it's called in my head from our girl unsound opinion [noise]\nTo me because I've been watching this ban since the beginning the progression is part of what I find so appealing and they they were really shabby at first but clearly had\nA great ambition they they sounded like they want it to write for an orchestra and there's something about uh their ability to combine like Ninety the markets are says with\nHuge production in in the case of the new album that uh is so compelling to me is uh unusual and unusual for this you know they came out of to me it's a this record is symbolic of a band it's\nAt the edge of something that could just break up tomorrow at or to studying just throw every idea\nOr maybe they could become a Twenty one pilot either way\nIf you've got to pick a of an album that we really need to hear call and leave a message on our hotline eight eight eight eight five Nineteen hundred or find us on Facebook or Twitter after break ... dig up some more buried treasures plus lead or has one more pick two that's all coming up on sound opinions from WBEZ in Chicago NPR ...\n... welcome back to San opinions I'm

bit out of left field it's not a traditional rock record in any sense or a hip hop record it's a it's it's more of a jazz Latin jazz record but I cannot get enough of it I think people will appreciate

Hammond organ to record a vocal which just wasn't done right to jump\nNo no of course he wasn't on ... and I and I also had you know certain sounds in my head because I I've been listening to a lot of American records while I was ... I don't want you to try and improve\nOr getting get more more sort of adventurous sounds out of the studio them than we were basically getting and the other thing I was going in full was as close as sound honoring drum kit and not to move to the ... closer to get ... from skin off and go into trouble for moving ... closer than than two feet and\nEventually ended up with a written letters to giving me permission to be able to do that\nTell us about these backward tape loops which were obviously a big part of tomorrow never knows and the whole um how did you guys happened upon using\nThis you know really ... our own little ... and pull in particular I used to go go home and an expert on making these little little crazy type loops on on as a\n... machine but they'd be back which things started when John actually at a ... on his reel to reel because you know we'd we didn't have ... and and the only way you could take attract home to listen to it was a play back like a\nUm a which meant watching for an up to the next I get to get it so Jonah\nNo technical took with type ... of a rough mix\n'em and like stood up backwards on the machine and came back to the next day and said there was something wrong with the mix\nAnd not realizing that you'd been playing it back to [laughter] to show off after that we you know we know that that's how the backwards things started you know we used to listen to everything backwards that we we we recorded you know even as as just as a as well not really a joke was ruled ... and\nWe ... we saw the Russian language was was actually English backwards and we've got some Russian\nUh ... and played it backwards to see if it was actually English when it was played back with the world [laughter]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nI didn't get the impression from here there and everywhere your book that there was a stranger moment bin Laden in\nDeciding that he had to sound as if he was singing underwater for yellow submarine and in fact he wanted you to record him singing underwater\nIn well what exactly I mean not that was you know what I mean I'm running around the students also terminal hair out you know there's all there's all the all the people that you know I was assigned in the end all so when you join you can't do that I mean it'd be it'd be blowing singing singing in Seoul from bumping into knows what else\n\nBig little lies the sauce so will the next best thing is just ... out of desperation was to try and put a more profound in in in a in a bottle of water and you just sit just seem to have some sort of the golf golf milk multiple but we have to protect the slim convince a microphone\nWhich had you know like two hundred missiles evolves running short a\nElectricity I don't know much about recording engineer and electricity and water don't mix right ...\nExactly how it started out as the ... what can we put in a ... you know produce the or the ... of his wallet and uh put put the market not and in San ... in the mail postal so and that's what we did was I called a dog she going to stop using it it was just a doll yeah sort of sort of sound to Joan Joan\nI Know you can do if you if you had that use condoms today or I Am a man you'd be set for next year on your\nShe arrived he couldn't understand why you couldn't directly inject he's vocal much you could have vice guitar or do I get all like lights are on ... and you know ... or ... and explained that you'd have to have an operation another jak jak soccer implanted in his neck but that was on the east side there's a joke you know he he so he can run and stuff like that you know\nOne of the things to that I think uh you you sort of pioneered with this record revolver a Jeff was just simply where you place to the microphones inside ring goes bass drum and close might be the string section on an al ... did you have any idea how these experiments were going to turn out before you tempted up\nBut they do all the other and everybody thinks string sound was was a sound that you know or discuss with pulled him we want to disclose Shannon because when I went in very close to the string players were those microphones which was a ... it was a double string culture so there was I I play I was there a but they'd never be martyrs closest ... to some of the guys as we would just", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Sound Opinions", "city": "Nashville", "day": "13"}
