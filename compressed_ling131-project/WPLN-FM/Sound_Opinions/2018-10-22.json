Russell on and on\nShe'll talk with us about how she decides what's the perfect song for every scene and how she got let sampling\nOf all people to agree to their music being used as coming up later in the show Greg but first we've got some new music [noise]\nNever met the cat is so [noise]\n[noise]\nI'm On the view that they\nKnew who\nIs a snippet of purple rain everybody knows that so [laughter] right oh yeah the great prince as you can tell very sparse a stripped down version or in its initial stages of purple rain these are demo recordings are done in princes house\nBefore there was a Paisley Park even now\nA sitting at a piano with a microphone and working out songs and that's the name of the new posthumous prince album piano and the microphone Nineteen eighty three what a career he's had a since his death in two thousand sixteen the vaults have become a low yeah so the public will see\nUh what this producers because in the past we've seen uh some uh some vaults or projects or the Jimmy Hendrix a state uh the doors et cetera ... where there's been a ton of recordings coming out a posthumously no that is starting to happen now with prince's music as well\nWe're going to evaluate a the the merits of this project\nA track called Mary don't you weep or the great uh nineteenth century spirit has been in the gospel cannon for centuries as performed by prince from piano in a microphone Nineteen eighty three unsound opinions\n\nNo\nTo\nBe true\n\n\nFriends with a piano a microphone in Nineteen eighty three\nCovering Mary don't you weep a I don't think he topped Aretha Franklin version on amazing grace\nBut it is an extraordinary a version of that song Greg neglected to say it was recorded by an engineer this album piano with the microphone Nineteen eighty three I sat in one point here prince talking about you got to flip that over now right\nCassette ... was an antiquated or the technology I'll never mind I'm you know\nI in saddened by what is certain to be forty or fifty years of Pashtun mass grave robbing of princes volts\nWould he have released this I don't know is their interest there for people who love prince absolutely but you know the stakes are not high he's playing for the joy of playing you can see songs develop\nA you can see sides of his personality as with Mary don't you weep I also really love the ... song\nCold coffee and cocaine for the\nI\nA comment on gay and make\nA prince heads talk about his Jamie start caring you're right you know the street hustler why they're you know All right you know Mary and and and cold coffee and cocaine or the only revelations here\nThis is not a great last prints album like say the blackout be hard funk record he had to shell in Nineteen eighty seven we all scoffed it up on bootleg didn't come out officially till Nineteen Ninety four are their equivalent like that in in these volt I don't know there are ...\nEver listen to it again [noise] you know I disagree with the I'll never listen to it again remark I mean that's your taste my initial reaction to this record was that it was a\nIt was kind of a throwaway okay what's what's this all about why says even coming out and the more listen to it I sort of got pulled into the idea that we're getting a window into process here and we so seldom got that was prince um you know he was very big on releasing finished records in fact there's tons of finished\nRecords in his vaults there I haven't come out\nAre so why this one you had made purple rain yet you know he's on the cusp of something really extraordinary but we're seeing how his mind works and what I loved most about hearing this is his virtual city as a pianist a first of all a and the joy he brings to the performance is the fact that he seems to be\nSo unfiltered and realizing hey I'm just sort of messing around here just following my mind letting it wonder\nIs pretty bad thing I mean there's basically a a a thirty minutes string of unbroken music here where he's just getting on one end to the next you know a snippet of purple rain a snippet of Joni Mitchell\nIn that in that\nThat great gospel track that we just play which by the way he totally reinvest it going to be that way yeah yeah they sit out a church there is no basically it'll just Saturday Night go go scripture isn't there anymore than Mary is now a real person who got your lovers are going to come home ... married don't you weep you know he's a\nHe's talking about some other subjects there he's blending the sacred and the end the profane\n... down and\nYoung man comes up\nSo I Love that aspect I I I'm Glad you mentioned cold coffee and cocaine you know a Jamie stars just another way of saying I'm ripping off the ground here\nNow I'm not going to recommend this to everybody a but man if your prince man this is that this was man it from Avon is a man like yeah but if somebody spent two years and went through what is alleged to be you know a treasure trove and the volt and just found those Mary don't you we're I'm at and gave us a whole album that\nThat's right Jim this is your second television collaboration with director Jon ... after the HBO series big little lies so we can get to the interview by asking her how she got into the music supervision business\nYou know I can start sort of following\nLike I think most things I fell backwards into this field you know my first soundtrack album credit was project managing she's got a habit\nAnd worked very closely with Spike Lee's father who did the score from that album when I was working at Arlen records\nOr girl that I once knew who all of them had of reading books and she gave him time low when Enron supply\nThe gum from far away and often go there all day to show their low and the which one which day ... and then I\nWent on to management I kind of circled around this for a long time in different directions and find the time that I actually knew there was such a job is to music supervision which came from a recommendation to June ... up I was the first film I ever did on my own you know I ...\nPerched at like this is what my artist once Jillian does with what he wants an on going to figure out a way to go [noise]\n\nYou know Suzy\nYour job essentially didn't exist for a long time it was one of those things that sort of ... music and movies built to sort of\nSynergistic relationship it used to be that or or Castro scores made for these movies right and then the job also became not only these original scores\nBut then the idea of a placing songs from the pop music Rome or whatever genre into the movie just sort of help develop character tone and plot where you kind of a fan of this art form before you actually started doing it\nYeah I actually played soundtrack album addicted to the swimmer the trolley swimmer that have the most beautiful American families should be\nYou know and Spartacus in acting my record collection had almost equally soundtrack final soundtrack visited bam you have always found that interesting and I never in a million years thought about it\nAs a job and didn't know that it was a job and\nEven when I came in really a lot of supervisors were working directly with record labels and then putting\nTheir music into movies were record labels are actually paying for ... for supervisors and the music in the movies you know I'm just such a control freak in the fact that I don't want to be dictated by ...\nYou know to you know go wherever the movie and the director wanted to go and then end up having people on the soundtrack after that and not kind of work it in the other way because I just that being dictated to from that direction with never interesting to me\nI think words evolved to is that it's become a much more important factor in television and now that you've got these mini series that are sort of viewed as art forms on the level of a of a great movie\nYou've got this increasingly important role the music is playing in them what intrigued you about these mini series\nWell my only experience I followed my director shock value and I had worked on a couple of feature films and he said okay we're going here and all that was my deep dive and came away with so much appreciation for that work for\n\n[noise] ... [noise]\nChanged [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nIt's something I really liked about the two HBO series you worked on big little lies and sharp objects\nWas they both featured female music which you know I think too often in movies and TV male characters are the ones who are the messengers the cool music you know the ones whose lives were saved by rock and roll\nUp first I Want to talk about Chloe from big little lies who's this little six year old girl who loves music and we're not talking about Disney so you know she's listening to some pretty great stone PJ Harvey Charles Bradley\nShe's amazing him including her her precocious little\nIPod you know telling her dad you know what channel the song he needs to play no no no doubt you could do this one\nYou know she's a she's a already hanging out with the old Seventeen stopping and then you know introducing the bridges to her mom and yo yo you know she's like she's an incredibly precocious young young girls\n[noise]\nSo I don't want to come on [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] ten thousand [noise]\nNow oh\nRay\n[noise]\nWhich you know it's very much on mark planted it because he doesn't use composer than we are having to tell our motives story\nThrough the license tracks which is very unusual for any director to kind of knows that going through that I'm not going to use a composer and we're going to handle all these emotional the it\nThrough our you know through these characters and that's what I mean ... you know we just really she's the one that sort of was helping everybody narrative lane through her iPod [noise] tell that story\nThere's also a character in sharp objects Alice who helps tell the narrative with music on her iPod [noise] she's a fellow patient in the hospital a with Comey oldest shows protagonist they were both dealing with problems with self harm Alice teachers Camille to use music particularly Led Zeppelin\nAs a way to escape the internal distress the pain that she's experiencing\nWhich she didn't know anything about music she gets into the hospital and she's there with this young girl that you know kind of looks at her and says we're kind of music do you\nPlay or do you listen to and she's like I don't I don't like music I never really listen to music and the girls like job just to follow the law that she's\nShe's like what no wonder you're on your girl and she's one of your inherent to girl and she goes but I can get out of here and that I loved that so much that she could teach somebody older than her\nShe's a teenager looking at some in her mid twenties and saying I can teach you how to fly out of here you don't even have to be an here\nAnd teaching the power of music to escape your situation [laughter]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[laughter] what led you know really signed on to wish that uses a lot\nThan just some background than a restaurant\nOr some ... some video if can place and you actually important role in\nIn so many large and if you're not familiar with it in that way and don't have that relationship I'm hoping that come meals character encourages everybody to kind of sit back and go wait\nI'm Ines mood I'm going to put on this record and see what happened and you can fly off and it will totally changed your mood I think that the importance of it\n[noise]\n\nWell you know I got to ask you though are Jews and so did you ever have a conversation with the character and say why do you have such expensive taste good licensing Led Zeppelin songs ain't cheap I Wonder how that worked out because they are notoriously difficult to uh you know extract music from or allow their music to be used in films or or or TV show\nAnd she was like well I you know if there's something really emotional and warm about those rock songs and the seventies [noise]\nYou're my way [noise]\n[noise] [laughter]\n\nWe met at an Irish right near where I was\nWhen you sit down and try and help in Asia and you're right you don't have some\nMore stuff that goes to show up and do it really started with such a first picture is always first what's going to serve the pitcher and\nSo those songs ended up really being something about it was so important Illinois Tanya that that music stayed warm and that she said that we could have power because otherwise you wouldn't like car\nAnd if I tried a couple of Ninety things I tried a couple of things in it which totally film didn't want it and it may turn ... or so we really how we worked really hard so I already he already had you know his arrow pointed in I Want seventies music and then we just worked really really hard to get\nWhat we wanted and to put things in there and you're always just serving narrative and serving pitcher\nBut the most difficult thing of time there was getting people to understand\nThat this was a really important story to be told\nAnd you know we mark ... was so gracious because he has turned down\nThe dire straits on Romeo and Juliet several times saying no way that that was before I came on board and then I reached out to spend four hours writing the rate letter and sent him the first real instead I'm just asking you to take a look and if you want to see the rest of it\nLet me know and then I got a call for management can send a rushed and I knew\nThat he would understand that that was actually a really beautiful use of Romeo and Juliet and why [noise]\nWhat do you like like me [noise]\n\n\n[noise] they must\nAnd it was really great but it was getting him and then he wrote\nThe sweetest note and said thank you Susan chicken would have never known that was it and he was so happy to be part of that film them so I think it's really about communication artist to artist you know more quakes turn to do why it's important and why that\nMusic belongs there is a lot of it and you know the same thing working on American Hustle are silver linings playbook which we how do you know really early Alabama Shakes and very very early O. J. was just a baby than point\nI it's it's so great when you realize that you're getting this great marriage of\nA visual and artists and then also to to see that I was saying and I went to see the most amazing elope concert they are out there playing chaplain is playing the most amazing shows right now and to see ten off our three eight overtures lie\nJust blew\nHustle had a lot to do what are they not dark and the pilots could that guy's got one hit song after another it's not like she you know but I ... that that the influence of film and you you know you're kind of think\nI bet that gave a lot of new life to that time because the crowd went crazy over\nCrazy it wasn't one of those uh you know top twenty below you know\nGreatest hits you you know and he got he got a top forty there I mean every time he probably she can't believe like oh my God he wrote that to have you back to and he brought that to a it's kind of amazing\nOr I got one question for you so you're the\nMusic ... like gosh in terms of you know how does how does music work or in the world and obviously you're a big fan of music working in film and TV you start your own projects what if you were to say to anybody give me an example of how music and\nAudio and video can work together to create something sort of a third thing that's the greater than some of the parts what's what's your best example of that\nGoes the Easy Rider go see it go see the graduate\n[laughter] [noise]\n\n[noise] [laughter] I mean those are the things that all of us strive to make the garage of again midnight cowboy my goodness I mean ...\nYou know when you have to either specially midnight cowboy when you have that collaboration between composer\nAnd then an artist by carry I mean all of us are trying to keep making ... none of us have gotten their\nOnly\nI Can't really\nRight\nI think about ... I'm ...\nPlan to make that dark in deeper and more [noise] yeah that's amazing and you can't even look at the graduate without thinking about the permanent Garfunkel\nSoundtrack to them you know we're all trying to do that I mean when I you know for sure I have anything that ever comes close to that kind of cooperation with a solo artist being a ball but also the industry was braver\nThan I think people just took the music played a looser roll it was more\nYou know if things were as manage that they are now\nAnd I don't know I think there's some young kid falling in love with your work now who's thinking this ain't that\nSome day I Want to ... I think you're inspiring a new generation they're all I Hope I Hope so we've been talking with Susan Jacobs one of our favorite music supervisors it's a it's been a real pleasure Susan thanks for coming in town dependence I'm great thank you all that\nWraps up our interview with music supervisor Susan Jacobs and now we want to hear from you what the film and television show that you think uses music really well give us a call at eight eight eight eight five nine Eighteen hundred and leave your answer and tell us why\nAre our\n[noise] Mm [noise]\nEverybody was why was [noise]\n\nOh\nGod\n\nWe ... we had a\n\n\nUm\n[noise] oh\nThat was offered a ... like to take a trip to the desert island pop a quarter in the desert island ... box\nAnd play a track we cannot live without Jim this week it's your turn\nWell Greg obviously after that ... we had with Susan or movies and music\nAnd the perfect pairing of the two were on my mind I'm usually two or three years ahead of you on movies\nAre only because my wife is the editor of movies at your paper out this she's up and bringing something home and she had to twist my arm to watch this film that she was excited about and I was skeptical Mika Nineteen eighty eight\nThis is a twenty Seventeen interesting collaboration between artist in Italy and Belgium a female director Susanna\nNicole rally a shot in English starring a Danish actress train dry hole apparently a train was a big star in her native uh Scandinavia a began singing as a teenager", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Sound Opinions", "city": "Nashville", "day": "22"}
