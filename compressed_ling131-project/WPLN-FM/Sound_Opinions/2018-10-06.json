legendary guitarist for the Detroit banned the MC five currently on tour celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of that bans signature debut kick out the jams\nWill talk to wane about his new memoir is struggled with drug and alcohol addiction and his time in prison and how that helped turned his life around but first we have to pay tribute to the late great Otis Rush\n\nWhat you're\nThat his oldest rush with I Can't quit you baby his first single in Nineteen fifty six oldest rushed died recently the age of eating for Jim noticed well known as some of the great a Chicago these icons you know Muddy Waters and Willie Dixon even doubting guy Howlin' Wolf\nBut I Would say as influential as any of them are really important a figure in the Chicago blues beginning in the fifties in fact if you'd only recorded those sites that he didn't\nAbout fifty six through fifty eight he would be a legendary guitars he had a long career after that suffered a stroke and a two thousand and three that just centrally kept him off stage or for the last Fifteen Years of his life but his legacy\nIs huge you just need to talk to people like Eric Clapton or Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac Carlos Santana Stevie Ray Vaughan his style was intense corrosive\nYou know he was he was a you know that noise melody kind of merger that was so hip Twenty years later or or or a decade later started with people like Hendricks\nOldest sort of had that style down in the fifties bar scene in Chicago and you can hear it in his guitar playing he was one of the architects of the so called west side sound there is a lot of debate in Chicago like what's the difference between the west side blues\nAnd the south side lose some people say it was as simple as the fact that oldest rush used a horn section and instead of a harmonica player in his bands but there was also an intensity to the sound that old as a rush brought to his guitar playing but I think was truly truly\nDistinctive the one thing about oldest rush is that you've got a sense of you know people talk about the blues being kind of sad music yeah with Otis there was pain there was an English at the heart of it\nWell and there were protests music yeah you know I I hate you quote him again but the late great Lester Bangs at toward the end of his life the last great piece he wrote\nThe great guitarist Robert Klein who's also gun said you need to listen to Otis Rashid Lester was depressed he was down in the dumps he wrote this incredible piece that I have all my students in college read Otis Rush mugged by an iceberg and it's about that intensity that searing pain\nAnguish anger there's no way you can listen to his guitar playing and not be moved\nHe was a you know he'd always be smiling and those album covers yeah have you ever saw him perform there was that face was so serious and it was a very soft spoken guy\nWhen you did interviewing I remember once you know he was talking to me and he says you know I don't do anything but worry that's about all I Do I worry about my damn hard times and bills and this guy was a you know he worked at a steel mill packing house he's driving a truck\nYou know these guys didn't make a lot of money they had they had to make ends meet he was still worried about paying rent even though he was worldwide famous at that time there was a sense of that English and pain in every\nNote he played his guitar player was extraordinary but he was also a great singer I think that probably the most underrated facet\nOf Otis as a performer was not only could he play that guitar but man that guy could sing as well\nHere's one of his most famous tracks double trouble from a from the fifties when it first recordings he made just a kitten as early twenties and listen to the intensity beats the very adult nature of the anguish in this man's voice double trouble from oldest rush on sound opinions\n\n\nRight\n[noise]\nThat is a great Otis Rush dead at the age of eighty four\nRight that's a little bit of a track called window from room twenty five in the first proper album by an artist who goes by NO NAME she does have a name ... Warner\nGrew up here in the Brownsville neighborhood of Chicago or mom ran a bookstore well respected in the African American community\nUm now based in Los Angeles making a big splash with room twenty five although she first appeared on the hip hop scene are collaborating with a lot of Chicago hip hop talent this whole new generation great make Jenkins chance the rapper\nDonny Trump at the social experiment meal of woods uh twenty sixteen\nGot a lot of notice for her first mix tape as a solo artist telephone\nNow comes a photo album\nThe name comes from the fact she was twenty five when working on most of this album and also living in one hotel room after another\nDealing with drug addiction a turbulent relationship all of it goes into this record this is a song called NO NAME by hip hop artist NO NAME from room twenty five on sound opinions\n[noise]\n\nI mean for people to ... to ... I see that they put me in trends and I felt the and then like cancer not as a threat and mining is pretty good candidate\nSays something about this because they didn't give up the process of painting and history in Malala's name down in Saint\nLouis they didn't and going and I'm a camp there\n[noise]\nI mean that's when I have is like\nOn the on that I that\nLet us know name with a track called NO NAME from her new record rooms twenty five gym a lot of discussion about you know the name the meaning of that name NO NAME what he called herself known as the question she gets asked\n\nIf it was a no win a lot of fans in the late sixties we're talking about sort of a radical revolutionary as sort of a sense of cultural upheaval was necessary in the midst of the Vietnam War [noise]\nSpiro Agnew was the vice president of our country at that time commission on terrorism and the and the new ... says the band is part of the communist conspiracy to corrupt the use of America [laughter] way and you're a young guy you're seeing all this stuff getting piled on your head\nOr you're you're on a rock band that's that's making some noise out of the mid west and suddenly you're on the radar or the vice president United States what was it was a feeling within the band at that time [noise]\nFelt like we were um being fairly effective in disturbing the power structure but clearly used everything they had against us and we ultimately\nWent to court with the Justice Department over the issue of illegal wiretaps they said that they could tap our phones because it was a matter of domestic security\nAnd we held that we we're a nation of laws and not have men and that you needed a warrant signed by a judge to tap ones phones\nAnd the Supreme Court of the United states agreed with us\nAnd the day before our court decision was released\nThe plumbers were caught taking the bugs out of democratic headquarters in the Watergate mhm so our white panther wiretap case led to the downfall of Richard\nNixon I basically inserted my strata caster where the sun doesn't shine Richard Nixon [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\nTo me was interesting when you talk very openly in the book kind of openly admitting or you know hey I just wanted to not do a regular job like I didn't want to work\nI wanted to have sex I wanted to play in a rock and roll band and yet you become these sort of ... of this radicalized you know left wing revolution how did that transition really occur\nWell it it wasn't that I didn't want to work\nI just didn't want to do certain kinds of work were you know I'm being a Detroit or we hold hard labor in high esteem there's no ability and working hard so I wanted to work hard but I wanted to work hard it's something that I thought mattered and I didn't think\nThat a ... a job on the line at Chrysler was going to amount to much\nBut the radicalization was ... that I was part of an entire generation\nThat just could not stomach the hypocrisy and the corruption of American ideals you know at my core I always saw myself as a Patriot Act you know democracy is participatory it's not just the word that we throw around it's actually something that we do\nAnd my understanding of the way our country function was if you didn't like the way the government was doing something that you could protest it and I protested with everything that I had\nAnd I was part of an entire generation that protested the war in Vietnam civil rights outdated fifty sexual morality\nLaws and host of other uh you know the environment [laughter] there there was a lot to protest\nAgainst and [noise] and uh I was one of those people that smoke out [noise]\n[noise] you're\nRight in the middle of that sixty eight Democratic National convention when things got ugly you were the only I guess there were the number of bands that were invited to play you were the only band that actually did play\nAt the convention a sort of a as a part of this the the student movement that was occurring in protest it what was going out of the convention downtown Chicago you shut up and Lincoln Park um what were your memories of that day and sixty eight to because of the riots started to flow downhill\nPretty much as soon as you got dumped playing right [noise]\nYeah it wasn't like other outdoor live music events\nThat we all have been to\nWhere people are happy and smiling and there's a good vibe there was a very heavy vibes the Chicago police were driving there a Harley Davidson try sickles\nThrough the crowd mocking them kids over there were undercover police are starting a fist fights with kids or you're roughing people up\nSo the atmosphere was very tense and uh you know a number of uh the young people came prepared to fight and so once the band once we finished our set and the crowd didn't have anything to focus on the focus their attention on the Chicago police and they were\nThey welcomed them with the ... swinging batons and had had busting and arrests and\nAnd it was the first time that a mom and pop America saw it happening on the nightly news you know they had never seen a policeman beat kids before like a beat reporter slide\nAnd his is a shock the nation [noise]\n\nWayne that after the MC five such intensity a blaze so bright for a short period of time you go into the recording of the second out at Penn it's a real super intense studio experience\nAnd you seem to have mixed feelings about that album still you know you were you is something that you guys we're we're striving for was just sort of out of reach [noise]\nWhat we had no experience working in a recording studio it takes time\nTo learn how to be comfortable with the recording process we had only made a couple of singles before kickoff his ... and check out the germs was recorded lives\nSo on a back in the usa the MC five second album that was really our our education and how to record and we were going through a lot of changes in the band trying to trying to ratchet up our approach in order to be better musicians to be a better\n[noise]\nI have mixed feelings but [noise] um I I Know each albums intimately I Know\nWhat their strengths and weaknesses were and in that records case I think we we did overreact to the criticism that we were so undisciplined\nIn so irresponsible music irresponsible idiosyncratic\nThat that we that we really put a lot of emphasis on\nThat the temples were solid and that the guitars we're in tune and that this ... singing melodies were on pitch and and that the lyrics were were very ... in fact the lyrics are more overtly political on the second album than they were on the first album\nBut you know each of these albums as they're like my kids you know they got a special place in my heart and the great\n... records of what we were trying to accomplish\nAnd yet those who who were there who saw the five in their heyday or who've seen you since in your white excellent solo career you know will always say the records are great but it's live\n... what happens live I mean that's where I think if some day when I grow up I'm going to come to terms with jazz when I'm more mature but I as I understand as I understand what you guys took from jazz and and what you as a as a as a musician and a person I've taken from jazz is that spontaneity\nUnique a thing that can happen only in the moment mhm\nYeah there's a there's a time\nIf musicians are tuned into each other and have a fundamental agreement about what they're trying to do where everything works beautifully that Europe human beings doing a most human activity of performing and creating music spontaneously\nAnd it actually never gets any better than that there's you know and I've I've had my share of of great nights of music where you're you're up on the stand\nYou know he's become obviously ... I mean you should be an iconic character you guys saw something in that band that you liked obviously\nOh yeah I mean you couldn't deny it she had a complete vision and it was very clear about I mean there were no performers danced with the abandoned and the rhythm that a ... popped danced with are still dances with I mean he's one of the great front men of all\nTime um uh so yeah of course if or when Danny feels sub does or any other bands around here like the MC five I said no there's no more bands like the MC five which are he just seemed like a family\n[noise]\nAll you know we were all best friends and we all listened to the same coal train them sunrise and we all smoked the same passion we always at the same bologna sandwiches and brown rice and\nYou think about the characters you know coming through there the navy and I guess I don't know if you knew Alice Cooper at the time but he wouldn't even just a little bit\nLater I guess a Seeger Bob Seeger measure writer all these characters I mean where was it a close knit community in terms of the people who are making this kind of music which wasn't precisely mainstream certainly at that time\nYeah it was it we all knew each other I mean we've all been together with all known each other\nGoing back to the record ... days where we're all\nShow up at a at a church hall where one of the local DJ's would uh be spinning records and there'd be packed with teenagers dancing and and uh your band could get up and play a Fifteen or twenty minutes set in between mall the a Motown artist\nTheir latest release it was very exciting time I mean Detroit was driving it was a bustling industrial city with the you know good paying jobs and everything seems impossible and\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nOne of the\nHottest thing I found all you have a good buddy his name is Ted [noise]\nAnd I know you and Ted Nugent came up in the same place under the same time All right\nUm but my God\nYou know he wants to go out and shoot Buffalo's and shoot anybody who wouldn't let him shoot a buffalo and and just just about I mean he's about ... about a hundred and eighty degrees opposite everything you stay in Fort Wayne\nYeah it's it's it's pretty it's pretty weird yeah you know he he never had any political interest in the sixties\nAnd he didn't really take it up until I'm thinking you know ... once a solo career kind of arc and they were he was looking for something new to\nTo ah to keep him in the discussion and I think he discovered that\nThrough his uh his hunting in outdoorsman [laughter] hobby that there was a an entree into the world of radical right wing extremists the viewpoint\nYou know I I we remain friends or I could call them up today and we could have a pleasant conversation\nUm but we have not we have yet to have a real substantive political and Iran I I'm open to it I Would like to I'd like to fish because I Know he does a lot of good in the world you know he works with kids he under writes programs for young people\nAnd I know he's a Family Guy and ... and I and I kinda worry about him you know he invited Tom Burrell and I to one of his gigs in in LA and we went over to the house of blues where he was playing and were hanging out backstage\nAnd it's getting to be time for him to go on and he turns around and bends over to pick up his guitar and we see he strapped\n... you know he's got this this level in the back of his ... just\nStruck me like oh gosh what must a man's life be like that he has to go through it armed you know what world does he live and how much how much fear is got to be going on there [noise]\n\nLet me ask you a broader question I'm sure it seemed like even when people had political differences and that most turbulent time of\nThe sixties we could unite around certain things the music could bring people together do you think Wayne that still the case today I mean you play in a lot of different guys as you play in the indie rock punk rock underground and you play jazz and you play with prisoners behind bars and you know um it does it still have that power do you believe in\nSure does art art will always have the power to make a connection between people to to bridge the gap between people if I Do something in music if I tell the truth about\nAre there's somebody else out there that felt the same way that reminds me that I'm not the only nut case no out here you know somebody else's feels word because ultimately art confirms our humanity and tells us we're not alone\n... and we're all in this together we are all in this together ethnicity\n[laughter] [noise]\n[laughter] [noise] I'm reading\nIn one when the MC five fell apart and then you go down your passive of drug abuse crime wind up in prison [noise] it seems like there was a distance there\nBetween you and and Fred sonic Smith and un Rob tighter you you you say like ... I mean you deal with each of their passing in a couple of sentences and say you know we hadn't been close when he passed but it hit me hard well\nBecause we never were able to reconnect after the breakup of the band nothing was ever resolve a we never got to know each other as grown ups and it it's just left as an open wound a scar a and\nThere's there you know there is no closure or resolution to\nTo ah when people leave before their time even if\nEven if it is a natural I mean what what is a natural death for me yeah right you know desire to die that's about as natural as it gets 'em\nBut you know we never got to ... we never got a chance to to be friends and you're kind of review what we went through together I I think we probably none of us\nReally survived having been in the MC five it was too much for a bunch of young guys to\nTo walk through the fire and and all the the ultra highs and devastating Lowe's and the\nPressure and say the friendships and the camaraderie the undermining of all that and\nSee it one day all go away\nIt was it was rough so yeah I mean it was hard [laughter]\n... ...\n... runs [noise] boom [noise] ... do\nTell us about a ... you have the second career now is well a scoring films and doing film where you've been in LA for a long time now based out on the west coast [noise] um what is what does that world like how did you get into it [noise]\nWell I knew I knew the day was coming when I Would not be quite so enthusiastic about getting in the van again\nYeah yeah there is a great paragraph towards the end of the book about everybody romanticize it but it's leaving how sleeping on the floor night after night yeah it's\nIt's hard work and and uh you know I I thought I could\nDo some music for film it always seemed like a possibility I I Would listen to the under score on television and and uh I ... in movies and saw my could do some of that I could do something like that I Know a little bit about this but when I finally moved to LA and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Sound Opinions", "city": "Nashville", "day": "06"}
