songs to elevate the visuals to another level\nTo always puts conveying the emotion that the director wants to convey as you know tell people music as a point of view are chopped his supervisors is to make sure that everybody's understanding the different point of view that are possible\nPlus we'll review new albums from prince and singer songwriter Sam Feldman that's all coming up on sound opinions\nSound opinions is supportive I guess I was their company Chicago craft breweries that works to innovate new ways to brew an age fear more at ... dot com\nYou don't need to be the only very drank we just want to be the best theory drink [laughter]\nUsually the sound opinions and a leader in the show Jim we're going to talk with Susan Jacobs she's an Emmy winning music supervisor I mean she's the person that picks the songs you hear in shows like a sharp objects and big little lies she's also been the music supervisor for a number of movies working with people like Spike Lee\nDavid old Russell on and on she'll talk with us about how she decides what's the perfect song for every scene and how she got let sampling of all people to agree to their music being used that's coming up later on the show Greg but first we've got some new music\nNever met the man oh\nBecause\nI'm On the view that they\nKnew who\nIs a snippet of purple rain everybody knows that some of the great prints as you can tell a very sparse a stripped down version or in its initial stages a purple rain these are demo recordings are done in prince's house before there was a ...\nA sitting at a piano with a microphone\nThe new ... prince album piano and the microphone Nineteen eighty three what a career he's had a since his death in two thousand sixteen the vaults have become a low yeah to the public will see uh what this producers because in the past we've seen\nSome uh some ... projects or the Jimmy Hendrix a state or the doors et cetera ... where there's been a ton of recordings coming out a posthumously\n... that is starting to happen now with prince's music as well we're going to evaluate or the the merits of this project but first let's play a track from it\nIt's a track called Mary don't you weep a great uh nineteenth century spirit has been in the gospel cannon for centuries as performed by prince from piano in a microphone Nineteen eighty three unsound opinions\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nFriends with a piano a microphone in Nineteen eighty three\nCovering Mary don't you weep a I don't think he top Aretha Franklin version on amazing grace\nBut it is an extraordinary a version of that show and Greg neglected to say it was recorded by an engineer this album piano when a microphone Nineteen eighty three I sat in one point here ... you got to flip that over now right cassette kids was an antiquated or the technology I'll never\nMind I'm you know I in saddened\nBy what is certain to be forty or fifty years of Pashtun Mitch grave robbing of princes volts\nWould he have released this I don't know is their interest there for people who love prince absolutely but you know the stakes are not high he's playing for the joy of playing you can see songs develop\nA you can see the sides of his personality as with Mary don't you weep I also really love the ... song cold coffee and\n[noise] common name\nA prince heads talk about his Jamie start caring you're right you know the street hustler the why they're you know All right you know Mary and and and coke coffee and cocaine or the only revelations here\nThis is not a great last prints album like say the blackout be hard funk record he had to shell in Nineteen eighty seven we all scuffed it up on bootleg didn't come out officially until Nineteen Ninety four are their\nEquivalent like that in in these vaults I don't know there are revelations here\nI just don't know if I'll ever listen to it again\n[noise] you know I disagree with the I'll never listen to it again remark I mean that's your taste my initial reaction to this record was that it was a it was kind of a throwaway okay what's what's this all about why is this even coming out and the more listen to it as sort of got pulled into the idea\nThat we're getting a window into process here and we so seldom got that was prince um you know he was very big on releasing finished records in fact there's tons of finished records in his vaults they haven't come out\nA so why this one yet made purple rain yet you know he's on the cusp of something really extraordinary but we're seeing how his mind works and what I loved most about hearing this is his virtuous city as a pianist a first of all a and the joy he brings to the performance is the fact that he seems to be\nSo unfiltered and realizing hey I'm just sort of messing around here just following my mind letting it wonder\nIs pretty bad thing I mean there's basically a a thirty minute string of unbroken music here where he's just getting on one end to the next you know a snippet of purple rain a snippet of Joni Mitchell\nIn I'm not\nThat great gospel track that we just play which by the way he totally reinvention jak I mean yeah yeah it's it out of church there's no big deal just Saturday Night go go scripture is there any more than ... now a real person who yet you're lovers not going to come home Mary Ryan Mary don't you weep you know he's a\nHe's talking about some other subjects there he's blending the sacred and the end of profane\n... down and\nGot all that that\nYoung man and he comes up\nSo I Love that aspect I I I'm Glad you mentioned cold coffee and cocaine you know a Jamie stars just another way saying I'm ripping off the ground here\nNow I'm not going to recommend it to everybody a but man if your prince man this is that this is Matt from Avon is a man like yeah but there's somebody spent two years and went through what is alleged to be you know a treasure trove and the volt I just found those Mary don't you we're I'm at and gave us a whole album that\nThat's right Jim this is her second television collaboration with director John Mark delegate after the HBO series big little lies so when you interview by asking her how she got into the music supervision business\nStarts sort of something like I think most things I fell backwards into this field you know my first soundtrack album credit was project managing she's got a habit\nAnd worked very closely when Spike Lee's father who did the score from that album when I was working at Arlen records\nOr girl that I once knew who all of them had a friend or two she gave him time low where ...\nThey would come from far away and then go there all day to show their love anything which one which they ...\nAnd then I went on to management I kind of circled around this for a long time in different directions and by the time that I actually knew there was such a job is to music supervision which came\nFrom a recommendation to June ... that was the first film I ever did on my own you know I just\nPurchased it like this is what my artist wants Jillian or Twenty one I'm going to figure out a way because [noise]\n\nYou know Suzy\nYour job essentially didn't exist for a long time and it was one of those things that sort of evolved is music and movies built to sort of\nSynergistic relationship it used to be that or or Castro scores made for these movies right and then the job also became not only these original scores\nBut then the idea of ... songs from the pop music Rome or whatever genre into the movie to sort of help develop character tone and plot where you kind of a fan of this art form before you actually started doing it\nYeah I actually played soundtrack album addicted to the swimmer the trauma yeah swimmer that have the most beautiful American handling the\n... I think my record collection had almost equally soundtrack vinyl soundtrack visited bam you have always found that interesting and I can never in a million years thought about it\nAs a job and didn't know that it was a job and\nEven when I came in really a lot of supervisors were working directly with record labels and then putting\nTheir music and to move it more record labels are actually paying for ... for supervisors and the music in the movies you know I'm just such a control freak in the fact that I don't want to be dictated backwards but I really just always one at the freedom to\nYou know go wherever the movie and the director wanted to go and then end up having people on the soundtrack after that and not kind of work it in the other way because I just that being dictated to from that direction with never interesting to me\nI think where it's evolved to is that it's become a much more important factor in television and now that you've got these mini series that are sort of viewed as art forms on the level of a of a of a great movie\nYou've got this increasingly important role the music is playing in them what intrigued you about these mini series\nWell my only experience I followed my director you know shock value and I had worked on a couple of feature films and he said okay we're going here and all that was my deep dive and came away with so much appreciation for that work for\n[noise]\n... [noise]\nChange [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nIt's something I really liked about the two HBO Sears you worked on big little lies and sharp objects was that they both featured female music ... you know I think too often in movies and TV male characters are the ones who are the messengers the cool music you know the ones whose lives are saved by rock and roll\nUp first I Want to talk about Chloe from big little lies who's this little six year old girl who loves music and we're not talking about these me so you know she is listening to some pretty great stone PJ Harvey Charles Bradley\nShe's amazing him including her her precocious little\nIPod you know telling her dad you know which Elvis song he needs to play no no no doubt you could do this one\nYou know she's a she's a already hanging out with the old Seventeen stopping and then you know introducing Leon Bridges to her mom that yeah yeah you know she's like she's an incredibly precocious young young girls\n[noise]\nI don't want to come on\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nNow oh\nThing\n\nWhich you know it's very much on mark planted it because he doesn't use composer than we are having to tell our a motive story\nThrough the license tracks which is very unusual for any director to kind of knows that going through that I'm not going to use a composer and we're going to handle\nYou know through these characters and that's what I mean ... ... ... you know we just really she's the one that sort of was helping everybody narrative ... through her iPod [noise] tell that story\nWas also a character in sharp objects Alice who helps tell the narrative with music on her I thought she's a fellow patient in the hospital a with Camille shows protagonist they were both dealing with problems with ... hours teachers Camille to use music particularly Led Zeppelin\nAs a way to escape the internal distress the pain that she's experiencing\nWhat I loved about Camille was that she didn't know anything about music she gets into the hospital and she's there with the young girls that you know kind of looks at her and says more kind of music do you\nPlay or do you listen to and she's like I don't I don't like music I never really listen to music and the girls like job just to follow the law that she's\nShe's like what no wonder you're on your girl and she's on her she'll girl and she goes but I can get out of here and that I loved that so much that she could teach somebody older than her\nShe's a teenager looking out for me in her mid twenties and saying I can teach you how to fly out of here you don't even have to be in here\nAnd teaching the power of music to escape your situation\n[laughter] [noise]\n\n\n\n\n[laughter]\n[noise] [noise]\n[laughter] what led you know really signed on to the music has a lot\nThan just some background than a restaurant\nOr some ... some video if you actually important role in\nIn so many large and if you're not familiar with it in that way and don't have that relationship I'm hoping that come meals character encourages everybody to kind of sit back and go wait\nI'm In this mood I'm going to put on this record in the what happened and you can fly off and it will totally changed your mood I think that's the importance of it\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nWell you know I got to ask you though Susan you so did you ever have a conversation with The Elders character and say why do you have such expensive taste good licensing Led Zeppelin songs ain't cheap I Wonder how that worked out because they are notoriously difficult to uh you know extract music from or allow their music to be used in films or or or TV shows\nAnd she was like well I you know if there's something really emotional and warm about those rock songs and the seventies [noise]\nYou're my wife [noise]\n[noise] [laughter]\n\nWe met at an ice rink where I was\nWhen you sit down and try and jump in Asia and you're right you don't\nHave some more stuff that goes with the sound of it really started with such a first picture is always first what's going to serve the pitcher and\nSo those songs ended up really being something about it was so important on like Tania that that music stayed warm and that she\nSaid that we could and have power because otherwise you wouldn't like her\nAnd if I tried a couple of Ninety things I tried a couple of things and it was totally film didn't want it and it may turn ... or so we really how we worked really hard so I already he already how do you know his arrows pointed and I want seventies music and then we just worked really really hard to get\nWhat we wanted to put things in there and you're always just serving narrative and serving pitcher\nBut the most difficult thing of Tanya was getting people to understand\nThat this was a really important story to be told and you know we ... was so gracious because he had turned down\nThe dire straits on Romeo and Juliet several times saying no way that that was before I came on board and then I reached out spent four hours writing the right let her off and then to the first real instead I'm just asking you to take a look and if you want to see the rest of it let me know\nThat he would understand that that was actually a really beautiful use the Romeo and Juliet\nAnd why [noise] what do you like like me [noise]\n\n[noise] mystery shows and that\nTeam and there were just really great but it was getting him and then he wrote\nThe sweetest note and said thank you Susan checkups I would've never knows that was it and he was so happy to be part of that film and so I think it's really about communication are just the artistry and what Craig's turn to do why it's important\nAnd why that music belongs there is a lot of it and you know the same thing working on American Hustle are silver linings playbook which we how do you know really early Alabama Shakes and very very early O. J. O. J. was just a baby bands at that point\nI it's it's so great when you realize that you're getting this great marriage\nA visual artist and then also to to see that I was saying and I went to see the most amazing elope concert they are out there playing chaplain is playing the most amazing shows right now and to see how far three eight overture lie just blew\nHustle had a lot to do when they're not talking the lost cause that guy's got one hit song after another it's not like she you know but I ... that that's the influence of film and you\nYou know you're kind of think I bet that gave a lot of new life to that time because the crowd went crazy over it\n... it wasn't one of those uh you know top twenty below you know greatest hits you you\nKnow and he's got he's got a top forty there I mean every song he'd probably she can't believe like oh my God he wrote that too and you're back to and he brought that to a it's kind of amazing\nOr I got one question for it so you're the\nMusic ... like gosh in terms of you know how does how does music work or in the world and obviously you're a big fan of music working in film and TV you started your own projects what if you were to say to anybody give me an example of how music and\nAudio and video can work together to create something sort of a third thing that's the greater than some of the parts what's what's your best example of that\nGoes the Easy Rider go see it go see the graduate\n[laughter] [noise]\n\n[noise] [laughter] I\nMean those sorts of things that all of us strive to make the garage of again midnight cowboy and my\nGoodness I mean ... you know what\nHave that collaboration between composer and than an artist by carry I mean all of us are trying to keep making ... none of us have gotten their\nKnow\nI Can't believe\nAll in a shallow\nI think about ... how that I'm ...\nPlan to make that dark and deeper and more [noise] yeah that's amazing I mean you can't look at the graduate without thinking about the permanent Garfunkel\nSoundtrack to them you know we're all trying to do that I mean we you know sure have anything that ever comes close to that kind of cooperation with a solo\nArtist being able but also the industry was braver than I think people just took it you know music played a looser roll it was more you know if things were as managed as they are now\nAnd I don't know I think there's some young kid falling in love with your work now who's thinking the same\nSomeday I ... I think you're inspiring a new generation they're all I Hope I Hope so we've been talking with Susan Jacobs one of our favorite music supervisors it's a it's been a real pleasure Susan thanks for coming on China been a great thank you all that\nWraps up our interview with music supervisor Susan Jacobs and now we want to hear from you what the film or television show that you think uses music really well give us a call at eight eight eight eight five nine Eighteen hundred and leave your answer and tell us why new\nServer\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] oh\n[laughter] oh\n\nWe've ...\nOh\nOh\nOh\n[laughter] but as far as we like to take a trip to the desert island pop a quarter in the desert island you brought\nTo play a track we cannot live without Jim this week it's your turn\nWell Greg obviously after that ... we had with Susan or movies and music\nAnd the perfect pairing of the two were on my mind I'm usually two or three years ahead of you on movies\nAre only because my wife is the editor of movies at your paper out this she's up and bringing something home and she had to twist my arm to watch this film that she was excited about and I was skeptical Nico Nineteen eighty eight\nThis is a twenty Seventeen interesting collaboration between artist in Italy and Belgium a female director Susanna\nNicole rally a shop in English\nStarring a Danish actress train dry hole apparently a train was a big star in her native uh Scandinavia a began singing as a teenager the director Susanna", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Sound Opinions", "city": "Nashville", "day": "20"}
