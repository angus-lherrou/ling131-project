Christmas special but people love scary songs and there are tons of them were going to get to a bunch more today\nYou get to go first or a gym I've got a perfect lead us down for us it's from the band the cure from the u._k. debut album from Nineteen Seventy nine three imaginary boys and it is a song that I think typically buys this whole notion of the theater\nWhere a guy like Alfred Hitchcock was terrific building suspense in building anticipation\nYou wouldn't show you what is happening but what might happen and planting the seeds of doubt in the viewer's mind about what is about to happen to these characters and I think this cure song subway song does that perfectly\nBasically only eight lines averse I great I'm In a baseline in this song these little terse finger snaps about midway through and then a surprise ending I'm not going to give away completely but just be a notice that something terrible is going to happen\nTo this person that is depicted coming home late at night on a subway train we've all been there we've all heard the footsteps in the back of us wondering is that somebody following me am I the only person in here or am I being stalked by someone so the anticipation is is really nicely played out in the song it is a horrific\nHalloween saw the cures subway song unsound opinions\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise] so [noise] Mm\n[noise]\n\nMidnight and ... and she's on her way home tries not to around ... she's not alone ...\nSteps photos behind Bush and\nThen hung around [noise] and I know [noise]\n[noise] Mm\n[noise]\nMm [noise] Mm\n\n\nMm [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nMm [noise]\n\nWell\nI suppose you're part of my seat when I hear that part of the song it'll be played in the background and I'm just like I'll jump out of my chair when I hear it is scary but I tell you what scarier as Robert Smith all the whole outfit the make up the whole thing yeah this is kind of like the pre makeup Robert Smith but his head was definitely in a dark place when he wrote subway song that's the cure from Nineteen Seventy nine\nAll right Jim what have you got for a great Halloween song well\nYour reserve scary rock songs is seemingly a boundless but you know we've done the show a bunch of times and I wanted to not be so obvious that I wanted to kind of take some left turns today so I turned to some of our listeners for some inspiration some I chose myself some came in by email people were were ... look on it's all about the show they just were given a great suggestions\nKevin in ... park out here in Illinois he said one of my favorite songs spooky or not is ghost town by the specials from the ghoulish mountains to the high pitch whales from scary image painted of empty streets in closed down clubs to the singles cover art work of skeletons playing the piano\nHe does note in in a joking manner that even scarier was that no doubt once covered dish well we're going to the original version by the special\nOne ghost town came out in Nineteen eighty one it was talking about\nShuttered streets unemployment urban unrest on the streets of London it was a heavy time\nAnd there were riots that erupted just as this song was coming out and making to the top of the chart and I think that's the scary thing about this song a city losing it so a city in an uproar heritage by the special ghost town on sound [noise]\n\n\n\nAll of a global uh\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGhost town by the specials are sound opinions one of our scary ex for this Halloween [noise] but you got your next what he got the chill a good one gym one of the scariest aspects\nOf this song is the fact that the singer Scott Walker once used to be in a group called the Walker brothers seeing music that was completely unlike when I'm about to play\nThe Walker brothers had a huge hit in the sixties called the sunny going to shine anymore you can you do but and find out what that is all about and we played that song and then play this next one I'm about to lay on you know go that's the same guy Scott Walker using that slush baritone crew in his voice in a more sinister fashion\nOn this song it's from his two thousand six I'm called the drift\nAnd in this song he starts I was kind of this post nine eleven scenario and then it morphs into this meditation on Elvis Presley in the womb\n[noise]\n\nNah\nWelcome back to San ... caught with Jimmy regardless and this is our annual Halloween special we've been hearing from some of our listeners about some of their scariest songs of all time and gym and I are going back and forth to some of our selection and uh right now it's Jim stern\nGreg I'm going to throw another one to another dedicated listener who wrote in with a killer suggestion one was so good maybe go instantly doled out nobody ever thought of it before Shelby Peterson from Chicago said\nHard choice but I have to go with pirate Jenny by Nina Simone her voice has a haunting cash to it and when she gets out near the end that alert yet it sends shivers down my spine Shelby is absolutely right\nEunice way man I mean it smells real name is singing a song by ... Brecht and Curt bio from three pending opera\nIf I look at it as just the two that those guys wrote pirate Jenny is about a woman who is perhaps captured by one ship and then the pirates that she was part up are coming to rescue her the black ship on the horizon and they these people who've been mistreating are making her scrub the decks and who knows what else are going to get there\nThe weight Nina Simone plays it now she was a civil rights activists\nShe changes and very few words and does it skillfully it's suddenly a southern hotel and that she is cleaning and she's being mistreated by the white patrons in a racist society and the black\nShip suddenly becomes something else it's it's going to become justice when societies equalize you're going to get yours and you know the anger in her voice is amazing but it's so subtly underplayed that that's what's\nCreepy about a powerful tune\nA scary tune pirate Jenny by Nina Simone on sound opinions\nYou can watch one scrap and these are going to scrap and the laws while you're gone [noise]\nMaybe once you've kept me and it makes you feel ...\nYou couldn't hear you talk about\nThen no\nAs a screaming in the night and you wonder\nHave been [noise] and you see me ...\nOnce you got to clean all ... yeah is is [noise]\nWith the um the on into my\nHead and we'll be common and\n\nYou gentleman ... gas companies\nAgain when you talk to me it seemed to send them out to like ships but I'm happy\nSome nice nobody's going to sleep you\nKnow [noise]\n\nBut then\nOne night the bass green nice to have you seen clues\nKicking up around and use the meat has\nOut the window\nWhat I Do stand now that\nCounty is that as a sort of\n[noise]\nVote in a\n... but other shooting guns from a ... oh\n[noise]\nPirate Jenny from Nina Simone from Jim to regard as one of his great Halloween songs of all time I loved that choice Gemini ties in a really nicely with what I'm going to play next that sort of macro view of the world the sense of evil in the world looks like a fiasco addressed that on his song put you on game from his two thousand seven out of the cool\nConcept album about this title character and the choices he has to make in this world death fraught with evil I mean look at it was coming up a really hard time it's like when he made this album is father and a good friend had just died his longtime manager just gone to prison so he's investigating this topic of\nYou know temptation evil sinister forces at work in the world\nBut the narrator in this song is a really creepy character the guy runs this place and we're talking about from the White House the crack house and you have those those violins kind of escalating in the background the crack of gunshots you've got this ominous chant let me put you on game\nThe game as this hostile but you know the ... game the con game the gangster game\nAnd the song just keeps escalating intensity until the very end when ... almost revealed his identity or the identity of the narrator in this song\nHe doesn't really tell you who it is because it's on cuts off just in time but you can yes I mean this is sympathy for the devil this the Rolling Stones that ... you know everywhere there's some mayhem happening I'm the guy at the heart of it all coup a fiasco put you on game on Sunday opinion [noise]\nSome you know that I'm from the display and not become this must be front and since then it's become this way\nThing number ... than in there and they have become a monkey and I've been on one of them in the poll with the numbers died\nIn the heart of ... some of these different chapter obviously given the mole talked on this but they're from listening hard on this road rules from multiple steps I'm the one that they could buy no I Am the one that may minus or in\nMarket the whole Republican crack houses than the men\nDo to make the ... the pages that they just didn't seem to\nWith the same thing but the thing is you're famous or the\nOne that is most ancient his things because every single language on the plane\nDown [noise]\nI Am the maverick gyms dreams\nDining machine double the price committed the murder regime the tough guy and the one behind me [noise]\nI ended up in London this team it's gas whatever and then ... and in math and then the read the gunshot wound that class and talking patch she\nInvented the damage on demand for the hedge things\nBack I'm Glad that he's going to be helping them all comes back to what you want to put my hospitals Hi you're much\nIn the trash that can help when all that year when you fly in his\nI'm sure the ... and his background hospitals ... maybe ... maybe ...\nBucks a welfare even probably\nMake that you can watch TV addicts shipwreck but the ... the British will put up with what you are still my next to this I Am the same for\nResist the veterans didn't mislead the number one to prevent it from a grown up the bones are blew\nUp all the molecules are what make them\nHad a song based on\nThe cold or you don't know if you tell them that you played my game you're pulling in all of the mouth and say my name in terms of\nBut other fine Halloween choice put you on game by loop a fiasco nice when Greg\nI uh am ever got nobody to blame except myself for this one and you make Scott initially at this choice but I'm going with ten cc's\nI'm not in love watch creepy about it for one thing the production Kevin godly and allow cream the driving forces in this early seventies English rock band are now much better known as an award winning video production team\nBack then they were just as inventive in the recording studio this initially started out as a falling out of love song with a bossa nova beat nothing too extraordinary they decided to take out the drums and to build\nA wall of rhythm from voices the former members of the band each saying one note and then over dubbed at an ... an over dumped it until they were two hundred and fifty six voices singing the same note which gives this kind of the robbing sensation it seems pretty at first but it gets creepy or as the song goes on\nMen they really dropped the bomb with this apparently they turn to the studios receptionist and had her give that spoken word intro in the middle big plush don't cry\nBig but it's just creepy he said he's not in love I don't think he's going to be breathing much longer either it's kind of in the spirit of that song Timothy that you did a couple of years ago which was actually about cannibalism make little pop song about was that is what ten cc's are not in love is for me here it is on sound opinions\nMy\n... ...\n... ... ...\n...\n...\n... draw\n... ...\n... ... the\nWay from the [noise]\nThe ...\nIs a state trooper from Bruce Springsteen unsound opinions one of my scariest Halloween songs of all time I actually am scared by all of Bruce for his left out but what do you got for your last choice Jim I Want to go with Peter Gabriel Greg it it may seem like an obvious choice but there's good reason you know Gabriel\nI think is one of the best people in the history of rock to in body foreign characters and really bring them to you in Salt\nThe third album the one that really established him as a post geneticists solo artist\nIncludes the tune intruder\nIt's about a burglar I don't think he's just a burglar who enjoys breaking into people's houses\nThe recurring line is I like you know I like to feel a suspense when I'm certain you know and they're like you lying awake your bated breath charging near\nThis guy's doing it for cats and who knows how far he's going not just dealing silverware\nWe think of Peter now as warm and fuzzy world beat champion this is back when he was playing darker characters on the ... also interesting this song was built around a little repetitive phrased that his friend and replacement in genesis Phil Collins played on the drums and the entire thing\nGabriel would do for the next Fifteen Years came from this chance discovery in the studio and much of what Bill college would do it this solo career came from\nThe big aid to Tom Tom's download lots of ... I also love the way somebody guitar just little guitar comes in twice and limits the sound of a window breaking that one by one and unsettling to being true to by Peter Gabriel on down to making\n[noise]\nGermany [noise]\nBe\nThinking back\n... the\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n... ...
