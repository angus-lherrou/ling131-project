struggled with drug and alcohol addiction and his time in prison and how that helped turn his life around but first we have to pay tribute to the late great Otis Rush\n\nWhat is your\nOldest Russia with I Can't quit you baby his first single in Nineteen fifty six oldest rushed died recently the age of eighty four Jim not as well known as some of the great a Chicago these icons you know Muddy Waters them do and Willie Dixon even doubting guy Howlin' Wolf\nBut I Would say as influential as any of them a really important a figure in Chicago blue scene beginning in the fifties in fact if you only recorded those sites that he did was cobra records here in the fifties for\nOver a two year period a fifty six through fifty eight he would be a legendary guitars you had a long career after that suffered a stroke in two thousand and three to just centrally kept him off stage or for the last Fifteen\nYears of his life but his legacy is huge you just need to talk to people like Eric Clapton or Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac Carlos Santana Stevie Ray Vaughan his style was intense corrosive\nYou know he was he was a you know that noise melody kinda merger that was so hip Twenty years later or or or a decade later we started with people like ... oldest sort of had that style down in the fifties bars\nHas guitar playing he was one of the architects of the so called west side sound there is a lot of debate in Chicago like what's the difference between the west side blues\nAnd the south side lose some people say it was as simple as the fact that oldest rush used a horn section and instead of a harmonica player in his bands but there was also an intensity\nTo the sound that was a rush brought to his guitar playing that I think was truly truly distinctive the one thing about oldest rush is that you got a sense of you know people talk about the blues being kind of sad music yeah with Otis there was pain there was English at the heart of it\nWell and there were protests music yeah you know I I hate you quote him again but the late great Lester Bangs at toward the end of his life the last great piece he wrote\nThe great guitarist Robert ... who's also gone said you need to listen to Otis Rashid Lester was depressed he was down in the dumps he wrote this incredible piece that I have all my students in college read oldest rush mugged by an iceberg and it's about that intensity that searing pain\nAnguish anger there's no way you can listen to his guitar playing and not be moved he\nWas a you know he'd always be smiling and those album covers yeah have you ever saw him perform there was that face was so serious and he was a very soft spoken guy when you did interviewing I remember once you know he was talking to me and he says you know I don't do anything but worry\nAbout all I Do I worry about my damn hard times and bills and this guy was a you know he worked at a steel mill packing house he's driving a truck you know these guys didn't make a lot of money they had they had to make ends meet he was still worried about paying rent or even though he was worldwide famous at that time there was a sense of that English and pain in every\nNote he played his guitar player was extraordinary but he was also a great singer I think that probably the most underrated facet\nOf this as a performer was not only could he played that guitar but man that guy could sing as well here's one of his most famous tracks double trouble from a from the fifties when it first recordings he made just a kid in his early twenties and listen to the intensity beats the very adult nature of the anguish in this man's voice\nDouble trouble from oldest rush unsound opinions\n\n\n[noise]\nThat is a great Otis Rush dead at the age of eighty four\nAt the same thing [noise]\nRight that's a little bit of a track called window from room twenty five the first proper album by an artist\nGoes by NO NAME she does have a name ... Warner grew up here in the Brownsville neighborhood of Chicago or mom ran a bookstore\nI'm now based in Los Angeles making a big splash with ruined twenty five although she first appeared on the hip hop scene are collaborating with a lot of Chicago hip hop talent this whole new generation Greg make Jenkins chance the rapper\nDonny Trump at the social experiment meal of woods uh twenty sixteen\nGot a lot of notice for her first mix tape as a solo artist telephone\nNow comes a photo album\nThe name comes from the fact she was twenty five when working on most of this album and also living in one hotel room after another\nDealing with drug addiction a turbulent relationship all of it goes into this record this is a song called NO NAME by hip hop artist NO NAME from room twenty five on sound opinions\n[noise]\n\nI mean for the ... the names and they said that they sent me an I felt the and then the San Fernando ... Canada\nDoesn't last time I didn't I\nJust found the right thing to give up the proper paint and mystery M A label that that's not something done anything\nAnd he didn't and going from camp there\n[noise] I mean that's one I have is lying\nOn the on that at that\nLet us know name with a track called NO NAME from her new record room twenty five gym\n\nIf it wants to know when a lot of fans in the late sixties we're talking about sort of a radical revolutionary as sort of a sense of cultural upheaval was necessary in the midst of the Vietnam War [noise]\nSpiro Agnew was the vice president of our country at that time commission on terrorism and the and the new left says the band is part of a communist conspiracy to corrupt the youth of America [laughter] way and you're a young guy you're seeing all this stuff getting piled on your head\nOr you're you're on a rock band that does make some noise out of the mid west and suddenly you're on the radar or the vice president United States what was it was a feeling within the band at that time [noise]\nFelt like we were um being fairly effective in disturbing the power structure but clearly used everything they had against us and we ultimately\nWent to court with the Justice Department over the issue of illegal wiretaps they said that they could tap our phones because it was a matter um domestic security\nAnd we held that we we're a nation of laws and not have men and that you needed a warrant signed by a judge to tap ones phones\nAnd the Supreme Court of the United states agreed with us\nAnd the day before our court decision was released the plumbers were caught taking the bugs out of democratic headquarters in the Watergate mhm so our white panther wiretap case led to the downfall of Richard Nixon\nI basically inserted my strata caster where the sun doesn't shine Richard Nixon [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\nTo me was interesting when you talk very openly in the book kind of openly admitting I you know hey I just wanted to not do a regular job I I didn't want to work\nI wanted to have sex I wanted to play in a rock and roll band and yet you become these ... of this radicalized you know left wing revolution how did that transition really occur what was the catalyst for that for that occurring\nIt it wasn't that I didn't want to work\nI just didn't want to do certain kinds of work were you know I'm being a Detroit or we hold hard labor in high esteem there's no ability and working hard so I Want it to work hard but I wanted to work hard it's something that I thought mattered and I didn't think\nThat a ... a job on the line at Chrysler was going to amount to much\nBut the radicalization was ... that I was part of an entire generation that just could not\nStomach the hypocrisy and the corruption of\nMy core I always saw myself as a patriot you know democracy is participatory it's not just a word that we throw around it's actually something that we do\nAnd my understanding of the way our country function was if you didn't like the way the government was doing something that you could protest it\nAnd I protested with everything that I had and I was part of an entire generation that protested the war in Vietnam civil rights outdated fifty sexual morality marijuana laws and host of other uh you know the environment [laughter] there there was a lot to protest\nAgainst and [noise] and um [noise] I was one of those people that smoke out [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] right in the middle of that sixty eight Democratic National convention when things got ugly you were the only against them or the number of bands that were invited to play you were the only band that actually did play\nAt the convention a sort of a ... as a part of the ... the the student movement that was occurring in protest it what was going on at the convention downtown Chicago you set up and Lincoln Park um what were your memories of that day and sixty eight to because of the riots started to flow downhill\nPretty much as soon as you got dumped playing right [noise]\nYeah it wasn't like other outdoor live music events\nThat we all have been to\nWhere people are happy and smiling and there is a good vibe it was very heavy vibes the Chicago police were driving there a Harley Davidson price it goes\nThrough the crowd knocking them kids over there were undercover police are starting fist fights with kids or you're roughing people up\nSo the atmosphere was very tense and ... you know a number of uh the young people came prepared to fight and so once the ban once we finished our set and the crowd didn't have anything to focus on they focus their attention on the Chicago police and they were\nThey welcomed them with us swinging batons and had had busting and arrests and\nAnd it was the first time that a mom and pop America saw it happening on the nightly news you know they had never seen a policeman beat kids before like a beat reporters like\nThat and his is a shock the nation [noise]\n\nIt's Wayne that after the MC five such intensity blaze so bright for a short period of time you go into the recording is check it out and\nAnd it's a real super intense studio experience and you seem to have mixed feelings about that album still you know you were you is something that you guys we're we're striving for was just sort of out of reach [noise]\nWe had no experience working in a recording studio it takes time to learn how to be comfortable with the recording process we had only made a couple of singles before kickoff\nAnd so on a back in the usa the MC five second album that was really our our education and how to record and we were going through a lot of changes in the band trying to trying to ratchet up our approach in order to be better musicians to be a better\n[noise]\nI have mixed feelings but [noise] um I I Know each albums intimately I Know what their strengths and what their weaknesses were and in that records case I think we we did overreact to the criticism\nThat we were so undisciplined in so\nIrresponsible music irresponsible idiosyncratic\nThat that we that we really put a lot of emphasis on that the temples were solid and that the guitars we're into the ... singing melodies were on pitch and and that the lyrics were were very\n... in fact the lyrics are more overtly political on the second album than they were on the first album\nBut you know each of these albums as they're like my kids you know they got a special place in my heart and the great\n... records of what we were trying to accomplish\nAnd yet those who who were there who saw the five in their heyday or who've seen you since in your white excellent solo career you know will always say the records are great but\nIt's live ... what happens live I mean that's where I think if some day when I grow up I'm going to come to terms with jazz when I'm more mature but I as I understand\nAs I understand what you guys took from jazz and and what you as a as a as a musician and a person of taken from jazz is that spontaneity unique a thing that can happen only in the moment mhm\n[noise] yeah there's a there's a time\nIf musicians are tuned into each other and have a fundamental agreement about what they're trying to do where everything works beautifully Europe human beings doing a most human activity of performing and creating music spontaneously\nAnd it actually never gets any better than that there's you know and I've I've had my share of of great nights of music where you're you're up on the stand and and everybody is just\nThat couldn't get a leg up here was these guys who were made it or we're perceived to be making it giving a hand up to a a ... a baby band that was trying to find his way you know aids become obviously ... I mean you should be and I kind of ... were you guys saw something in that band that you liked obviously\nOh yeah I mean you couldn't deny it she had a complete vision and it was very clear about I mean there were no performers danced with the band and and the rhythm that a pop danced with are still dances where I mean he's one of the great ... men of all\nTime um uh so yeah of course if or when Danny field so does or any other bands around here like the MC five I said no there's no more bands like the MC five which we need to see the psychedelic\nShe [noise]\nAll you know we were all best friends and we all listened to the same coal train them sunrise and we're all smoked the same passion we always at the same bologna sandwiches and brown rice and\nYou think about the characters you know coming through there the navy and I guess I don't know if you knew Alice Cooper the time but he wouldn't name just a little bit later I guess\nA Seeger Bob Seeger measure writer all your characters I mean where was it a close knit community in terms of the people who are making this kind of music which wasn't precisely mainstream certainly at that time\nYeah yeah it was it we all knew each other I mean we had all been together with all known each other going back to the record hop days where we're all\nShow up at a at a church hall where one of the local DJ's would uh be spinning records and there'd be packed with teenagers dancing and and uh your band could get up and play a Fifteen or twenty minutes set in between ...\nA a a Motown artist that were coming by the lip sync their their latest release it was very exciting time I mean Detroit was driving it was a bustling industrial city with the you know good paying jobs and everything seemed possible in\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nOne of the um hottest thing\nHis name is Ted [noise] and I know you and Ted Nugent\nCame up in the same place under the same time All right um but my God you know he wants to go out and shoot Buffalo's and shoot anybody who wouldn't let him shoot a buffalo and and just just about I mean he's about ... about a hundred and eighty degrees opposite everything you stay in Fort Wayne\nYeah it's it's pretty it's pretty weird yeah [laughter]\nYou know he he never had any political interest in the sixties and he didn't really take it up until I'm thinking you know once a solo career kind of arc and they were he was looking for something new to\nTo ah to keep him in the discussion and I think he discovered that through his uh his hunting and outdoorsman [laughter] hobby that there was a an entree into the world of radical right wing extremists the viewpoint\nYou know I I we remain friends or I could call them up today and we could have a pleasant conversation\nUm but we have not we have yet to have a real substantive political and Iran I I'm open to it I Would like to I'd like to fish because I Know he does a lot of good in the world you know he works with kids he under writes programs for young people\nAnd I know he's a Family Guy and ... and I and I kinda worry about him you know he invited Tom Burrell and I\nTo one of his gigs and in LA and we went over to the house of blues where he was playing and were hanging out backstage\nAnd it's getting to be time for him to go on and he turns around and bends over to pick up his guitar and we see he strapped\n... you know he's got this this pillow in the back of his ...\nJust struck me like gosh what must a man's life be like that he has to go through it armed you know what world does he live and how much how much fear is got to be going on there [noise]\n\nLet me ask you a broader question I'm sure it seemed like even when people had political differences that most turbulent time of\nThe ... we could unite around certain things the music could bring people together do you think Wayne that still the case today I mean you play in a lot of different guys as you play in the indie rock punk rock underground and you play jazz and you play with prisoners behind bars and you you know um it does it still have that power do you believe in\nYeah sure does our our ... will always have the power to make a connection between people\nTo to bridge the gap between people if I Do something in music\nIf I tell the truth about how I feel about something chances are they're somebody else out there that show the same way that reminds me that I'm not the only nut case now out here you know somebody else's deals where because ultimately\nArt confirms our humanity and tells us we're not alone\n... and we're all in this together we are all in this together ...\n[laughter] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[laughter] [noise] I'm waiting\nIn line when the MC five fell apart and then you go down your path of of drug abuse crime wind up in prison [noise] it seems like there was a distance there between\nYou and and Fred sonic Smith and un Rob tighter you you you say like ... I mean you deal with each of their passing in a couple of sentences and say you know we hadn't been close when he passed but it hit me hard well\nBecause we never were able to reconnect after the breakup of the band nothing was ever resolved or we never got to know each other as grownups and it is just left as an open wound a scar a and\nThere's there you know there is no closure or resolution to to ah when people\nLeave before their time even if\nEven if it is a natural I mean what what is a natural death for me yeah right you know desire to die that's about as natural as it gets 'em but you know we never got it we never got a chance to to be friends and it kind of review what we went through together\nI I think we probably none of us\nReally survived having been in the MC five it was too much for a bunch of young guys to\nTo walk through the fire and ... and all the the ultra highs and devastating Lowe's and the\nPressure and say that friendships and the camaraderie and the undermining of all that and\nSee it one day all go away\nIt was it was rough so yeah I mean it was hard [laughter]\nMhm [noise] ...\n... really [noise] ... do\nTell us about a ... you have the second career now is well a scoring films and doing film where you've been in LA for a long time now based out on the west coast um what is what does that world like how did you get into it [noise]\nWell I knew I knew the day was coming when I Would not be quite so enthusiastic about getting in the van again\nYeah yeah there is a great paragraph towards the end of the book about everybody romanticized it but it's leaving how sleeping on the floor night after night if yeah it's\nIt's hard work and and uh you\nKnow I I thought I could do some music for film it always seemed like a possibility I I Would listen to the under score on television and and uh and ...\nIn movies and saw my could do some of that I could do something like that I Know a little bit about this\nBut when I finally moved to LA and started to pursue it seriously are just got a few jobs and then I discovered I Need to go back to school so I started taking a scoring classes at UCLA", "show_name": "Sound Opinions", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "08"}
