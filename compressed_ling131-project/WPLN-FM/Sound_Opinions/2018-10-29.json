Christmas special but people love scary songs and there are tons of them were going to get to a bunch more today\nYou get to go first or a gym I've got a perfect lead us down for us it's from the band the cure\nFrom the u._k. debut album from Nineteen Seventy nine three imaginary boys and it is a song that I think typically buys this whole notion of the theater of imagination you talk about this a lot of movies where\nA guy like Alfred Hitchcock was terrific building suspension building anticipation\nYou wouldn't show you what is happening but what might happen and planting the seeds of doubt in the viewer's mind about what is about to happen to these characters and I think this cure song subway song does that perfectly\nBasically only eight lines of verse a great I'm In a baseline in this song these little terse finger snaps about midway through and then a surprise ending I'm not going to give away completely but just be a notice that something terrible is going to happen\nTo this person that is depicted coming home late at night on a subway train we've all been there we've all heard the footsteps in the back of us\nThe only person in here or am I being stalked by somewhat so the anticipation is is really nicely played out in the song it is a horrific Halloween saw the cures subway song unsound opinions\n[noise]\nUm\n[noise]\n[noise] no\n[noise] no\n[noise]\n\nMidnight and ... and she's on her way home enough to remember who she's not alone\nSo footsteps follow behind Bush and\nI'm running around [noise] and I know wow [noise]\n[noise] um\n[noise]\nAnd um um [noise] um\n\n\nUm [noise]\n\n[noise] um [noise]\nMm [noise]\n\nWell I suppose your bottom I see what part of the song it will be played in the background and I'm just like I'll jump out of my chair when I hear it is scary but I tell you what scarier as Robert Smith whole the whole outfit the make up the whole thing yeah this is kind of like the pre make up Robert Smith but his head was definitely in a dark place when he wrote subway song that's the cure from Nineteen Seventy nine\nAll right Jim what have you got for a great Halloween song well Greg\nYour reserve scary rock songs is seemingly a boundless but you know we've done the show a bunch of times and I wanted to not be so obvious that I wanted to kind of take some left turns today so I turned to some of our listeners for some inspiration some I chose myself\nSome came in by email people were ... look on his all about the show they just were given a great suggestion\nKevin in ... park out here in Illinois he said one of my favorite songs spooky or not is ghost town by the specials from the ghoulish mountains to the high pitch whales\nFrom a scary image painted of empty streets and closed down clubs to singles cover art work of skeletons playing the piano he loves the creepy by above this all he does note in in a joking better than even scarier was that no doubt once covered it but we're going to the original version by the special\nWhen ghost town came out in Nineteen eighty one it was talking about\nShuttered streets unemployment urban unrest on the streets of London it was a heavy time and there were riots that erupted just as this song was coming out and making to the top of the charts\nAnd I think that's the scary thing about this song a city losing it so a city in an uproar here it is by the special ghost town on sound [noise]\n\n\nOh\n[noise] ...\n\nFive times [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGhost town by the specials on sound opinions one of our scary at this Halloween which got your next what he got chill a good\nOne gym one of the scariest aspect of this song is the fact that the singer Scott Walker once used to be in a group called the Walker brother seeing music was completely unlike when I'm about to play\nThe Walker brothers had a huge hit in the sixties called the sunny going to shine anymore you can you do but and find out what that is all about and played that song and then play this next one is about to lay on you in the Gulf that's the same guy Scott Walker using that slush baritone crew in her voice in a more sinister fashion\nAnd this is from his two thousand six I'm called the drift\nIn in this song he starts I was kind of this post nine eleven scenario and then it morphs into this meditation on Elvis Presley in the warm\n[noise]\n\n\nWell go back to have been in time bread caught with Jimmy regardless and this is our annual Halloween special we've been hearing from some of our listeners about some of their scariest songs of all time and gym and I are going back and forth from some of our selection and uh right now it's Jim stern\nGreg I'm going to throw another one to another dedicated listener who wrote in with a killer suggestion was so good maybe go instantly told how come I never thought of it before Shelby Peterson from Chicago said\nHard choice but I have to go with pirate Jenny by Nina Simone her voice has a haunting cast to it and when she gets out near the end that alert yet it sends shivers down my spine Shelby is absolutely right\nEunice waymen need it smells real name is singing a song by ... brick and Curt bio from three pending opera\nIf I look at it as just a tune that those guys wrote pirate Jenny is about a woman who is perhaps captured by one ship and then the pirates that she was part up are coming to rescue her the black ship on the horizon and they these people who've been mistreating are making her scrub the decks and who knows what else are going to get there\nThe weight Nina Simone plays it now she was a civil rights activists\nShe changes and very few words and does it skillfully\nIt's suddenly a southern hotel and that she is cleaning and she's being mistreated by the white patrons in a racist society and the black ship suddenly becomes something else is going to become justice when societies equalize you're going to get yours\nAnd you know the anger in her voice is amazing but it's so subtly underplayed that that's what's\nCreepy about it's a powerful tune\nA scary tune pirate Jenny by Nina Simone unfounded opinions [noise]\nYou can watch one on ... when I'm scrap and\nMaybe once you get to me and it makes you feel ... one town crummy old hotel\nKnow [noise] you ... you're talking about\nBeing on one\nScream in the night and you wonder\nBeen a no no and you see me can greening our labs grew up and\nOnce you got to green lush out terror yeah as it is [noise]\nWith the ...\nKid will be calm\n\nYou gentleman given free\nDon't even yeah you'd talk to me it seemed to send them out of the night shift but I'm happy\nFor tonight [noise] nobody's going to sleep you\nKnow but [noise]\nBut then\nOne of the best is green beans and you're saying who's\nKicking up around [noise] and you see me ...\nOut the window\nWhat I Do stand now\nHere it is as a sort of\n[noise]\nVote in a\n... but the shooting guns from a mile of\nPirate Jenny from Nina Simone from Jim do you regard as one of his great Halloween songs of all time I loved that choice Gemini ties in a really nicely with what I'm going to play next that sort of macro view of the world the sense of evil in the world looked like a fiasco address that on his song puts you on game from his two thousand seven out of the cool\nWas concept album about this title character and the choices he has to make in this world death fraught with evil I mean look at it was coming up a really hard time and it's like when he made this album his father and a good friend had just died his longtime manager just gone to prison so he's investigating this topic of\nYou know temptation evil sinister forces at work in the world\nBut the narrator in this song is a really creepy character the guy runs this place and we're talking about from the White House to the crack house and you have those those violins kind of escalating in the background the crack of gunshots you've got this ominous chant let me put you on game\nThe game as this hostile but you know the ... game the con game the gangster game\nAnd the song just keeps escalating intensity until the very end when ... almost revealed his identity or the identity of the narrator in this song\nHe doesn't really tell you who it is because it's on cuts off just in time but you can yes I mean this is sympathy for the devil this the Rolling Stones that ... you know everywhere there's some mayhem happening I'm the guy at the heart of it all to pay fiasco put you on game unsound opinion\n[noise] don't you know that I'm from this place and not become this must not be runs is the reason it's become this way and fans love spoke with is that we have become this free thank\nThem for my job of democracy in nursing has become one month I've been on one of them in the poll with the numbers dot\nIn the heart of Minneapolis [noise] someone trying to argue that gives me my whole point is what the mission that hard for this real real from footsteps I'm One that they found no I Am the one that I think mine is with\nMarket the whole will crack houses and the law [noise] due to me is that the news the pages and see just in the chamber [noise]\nThings senator or think putting your famous or the\nOne that don't most pension is things because every single\nI Am the maverick gyms rooms\nAnd dying and machine double the price committed the murder mystery ... and the one behind [noise]\nI have to let them get gas what they had an infection time it's a gym and it's meant to be the gunshot wound to come back in ... patch you [noise]\nI don't get invented in ... demand for the hedge things\nBack and I'm Glad you daddy is going to be helping them all comes back up these which among the mop the tie get much ...\nValue the trash can help get all that you were

property to make the British are filled with friendships are still my index does I think one\nVeterans didn't mislead there aren't that number one to prevent them from a drone up the bones are\nThese polls some our fuels why make them probably\nThem and know what I had a song based on how to get them from the table of the cold that you don't have you got the message you played my jam [laughter] I'll have to put that on the mound dissing my main concern is that\nAnother fine Halloween choice put you on game by loop a fiasco nice when Greg I ah him ever got nobody to blame except myself for this one and you make Scott initially at this choice but I'm going with Ken cc's\nI'm not in love watch creepy about it for one thing the production Kevin godly and allow cream the driving forces in this early seventies English rock band are now much better known as an award winning video production team back then\nThey were just as inventive in the recording studio this initially started out as a falling out of love song with the Boston Globe of beat nothing too extraordinary they decided to take out the drums and to build\nA wall of rhythm from voices the former members of the band each saying one note and then over dubbed at an ... an over dumped it until they were two hundred and fifty six voices singing the same note which gives this kind of robbing sensation it seems pretty at first but it gets creepy or as the song goes on\nMen they really dropped the bomb with this apparently they turned to the studios receptionist and had her give that spoken word intro in the middle big plush don't cry\nBecause it just creepy he said he's not in love I don't think he's going to be breathing much longer either it's kind of in the spirit of that song Timothy that you did a couple of years ago which was actually about cannibalism make little cops or about kind of was that what ten cc's are not in love is for me here it is on sound opinion [noise]\nMy radio\nOh ... ...\n...\n...\n... ... ...\n... [noise] [noise] [noise]\nBut\nA state trooper from Bruce Springsteen unsound opinions one of my scariest Halloween songs of all time I know usually scared by all of Bruce Springsteen laughed out but what are you got for your last Joyce Jim I'm going to go with Peter Gabriel Greg it it may seem like an obvious choice but there's good reason you know Gabriel\nI think is one of the best people in the history of rock to him body foreign characters and really bring them to you insult\nThe third one the one that really established him as a post geneticists solo artist\nIncludes the tune intruder\nIt's about a burglar I don't think he's just a burglar who enjoys breaking into people's houses\nThe recurring line is I like you know I like to feel the suspense when I'm certain you know and they're like you lying awake your bated breath charging near\nThis guy's doing it for cats and who knows how far he's going not just dealing silverware we think of Peter now as warm and fuzzy world beat champion this is back when he was playing darker characters on the ... also interesting this song was built around a little repetitive phrase that his friend\nAnd replacement in genesis Phil Collins played on the drums\nAnd the entire thing really relies on this time to be much of what Gabriel would do for the next Fifteen Years came from this chance discovery in the studio and much of what they'll tell us which is sort of came from\nThe fake it Tom tom sound with lots of ... I also love the way [noise] somebody's guitar just little tar comes in twice and mimics the sound window breaking\nThat well if I bought an unsettling to be intruder by Peter Gabriel unsound opinions [noise]\n[noise]\nAnd I remember [noise]\nThey\nListen to the\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nTo your parents to spend dues for them\nWay that the intruder by Peter Gabriel wrapping up our creepy ... picks for this year if you've got a creepy so to share give us a call at eight eighty eight five nine Eighteen hundred\nComing up we review that they view from classic rock torch bearers Greta Van fleet that intimate unsound opinions from WB easy Chicago NPR\n\nNa na na na\nNa\nNa\n\nBack not opinions on the gyms here got us my partner is reg caught and that it's a song called when the curtain falls is the first single Greg from the much anticipated debut album by Greta Van fleet anthem of the peace both army\nI think the best place to start with introducing was group they've been the runaway smash of many a summer festival here over the last couple of years\nWe're talking about three brothers Sam Josh and Jake ...\nAnd another guy come together as a late teens or in the town of Frank in ...
