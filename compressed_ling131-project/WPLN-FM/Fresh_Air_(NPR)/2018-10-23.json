press secretary Sean Spicer on Saturday Night live\nNow she takes a different direction in the new film can you ever forgive me which is based on the two thousand eight memoir of the same name by the Israel\nIsrael who died in twenty four teen had a moderately successful career writing biographies of people who had fallen out of the popular consciousness like actress to Lula bank cat and gossip columnist ... gallon\nBut after her biography of as stay laughter flopped she couldn't find a publisher for her next book about vaudeville star Fannie Bryce\nFinding herself broke unable to pay her

different role for you you play somebody who is very funny in a caustic sarcastic bitter way\nBut it wasn't called a movie a comedy and there there isn't any physical comedy ... in it and you're very no physical comedy so I Know you start in St Vincent and a dramatic role but do you consider this movie a new direction for you [noise]\nUm I think it's a it's a new direction for how I think most people are used to seeing me I I was in New York for many many years doing um dramatic place so\nI'm quite comfortable and I was kind of think if you you know put all the all the things I've done together I I may have even done more drama than than comedy in its totality but uh\nIf you realize I most people haven't seen a lot of that it was incredibly far off Broadway plays so you know the searching people at each performance joke [laughter] don't have much impact\nYou can put your support by calling six one five seven six zero twenty ten or you can give online adobe UPENN dot org\nThis was fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Melissa McCarthy she's starring in a new movie can you ever forgive me which is based on a memoir by Lee Israel\nWho when she started being unable to sell new book ideas decided to forge letters by literary greats and make money selling those four letters as if they were originals\nSo something else you've very famous for as your role and bridesmaids and the most famous or maybe I should say infamous scene [laughter]\nBlend the bride and the bridesmaids get food poisoning as they're trying to like really expensive fancy bridal dressing you haven't you know bridesmaids stresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms so you end up sitting on the bathroom sink in your expensive gallon that you're trying on and the whole scene is very intentionally gross\nAnd I'm Wondering how you felt about that scene because part of a of the scene part of the point of the movie is that you know women can do gross had comedy just as men can\nAnd it really wasn't the point of it oh okay\nThen ... none of us felt that way about it and that that scene was actually kind of in jak did into the film kind of late into the process and I think at first everyone bristled data and thought we don't want to do this grossing for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't\nLike for lack of a better way to determine ... more like a guy move and do you remember us talking about it and they said what are the only thing that appeals to me does seem funny and kind of [noise]\nThe the type of thing you watching go thank God it's not me I said if we just play the ... the horror and the embarrassment of it\nBecause it's weird things like this do happen and I said if it's less about gross for growth and more about oh my God I Can't make the euro swallow me up\nAnd if you play I think how maybe more women would do it in terms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like yeah look at this we were all desperately even though we were friends with in the movie saying like\nOh my God just look somewhere else like we couldn't escape it and then I and then I think we started to reconcile with the fact that like it could be funny for the sheer sake of being like what is the worst thing that could happen to you and\nAnd how do you kind of like just like a horror movie get through it\nIs interesting to hear you say that because the second half of my question [laughter] with him to be OK some women found that liberating that you know women can do grows out humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality of by doing gross out scenes so you're ... really interesting 'cause you're saying that's that's not really what was intended but it wasn't\nIntended it was really talked about because I'm I'm I'm not one for\nBathroom humor or stuff like that I think sometimes there's that horrible and wonderful feeling you get where you're so embarrassed for the character and I think that's showing the character kind of going through such a vulnerable humiliation that\nWe can all laugh at it because in some way we've all done it we've all fallen said the wrong thing had some shaming thing done and I think I think at least for myself that that was the connection to that's a real human experience even if\nThat particular action hasn't happened to most people\n[noise] Melissa McCarthy something else that you're famous for is I'm insults\n[laughter] insulting oh no [laughter] I'm not real life or maybe in real life I wouldn't know no I don't know why not [laughter]\nThe most famous example of that is and this is forty and there's there's a feud between your teenage kid and ... and Leslie man's teenage kid and this becomes a feud between the three parents and they're all called in to meet with the principal\nAnd that that the other couple the Leslie manpower ... couple have threatened you so\nYou're all just kind of going at each other in the office so yes let's hear that scene it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said that my son was an animal and then if I didn't keep him on a leash that he would hit him with his car\nDid you say that that's that's ridiculous who talks like\nThat you do say or even you know what I said was that we need to keep an extra ... kids because with all the technological advances or they need to learn to use them\nResponsibly no no what he what he said to me was he called me on what language Catherine language I mean I can relate to what they do not balls said to me unless I say it\nCan you please not talk like that Catherine music manager for her saying next door\nMusic man maybe if I look more like this fake Kabul was a big commercial that's what you look like like your bank commercial couple none of this talk\nIf productive I Would like your and my legs and kick you out in the jar with my ... bone just really scaring me this is what happens in your corner rat you corner me I Will chew through you know she was through you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits roll of the ...\nIt's just you kind of him and thriving insults in that scene in it and just got back on and on with more over the top insults is that's something that you're famous for outside like and the real world being able to to do really funny and solve\nNo I Know I Do not oh go round insulting people um I Hope ever [noise] um I don't know if it's a cathartic part of the work that you know you do something so kind of like yourself and maybe it's why I don't do it in life I get it all out on on screen but [noise]\nYeah well that's the first time I watched\nThat back I kept saying I didn't say that [laughter] never say that\nAnd the first time a sitting with ... sit for watching you say you set all of it and I I didn't remember saying most of it which made me feel slightly crazy and I was just trying to say ... anything that came up to the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything\nSo um you know maybe it was just that so much kind of free free word association that I didn't kind of law get into my memory\nHow'd you improv insults before\nYes I've had a\n... internally have played a lot of kind of very assertive um characters that you know I think in the heat\nOr especially part of part of the part of the characters DNA was just to literally say anything just to kind of kind of ... people down and I think kind of try to stand her in her own authority so it was a big part of that character\nAnd you're very impressive detective and that\nVery aggressive detective um there is a fun to it I mean I Would never want to do it in real life but it's part of the fun of getting to act you do\nThese things that you would never do your Boulder your harsher you know you're you're just ripping insults at someone and are there is if there is a fun to it because hopefully you know you you don't do it in your real life\nMy guest as Melissa McCarthy she stars in

I. A. dot or\nThis is fresh air let's get back to my interview with Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new movie can you ever forgive me when we left off we were talking about her early stand up comedy career so um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex is one of my favorite places to reform I just loved it also because\nThere which is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer and probably better than I did I didn't um [noise]\nWhen you went into a regular comedy club something that I really didn't like was there's this element there was always one\nOne guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go clubs club like are you actually the same guy\n[laughter] and it was always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like take your top off [laughter] and you're just like what like what does that ever worked for you is ending woman ever been like oh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my chop off [laughter]\nLike I just every time or something in that vein and especially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly shove now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it and they're going to keep doing it so in order to actually make them\nBe quiet you would have to kind of truly humiliate them not in a joking way because strangely just trying to indicate to them that like I don't want to do this I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane [noise]\nSo I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stopped talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to a heckler God\nI don't think it was my favorite I think the more work than where I hated it um\nIt usually would dissolve into some kind of thing about are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not how was your mom's basement you know I've always kind of go down that road like this so surprising like can I get a show of hands for women who\nWho isn't crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off and like and I would you vote for him and talking about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think she's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feel that like to his core\nAnd then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what first of all there's no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nThat they asked us if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there somebody there was a comedy club owner like happened is watching saying times oh my God so I Know there's\nThe light oh around ever present uh not to ever not be heated light that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the white man\nI Would have flash it at like ...\nYes and when that light flashes it is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know\nThe stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics ... you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like a whole my God it's a really big deal yeah\nAnd the other people's time here stealing it yeah you're taking it out of there are going to get less but the first time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something much my\nFlashed the light from the booze and I thought it was kind of a non verbal applause from the manager kind of ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up because I I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on the laugh\nTo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great [laughter] so I kept talking in the late kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me he is really encouraging me and then I\nI got up to finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes [noise]\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me up in a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I now that I truly didn't know\n[noise] so you're one of the women who has taken on like producing and and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure that you can act and material\nThat means something to you that you care about and give yourself good roles because yeah I think it's often hard for women to get good roles [noise]\nI think it is and I think you know I don't think a day goes by where I don't realize how lucky I Am and I never minded how much extra work I always thought I Want to be a part of making these three dimensional flawed\nYou know often challenging but to me really real women I just thought so many things I read were kind of\nI don't even know what in the in the breakdown you would describe them as pleasant\nI was like I don't know how to play pleasant like ... who who cares there's nothing to think your teeth into it's like the perfect clothes and they look really nice and they have a nice relationship and their houses I just thought oh my God like who who wants to watch that I don't I didn't want to play it also thought all the people I Love and like are\nFilled with quirks and eccentricities and isn't that why we always love or even just like people take we're we're a bundle of all these different weirdness is\nAnd so often I I've I felt that everything I read for female character was\nReally blend in and often a bummer just kind of everyone's having fun and then in would come to a woman to go like car all [laughter] I said I Am still I thought oh my God how many times can I just randomly walk into a room and say the guy's name I'm like\nWhy doesn't she ever walk in and go like what's going on this is fun [laughter] why she always a bummer I just I didn't know how to play it I felt like I don't have the skill set to play this because I don't know why she's doing it\n[noise] I'm Wondering if you feel that you've been affected by the me too movement\nWhich you know I mean like Harvey Weinstein fell several actors\nTheir careers or at least temporarily ended because they were ousted for assaulting Oregon Ratzinger mental behavior yeah try to women so like a as somebody who is both you know as an actor a writer a producer has the kind of\nChange and climate been meaningful\nFor you can you feel the difference do you feel that women are being more empowered in Hollywood now [noise]\nLittle inch I Will take every centimeter forward it will take I think the more we talk about it and the fact that it is becoming less acceptable\nWomen just can't be dismissed you can't treat half the population\nSo poorly and have it be like you know boys there has to be repercussions and it's happening in all fields which is what I think is so important about me too it's it's branching out to everyone and it's all women that need help that need money for representation it's saying that we're all in it together and\nI think the more we we linked up and and realize their strength and numbers\nIt can't be for the worse\nWhen Melissa McCarthy I Want to thank you so much for coming on our show I've greatly enjoyed it I Love you

the outcome will determine who controls the house and the Senate in this very divisive era as well as who governs key battleground states the results could be determined by who has the right to vote\nSince the twenty ten election over twenty states have adopted new restrictions on voting such a strict voter ID laws cutbacks to early voting and aggressive purging voters\nSince twenty fourteen hundreds of thousands of people were purged from the rolls in states that have a so called use it or lose it policy which removes people from the rolls if they haven't voted frequently enough in Georgia alone that policy purged\nTo a new investigation by American Public Media's investigative unit\nAnd twenty Thirteen the Supreme Court struck down the heart of the voting rights act\nBut current ballot initiatives in several states could make it easier in the future to register to vote in those states and to crack down on gerrymandering and I guess Ari Berman has been covering developments in voting rights and voting restrictions he's the author of the book give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America\nHe's a senior writer for Mother Jones are reporting fellow at the nation Institute and there's also written about voting issues with the New York times magazine and Rolling Stone\nAri Berman welcome back to fresh air before we talk state by state and get into specifics is it a coincidence that there are voters being perjure asked for IDs ideas that many citizens don't have in several states\nIt's not a coincidence and let me just give you the big picture of what's happening with voting rights right now\nSo since the twenty ten election\nTwenty four states have implemented in New restrictions on voting so nearly half the states in the country have tightened their voting laws\nTo do things like require strict forms of photo ID to cast a ballot or make it more difficult to register to vote\nOr to cut back on early voting periods or to close polling places or to purge the voter rolls and many of these restrictions on voting are playing out now in the ... elections in critical states like Georgia North Dakota Kansas et cetera\nWhere there are very close elections\nSo is it a coincidence that all of this is happening [noise]\nIt's not a coincidence this has really been a major strategy within the Republican Party after the two thousand eight election when Republicans gained control of a number of really important states in twenty ten\nThey began to introduce a wave of new restrictions to tighten access to the ballot than those efforts were basically given a green light by the Supreme Court when it removed a critical part of the voting rights act in twenty Thirteen and the Shelby County versus hold her decision\nAnd oak hill school welcoming New York times best selling author Julie lives contains author of how to raise an adult coming from speaker series Tuesday November six and the always dress enrichment center learn more at oak hill school daughter word\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Ari Berman we're talking about voter rights and voter suppression he is the author of the book give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a senior reporter for Mother Jones\nSo we've talked about the current election in Georgia where Brian Kemp the secretary of state is also running for office\nSo let's take a look at Kansas where the secretary of state is also running for office in this instance it's Kris Kobach who's running for governor what are some of the ways in which he's restricted voting rights in Kansas\nAnd not just any secretary of State Kerry I Would say that Kris Kobach is the most high profile secretary of state in the country and he has really been a leader\nIn the Republican Party when it comes to restricting voting rights this is the guy who was named vice chair of Donald Trump's election integrity commission which was formed in a very high profile way and then shut down before it actually did anything but it requested voter data\nFrom all fifty states which set off a huge fire storm last year Kobach was the guy who told Donald Trump that three million people voted illegally in the twenty sixteen election no legitimate evidence has been put forward by Trump or Kobach to support this than the less Kobach is really the guy who was formed intellectual case for restricting voting and what he's done\nIn Kansas is a few things he\nWrote a law that was passed by the Kansas Legislature called the safe act\nThat did a few concrete things when it came to restricting voting the first thing it did is that it required proof of citizenship to register to vote meaning that you had to have a a passport or birth certificate or naturalization papers to register to vote\nThis law blocked one in seven cans oh almost thirty five thousand people from registering to vote in that state's the federal court actually struck that law down earlier this year and said that there was\nAlmost no evidence of voter fraud in Kansas to justify the potential disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters so so that part of the law has been struck down but another part of the law of voter id law where you have to show government issued id to be able to vote\nThat part of the law remains in effect that I've looked at the numbers in Kansas and over twelve hundred ballots have been tossed in Kobach was secretary of state of Kansas because voters showed up at the polls without having the right id\nBut Kobach only won his primary his Republican primary by three hundred and fifty one votes and now he's locked in a very close election with Democrat Laura Kelly who's a member of the state Senate and independent candidate Greg Orman\nAnd even the smallest reduction in turn out to shift the race and co box favor and the government Accountability Office did a study of Kansas voter id law and they found that Kansas voter id law in twenty twelve and it was first in effect\nIn that state with the largest drop off among black voters young voters and first time voters and these are all people that are going to be less likely to support Kobach than the traditional Republican base\nYou say that Kris Kobach was actually the source of President Trump's false claim that millions of people voted in legally in twenty sixteen and if you compensate for all of those illegal votes Trump would have won the popular vote and not Hillary so what is called that do to plant that idea\nKris Kobach met with Donald Trump after the election basically Kobach was a disappointing for a cabinet position he was under consideration to be head of the department of homeland security\nAnd ... had to study not a very legitimate study but nonetheless it was a study that he gave Donald Trump that purported to show that three million people had voted illegally in the twenties sixteen election and shortly after this meeting with Kobach Trump tweeted\nThat millions of people voted illegally and when I interviewed Kobach for the New York times magazine last year he told me\nThat he was the source of Trump's claim and showed me this study that purport to show this however when the author of that study who was a professor at Old Dominion university testified in a federal lawsuit challenging Kansas proof of citizenship law\nKoh Buck's own expert disavowed that study and basically said it didn't show anywhere near that three million people voted illegally\nKris Kobach has also been an advocate for a new question to be added to the census and the census might not seem like it's actually a voting issue but it is voting issue Kodak advocated for adding a question about citizenship are you a citizen [noise] um how does that\nApply to voting rights\nIt's a huge issue because census data is used to draw voting districts it used to draw districts for state legislatures its use to draw districts for the U.S house it's used to determine\nHow many electoral votes each state has so the census was instrumental when it comes to voting and what happened according to court documents is that Steve Bannon at the time of the chief strategist to Donald Trump\nCalled commerce secretary Wilbur Ross who's in charge of running the census and says I Want you to talk to Kris Kobach about adding this question about us citizenship to the census and what Kris Kobach told Ross is he suggested wording for the citizenship question and then he said\nIt's needed because right now in his words illegals or being counted\nWhen it comes to representation I I don't want to get to tactical hear Teri but the the way that districts are drawn as they're based on total population so everyone in a given area is counted when it comes to drawn a district in deciding what level representation an area should have\nWhat Kobach wants to do is restrict those\nDistricts to only counting people who are citizens\nIf you did that areas with lots of non citizens places like Texas and New York and California would have much less representation\nThan places where there's a lot more citizens if Kobach has his way\nDistricts are going to be drawn only based on citizenship what that will mean is that will be a major power shift to Republicans because generally speaking airs lots of immigrants tend to vote democratic if you exclude them from counting then despite the massive demographic change we're seeing\nIs that the districts are going to become more conservative and this question about us citizenship hasn't been asked on the census since Nineteen fifty and there's a tremendous fear that if it is asked Latinos\nWhether it documented or undocumented are going to be afraid to respond to the census the areas where these people live will get fewer political seeds less money less political representation than they otherwise what an affair and after it senses\nSo where does that stand now this question\nRight now there are six different federal lawsuits challenging this question the most high profile lawsuits is being led by New York and sixty in other states and basically what they're saying is that this question is going to have a major league suppressive effect\nOn people responding to the question that you're going to see how many people are afraid to give their citizenship on the census because they're worried about Donald Trump's immigration policies and they don't want to tell Donald Trump\nWhat their legal status is and that's going to affect the entire senses and so if the centrist is unfair to says this is an accurate than so many things to the census does is going to be unfair and inaccurate as well\nMy guess is Ari Berman author of give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and senior reporter at Mother Jones\nAfter a break we'll talk more about voting restrictions and ballot measures that may expand voting rights and we'll look at the Supreme Court with Brett Kavanaugh on the bench and how it would likely respond to cases pertaining to voter suppression and voting rights\nI'm Terry Gross and this is fresh

every dollar pledged today is matched\nThat would restore voting rights to ex felons so Florida is one of only four states that prevents ex felons from voting meaning even after you've served your time you've paid your debt to society\nAnd you have to wait five to seven years in Florida\nTo appeal to have your voting rights restored it by the governor and his executive clemency board and this current governor Rick Scott in Florida has restored voting rights to almost nobody you have a situation in Florida\nWhere one point six million ex felons canceled that's a staggering number what that means is that\nOne in ten people in Florida\nIncluding one in five African Americans in the state can't vote because they have a felony conviction so ten percent of people\nIn the most important swing state in the country that has routinely decided presidential elections aren't able to participate in aren't able to vote in twenty Eighteen and this ballot initiative would restore voting rights to up to one point four million people in Florida\nThat would be the largest in franchise meant of new voters since the passage of the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five so despite all the suppression we're seeing in Georgia North Dakota and Kansas in other states\nFlorida has a chance to give the right to vote\nBack to more people than at any time since the Nineteen sixties and and that's the good news that help doesn't get drowned out by all the bad news\nSo Rick Scott the governor of Florida who you described as the chief enforcer of the felon disenfranchisement law he's running for Senate against three term incumbent amounts and\nHe is and so here you have a situation where the architect of a policy that has disenfranchised one point six million ex felons in Florida is running for office\nAnd the people disenfranchised by Rick Scott aren't able to vote against him and previous governors and Florida have restored voting rights to many more people than Scott has Jeb Bush the governor of Florida restores voting rights to Seventy seven thousand ex felons\nCharlie Crist Jeb Bush's successor restored voting rights to a hundred and fifty five thousand ex felons in Florida Rick Scott has only\nRestored voting rights to three thousand people in Florida during his eight years as governor so he is emitted this felon disenfranchisement law in the most restrictive way possible and it's not just his race Florida could also elect\nThe first black governor in their states history Andrew Gillum but you have a situation where five hundred thousand half a million disenfranchised African Americans\nAren't able to vote potentially to elect the state's first black governor\nSo in the past there have certainly been a lot of voting related court decisions\nCourt the Supreme Court now has added Brett Kavanaugh to the bench what's his position on voting rights [noise] he\nHas from the cases we've seen a pretty alarming record on voting rights\nHeat up out of voter id law from South Carolina and twenty twelve that the Obama administration had opposed and said could disenfranchise tens of thousands of minority voters in that state but cabin I wrote the majority opinion upholding this law and he basically said that even if there was no evidence of voter fraud\nThat states could enact new restrictions on voting and that sets a very broad precedent\nFor Republican controlled states like Georgia like North Dakota like Kansas to enact new restrictions on voting and even if there is no evidence\nOf the kind of fraud that they are purporting to crack down on\nThey can uphold these measures as legal ... even if they just say that they are intended to and cabinet as words uh promote the integrity of the election and so he is going to be joining\nA very conservative court already this was the same Supreme Court remember and Terry and twenty Thirteen that got at the heart of the voting rights act\nAnd he is going to be less open to potentially striking down these restrictions than his predecessor Anthony Kennedy who was already pretty conservative on these issues was and so now we're facing\nThe most conservative court on civil rights issues since the Jim Crow era and there is a tremendous amount of fear that Brett Kavanaugh is going to give a green light to the kind of voter suppression efforts that we're seeing playing out in the twenty Eighteen election right now\nLike chief justice John Roberts is now considered to be the swing vote in the court with his record on voting rights\n[noise] it's amazing to me that Roberts is now considered the swing vote on the court when he has really been the most aggressive advocate on the court\nFor limiting voting rights and this goes back many years when John Roberts was a young lawyer in the Reagan Justice Department all the way back in the Nineteen eighties he led efforts\nTo weaken the voting rights act that was a key part of his portfolio and then when he joined the Supreme Court he authored the twenty Thirteen decision that got the heart of the voting rights act\nAnd ruled that those states the longest histories of discrimination no longer needed to approve their voting changes with the federal government Roberts mocks the idea that voting discrimination was still widespread pervasive and his words and in fact\nEverything that we're seeing right now which seemed to contradict that the fact that there are so many new barriers to voting both in states that were covered\nBy the voting rights act places like Texas and Georgia orange taste that weren't covered by this one provision of the voting rights act like Kansas the fact that there is such widespread\nVoting discrimination that we're seeing right now which seem to argue not just for keeping the voting rights act intact\nBut if anything strengthening it to have more protections against voting discrimination but instead the Supreme Court did the opposite and voting rights advocates are extremely worried that all of these new restrictions on voting when they go before the Supreme Court are basically going to be upheld\nThe argument for voting restrictions is fraud that you have to do this to prevent fraud if you look nationally and voting fry how pervasive hasn't been\nEvery study shows that voter fraud is a very small problem in American elections not non existent but incredibly rare that from two thousand to twenty fourteen according to one study there were only thirty one\nOut of one billion votes cast\nSo even in states where there are no voter ID laws like New York where I live it's a very difficult to commit fraud in New York but we do is we sign our names at the polling station and they have to check\nThat the signature on file matches they signature that were signing when we go to vote well if I wanted to commit voter fraud in New York in the state without a voter id law I Would have to find a voter I Would have to know what their addresses I'd have to know what their signature looks like I Would have to know that they hadn't voted already\nAnd I would be facing potentially five years in jail a felony conviction a tremendous fine and I would only be shifting one extra vote after all of that\nSo it doesn't mean that voter fraud never occurs but the penalties for voter fraud are already very high the mechanisms that we have in place already deter people from doing it\nIf you try to commit fraud you're most likely to get caught and then you're are only shifting\nA very small number of votes one vote usually most and so what I see based on the data is that the number of people prevented from voting by restrictions on voting is exponentially larger than the cases of voter fraud or say\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is journalist Ari Berman he's the author of the book give us the ballot modern struggle for voting rights in America\nIs also a senior reporter for Mother Jones who's
