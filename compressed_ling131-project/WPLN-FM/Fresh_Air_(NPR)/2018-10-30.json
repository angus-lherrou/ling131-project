I was a Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter who is the author of a book about that movement titled rising out of hatred\nAnd focus is on the story of Derek Black\nDerek father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and\nCreated the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm front\nDerek was seen as an heir apparent in the movement but here we noticed his racist and anti Semitic views when he was in his early twenties\nIn a few minutes we'll hear an excerpt of the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black and ... but first we're going to hear the interview I recorded with ... this morning\n... welcome back to a fresh air I'm Sorry it's such a sad occasion that's bringing back to our program when I heard about the massacre at the synagogue I thought about your book\nGarrett black has renounced his white nationalist views but his father Don black is still a white nationalist and still has the website storm front he did not pull the trigger at the synagogue and I'm not trying to blame him for that but do you find done black story relevant to the views that were expressed\nBy the shooter Roberts hours\nI think you can draw a straight line from dawn views and ... work in this movement to the views expressed by the shooter um you know not straight line honestly starts with just the ink on the shooters body yet attached to a fourteen eighty eight to white national slogans\nFourteen refers to a a fourteen word for statement a purpose that is central to what started frog does about securing a future for the white race and the existence of white children you know and and saying things like I'm here because of a white genocide and I can't stand by and watch people get\nGet murdered 'em as the shooter in this case did when he was at the synagogue that's exactly the language and the motivation that exist on start front and that's\nThe way that they speak about this a quote unquote race for that they believe is under what\nYeah I'm a ... ... hours ahead had said that um he believed the Jews were committing genocide against his people genocide is what happened to the Jews in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust do white nationalist believe the Jews are committing genocide\nIt allows for people who already have some of these ideas to sort of cultivate their own reality and\nThat was when he went on gab he saw the messages of only the people that he followed which is essentially\nOne long news feed of confirmation bias and that those are the messages that he was getting he was reading again and again about the care caravan about the invaders about the threat to America and so then suddenly saying something like I Can't sit by anymore and wash my people get slaughtered and that's because\nThat's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front to the shooting at synagogue\nI'm In store front is to say that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the founders son so so what are you reading on storm front now\nAre some really file I'm sort of celebration of what happened uh there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero I'm a racial warrior uh and and hold him up in those ways I Would say\nThat the largest reaction on storm front um\nIs is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh you know several mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on storefronts over over the last decade and and the reaction is mostly that well this probably isn't quite the way to go about it that he went a little too far and we don't we don't really\nPeople at but the people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself\nBut our our ... and choose who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to bring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect that every now and that somebody's going to get frustrated at act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so have you spoken with either done or Derrick black since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nYeah I've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular um and I think that he's\nHeartbroken at and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens he feels in small ways Gulf War and he wanders at you know how much three messaging that he did in terms of white nationalism\nPlays into incidents like this I'm Derek was central to creating a phrase white genocide and said to popularize the movement to then somebody going to a synagogue and murder eleven people and leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself\nSpread again and again on the radio for years and your wife is a I think it's it's ...\n... is the author of the book rising out of hatred about Derek Black a former white nationalist whose father Don black founded the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm from\nWhen the book was published in September I spoke with Derrick black and ... will hear that interview after a short break this is fresh air\n... ... ... Mm Mm\nMm Mm\n\nThis is fresh air to social media posts and statements made by Robert Bowers who shot and killed eleven congregants and a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement\nWe're going to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Garrett black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before we announce in those views when he was twenty two he helped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers\nGehrig's father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm from\nGarret black is the subject of the book rising out of hatred my Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter ... who we heard from earlier in the show my interview with black also included sass no the first question was addressed to Derrick black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning white people are better than\nWhite national not nationalism kind of turned it down to like it's not that we're better than but we're all better off being separated by my race\nIs like my dad popular I ever turn white nationalism instead I was just saying\nYeah he didn't invent it but he was far it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when you found that storm front called it a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy is being\nOne that you didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and that that was not about superiority it was just about the wellbeing\nIt was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's it's totally irrational I how exactly think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nCandidate for a second I've always wanted to know the early people who rebranded white supremacy to white nationalism whether they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable\nOr whether they really believed that there was a difference between white supremacy and white nationalism\nThey really did believe they were not\nDoing bad things to other people that the uh accusations of violence and a hatred and racism or just insult put towards them and that they really did just want what's best for white people and then by extension other people and it may be unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything's going to be much better\nUm the the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America was founded as a white supremacist country and that that was not and gone to the civil rights movement had changed the language and it made it much more difficult to speak about race and their job was just to\nGive people a space to say racist ideas in a more explicit proud a confidante way\nInception was everybody is basically all white people are basically racist they're just afraid to express it so let's give them a language in a safe space\nSo they don't like the word racist I think that's a made up insult toward the ...\nThe word um\nRatio is racial out all\nThe years if you look at the language in terms of how\nMany people in this movement have identified themselves it went from the KKK to white supremacist to white power\nTo white pride to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think that the thing that's complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy\nIs that white nationalism I think effectively identifies a movement of people who are actively\nPursuing in and cause of separating a\nYou know races into into different homeland and white supremacy unfortunately is something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is\nSo if we're talking about these people as white supremacists or it it doesn't quite distinguished movement in the same way because much of much of the country was founded on things that are white supremacist and many of our structures\nAre based on white supremacy so that's the distinction distinction sometimes in the language that I think is still effective and useful for us as we talk about it\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black a former young leader of the white nationalist movement who has since renounced those views and Washington Post reporter Eliza ... who wrote a book about black called rising out of hatred we'll hear more after a break and Terry Gross and this is fresh air\nUm\nYou've our family foundation supports WHYY is

act of terror and a caravan the mass exodus organized by activists in Honduras if the lead to be the largest migrant caravan on record\nAnd who the victims and who they are exactly in the end of this was a long process but um immigration was just going to out number white people in all their countries and that that was a threat to all the normal people who are listening to the radio show or posting and the comments section\nAnd the white unlike what they were being told they were the aggressors that they were the people were making society worse\nGetting back to being attacked it's not like all the immigrants are going to take our jobs are they going to speak a foreign language we're not going to understand at an American culture you know won't be quote unquote pure you're talking about like genocide like they are going to kill all of us we will no longer exists\nI'm Talking about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme let it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kittens in the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against that every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI I think it's important to note also that the entire ideology the endpoint of the ideology is built on a fallacy\nTime with white nationalist I Would press them on what you mean you want to separate people have different races and different places like what percent ... percent white is okay what percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea at\nSo which I think it's the core issue that and your racism nebulous thing that that that is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time defining there\nWas a really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never republic uh and huge debates would come on on storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this Fisher how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to\nAre we going to do this or that and one of those was how do we wanted to find who's white because only a white person could be a member of storm front\nBut there's no biological definition of white and so that was very clear there's no way to say the what's the twenty three and me by definition even if that had been around at the time\nAnd there's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white N's and were something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so the conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come to as to who is white\nWas that you had a generally be considered visually wide by most people in America\nAnd you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands opposed to define what is a white person even mean\nWe're listening to the interview I recruited in September with Garrett black a former white nationalist leader and Washington Post ... the author of a book

Don black as a former KKK grand wizard and founded the white nationalist website storm front\nWe're also hearing from Washington Post reporter ... the author of a book about Derek Black called rising out of hatred\nSo they're one of the things you ... you had been home schooled so you were pretty isolated from any beliefs outside of your family is racist views\nUm but then you went to college and from the way you described it in the book it was a pretty liberal college in Florida they were Jewish people they're usually try to hide your identity and then you could you might as well [noise] let people know\nSomebody else you placed a magazine [laughter] you must have obligations with an article by you and the gym so that people would find it and realize oh God that's Derek Black\nSo after you kind of out of yourself and after having befriended people who would you know Jewish and gay and who were very upset when they found any really are um you had Jewish friends who reached out to you\nEven had a girlfriend who dated didn't initially no was Jewish um what what are some of the things that Jewish friends said to you\nThat made sense to you that you hadn't been exposed to before and you thought maybe there's some legitimacy here\nBut I think it's very interesting that I'm Matthew Stephenson and Moshe Asher with the people who invited me to Matthew about dinners took the strategy that I think was very very smart\nOf ... are not talking to me about it uh I went to those dinners for two years and the white nationalism never came up well every this other thing that we were possibly interested in did\nA and I think the Matthew said that the reason for that or was that\nIt would have been a not as effective at allowing me to see him and dinners as people that when my family is talking about something anti Semitic that we're not talking about something after we're talking about him or talk about his life and this is very human\nAnd he wanted to demonstrate that and even if nothing else came from it it would just be that it was it was a person who we were thinking about when we were thinking about Jewish people\nAnd is it effective like actually actually meeting Jewish people and having Jewish friends did you see you know Jewish people in general as being human in a way that you hadn't before\nYeah I think that was actually one of the things that changed about my beliefs earliest um was that\nThe Jewish conspiracy part of white nationalism was a little bit loose and nuts and unnecessary\nUh that didn't undermined the firm believer in racial differences and there are actually white nationalist groups that are already believe that that oh of course Jewish people or white or so it didn't undermine all of white nationalism but it I think it was actually pretty early were either this is this is crazy when you to stop attacking Jewish people back off\nIn addition to being the story of Derek transformation I mean I think the book is also the story of the real courage shown by a lot of students on this campus who invested themselves in trying to affect\nYou know profound change and they did that in a lot of different ways I mean there was a civil resistance on campus by a group of students who organized the schools shut down and shut down the school and sort of cast dark out and made it clear to him\nHow how awful and how aid for and how hurtful this ideology was and it was also students like Allison eventually his girlfriend who ah who won one is trust built a relationship but also armored herself with the facts and sort of like point by point went through in and\nAh and showed how this ideology is is built on total misinformation and and then there were also students like Matthew and most Shea\nWho in a remarkable act invited Derek over a week after week after week not to build a case against him but to build their relationship hoping that\nJust by spending more and more time with them he would be able to begin seeing pass the stereotypes to the people into the humanity and and hoping that a relationship in of itself can be transformative\nAnd I think it's important to note that that did not happen quickly and ended they knew the full horror of a lot of the beliefs of this ideology and the things that Derrick had said Matthew in ... in between these dinners which sometimes\nSite and they would see the horrible things that you said about Jews and and ... yeah\nUh Jews warm their way into control over our society Jews must go all Jews Moscow and you're in the white nationalist ideology in like the awful pyramid and beliefs\nJews are at the top as enemy number one and because I think white nationalist believe the Jews have propagated a scheme of multiculturalism and are\nAre sort of the number one enemy of what white nationalist with defined as the white race and so ... had also in their own lives experienced large degrees of anti Semitism in ... case he's a from a family of Hungarian Jews

money ball and the wolf of Wall Street\nI Want to ask you again about all The Simpsons scripts that you wrote when you're a kid did you ever try submitting one of them\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting them\nWould you be willing to share a story line or a joke from one of your early scratch\nHere's where I'll say I think the strongest episode was I was in a file since a young age and my parents were incredibly ah let's just say how would I put it they encouraged me or let me watch movies beyond my age because they saw how interested I was in film\nSo perhaps ignore the content matter of certain so [laughter] but I maybe should have waited to see\nYoung age because my dad's favorite movie and I wrote a Simpsons godfather spoof\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten now I think is a I I was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the analogy between the characters from the godfather and the characters in The Simpsons were clever for a nine year old [laughter] who\nIs who Marge was Don Corleone [laughter] because of nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer so she would be the chess player sort of quiet low key chess player that would become the Don no excuse me she's Michael\nOK okay barges Michael a grandpa Simpson is is Don he dies right away though so Marge is Michael weight as Homer fan\nNo Homer see that would be that would make margin Homer siblings so even in my nine year old mind I knew that was not going to work so Homer is a K [laughter]\nLike I tell us Diane Keaton like [laughter] where are you gonna go legit you know [laughter] but ah Lenny and Carl homers friends from work or when he was afraid to do and Carl was sunny\nAnd I don't know I mean it's not actually clever but for a nine year old I was like wow it's interesting that you have the M fishing or the or or even I guess the wherewithal to know who would be the character equivalent of who\nTend to think of that story and character in that way and to make connections between things I I think that's pretty great what are some of the movies that were beyond your age as a kid that your parents let you watch because you love movies so much\nI'll tell you a story that I I find interesting because\nI mean I saw everything I devoured film like I continue to I Love it so I'd ran through so many films and I would go to the newsstand and you know your parents take you to the magazine stand when you're a kid and you flip through magazines or if there's a magazine she on the corner and they're out another place or something\nI Would look through the film magazines I was just so interested so I Would ask them often can I see this film can I see this I mean most of the time they say yeah so basically it came down to two films that I wasn't allowed to see [noise]\nUm they said we're so ... you don't even realize how lucky you are you cannot see kids and you cannot see a clockwork\nOrange well kids is all about kids similar to the kids in your movie\nAnd it's a seminal movie in my life kid is a huge influence on me as a filmmaker but this film is in the opposite of kids where kids is so beautiful and it's ... and it's the world ending tomorrow burn the world down\nAnd this film mid nineties is all about connection and hope even if it's dysfunctional connection and hope and\nThose are the two movies I wasn't allowed to see so of course I made it my mission to see both of them right away I think I was eleven or twelve how did you do it\nUm a friend of mine who ... who is older had both cassettes at his house\nAnd I saw kids and I was like I Love skateboarding I Love New York this is about kids skateboarding in New York I completely was too young to understand the AIDS subplot or main plot I guess\nAnd so I completely wasn't affected by that so I was just like this is the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life it wasn't till I was older that I understood\nThe HIV aids plot Marta ... because they went over my head so I just took wow this is subversive and this is dangerous you know [noise]\nAnd then I saw a clockwork orange and I had to go to my parents like a shell of a child\nI saw it disturbs me and I need to talk show [laughter] I was like you know like a ... he was tell them that I disobeyed them but I was too shook up not to speak to him about what I had seen what's your view of the most about the film\nI think the\nRaping ultra violence was just too of course it was too heavy show so hard to watch as an adult let alone a kid what are your parents say to reassure you [noise]\nWell first of all they were like you should listen to us because we're telling you there for a reason yeah and then of course didn't for many many years and realize they were trying their best\nI think ultimately it did make me braver as an artist in life because I Do think about that and I think ultimately there's something about me that draws me two\nThings that are difficult and maybe I'm uncomfortable with comfort and I think my acting career says that when I really dissect it is well\nMy guess is Jonah Hill he wrote and directed the new film mid nineties about a group of skate boarders in their mid Nineteen nineties we'll talk more after a break\nAnd marine card in will review a new book about Emmett

bunch of years five six seven years you've done a play more dramatic roles\nYou know in films like Wall Street and money ball [noise] how did you get the word out to some directors that you are interested in making that transition to more dramatically [noise]\nIt's just by choices you know um I had seen the puffy chair which I loved and I reached out to the ... brothers after super bad came out and I was like I Would love to work with you\nAnd they gave me this part and Cyrus which is a film that I Love is that um was a great experience with John ...\nAnd then and Catherine Keener and then Bennett Miller was making money ball and Catherine had talked about me to ban it and then then it's off Cyrus and in Kashmir Moneyball\nAnd then in the inter I'm a\nI continue to do some comedy films that were funny and fun\nAnd then uh\nI had heard about the wolf of Wall Street and I asked you audition\nAnd um\nI knew that was going to fight to get that part but I I knew I wanted that part really badly and then when I wanted to write and direct I think I had a lot of opportunities to do that if I wanted to make a mainstream comedy\nUh\nAnd when I really thought about it I was like wow things in my life are happening that are intense\nAnd am I going to be happy\nJust doing what is expected of me or what my heart really want so I have to figure out who I Am I have to figure out how to love who I Am\nAnd I have to figure out what my voice is as a filmmaker and when I looked to my heroes like Mike Nichols or Barry lemon center people got started on comedy and ended up having great filmmaking careers\nI looked at their first films and a lot of times they came from a really personal place and they weren't just funny they were they felt like life and they felt like all the pain and joy of life [noise] why don't we\nHear a scene from a Wolf of Wall Street\nHe and written by parents winter who was also the show runner for the HBO series Boardwalk Empire\nAnd so this this is a movie that I'm a based on the story of Jordan Bell Ford who was a corrupt stockbroker who made his fortune in penny stocks schemes\nAnd eventually went to jail for for fraud and in this scene Jordan
