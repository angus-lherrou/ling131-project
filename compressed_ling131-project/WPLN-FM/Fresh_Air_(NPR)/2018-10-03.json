under President Trump is the subject of the new book the fifth risk by my guest journalist Michael Lewis who's also the author of the best sellers Moneyball and the big short which were adapted into films and the undoing project\nLewis lifted Trump's government by focusing on three departments energy commerce and agriculture\nIf you're thinking that this is about boring bureaucracy consider that as Lewis points out the government manages a portfolio of risks that no private person or corporation was ever able to manage ranging from forecasting and warning about hurricanes the national weather service as part of the Commerce Department\nTo preventing the accidental explosions have our own nuclear weapons one of the energy department's many responsibilities\nMany essential positions and the Trump Administration remain unfilled and some of the key positions Lewis says uh filled by people who are uninformed about what areas they're supposed to be overseeing while others have conflicts of interest or political views that make them antagonistic toward the department or agency they're leading\nLewis started writing about this in articles published in Vanity Fair Michael Lewis welcome back to ... explain what the fifth risk is\nShort answer is the risk that you fail to imagine it's is while you're worried about what you're worried about is the thing is actually going to come and kill you and the longer answer is when I'm working on this book about the federal government under Trump\nBy come to see the federal government as really a portfolio of risks that are being managed\nAnd as a wandering around the federal government tried to figure out what these risks are over and over again I what am I asking people in the Energy Department or the agriculture per even the White House to name kind of the top ... risks on the tip of their minds\nAre they all come up with three or four and then they can't think of this so I thought that's the moment where the mind failed to imagine what it needs to imagine\nSince your book is about the federal government under Trump focusing on the energy agriculture and commerce departments why did you name it ... now that you've explained with a fifth risk means\nIt was a response to what I found about how the Trump Administration has gone about taking over the federal government we're kind of light to foreign to me is what I discovered that the Obama administration and spent the better part of a year and\nThousands of people's lives preparing especially the best course it at every been created in in how to run the federal government or what was going on inside the federal government\nAnd that this course was meant to be delivered to whoever won the election the day after the election starting the day after the election\nAnd they were expecting hundreds of people to roll in to do receive these briefings and nobody showed up nobody to Britain in many cases when I go get get get these briefings on the first person to have got them\nAnd I thought well this enterprises managing all these ... ... ... but we as a society to spend much time thinking about um\n\n\n\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis he's best known for his books like money ball the big short and the undoing project all of which have been bestsellers his new book the fifth risk is about the federal government\nUnder Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and commerce departments\nNow I'm Wondering there's so much attention being paid to what's happening in the White House and to the Mueller investigation and now to um the Kavanaugh confirmations story\nAnd not as much attention is being paid what's happening on the cabinet level on the department level and I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action happening in the department level like the three departments you write about no agriculture commerce energy\nThat most of us aren't paying that much attention to even though it's it's being reported on\nBut it's not it never seems to be like the sexiest story\nIt never will be and that's the problem is like where society of distracted drivers we're not paying attention to the thing that matters most\nThere is this enterprise that is not up for a prize the biggest ... ... ... doesn't function without the government government is is it's been subjected to decades and decades of of abuse and scorn\nAnd with a sledgehammer and is is having at it and nobody's paying much to know is paying much attention because of slow moving story and this to me you know one aspect of the fifth risk\nIs the go a lot of the risk that the government manages are very long term slow moving risk climate change would be one of them income inequality ... would be another ah cleaning up uh you know horrible toxic waste sites that can pollute rivers and\nRuin lives and another they're all kinds of examples of very slow moving problems that are dealt with in a slow way but they require a long term approach and on top of this enterprise has been has been thrust is very short term\nAttitude I mean the ... the Trump Administration has incredible kind of living from news cycle the news cycle\nAnd the public is go along with it and that's ... that's that's the frightening thing to me\nAnd you see a lot of action happening at the department level that that kind of level of government where things are being done when positions aren't being replaced where people are being appointed who aren't really appropriate for the position\nAnd people and they're people who have the ability to dismantle critical functions as the government who also have a financial incentive to do so because they have some conflict\nSo let's get back to the Commerce Department which you write about in the ... the Commerce Department includes the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in L. A. Noah and you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department Israeli Noah first of all what they're doing in the Commerce Department [laughter]\nIt's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent of its for sixty five percent or so of the budget it goes to this one thing I Know it eats the Commerce Department and they simply don't National Weather service as a National Weather service is a bit and now there was there which is the biggest part of no\n... and how do they get their back in the seventies or Nixon was contemplating reorganization of government and\nUm he was going to put the no ... in the department of interior and the secretary of interior at the time came out against the Vietnam War in ... Nixon got ticked off and just shoved into the Commerce Department is an act of vengeance so it's there it doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there\nAnd it is it's the single most important institution within the Commerce Department are and it does it eats most of the resources\nAnd it and what it does um is absolutely critical and er into this place Trump is put the most really about the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nAnd you're talking about Barry Myers who is the C. E. O. N. accuweather I that sounds actually like a good fit he runs a leather production surface\n[noise] well I'm\nSo here's the problem are typically the person who runs NOAA has as a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's a ... you know as a giant science operation\nUm the problem is that the national weather service uh which has been a ... a fabulously successful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but but the weather prediction has gotten generally\nBetter over the last few decades we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings a faster than we used to be able to give them and I mean ... and just the you know the daily\nSaves lives and property or if that's the mission of the national weather service to save lives and property to do it it has to\nCommunicate with the public uh it it has to let the rest of it as it has to be good at communicating with the public and Barry Myers a has been on a two decade mission to present the national weather service from communicating with the public so that accuweather\nCan do it instead and that's how accuweather gets paid and so he has had bills introduced in Congress just actually forbid the national weather service from\nFrom doing anything but warning in ... right in advance of a of a weather event that might kill you at the problem with is is that well in the first place\nIf the the the the the data that that is required to generate weather prediction\nIs all paid for by the taxpayer I mean that they these billion dollar satellites that are hovering over us the ah the ... the ... the network of radar stations across the country the national weather service spends the bulk of its money accumulating the data they didn't then makes available for free\nTo companies like accuweather so that they can go and you know advertise the whether there's no real reason why the taxpayer should have to pay for this twice having paid for the date of the national weather service really should be able to give people forecasts\nBut what he's been trying to do is Oregon eyes is actually a kind of exclusive rights\nTo use that data and make money from it and his argument is that I shouldn't have to compete with the government but it's a very strange argument because the government gives him basically all he needs to do is business for free\nYeah you're saying about the weather satellites weather radar weather balloons oh the high tech stuff that I'm\nAt no private company that no private company on its own would have the wherewithal to to pay for that it is a naturally or a government operation and so and it's naturally a government operation to deliver a weather forecast for the public\nSo Barry Myers or had been like one vote away from Senate confirmation where does that stand now [noise]\nHis nomination is stalled so he's not in the job yet\nMy guest is Michael Lewis his new book is called the just the risk we'll talk more after a break I'm Terry Gross and Mrs fresh air [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from cancer treatment centers of America working to outsmart cancer for the use of genomic testing to profile each individual's cancer and revealed possible treatment option\nLearn more about precision cancer treatment that Cancer Center dot com and from ...

quote landing team will send a list of Seventy four questions he wanted answers to somebody for questions to the department of energy what were some of the questions\nHe wanted lists of uh names of anybody in the department who attended meetings that were associated with climate change\nHe was trying to identify people who might be hostile to the fossil fuels industry I think so the department didn't actually respond by giving him the list of names but he ... the bigger point was\nHe came in in what were they interpret it as a hostile spirit I'm signaling that the new administration was not did not approve of various attempts the department of energy was making to wean us from fossil fuels and it is you know part of the department of energy's mission to\nEngage in and fund basic research in alternative energy\nSo you know your previous book about the science of of risk and about trying to\nThe human mind works when it's assessing risk that book was called the undoing project do you feel in a way that your new book could have been called the undoing pack because in some ways\nDepartments and you know I in the Trump Administration are getting on ... ... there aren't a lot of people to replace the people from the Obama administration yet and some of the people who have been put in positions to run those departments are antagonistic toward those departments\nSo yes but there's actually there's actually direct connection between the undoing project my last book in this one is what got me into this book in the first place [noise]\nOne of the insights that drops out of the work of the psychologist Dan economy to name Mr risky who are studying the way people judge risk\nIs that when you changed the odds people don't sense it especially with catastrophic risk you take something that is there's a one in a million chance of it happening and change it to one in ten thousand people don't feel that\nAnd I was thinking of that when Trump came in and approached the federal government the way he did because\nOne way of thinking at the federal government is is this vast portfolio of risks many of them potentially catastrophic risk the risk of a pandemic or a the risk of a a nuclear accident or the risk of a terrorist attack or the ... one after another and many of these\nAre not risk that most people are thinking about the risk that the nuclear waste site in half or Washington leeches plutonium into the Columbia River and poison the whole Pacific Northwest and I thought Trump's approach\nIs effectively taking it lots of you know one and a million or ... hundred thousand risks and making them more likely making them all more likely because he's putting people in charge of the risk you don't know anything about it and I thought this society doesn't feel it it kind of interest you showed you that people don't really feel this\nAnd that insight is what got me going in the first place\n[noise] so you used to work on Wall street way back in the day and you wrote about that experience in your first book liars poker last month mark the tenth anniversary of the financial collapse of two thousand eight the market has more than recovered over that time\nBut some people are starting to say this might be another bubble um\nHow are you interpreting having written a book recently about risk and having you know been having written about the financial crisis what you've done I'm I'm saying what your thoughts are about whether we really are now in terms of financial stability and and and world markets\n[noise] well a method to question the question you're asking me to predict the bad things going to happen next well I I Know that's not really your job but no it's not my job but you know if I ...\nI Would love to have one ... outlandish prediction on the record not that I think it's going to happen but like it's a sort of thing that if it does happen I think a lot of people will go oh my God that's exactly where we were headed all assuming Donald Trump remains president for a while\nI think there's at least the possibility of the risk that he will try to default on the American debt selectively like he'll say or the Chinese are trying to sell their treasury bonds is causing disruption and the treasury bond market they stole money in the first place from us we're not going to pay the Chinese back\nThis is a a war way of saying that I think the risk now in the financial system is political risk I at the banks are much better capitalizing better regulated\nUh directly a banking crisis but I think there could be a crisis in face in the dollar and in us credit worthiness our deficits are exploding we have a president who has a history of defaulting on debt\nHe's riled up lots of emotions hostile emotions to foreigners who hold the debt I'm it would that wouldn't shock me and that would trigger a financial crisis a so why\nWould if you treat them at the national ice as\nWell because the dollar is the world's reserve currency lots of lots of people hold it assuming it's going to be more or less stable\nThey'd be a flight out of the dollar a U.S treasury bonds or the benchmark for a ... of risk a risk was asset in the world with everybody kind of measures themselves off of it's assumed to be\nYou know better than gold ... if that if that is called into question and then treasury bonds are going to collapse in the interest rate which the U.S government can borrow is going to skyrocket\nUm this is the doomsday scenario and I'm just kind of playing with it hit here but if you asked me to like\n... predict what might trigger a the next financial crisis I think it's I think I Would predict it's some sort of political event and it would be that sort of thing and if that happened you know it's fun\nWhen you predict things funding or predict things where where where they happened they make sense of a lot of things that have happened leading up to it\nAh I think a lot of people would say oh my God we should have seen that coming\n[noise] my guest is Michael Lewis and his new book is called this this risk and the book is about the federal government under President Trump and the book looks at the energy agriculture and Commerce Department we're going to take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air\n[noise] Mm [noise]\nMm\n[noise]\nIn [noise]\nIn [noise]\nMm Mm\nAnd\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis his new book the fifth risk is about the federal government under Trump a lot of the government as a often dismissed as being a\nThat slows down anything ... sons down enough and prevent anything from getting done and that it just like layers and layers of of bureaucrats have like managers and\nI'm just lazy stupid people is it has your has your understanding of like our bureaucracy changed through writing these stories\nOh my God I so I didn't know what I was going to fight when I start knocking on the door of the Energy Department or the agriculture department the Commerce Department and I turned out having exactly the same experience\nThe political people have when they're appointed to these jobs running these places and have these some preconceptions but vague preconception of what the bureaucrats are like [noise] um this happens over and over again\nAnd if they have kind of contempt vague contempt for the people who were there and four years later they walk out and say those are the most amazing people I've ever worked with\nI I expected to be brief can be you know it'd be kind of informed about these people I did not expect to be inspired by them\nThe kind of person who is still working in our government despite all the abuse the government takes is is a mission driven person they're not paid well\nUh they're they're because they're interested in the task the people in the national weather service or people who have had a passion for the weather since they were little kids that people in the department of energy aside just about a passion for their particular size since they were little kids\nThey essentially it's essentially what they are all these people are firefighters are in spirit and\nThere's something really moving about groups of people who were doing what they're doing not for money but from mission uh they they have a purpose in life and it just jumped off

your head having that argument with yourself yeah I think I was I think that that's fair a kind of um\nYou know how did I end up here I mean her blaming second wave feminism for her I mean it's such a\nDemented thing to do but then I started understand what she said I remember my producer was trying to follow the the logic of the writing and she was like well I'm she's sort of a leaps to that and I said you know it's buttering this isn't like a rational this is a kind of\nUpsets buttering person then this is what's flying out of her mouth it's not a well thought out argument but I get it on an emotional level I get why\nShe feels betrayed by some notion of like a you know be independent and you don't need you know pursue your career and it's not like Lori time ever said that exactly you know she's really can't be blamed but I Know what conference character is talking about some sense of\nLike a license to pursue your\nOr to pursue the other part of your life not the wife part not the mother part but the other part and then suddenly\nShe feels like the rug has been pulled out from under her and this thing that she um delayed is now possibly not available to her I think for a lot of women\nWhen you're trying to reach a certain point in your career there never seems to be a great time to take time away from that to you know get pregnant and and raise a child and take some time either a little are a lot\nAway from the work that you are pursuing from the career you're trying to establish\nWhat are you really afraid you'd waited too long and not you know work had gotten in a way of of\nI mean it's also it's work and it's probably my own hesitation about taking that plunge and what it means and sort of maybe as you were getting at in our last interview ten years ago my own weird family also played an impact which isn't really\nYou know that marriage and having babies didn't look so good from my childhood point of view [laughter] so maybe I wasn't rushing to do it anyway um but back combined with the\nYou know pursuing a career in being a writer I was a performance artist and then I I was an actor I was a performance artist I was making theater I was you know then I decided to go to graduate school and film and then trying to make films and it was all very\nConducive to having a kid I mean I didn't have any money for one and I live but it's going to my teeth and didn't have any health insurance and you know it was not I wasn't doing anything that seem particularly stable\nMy guest is camera Jenkins she wrote and directed the new film private life which opens

has a lot of drama to it about a couple of played by Paul Giamatti and Catherine ... who are in their forties and trying to conceive through various fertility methods and the old fashioned method and\nAlso trying to adopt and it's creating a lot of emotional turmoil and conflict\nOh I should mention that Temer Jenkins also wrote and directed the savages and slums of Beverly Hills\nSo they're spoken after each of your future in films and in two thousand seven when we spoke after the savages and you are forty and talked about how you are trying at that point to have children with your husband [noise] he said so you know I guess I'll be an older parent because you are already forty\nYour father was Twenty years older than your mother so he was an older parent and he raised you part of the time as a single parent not a very good one maybe but [laughter] um what was the experience for you like having a parent who is older than most of the other parents\nYeah I mean he was also and he was made up their hair here yeah yeah he was from another time it was like having a Damon Runyon character is your dad I mean he was um he was old fashioned anyway\nUm and it but it was really different I remember people saying oh I remember being with my dad at a grocery store in Los Angeles and I think somebody said something about\nOh you know well you know oh honey you know well you just give that to your grandfather and I started to correct the person uh I think it was you know a cashier and I said oh that's not my grandfather and I feel like my dad sort of shut me up\nLike he didn't want to get into it and I and and then it was sort of ... I mean now there's so many older parents in a way but and maybe the idea of having a mom that was Twenty years younger than your dad I don't know but yeah he he also felt like he was out of time he was sort of\nYou know he was a bubble and we lived in Los Angeles and everybody seems sort of modern and in the seventies and she just seemed like I said like smoking as Paul malls and his sued and and had a compulsive gambler like he was really like a character so you make three feature films two of them are about being a daughter and\nOne is about becoming a parent uh your first one slums in Beverly Hills is when you live with your father and he moved you and your brother to Beverly Hills and he was broke basically [laughter] but he wanted you to go to good schools so we'd find like the cheapest places he could possibly find in Beverly Hills\nWeb streaming is made possible by the bone and joined Institute of Tennessee helping patients make a living with pain from aging traumatic accident or sports related injury a thing of the past appointments are available that bone and joined the tea and daughter work\nI'm a a a nursing home and he was not as usual he was not appreciative of what you were doing [noise] I'm In part because of the dementia and part because he's just not you didn't depict him as the appreciative type 'em right and there isn't a strange men\nBetween you between the actor and a father and also between the character and her brother so unusual coming together and of course the new movie is about you know a woman in her forties trying to to have a child through whatever means necessary [noise]\nUm and so no matter which way you kind of turn the camera what you've been looking at in your movies\nIs um is family and you know\nThe complications of having one wanting to have one and I'm Wondering if you think having such a complicated childhood yourself because of living several years with your father and not being well parent at during that time has made you so focused\nOn the idea of family\nYeah I mean I I must be I mean it's hard to know exactly what goes in to it but I guess I Am I mean our family was super fractured and there were multiple said you know there was actually four children and\nUm we you know didn't live with her mother lived with her father than we lived with her mother a little bit then we moved to Cambridge and my big brother became my legal guardian he adopted us I mean we were pretty we we did a lot [laughter] what what is your mother arrangements\nUm when I was a teenager or at that point I had ... I was living with my dad for ten years and my dad\nUm ... we moved away from living on my dad's plus he was old PS but anyway and I had a little brother and we moved to live with my mother and that was very unstable and kind of crazy and then my oldest brother who's ten years older than me um had been\nA living abroad and he returned he was living in ... he was living in Bali actually and he returned\nTo uh go to graduate school at Harvard\nAnd he came to see me and I was living with my mother and he was concerned about me I was a teenager I was pretty depressed and\nI was working at a dry cleaners in Philadelphia and going to lower Moran high school for a second and then um she was worried about me and he said that he was moving to Cambridge to to go to school and did I Want to\nMove with him\nHe's sort of save my life how did he say I didn't because I he paid attention well then I didn't move in with him and then my little brother we all lived in Harvard housing and they um student housing at Harvard and he sort of began became our parents\nHe paid attention to us like we had very narcissistic parents when we were just no one was paying attention and suddenly and it was very chaotic and\nCrazy and then suddenly we were living with like little monks we're so happy\nMy brother was you know getting his PHD and uh and me and my little brother lived in this Harvard housing and we lived on food stamps and student loans and my brother took out and um\nYou know we our lives improved and we became much better students [laughter] that's cool [noise]\nWhich is ironic because of course everybody from the outside thought oh they don't have any parents must be wild over there but we were the opposite we were\nTo be in a chaotic place that we we weren't like the wild family we were like the we were trying to find sanity what's an example of a chaotic moment in your childhood\nUm well you know the stuff in California would be my father's relationship to every landlord that we had in LA because we there was always some drama with the rent and having hostile relationships with our landlords\nBecause my dad although we didn't know why you know the landlords were nice to the kids but I mean now I'm like oh they didn't like it was because dad was probably late with the rent\n'em so there was that there was a kind of general dysfunction in any building we ever lived in\nUm um and then when we lived with my mother she would I guess she was on her second marriage and her second husband was an alcoholic and it was very chaotic and there was never food and the refrigerator but there were things like cocktail food like olives and\nThings that you would put it in a ... Mary she know cherries and ah maybe some parmesan cheese but there was never food food it was very cocktail oriented and then um yeah there's a couple of examples so when you were living with your brother\nWas it was at Harvard and on on the ... yeah it was Harvard housing it was not on the campus but I'm close to it yeah it was in between Harvard Square importer square off mastiff mhm so what was it helpful to you to be in an atmosphere where there were a lot of college students\nYeah it was really it was so different from our weird like LA Nineteen seventies world like living in the outskirts of Beverly Hills which is just specific and strange and\nUm and then go to a you know wherever in Philadelphia which was my mom lived in the suburbs of the main line and ah [noise] yeah it was just a Cambridge itself just felt so I mean it was New England just had a very different feeling\nUm it was and there you know there was just so much focus in our house because my brother was doing so much and he was getting his you know he's taking care of two kids and getting ... like twenty five was crazy I mean it was an amazing sacrifice and\nI just an amazing act of love and I mean I guess now that I'm Talking about it with you because you're so good at does your polling this stuff out\nDr gross I'm [laughter] not that that said even in the wreckage there's this kind of makeshift family that gets put together by any means necessary and in a way all of these movies are sort of like that\n[noise] let's hammer Jenkins it's great to have you back on our show thank you so much thank you\nTimer Jenkins wrote and directed the new movie private life it opens in theaters and begin streaming Netflix this Friday she also co wrote the film adaptation of Nick ... novel Juliet, Naked which is currently in theaters\nAfter a break Marine Corps again will review the new memoir heartland about growing up just below the poverty line in a family that had been family farmers in rural Kansas I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Nashville", "day": "03"}
