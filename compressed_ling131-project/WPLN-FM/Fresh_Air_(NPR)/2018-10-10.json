[noise]\nSpeaking with the W. singer a strategist at New America and a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community also with Emmerson broken he writes about conflict and social media their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\nYou look at the Israeli incursions into the Gaza Strip and its battles with Hamas and you're right that the Israeli military efforts were accompanied by a viral online marketing campaign and they were hip to the importance of this what\nDid they do so it was actually a twenty twelve pillar of defense operation a eight days of Israeli airstrikes that drew Peter myself to this subject originally and got us researching it ever since [noise]\nUh this military campaign was accompanied by a remarkable online viral marketing campaign\nThe\nCampaign to twenty twelve opens with the assassination of a high level Amoss militant\nThat's not particularly unusual but it is uh what is unusual is that the drone strike video was up within a few hours and the official Twitter account of the Israeli defense forces was broadcasting it out again and again\nIn time or a mosque Twitter proxies respond threatening war and how far\nAnd is the operation commenced as Israel would strike particular targets it would\nPut out information about what had been done about the the weapons caches that have been recovered then among us would respond in a similarly taunting manner\nAnd what's important is that this wasn't just the social media operatives if these two sides but also millions and millions of Twitter messages exchanged back and forth by the proxies if one side or another ten million and all in this first twenty twelve conflict Ninety percent of which were outside the region\nAnd this was an example of a limited military campaign but nonetheless was a global war for public opinion and this set a model that we're starting to see a in all future conflicts\nAnd to think stand out about it the first is that we could all participate it was people outside the region or deciding whose message went viral who's a side of the story was winning out\nBut importantly it was not just winning out on line when it was also affecting the real battlefield decisions when you go back and map out\nThe ah targeting by Israeli airstrikes and the pace of them\nA centrally they changed by almost half dependent on which side was winning out on line so it was happening is that the politicians and the generals were making battlefield decisions while watching what was playing out on their smartphones reflecting what you and I were clicking on\nYou know you make the point again that scale matters if you put put up a an effective post on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram that's one thing\nIf you have an army of people organized to re tweeted and magnify its effect that's all the more important ... did the Israelis anticipate this and have their own Qadri of social media users ready to to give their their message where residents\nSo originally the Israeli military is not ready for this whole space and they're quite taken aback by a\nHow they're losing this bottle of narrative but with very real physical and political effects\nAnd like any other military they learn they reorganized and they reorganized and everything from uh creating new military units are in fact one of the find a images that you can see a line is how they've changed their recruiting to let young Israelis know that you can do your military service by serving\nThe online battle a instead of you know carrying a gun you can be using Internet means in the like\nBut it's also woven into the broader population for example they create a organizations within a Israeli universities where not only Israeli students but students from around the world\nCan participate in this battle a narrative to they have created apps that allow you and I to download them and serve the cost and you know gain badges and the like\nAnd in many ways what Israel is done has created a model for other militaries around the world that are looking at this and saying maybe we need to engage in this kind of reorganization too and you see it everywhere from ah Europe to some discussion within the U.S military\nSo so you can in enlist in an online army and get you know what badges promotions\nThe same way that you can enlist in Taylor Swift army of swift ease you can list and the Israeli defense forces on line army the uh cars may not be the same but the tactics are\nAnd by contrast with the Israeli approach which is fairly centralized you're giving you a mission giving a set of messages to push\nThe Amoss one poll from the world at at crowd sources so to speak and\nOne of the other tools of the trade what are the tricks that used in these but also in political campaigns to marketing is basically to find out what's trending elsewhere and try and try and layer onto it\nSo for example or you had the um ice bucket challenge a couple of years ago where we were all you know drawing attention to ourselves as a way to fundraise for a disease research this was woven into the battlefield where people were doing the ice bucket challenge but using rubble after Israeli airstrikes\nYou would put rubble on your head\nYou would port rubble on your head and then the image would go viral and it was a way of kind of\nHijacking one discussion\nTo drive it through your own in the same way that ISIS for example would hijacked discussion about a hash tag World Cup and jumped into it to the same way that Trump's online army would try and hijack discussion that was trending for Hillary or the like\nWe're listening to the interview fresh air Dave Davies recorded with the W. singer and Emerson breaking\nAuthors of the new book

council on Foreign Relations also with us pi Wu singer strategist at New America at a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war the weaponization of ...\nI'm interested in your sense of how um social media wars affected opinions about the um Kavanaugh's confirmation controversy I mean this was a case where there were facts in dispute a lot of strongly held opinions do you have any sense of [noise]\nAnd they must have been social media campaigns what kind of impact they had on how this was perceived and you know the enduring impact it'll have on our discourse\nIf you were watching your social media feeds during the Kavanaugh hearings in many ways it felt like a war going back and forth and uh it was in a certain way you had both sides using\nThe exact same tactics of you know what we call like war that military for using all around the world you could see everything from\nOpen source intelligence gathering campaigns where are they were enlisting\nThe online crowd to find bits of information to bring it together\nAnd they wouldn't have previously been possible or so for example on one side you had a crowd source hunt using images from Washington National baseball games to try and figure out who sat next to Kavanaugh to a unpack this strange story of his two hundred thousand dollars in a baseball ticket that\nThen you add the other side this combination of a Google Earth images and Zillow real estate data\nTo basically push this narrative or the ... gang or a narrative that a doctor for a the claim was well she's not a liar but she's confused about who it was now that narrative that was pushed on line points to a second thing that played out\nThe um spread of disinformation the spread of alternative theories the idea of bearing the truth underneath a sea of lies it's something that for example Russia's specialized again\nAnd again you saw both sides engaging in this and the Kavanaugh debate pushing out all sorts of different false stories false persona as in the like and the battle to have their own narrative went out and the other side's narrative\nBe buried underneath this you even saw attempts to change not just your point of view but history itself for at least the online place that we go to a ... learn about history Wikimedia\nSo for example in the book where the story of how after the Russians shoot down an airliner over Ukraine\nRussian um actors go on to compete in very quickly to change the story to make it seemed like they weren't involved\nThe same thing played out during the Kavanaugh hearing where ah he used the term I'm In is a high school yearbook it was sexual term and during his hearing he says no no no no it's not a sexual term is about drinking game\nThe problem for him is that there's literally no evidence on the entire Internet of that being a drinking game\nUntil someone within the house of representatives again everything is out in the open so we can geo located to that\nDuring the middle of the hearing someone in the house of representatives goes to create the evidence on ... do you make it seem as if he is telling the truth so you have this back and forth back and forth\nAnd it's our contention that every single political debate moving forward is going to see these kinds of tactics utilized again because both sides not only use them but believe that they were the key to their effort including in winning\n[noise] you're right that the social media platforms are private companies uh and they are now coming to terms with the fact that they play like it or not a very powerful role in elections and the national discourse and have to take some responsibility for dealing with this content which is a huge challenge just because of the sheer volume\nBillions of posts a day and you know the subtle\nIn what is not um and that there is a developing tool\nCalled neural networks explain what they are what they can do\nSo neural networks is part of this larger ah area of research that people talk about is essentially artificial intelligence\nOr using machines to not just ... but maybe in some ways surpassed I'm human intelligence and thinking and so neural networks can be used or like any other technology for both good and bad or so for example they can um\nCreate a wonderful imagery and scenes or images of a volcano that doesn't exist in the real world\nUm and it's very powerful and use of ... for example or the future of marketing a it's going to move into areas ah like customer service um the company the this also as a way to save money or for example if you're interacting with a machine rather than someone behind a help desk\nBut like everything else it's also going to be weaponized and so those very same I chat box for example that might be trying to persuade you to buy a product might be trying to persuade you to vote in a certain way or I'm a convince someone to take a certain position on the war\nA certain way to challenge also moves into visual imagery there's an area known as deep fakes these are hyper realistic images um videos for example of speeches that politicians never made it seems that never happened and so\nWith humans finding it harder and harder to figure out what is real or not the companies and turn are looking to artificial intelligence to help find it to help police their networks\nAnd so you get this strange but yet I'm kind of a wonderfully appropriate outcome the origin of social networks online we're a bunch of scientists talking about science fiction that's where this all came from\nAnd now we have the science fiction like outcome emerging where you have to say I ... back and forth with us humans caught in the middle\nRight so so so these neural networks like that could be good at subtly detecting what a robotic Twitter account might be in a way that would be hard for humans but they can also produce a picture of NO NAME somebody Joe Biden offering some you know\nProfane a comment at something\nTo get real world examples of this there have already been creations of speeches that a rock Obama never gave\nOr there's other ones where you can lay are real and fake imagery together where for example it can be your facial expressions but you're controlling an online image of everything from an example Arnold Schwarzenegger\nTo ah George W. Bush basically anyone that you have enough data points on what their face looks like\nWhich by the way you can get off of Facebook\nYou can take out and meld together to allow you to a in essence created a fake seen of them saying or doing something and so just like everything else in this space it's going to be used for good for jokes for laugh it's going to be monetize for for profit\nAnd it's also going to be weaponized\nEmerson broken ...

was what [laughter] why would someone who is so absorbed in movies and jazz and musicals make a movie about ... an astronaut and space\nI Love the film but I was wondering like when you were offered the chance to make this film how did you see yourself being the right fit with it\nUh well you know I I myself I think had the the same sort of initial ah you know it it didn't really line up with the sort of films I'd been making art or kind of had in my mind but\nI think after thinking about it for a little bit and and during the ... the incredible books at the movies based on it struck me as a story about dreams and uh and the cost of pursuing those dreams and you know that those are similar the Maddox terrain at least two\nWe used a full scale replicas of these capsules they were the you know sort of exactly the same size all the details were exactly the same or production designer a nascent crowded and incredible job sort of rebuilding these things and\nWe'd we would amount to you know we wouldn't fly them into space but we would mount them on the most control systems gambles that basically wouldn't move and rock back and forth quite violently if we needed them to\nUh and we would set those up against a giant ... D screens so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see off to set you look out the window you see space imagery instead of you know film equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nYou see the earth's spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had to kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you get this kind of strobe you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors in for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know was kind of feeling if we can feel it onset if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to ah to give that sense then\nThen the audience is going to feel at the actors are gonna be that much more ... you know the the sweat you see on screen will be real the shaking will be real even some of the terrible the real the knowledge that will be real and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight till uh Ryan Gosling isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that it looks real and so that he is really experiencing all of the uh ... Haitian and just physical jostling of all of this\nYes you know we didn't literally a spin Ryan in the capsule at you know several rotations per second as happened to a Neal and and Dave's got you know uh [laughter]\nBut we a ride and I both wanted to try to make this physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody throw up to the heart and question [laughter] not not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because ah he started to uh apparently you started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone and so we had to uh\nLast year and I was getting gas out from we\nWe have to take a we had to take a moment\nNo he got his actually all very a a word for a second or his rise the type of actor who really just you know a really wants to do as much with himself as as you can do I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you arrest and ah you know\nHave you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine but\nI think it's a testament to Ryan that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting\nAnother thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is the noise I mean you're hearing alarms go off in hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet but I guess at times like this is not quiet at all inside the space capsule at least it lessens and said can you talk a little bit about that\nThe one we've been talking about\n[noise] yeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was putting space in film it is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of ... you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space um injustice position with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know this is a hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of uh making its way up there so something like a\nLike the spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we wanted to kind of a try to hit an emotional reality for that uh in the sense that we sort of way to augment the sounds you would actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually remind audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks\nA little groans and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire to just whenever possible remind them that this is\nThis is a piece by piece a hand built machine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts are something that are just delivered from the future you know their piece together by robots by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon flight\nMassive puts together a press state meant about the deaths of the men on a flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\n'em and sell you know they basically standing as astronaut off into space hoping that land on the moon but if they don't that's I guess they download masters preparing you know basically a eulogy and press release eulogy um get get that actually happened\nYeah yeah I mean you can find the uh ... you know you can search it on line in a van of moving disaster um and ah what sort of the you know the the sort of had it on the copy a and so the sheet of paper you see a you see a a\nGear and Heinz who plays ... movie holding his is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh uh the actual sort of format and paper um [noise] uh that you can uh again that you can find on line and and the wording as is word for word um and it's a really I mean it's it's a\n... actually really love that that speech because uh you know think thank God it was never given\nBut in a way to capture late in such a poetic beautiful way the willingness to sacrifice and and this kind of reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speech says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the er at the moon will know that there's some part of another world that is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what the intend to that speech was\nBut yet also at the same time this incredible kind of hope and this sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what these sort of a risky costly brave ventures a could maybe do for for the country and for humanity\nI was wondering if the astronaut Neil is Neil Armstrong knew that NASA was riding his obituary just in case\nKnow I I um I don't know that for sure I think you know one fascinating thing about Neal and and his colleagues was just how close to death they\nAre live their lives and and seemed willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilots are astronauts you know it's something that families are all over the country and all over the world\nConversations that they sometimes a half to has or any sort of service for country often\nSomething I think it's helpful to to remind

[noise] I Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think is the music he actually brought with him to play after the space landing in my right about that [noise]\nUh this is music he plays on the way to the moon I think is what you're referring yeah and the way to like yes yeah yeah that can do it\nIt's a ... piece called litter Rhapsody yeah and when I find really interesting about that is that you know this comes into the category about an agenda that's been described as exotic I but you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way\nWith all due respect to Neil Armstrong like like Hollywood style celestial voices Sarah ... incredibly like Lauren piano if it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty shocking and having that kind of transcendent experience of like\nBeing a fleet of the moon and plane was like really corny [laughter]\nRomney version of what you know women are might be it just strikes me as so it just so strange and I as somebody in the I Know how interested you are in music and how like you playing music so how did it strike you\nI was a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually in the rye and himself it stumbled on a you mentioned in Japan since the book that Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is\nSo Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous tracts of music that uh that Neal and the other astronaut play during the course of their mission they played a piece for by divorce shock and\nAwe and what not but this you know strange little less Baxter tune a was something that was actually a the kneeling Janet or listen to together that they loved together when they were young and loving in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nA in space and as I learned someone who was you know who was having a going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kind of unexpectedly play distracted really no one\nListening no much control certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know time space and and the sort of cause most to ah\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nWhy don't we hear a little bit of the record that we've been talking about which is called RNA Rhapsody [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nOh [laughter] oh\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\nAtlanta Rhapsody which Neil Armstrong played on the way to the moon and it's used in the new movie first man which has directed by my ... who also directed la la land and read it too and also wrote and directed whiplash [noise]\nUm and I found remarkable was that you were working on la la land before first man but la la land wasn't turnaround sound like you hadn't really began shooting it right yeah\nI I first met Ryan uh to talk to him about first man ah and ah so you know that that was you know a few years until ... kind of languishing you know life is sort of you know just\nA a you know [noise]\nI've been trying to get a made for a while and with no success and and uh through a lot of stops and starts and and uh and during that time I er I made whiplash and then during the day after that I was given this book a first manned by Jim Hansen and\nFell in love with it and and and went to Ryan and said hey would you be interested in playing Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and oh by the way also if you're a you're into musicals you have a musical script and I said oh yeah you like musicals city I Love Gene Kelly and\nWe talked about Gene Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first man but a lot of land\nBut as soon as well and was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and uh we jumped right into this\nSo I'm finally what brings you the most joy and the most anxiety and doing a movie like first man which they so much technical stuff you had to do you know it's like sound effects and reproducing I'm a space capsules in space flight and creating like\nReplicating real size and then miniatures it it's it's\nYou know la la land was a complex film but that's like the choreography in the camera work and the dreamy sequences this is like really difficult in a in a whole other level\nYeah I mean I uh I think everything you describe gave me a lot of a lot of anxiety a lot of sleepless nights I'm I think even more than that you know it was a little bit the the responsibility of the weight of history and I think particularly knowing\nThat a a an ... and Ryan has said something very similar to a a knowing that Neal's kids were going to see this film you know they've been very helpful with us\nA all through the making of it and and helping us get it right up and knowing that at the end of the day this was a film that they were ah going to see and they weren't going to see a store called figure on screen they were going to see their mom and their dad or they went to see themselves they're going to see their family life\nIt it was just to kind of responsibility that certainly I haven't felt before as a filmmaker um and I think it was a it was a good fire you know sort of lit a fire under myself and all of us to just go that that much further work that much harder to you know really get it right and pay proper tribute to ah to these people\n[noise] they mean she's I'll thank you so much for talking with us it's been great to have you back on our shown congratulations and thank you so nice to be back thanks for having me\nDamien ... directed the
