failure ego power addiction relationships and sexism\nSeason five is set in the era of the me too movement\nBow jak horsemen takes advantage of the kind of characters that you can pull off in an animated series it's a world that to mix of people and talking animals with human characteristics\nBow jak is a horse who became famous as the star of the nineties sitcom horsing around\nBut when season one of bull jak horsemen begins bull jak is washed up his celebrity has faded and he spends a lot of time drinking feeling sorry for himself and watching old reruns of his sitcom horsing around admiring how great he was on the show back then\nLet's start with a clip from the very first episode of Bo jak horsemen when Bo jak is aghast that Charlie Rochelle\n[noise] Nineteen eighty seven situation comedy horses around beard on ABC Show which young bachelor horses forced to reevaluate its priorities agrees trees three human children was initially dismissed by critics is wrong and ... and not good\nBut the family comedy struggled with America went on to air for nine seasons store or a portion of around ... or ... ... it is good to be here Charlie\n[laughter] Raphael Bob Blacksburg welcome to fresh air time changes how we see things doesn't it [laughter]\nWhat were you when you did that Charlie Rose opening you probably had no idea that he would be accused by multiple women of sexual harassment and that would lead to the loss of his job [laughter]\nSo let's just start with the surprise of that for you did you think of that opening episode when the women step forward\nIt really dates the show doesn't it to have Charlie Rose be the the voice was sober reason that you know we'll get bow jak who is such a mess and all that far EEO and unprofessional and Charlie Rose up ... quit by pat knows ... is our our street person in the scene\nAnd uh yeah when the allegations are against Charlie Rose came out I don't want to say my first thought was oh no my show\nBecause there wasn't it was truly oh no Charlie Rose ... and and all the women that he allegedly targeted a that's terrible but it it it is interesting now to go back to that first episode and look at it and think about how times have changed\nSo how did you come up with the idea of starting a series with a horse that can talk and walk on two legs and dress and be bitter like a human being and have him be the washed up star of the family\nI liked that sneak attack into sadness into in some fun ways [laughter] far north as quick as it kind of sadness I like the final version [laughter]\nAnd and oh jak isn't such despair afterwards and feels so responsible he's driving any closed his eyes and nearly drives off the road but then opens his eyes just in time to save himself and I think that's a suicide attempt as opposed to him falling asleep at the wheel\nWhere I Would say it's a lazy suicide attempt right it's a suicide attempt at a plausible deniability well he's not actively killing himself but he's\nAllowing the universe to take its course you know what I mean I always felt like in a port and ... maybe minor distinction to us that he was so disappointed and despairing but he was willing to do this but not so much that he was going to actively do it himself\nOne of the episodes that you have in the current season season five which you wrote is um an unusual episode because it's one long monologue ... mother has died she was never a nice mother she was always mean to him\nAnd during the last period of her life she had really bad dementia and low jak does not feel warmly toward her so this episode is all his eulogy for her so he's at a podium at a Mike her coffins at the side\nAnd he's not trying to paper over what their relationship with like he's talking about all these horrible things that happened in the family and how he was mistreated by his parents and how his father was\n[noise] I I Want to play a brief part of his ... and ... as well or not as well jak horsemen\nI used to be on the TV show called horsing around fiercely they'll hold your applause\nWill held it was written by my friend her because as who's also dead now and it started this little girl named Sarah Lynn\nAnd it was about these orphans in early on the network at a new maybe don't mentioned they're orphans so much because audiences tend to find orphans sad and not related at all but I never thought the orphans were said I I always thought they were lucky because they couldn't imagine their parents to be anything they wanted something to long for\nAnyway we did this one season finale we're Olivia's birth mother comes to town and she was a junkie but she's got herself cleaned up and she was to be living his life again and of course she's like a perfect grownup version of Libya and they go to the mall together and get her ears pierced like she's always wanted and anyway the horse to water be careful\nLoves to have a way of letting you do but Olivia\nJust thinks the horses jealous and when the mom says she's moving to California Bolivia decides to go with her\nAnd the network really juiced cliffhanger is Olivia gone for good\nBut of course because it's a TV show should not gone for good of course because it's a TV show Olivia's mother had a relapse and had to go back to rehab facility had hitchhiked all the way home getting rides from Mr T. alpha the cast stop of course that's what happened because what are you going to do just not handled Libya on the show\nYou shouldn't have happy endings sitcoms not really because if everyone's happy to show it would be over and above all else the show has to keep going there's always more show and you can call horse in a round dumb or bad or unrealistic but there is nothing more realistic than that you never get a happy ending 'cause there's always more\nShow I guess until there is\nAn assay saying until there isn't he's looking at his mother's cough and you know his mother had told him earlier you were born broke and your bow jak horsemen there's no cure for that I'm so he he really had a bad relationship with her and when he says early in that clip\nThat um he ended our our fence because they can't imagine their parents anyway they wanted to [noise] um let me do you think about that\nWell you know I I I think a big part of this episode at a big part of the larger story of his relationship with his mother ... and his relationship with his parents is about\nThis idea of can you forgive people who have done nothing to earn your forgiveness and can you find peace with this woman who was so damaging to you but it's gone now and will never hurt you again and\nEven in the last years of her life was a frail scared woman herself and I'm really interested in that idea and that that question of\nYou know what do we owe the people in our lives as far as forgiveness goes and I think what's really interesting for me is the tension between that and to easy forgiveness of public figures right and and I want to believe\nOn a personal level level that nobody is era deem a ball or so far gone that they can't find a way to be better and be forgiven\nAnd how does that track with me\nWhere I also think some of these you know famous Garbage Men who've heard so many people in them so many terrible things should just go away forever and not be allowed any sort of redemption and I don't know how I'd reconcile those two ideas and and that tension for me\nHas been at least or a really interesting to explore over the course of this last season but also the show in general\nSo ...\nHave so much to apologize for [laughter] I'm One of the funny things that you've come up with for the the richer you un the writers is do we forgive you award you created a whole awards ceremony for people who\nNeed to apologize for saying would you describe the ... the ... ...\nBut we forgive you awards as presented on the show are awards\nThat celebrities gets when the industry has decided to forgive them so we have a a character we made up called Vance Wagner who who's gotten into some trouble in the past and he's being presented a we forgive you award from I think for time forgive the recipient Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd it one of the sad slash funny things about this comedy slash drama and the making of it\nIs when we first started writing the season\nLast year or last summer we were talking about how sad it is\nThat our industry so quick to forgive these you know really terrible men who do awful things and they're able to kind of like ... back into the limelight and we wanted to satirized at and then over the course of the last year it started to feel like oh wait a second maybe there's been like a huge sea change in our industry\nOf a sudden it feels like we're holding them accountable and we're we're kicking them out of the industry and then just in the last month or so it started to feel like oh no wait maybe we'll forgive me I don't know maybe this is sadly irrelevant a new\nI'm sort of feel like oh we're really you know on top of the last month of pop culture news\nWhen in fact we were describing this thing that's been happening for years and years\nWhat makes you think that people are being forgiving again\nWell uh it was announced that Mel Gibson is co writing and directing a new movie for Warner Brothers\nAnd I I don't know if we have we forgotten his anti Semitic remarks is homophobic remarks his threats against his domestic partner the allegations that he beat her is use of of racial slurs\nIn miss defies me in this area that we're in we're we're claiming to hold men accountable that it still feels like we are not\nYou know when we see K A stand up set a little ways back and got a standing ovation a there are reports that Garrison Keillor and Matt Lauer are planning their comebacks I think that there is\nWork that those men can be doing to better themselves and I would\nPersonally love to hear about it I Would be happy if they want to do come back and do an interview and reflect on their misdeeds and talk about what they've learned and then I think from there maybe we can you know think about their professional development and I feel like we're going about this backwards and it I found it tremendously upsetting\nMy guess is ...

jak horsemen which is now being shown on reruns on Comedy Central so watching the series especially like after the eulogy episode\nI would've thought that you were a bitter man who had a very troubled childhood reading about you a little bit my impression is that was not sell\nYour parents were involved with a Jewish culture your mother rented Jewish bookstore your father helped Russian Jewish immigrants in the U.S and tell us about the book store your mother used to have like what kind of what kind of books were there and did you read any of them\nAre so my mother on to a Jewish gifted in book store called Bob and Bob and it was kind of a hub of Jewish life in the bay area or or at least you know my section of the bay area Palo Alto and the surrounding area\nAnd so I really you know what I Would go and visit the store and I sit in the kids' section or sit at her desk and and and and leaf through the books and and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a Jewish state school um\nAfter a high school I went to college at bard where there are plenty of Jews I went down to New York where there are plenty of Jews it never felt\nA extraordinary or special to be Jewish I never once felt like a minority and the communities that I was in um\nShe would always bring home stuff from the store off and it was defective stuff that she couldn't sell so we had a lot of money that we're chips um we have we have a banner that we put up every Hanukkah that's as\nHappy Halloween because it's missing an and have the the misfit toys or Hanukkah um it it just felt very normal that to have a Jewish life\nUm and to be kind of a swimming in this stuff\nWith the disconnect between being told about anti Sam ... senators and living in this culture that was a majority Jewish culture\nA hundred percent it felt like a thing of the past it felt like oh the Holocaust happened\nUh and that was terrible but now we live in sophisticated [laughter] now you know now it's it's okay to be a Jew and you know there are people who still have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes um\nAnd it's really been a wakeup call in the last few years to feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country and they're they have a lot of power and there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments still floating around out there and doing a lot of damage\nUm and that's been very scary to me uh but also scary\nHow little I recognize it or was aware that it was happening\nUm especially big some for someone who\nYou know as a Jew you hear the story of a Holocaust over and over and over growing up and the story of the Holocaust is people didn't see it coming they were swimming in it and they thought it was a passing thing right there are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me\nWho are shocked when their own neighbors started you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing them and cutting off their beards\nAnd so it's it is a scary time for a lot of reasons and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAnd you know if actually one of the Jews control the media\nI guess I Am right um but even even that kind of joke or I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kinda feel like oh no there's people who believe that\nThey set up because there's people that look at and like I think yeah and I and I would\nSay a couple of years they'll be like oh yeah we do control the media is not hilarious um and now I think yes I Am a Jew and I have some power in the stories that I put out and I'm very glad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\nSo your mother and grandmother ran a bookstore you are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nYeah that's about I don't you remember if it was middle school or high school but somewhere around then\nSo it was a difficult for you to concentrate in long enough to to read books\nUm yes or sometimes\nYou know I I could always read books that I was interested in and some people can't even do that and I was lucky that I had a form of ADHD where if there is something that really interested me I I could focus and do it you know the problem is in school you have to focus on a lot of things that you're not interested in\nAnd there was a while where I wasn't diagnosed where it felt like something is wrong with me and no one quite knew what it felt like oh I'm just a troubled child I just don't behave\nAnd you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time that I took her pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid he's you know he loves making a scene he loves being the center of attention and I did enjoy sometimes being the center of attention ensure like any kid you know I loved it\nWeb streaming is made possible by states in hospice and a full

a funny joke I Would just say it's a ... you know whether or not it was disruptive or not because I\nI have I Want to say those things so I'm going to say it and I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and say this funny thing and when it was not okay\nI thought that was more of a symptom of being a comic then attention deficit disorder [laughter] well\nI think those things are related a little bit for me at least I'm ... I don't necessarily know the difference I mean you know the problem with ADHD and other a mental or or learning disorders is not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not\nOh you have this thing therefore you're this or we're going to give you this pill and you're going to stop doing this precisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas and it's hard to say yes am I a comedian because I have ADHD or do I have\nYou know comedians disease that was diagnosed as ADHD and and what are the overlaps and what does this mean I I still am not quite sure\nWhat what is TV like a safe space where are you where you can like unless yourself and television and be really comfortable like did you live more in the world of what you were consuming than the natural world and the reason why I ask that is that like that so many pop culture references\nAnd bow jak horsemen and some of them like just like whiz by you and it happened so quickly you can barely like catch some of them\nUm set made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when you were growing up\nYeah well TV made sense to me and you know there's a a correlation and causation chicken or egg conversation to have here but on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it right even if it was maybe an awkward situation maybe especially if it was an awkward situation there definitely\nWas a period in my life where I thought of the funny thing even if it was mean even if it was inappropriate if I thought it would get a laugh from an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this scene that I was living in\nFeel like the scenes but I was seeing on TV and that was a a real lesson that I had to learn\nUm and I think what's been helpful as being a writer and having an outlet and now if I Am in a situation I think of the funny thing\nI can write it down and say oh I'm going to hold onto this and all have a character say it later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment or if I think of a funny situation you know or wouldn't it be funnier awkward if I if I did this thing or if someone came in here and did this I can save and go you know why would I give us away for free in this moment I'll I'll get paid for by putting into the story later\nSo having those outlets has been tremendously helpful for me\n[noise] you know I'm thinking now the comedy central is is running low jak witches Netflix series now the comedy central it's raining it's starting with season one um what's that like for you because you and ... like some of the jokes and season one where\nNew life [laughter] cable\nYeah you know it's it's been interesting because we're we're actually editing some of the episodes down to you know add commercial breaks\nOr the right time for Comedy Central\nAnd you know we're obviously want them to keep their dignity as an up sort of television not edited out and even to important but as we are looking for cuts one of things I'm looking at is is this joke still funny to me or would this work without those moments and if it does sometimes we'll take those moments out\nUm but I also think look this is the show and\nIt has to do exist on its own terms and hopefully people you know as they have embraced the showing Netflix will embrace the show on Comedy Central and if there are flaws with it they will see those laws for what they are and you know we'll see what happens\nWhen it's been great to talk with you thank you so much\nIt is my pleasure thank you so much\nMean three WPN Len Nashville public radio Ninety One point five WTO ... in Ninety One point seven W.

queens of his uh and so we had enormous skill building middle class housing and she also specialized and\nInto a ... billion dollar empire that remained for the most part the dominant narrative that she sold certainly you know to make themselves a celebrity to gain a power and ultimately it's worthy Champaign bond very avoid\nTo win win the presidency and so this story really dissect that narrative think more than anything else offers readers now based on the actual facts um in based on the actual documents an entirely new financial narrative the forty for president\nWell let me re

and crack and David Barstow two of the three writers who reported just a couple of weeks ago on how a Donald Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches\nFrom his father and deconstruct the whole Donald Trump meth about how as a self\nMade millionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money Fred Trump Donald's father funnel to him and his other siblings and how they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man\nBy the time he was a teenager\nOkay so in addition to some of the tax games we talked about um ... made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that you got a million dollar loan from his father and help parlay that antennas\nInto his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump inlaws\n[noise] ah we were little document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans no one million uh in today's dollars of quits two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in direct wealth that we saw\nTransferred to Don and what we what we also saw what is important also is that in many cases um these were loans that were never repaired human who would take it\nLooking at one particular year was like every month\nHe's going back to dad and his barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks and then a million dollars it was just like a monthly run to do for Trump to get more money we saw especially the the flow of loans increase\nAs Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increase\nWhen she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream it went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then off being off to the races [noise]\nThese were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo so how did Donald Trump use the money that was alone from his father\nYeah he used the money for\nMany of his ventures the how Trump Tower um money that he got for for a Trump was used to support that it was used to support his ventures in Atlantic City\nAnd elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars\nIn debt and this is the time he not only are the banks hundreds of millions of dollars um he was in debt to his father was going to bother these very crucial times for more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and end up in debt and a lot of instances instead of making a fortune from his own investments\nCould also see that when his cell you know when he would fall down the safety net was there for Trump safety was there to catch them\nThere's one spooked just almost unbelievable moment in the store and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this is a time\nIn the you know the backend of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of companies are either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump had been there for him at every turn according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casinos that they're facing a debt payment\nAnd Fred Trump has a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casino chips and walk out without placing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money disappearing million dollars' worth of it was three and a half million dollars worth of casino trips\nAnd at this period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that weakens the\nAnd Donald Trump at this period has a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father's well centrally and do well and it was caught us all to the will is taken to Fred Trump's house in December Nineteen Ninety\nAnd Fred Trump immediately sees this caught us all as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire and potentially put at risk and Fred Trump immediately says now he freaks out and he make the call to his daughter who is a federal judge in the lawyer and\nA new caught us all within months is drafted that removes Donald is to Seoul executor for Trump's well inputs Donald and Robert Trump and Mary and Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new well is dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life\nAfter all his father has done for him that he makes this move to incredibly dramatic move and scarring to the family what he did\n[laughter] so what you're saying I think that at the end of ... life or toward the end of ...\nLife Donald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own good to help Donald Trump bail himself out and ...\n... of the sun that he had helped with so much money over so many years\n... what we know for sure is good for Trump perceived to this is an attempt to bring his um to Jane complete control over his state and potentially to use\nThe umpire for Trump doggedly impatient rebuild over many decades to use that empire as I'm potentially those collateral to help bail Donald Trump out of his own financial difficulties\nAnd I guess or New York times reporters David Barstow and

hundred progressive now that's progressive this\nIs fresh air let's get back to my interview with New York times reporters says and Craig and David Barstow who along with Russ Buettner published along investigative article this month about ... schemes to avoid paying taxes or transferring money from his real estate empire to Donald Trump\nMeasured in today's dollars Donald received about four hundred Thirteen million\nThen after ... died Donald Trump took the lead and decided they should sell off everything that Fred Trump still own at the time of his death why to Donald Trump make that decision\n[noise] so the interesting thing about that sale and it's something that we noticed again and again when we were doing our reporting was that\nFor a Trump very much wanted this empire to stay in the family um he had kept it together um through his whole life and he had hoped that after his death they would keep it and I I think what we can never really get into Donald Trump's mind as to why\nHe saw that in in two thousand and three there was a family meeting and they had regular family meeting softer for Trump died they would hand out checks you know for Trump's buildings were very profitable and they would meet every few months um to get an update on the status of the empire and to get a chalk\nAnd then in two thousand and three at one of these meetings Donald Trump announced that it was time to sell\nAnd quickly assembled a private sale to a developer in New York for almost all of it and it was sold you know give or take a few buildings in one sale for just under eight hundred million dollars\nSo that the the uh buildings that were sold all of those buildings ... own at this time of his death out that it also include all the buildings that had been transferred from Fred Trump to the children\nThey included both of buildings that had been transferred down the one city owned it was it was pretty much as ... empire and it sold 'em you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York developer name or be shown in them\nHundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learn through the ... the documents that we went through that thought sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars then what the banks would value at out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that dot empire um was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much less\nSo it wasn't like the ... century that down Donald Trump made it definitely wasn't just the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the IRS\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely got away with that so it's true that the IRS actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe describe in the story and in fact the IRS ours did push back some and especially on the lower valuations they placed on buildings and made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning to ... million more bucks\nOn that return but the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got\nAn agency that is pretty over matched overworked an auditor who can walk into a session and can extract a few million dollars that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy families you hire the most expensive legal and accounting helping who engage\nIn these very sophisticated maneuvers to to avoid or evade taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more at the request of an auditor\nThere looking though at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more meanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of\nSimply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at just going to state tax returns\n[noise] um so then I'm going to ask you to choose either the art video the art on the comeback or The Apprentice and tell us all is actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the show based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals\nOn public\nI'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David or the comeback [laughter] go for it [noise] [noise]\nAh well said he publishes the art of the come back in Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this story of his sort of\nYou know pulling himself up I'm Out of the ... of his casino collapse and through shows grit and determination and Wylie negotiating skills getting himself back on his feet well within a few weeks of the publication of this book\nSo happens to coincide with the time when he actually took possession of one quarter of his father's\nReal estate empire through one of these very elaborate tax schemes that we describe in the store it\nSo at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of Kevin himself off the map it actually cause it's perfectly with the moment when he's just taken possession of twenty five percent\nOf this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way not a word of that made its way into the book the art of a comeback\nAlso thinking of immediately uh the\nOf the song money money money money that happened in two thousand and four\nI'm right as the sale had gone through the the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Fred Trump and yet when you watch that opening scene it's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane is there that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene that for a Trump built and paid for\n[noise] I'm Wondering how\nYou feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the mess of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and has great negotiating deal making\nAbilities [noise]\nAnd so many people still believe the mess and Donald Trump is still putting forward than that it's interesting when I think about that I think you have to sort of go back to that idea\nThat you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stocked\nAnd I think that we've reset thought I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken I think a good first stop in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe what I think the the power of the story is\nYou know I think the whole careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents off and it gets really hard to refute the story um it's harder for you because it's absolutely true in the documents are there and in a lot of them are the source documents with the Trump family themselves [noise]\nUm but I think it will take time for this just sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um\nI think it's going to happen so you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times those basically sealed off to everybody except that the three reporters working on\nThis story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access knew were locked up in this room um who cleaned it allowed to go [laughter] we uh we did not have a cleaner I admit I have a whole bunch of this I did come in one day with a\nWith a little vacuum and and [laughter] [laughter] but we uh yeah it was just the three of us for a year um with ah yeah it's a pretty messy [laughter] I don't go ...\nAnd that'll costs are phobic the item imagine [laughter] other people know why you were locked up in this room [noise]\nUm actually if people knew our our editors new but I think there was a lot of sort of a mystery mystery surrounding it we are kind of kept to ourselves and uh yeah it was it was difficult everybody you know these people keep asking you what you're up to and [noise] um but we uh we tried to keep a lid on it as best we could\nWell thank you for your reporting and thank you for telling us about it Suzanne ...
