technology we have today\nAnd that makes the successful moon landing even more remarkable my guess ... directed the new movie the first man based on Neil Armstrong's life in the Nineteen sixties when he was an astronaut and took incredible risks to test new spacecraft and fly to them or\nI'm sharing is played by Ryan Gosling who also start in the movie musical Lala land which does al wrote and directed to do when the best director Oscar for that film he also wrote and directed whiplash\nLet's start with a scene from first man astronaut Neil Armstrong my Collins and Buzz Aldrin played by Cory stall are seated together at a table at a press conference in July Nineteen sixty nine taking questions from reporters before embarking on their Apollo eleven mission to the moon Neil\nIf it does turn out you'll go down in history will cut us off do you have about that when the thought it to a guy suppose that flight successful we're planning on that flight being successful uh [noise] I I just

choices they force you\nDamien says oh welcome back to fresh air and congratulations on first man you know my first reaction when I heard you're going to make a film about Neil Armstrong and the moonwalk was what [laughter] why would someone who's so absorbed in movies and jazz and musicals make a movie about ... an astronaut in space\nI Love the film but I was wondering if like when you were offered the chance to make this film how did you see yourself being the right fit with it\n[noise] ah well you know I I myself I think had the the same sort of initial ah you know it it didn't really line up with the sort of films I'd been making art or kind of had in my mind but\nI think after thinking about it for a little bit and and during the region mansions are incredible books the movie is based on it struck me as a story about dreams and uh and the cost of priests\nWe used a full scale replicas of these capsules there were the you know sort of exactly the same size all the details were\nExactly the same or production designer an ... an incredible job sort of rebuilding these things\nAnd we'd we would mount the you know we wouldn't fly them into space but we would mount them on the most control systems gambles that basically wouldn't move and rock back and forth\nQuite violently if we needed them to ah and we would set those up against a giant Eli D screens so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see off the set you look out the window you see space imagery instead of you know film equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nYou see the earth's spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had to kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you get this kind of strobe you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors in for you know their body cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know that was kind of feeling if we can feel it onset if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to a to give that sense then\nThen the audience is gonna feel at the actors are gonna be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be real shaking will be real even some of the terrible the real the knowledge that will be real and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight till uh Ryan Gosling isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that it looks real answer that he's really experiencing all of the a disservice\nDoes it go jostling um all of this\nYes you know we didn't literally a spin rind in the capsule at you know several rotations per second as happened to a Neal and ... you know uh [laughter] but we a ride and I both wanted to try and make it as physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody throw up his heart and question [laughter] did it not not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because uh he started to uh apparently started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone and so we had to\nSay what did we ain't getting jostled from where we\nHad to take a we had to take a moment\nNo he got his actually all very a a word for a second or his rise the type of actor who really just you know a really wants to do as much with himself as as you can ... so I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you arrest and uh you know have you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine but\nI think it's a testament to rhyme that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting ...\nAnother thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is ... I mean you're hearing alarms go off in hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet but I guess at times like this is not quite at all inside the space capsule or at least in less than\n... a little bit about that sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about\nYeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was put in space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space I'm In juxtaposition with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know uh this is a hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of ah making its way up there so something like a\nLike the spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we wanted to kind of a try to hit an emotional reality for that uh in the sense that we sort of way to augment the sounds you'd actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually remind audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks\nA little groans and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire to just whenever possible remind them that this is\nThis was a piece by piece a hand built machine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts are something that are just delivered from the future you know their piece together by rabbits by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon flight\nMassive puts together a press state meant about the deaths of the men on a flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\n... um and still you know they basically sending astronauts off into space hoping that land on the moon but if they don't ask don't guess they download NASA's preparing you know basically a eulogy and press release eulogy um get get that actually happened\nYeah I mean you can find the uh ... you know you can search it online in a van of moving disaster um and ah what sort of the you know the the sort of had it on the copy a and so the sheet of paper you see a you see a gearing Heinz who plays ... movie holding his is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh\nWeb streaming is made possible by the CIA launch a lawn show room showcasing antiques accessories and the ancient motor in line for the contemporary home on the Web ... antiques dot com or six one five seven eight zero twenty six hundred\nBut in a way to capture relates in such a poetic beautiful way the willingness to sacrifice and and this kind of reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speech says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the er at the moon will know that there is some part of another world that is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy in in reading that knowing what the intended that speech was\nBut yet also at the same time this incredible kind of hope and that sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what do you sort of a risky costly brave ventures could maybe do for for the country and for humanity\nI was wondering if the astronaut new let's Neil Armstrong knew that NASA was riding his obituary just in case\nYou know I I um I don't know that for sure I think you know one fascinating thing about Neal and and his colleagues was just how close to death they\nA live their lives and and seemed willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilots were astronaut you know it's something that families are all over the country and all over the world\nConversations that they sometimes have to have a any sort of service for country off involves you know at least that risk and it's it's something I think it's helpful to to remind people up\nI guess just ... he directed the new film first man and wrote and directed la la land and whiplash we'll talk more after a

[noise]\nI Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I I think there's music he actually brought with him to play after the space landing in my right about that\nThis is music he plays on the way to the moon I think is what you're referring yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah okay yeah so it's it's a ...\nPiece called lunar Rhapsody yep and when I find really interesting about that is is that you know this comes under the category about of of China that's been described as exotic uh but you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way\nWith all due respect to Neil Armstrong like like Hollywood style celestial voices Sarah I'm In this incredibly like Florida piano if it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty shocking and having that kind of transcendent experience I was like\nBeing on your ... to the moon and playing like really corny [laughter]\nAny version of what you know lunar might be it just strikes me as so it just so strange and I as somebody in the I Know how interested you are in music and how like you play music so how did it strike you know\nWas a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually sing the Ryan himself it stumbled on a you mentioned in Japan since book\nThat Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a so Florida or you know or so little known there were also more famous tracts of music that uh that Neal and some of the other astronauts play during the course of their mission they played a piece for about divorce shock and\nAwe and whatnot but this you know strange little less Baxter tune a was something that was actually a Neal and Janet listens to together that they loved together when they were young and love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nA in space and as I learned someone who was you know who was having a you know going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level\nPlay distracted really no one\nListening knowing much control certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real can actually do except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know tiny space and and the sort of cause most to uh\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nI think why don't

which Neil Armstrong played on the way to the moon and accused in the new movie first man which has directed by ... who also directed la la la land and ready to and also wrote and directed whiplash [noise] um and I found remarkable was that\nYou were working\nOn love and land before first man but a lot of land wasn't turnaround sound like you hadn't really be done shooting it right\nYeah I I first met Ryan or to talk to him about first men are and ah so you know that that was you know a few years until ... kinda languishing you know life is sort of you know just\nA a you know [noise]\nI've been trying to get a made for a while and with no success in and a thrill out of stops and starts in and uh and during that time I er I made whiplash and then during the day after that I was given this book a first manned by Jim Hansen and\nFell in love with that and and and went to Ryan and said hey would you be interested in playing Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and oh by the way also if you're a you're into musicals you have a musical script and I said oh yeah you like musicals so yeah I Love Gene Kelly and\nWe talked about Gene Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first manned a lot of land\nBut as soon as I like it was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and uh we jumped right into this\nSo I'm finally what brings you must joined the most anxiety and doing a movie like first man which there's so much technical stuff you have to deal you know it's like sound effects and reproducing um space capsules in space flight and creating like\nRead like as in real ... miniature as it's it's it's\nYou know ... is a complex film but that's like crazy I see in the camera work and the dreamy sequences this is like really difficult in a in a whole other level [noise]\nI mean I I think everything you describe gave me a lot of a lot of anxiety a lot of sleepless nights I'm I think even more than that you know is it was a little bit the the responsibility the weight of history a and I think particularly knowing that a A N and Ryan has said something very similar to a you know in that Neal's kids\nUh all through the making of it and and helping us get it right up and knowing that at the end of the day this was a film that they were a going to see and they weren't going to see a historical figure on screen they were going to see their mom and their dad or they were gonna see themselves they're going to see their family life\nIt it was just to kind of responsibility that certainly I hadn't felt before as a filmmaker um and I think it was a it was a good fire you know sort of lit a fire under myself and all of us to just go that that much

is now\n\nI don't think that there's a national understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is I think that um people who are in line at about this issue I understand that it doesn't have to include penetration um but I think that\nPart of why good part of the country is in line with Trump on this issue is that we don't have a national definition\n[noise] so um you also say that the definition of consent is being redefined and the slogan used to be no means no but now at the yes means yes what's the difference between no means no and yes means yes\nThere is a huge difference something like yes means yes is okay until you get some sort of yes you don't really have permission to talk to somebody now\nA yes you know in the college definition could be verbal or it could be um they like to call it acts unmistakable in their meaning which I suppose means I'm mon are grown or pulling off clothes etcetera and from ...\nDidn't agree with this at the outset but I came convinced that this is a really good standard for young people and perhaps for older people as well certainly anybody who's\nIn a workplace who might have a crush on somebody else you know you got to ask a question 'cause you could be misinterpreting signals people do that all the time so why were you\nResistant to this yes means yes standard and why did you change your mind\nWell I'm an adult you know I'm In my forties and I know that that's not the way sex usually happens means sex is something that is ... book and that's kind of energy between people and more exciting in some ways when it's like that\nYou know we see a lot of young people who are having sex with people that they met on dating apps they barely know these people home that's part of the\n... part of the charge but and I I'm not so doctrinaire that I think that you should have to say yes to each escalating base or sexual act which is the way a lot of people think of yes means yes but I Do think that the question is not that big a deal\nI'm In Gen x we had the question you know should I get a condom which was always\nKind of a a question about protection but it was really a permission question I'm there really has to be an extra question\n... you read that the strongest argument for affirmative consent for yes means yes is that it frees girls from the cage of socialized politeness one you mean\nWell one of the complexities of sexual assault is that girls don't always saying no um they certainly don't say it that way no get away from me I'm pushing you away right they say well\nMaybe another time uh I don't think I Want to do this tonight until band up\nGiving up um you know some of the most interesting work that's being done now in terms of trying to\nFix this problem is about girls understanding the signals from people who might in Trenton them harm and removing themselves from the room before anything actually happens because people understand once they're in the room it's really hard to get out well\nYou know the thing about yes means yes there's a lot of people say oh that's so awkward to kind of have these like\nRules like almost like a questionnaire like I authorized huge too like you know take off my shirt or whatever [noise] um but it's equally awkward I think for the woman to be in a place where the man is making all these advances\nAnd you have to say no no no stop no I really mean stop no okay I'll leave no it just put the responsibility on her and it makes it like really awkward\nAnd it's not a shared awkwardness it's like one person having the full burden of the awkwardness\nExactly so this is a little dorky okay ... ... it definitely changes things I mean I went to a dance party like to go out and dance it may\nRecently you know guys try to come up and downs with you and you try to get away and this guy came up and he was about to put his arm around me and then he said is it okay if I put my arm around here and I said no\n[laughter] no I mean his arm around me and he said oh yeah I get it consent I'm I totally get it I understand I'm Glad I asked was that the first time that happens here\nThat was definitely the first time in fact it up for it to be I mean I ...\nIntended me harm but I didn't want his arm around me I had no interest in him I married um I was just there with my girlfriends having a good night and dancing so I think that's a great thing to have that happen and to have young girls who\nTruly a\nYou know are in night clubs or at dance parties a lot understand like this is my body I own at people have to ask permission to
