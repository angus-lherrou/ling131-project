owned me as he owned all those I Lived among not only our lives but also our deaths and that pleased him too much\nReaders will naturally anticipate that a tale of brutalities small moments of grace and for did escape attempts will follow except that's not quite what happens in short order to escape attempts here are successful\nWash breaks away from that plantation via hot air balloon no less and se ... also breaks away in her case leaving behind the confines of the conventional historical novel\nAnd transporting readers into the guinea rounds of romantic era travelogue and scientific exploration\nIn Washington Black ... has created a wonder of an adventure story powered by the helium of fantasy but also by the tender sensibility of its aspiring young hero wash black\nLet's backtrack a second to that opening scene at the plantation\nThe new master is not the only white men who steps down from that carriage his younger brother Christopher wild nicknamed pitch also all lights\nHe turns out to be a rather decent man of science who's brought along the materials to assemble what he calls a cloud cutter a hot air balloon attached to a boat like gone to law\nPitch in lifts wash as his assistant teaching him to read and in the process discovering that wash possesses a skill for executing detailed scientific drawings\nAcross the color line the to strike up a kind of friendship\nSo much so that when it seems likely that wash will be killed in wrongful retaliation for the death of a white visitor to the plantation\nTeach fires up the gas canister cuts the ropes that tether the cloud cover ... earth and together the to ascend into attempt pest you as nighttime sky\nI began to cry recalls wash thinking of this extraordinary moment the air group colder crept in\nOh was shadow red light storm fire and frenzy and up we went into the eye of it untouched miraculous\nIf only that escape or the soaring conclusion to wash his adventures not just the beginning\nBut inevitably the friends that attempt to float above the consequences of race springs a leak and their balloon comes crashing down too hard historical realities\nA multitude of plot twists in Sioux taking first washing pitch and then wash alone to the Arctic Nova Scotia London and even to the bottom of the sea\nCertainly much of the pleasure of reading Washington Black derives from ... ingenious storytelling gifts but her novel is more than just a boy in bobble\nWashes weighted down throughout his travels by the burden some question of identity for one thing he can never predict how other characters whether they be black or white will see him\nThe prize scientific education he received from th elevates wash but also makes him a curiosity much like the solitary little orange octopus he captures on his underwater dive to later exhibits\nWash resolutely places his faith in science to advance human enlightenment but midway through the novel he experiences a harsh awakening I had long scenes science is the great equalizer watch says no\nMatter one's race or sex or faith there were facts in the world waiting to be discovered how little thought I'd give in to the ways in which it might be corrupted by human beings\nWashington Black is an unconventional and often touching novel about the search for transcendence above categories as she tries to do for her hero

Hi I'm really pleased to be here\nUm the plantation of your novels in Barbados as I gather you do a lot of research for your work um did you find that plantations in Barbados were much different than the ones in the United states\nYou know I'm not I'm\nNot a ... a full blown historian but you know given my readings from my sense of things that seems so life on plantations in the Caribbean was much more much more brutal [noise]\nThis is kind of an ironic thing to say but the sense of preservation of of um of one's workers ah you know everywhere expendable so the cruelty was a you know the death rate was much higher\nThe ah the conditions in circumstances of slaves lives were much more dire and I'm ... you know quite horrific to have to to do that research but some very important for me to show what that was like\nThe main character booked a George Washington black who goes by the nickname wash\nDay he gets a call to go serve the that the main house for dinner which is a terrifying prospect\nUm but the masters brother is their name is Christopher wild it goes by church there's a lotta nicknames and uh he's a naturalist and he's building a hot air balloon and he requested washed because assistant mainly just because he's like the right weight he's as for ... for the balloon\nUm and it's a moment the changes washes live forever because a bond forms between him and this was white man church\nUm and teach will eventually help wash a skate but it's such an arbitrary moment in such an arbitrary change in this and this boy's life and not arbitrariness forever hearts wash\nChristopher does choose Washington because he sees him as\nBeing helpful to his experiment and that he is you know precisely the right weight a demand his arrows ... which is you know kind of a cruelty and itself to to look at somebody and I think it out of them but then Washington really um surprises him\nWith his natural gifts like he has no\nNo idea you know that this this young man it's just completely [noise] you just don't naturally a gifted at a drawing and um he has a a good sense for 'em or an article methodologies and and all of this he really comes into his own uh under ...\nBought some you know there is that sense and part of what I was trying to suggest to explore in ... character\nIs you know although he's an extremely liberal minded men for his time ah you know there are limits to his to his thinking that he is in a lot of ways still tethered by a certain ideas and and notions a\nOf his era you know he's an abolitionist so he truly has a very general belief in the rights of man it's kind of a prescribed belief but in terms of applying this personally to people it's a it's a little bit more difficult for him\nAnd his argument for trying to end slavery is that slavery won't allow people to get them to have them if they allow such cruelty\nYeah that's one of his his main um ideas about it and you know this is central to his a philosophy or adult life but you know having said that he somebody who very much does feel a great affection or comes to the great affection for Washington and so\nThere's that dichotomy in his personality that so interesting to me\nSo they'll wash the skates from slavery and becomes a free man he not free from the time he lives on him you know it was haunted by his time on the plantation and I think one of the points\nYou're getting up in the book is how much freedom is available to someone born into slavery and also how fear that people complicit in ... the slave economy\nYeah exactly I think that son teach for instance\nLikes to believe that because he has these in light and ideas that he is and because he's actually trying to do something to end slavery itself you know I think he has a sense of themselves as being quite a moral person and", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "15"}
