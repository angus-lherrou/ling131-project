editor for Rolling Stone where he's written for more than thirty five years to Curtis new read and considered him a friend although not a close one\nAs part of his research your Curtis interviewed many people read new including his first two wives knew read cofounded a velvet underground which he played with from Nineteen sixty four to Nineteen Seventy\nThe band was initially managed by Andy Warhol and was part of Warhol seen well many bands of the time or singing about peace love and who are losing the Gen x Lou Reed was writing songs about heroin street hustler and transcripts of sexuality he continued in that direction as a solo artist\nBut he also wrote sons that had a spiritual quality to Curtis says other than Bob Dylan the Beatles and James Brown no one has exerted as great an influence on popular music as Reid has\nRe die of liver disease five years ago at the age of Seventy one\nTo Curtis says he wouldn't have written this book while Reid was alive quote\nThis book does not at all times see Lou the way he wanted to see himself\nAspects of his sex life his drug use and is cruelty that it came to be embarrassed about our discussed here in detail as our his generosity and his kindness his talent his vision and his genius unquote\nWe recorded the interview last November when the book was first published and started with the sun heroin from the velvet underground first album\n\n\nI\n\n\n\n\n\nTry\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\nBut you also write don't once when we came home from college\nThat he was basically like non functional\nAnd his parents who are concerned that he was in a terribly deep depression the doctor said you know he might have schizophrenia am I getting this right yes and that that that that that also figure into\nThe the shock treatments and his sister tells you oh our parents were were very liberal and they weren't homophobic so it wasn't about their fear of him being gay but I was thinking like everybody was homophobic then\nWell that's right and that's the thing I don't think they were more homo phobic than that you know they were just kind of a conventional suburban couple Louis bringing into their life everything that they were supposed to not have to deal with any more after having left the city there was a vision of the suburbs when they moved and the Nineteen fifties as this kind of\n... of peace and you know lose various outrages under which they would certainly have filed a you know who's going to go to bars and acting out\nAs a gay person you know we're elements of that but it wasn't like we're going to make him straight you know I don't I just don't think that was part of it\nIt will eventually you mention gay bars and and him being gay but he's also with a lot of girls at the time I well\nYeah that's true and that there are people I mean this was a really I mean it's a very it's an issue very much at the moment interestingly because I'm kind of gone around the block\nSee anything he was on like flu it in his actual alley yeah\nI mean one of his girlfriend's a describes him as inter and [laughter] it's a kind of interesting usage I think you know those\nAnd but I've had gay friends gay male friends like write to me and say you know you describe this element of loop but he was really gay\nAnd the other day I got one of those and it was you know as a pretty stern email that you know made me think about what I had written I had lunch with one of his former girlfriends she was saying look there's no way Louis gauge\nHis sexuality with something I think you know as you gauge the addict you so you wanted to see you know and I think Louis kind of hoping to go in wherever that was\nAnd I think everybody had a language for it then\nWell that's right they didn't that language didn't exist [noise]\nYes I did want a guy I just didn't want to say one thing about his parents because you know there really was this sense you know after the shock treatments of of lose never forgiving them for that\nBut when ... left the velvet underground he went back and lived with his family I have a price on Iran I ... yeah you know and and ah\nI once said you know his first wife was talking about Lou being cheap introducing a guide you ever want to spend money we were living in these all these small places he would never ask his father for money and at that point in my research I I took loose story as you know the truth\nAnd I just said well with his father ever given their money as she said of course he was giving them money\nYou know if it's anything for you know he will be you know he was the oldest son and his Jewish family and\nYou know his father was a very conventional man who would have loved to have a son that wanted to take over his accounting business you know he didn't get that he couldn't get around you know a lot of what\nLose life and you know even his art was like but you know on the other hand whatever Lou needed anything he was there and you know that was one of the complexity flu dedicated his book of lyrics to his parents and his sister\nYou know a ... you know it wasn't as simple as a\nYou know as it might initially seem\nAnother thing that really nice like amazed me\nA reading about this in your book is that after the velvet underground split up and he went on his own he didn't have any money not set so that he got a job working for his father hyping up in his father's accounting office yes they're cutting trans grass have is that [laughter]\nI Try to let it they don't have any I always see which say 'cause you know well my mother always said you know like a you know you should have something to fall back on and kind of typing was not for me\nUm you know I think it was just a way to buy time and make money and if they were already ... um yeah exactly yeah somebody told me a story I wasn't able to confirm this but that the night Lou quit the velvet underground you know after a show at max is Kansas City\nUm that his parents were waiting for him in the car to drive and back to Long Island I mean I could never get confirmed but it's certainly possible and he certainly did move back there immediately and you know they kind of relationship it was a\nYou know along with a you know this kind of you know festering anger that Lou felt him and he would never meet with them without his sister being there he always refer to them by their first names that was never like mom and dad\nUm and you know he certainly would characterize them in song you know in ways that you know must have made their skin crawl but ah yeah but in real life you you know got along with them fairly well so early\nIn um the velvet underground period\nThey team up with Andy Warhol like Andy Warhol brings them under his wing he wants he wants to have a man she I'm kind of have yet to kind of expand his his his his reach\n'em and what work and what didn't work about that connection with Warhol what were they went didn't work for ... lead\nUm yeah ... ... or ... Andy wanted a band in the same way you know it was just like oh you know movies are getting popular you know I'm just going to make some movies now and you know it sounds like we should have a bad year rock and roll is getting to be a thing and\nSo they found the villain underground um you know through some you know on the artists who had gone to see them and thought they might work for him to\nUm you know a Andy Warhol and Paul Marcy his car ride right hand man at the factory their studio decided that the the velvet underground we're kind of too boring looking\nSo they got Nico yeah who was a German model an actress and soon to be finger too young to be their lead singer Lewis not crazy about that but I think he felt like Warhol was going to bring 'em a degree of disability\nThat was good it was important and that he would just go along with the TV limited knee goes participation as much as he could you know um she only sign of you know a few songs\nOr the band was pointedly called the velvet underground and Nico you know like that is she's not a member of the band and as soon as he could have gotten to recheck Nico out of the band as well after having an affair with her well that's very true [laughter] ... it was you know part of those times\nUm and that was a year so that was one of the issues with Warhol a Warhol was great because you know back then you know I was a kid in New York around that time where I was in the newspapers all the time they're not\n... you know not art critics reading about it although that too but it's just like a this crazy guy you know he thinks they're Campbell Soup cans or art and you went to this party the other day I mean every day was in the newspaper so whatever he did got attention\nAnd uh you know Lou took advantage of that but that also hurt the velvet underground in that\nYou know rock and roll certainly back that was a pretty Ernest thing and the I wore whoa seemed like a put on like a joke oh this is like an Andy Warhol version of a bat and you know for for people who do you how to turn them yet you don't hurt our amazing they are so\nYou know I think eventually like once they made you know certainly the first album and we're in the process of making the second one I think\nLou felt All right we've kind of established a baseline here now and he's got to go I you know this needs to be a more professional operation and you know there's no way out of the world was you know a rock and roll manager of you know any note\nMy guess is Anthony the Kurdish the author of the book Lou Reed uh life it's just been published in paperback after a break we'll talk\nAbout ... relationships with women including his wives and his trans partner Rachel I'm Terry Gross and the expression [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur family foundation supports WHYY fresh air and its commitment to sharing ideas enter encouraging meaningful conversation support for NPR comes from this station and from Amazon Prime video with the Romanoff\nStarring Diane Lane snow all widely Christina Hendricks into Andrew around new episode every Friday on prime video and from tire Iraq with more than\nFive hundred tire models from twenty to manufacturers and an online tool for finding tires based on vehicle needs budget and brand tire rock dot com helping drivers find deliver install [noise]\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Anthony ... Curtis he's written a new book about Lou Reed at a new biography called Lou Reed life\nLiberate second solo album after the velvet underground broke up a transformer which produced by David Bowie and you know always of course famous for all of his you know persona as and for his sexual fluidity what impact did working with David Bowie have on the lead in terms of\nHis self image and his persona\nWell you know Lou how complicated feelings about that um you know at the time it was a big opportunity I mean David Bowie was kind of the you know the coming thing and uh you know bully you [laughter] you know\nAs with flu like there was a very conventional aspect of but we I mean much as he was a boundary breaker he always you know kind of respected his elder CEO and and the people who had an important influence on him and Lou Reed was right at the top of that list\nAnd so he you know ... offered to produce transformer and restored\nYou know lose standing after the velvet underground and creating\nUm they'll walk on the wall side was on that record um [noise] you know so little of course you know once you got to hit that he desperately wanted you know kind of came to resented and you know thought of it as um you know just to kind of pop song and why do people sort of reduced me too that\nUh but at the time that he needed it he really needed it and he really wanted it and I'm ... and ... guitar player ... who co produced that album with a with with David\nA date created that song and also you know of other beautiful songs like you know perfect day and satellite of love that are that are on that record and uh you know made it such a you know such a significant album for Lu\nWho want to walk on the ... from that album and\nUm this was his only real like radio hit and it was a big hand I'm In the sun the lyrics are inspired by some other trans women he knew from Andy Warhol was a factory so so let's hear it and then we'll talk about [noise]\n\nHolly came from Miami ... [noise] hitchhiked way across the U.S they loved her eyebrows on the way to shave their legs and then he was uh she she says the they\nTake a walk in the wild and said hey honey ... [noise]\n\n... from out of the island\nThat's read walk on the wild signing his album transformer which was produced with David Bowie\nI'm so that so that was actually a head friendly but it's not architects from your book like this attack he wanted to hit so badly finally has run and he sounds like he was actually kind of ambivalent about it\nWell that's you know there were you know he was pulled back and forth by you know his desire you know look Lou Reed grew up in an era where there was no I mean the velvet underground sort of created this you know where it was possible here to be a rock band that have credibility and not have hits before that you either had hits or you went home\nYou know more than more gone yeah yeah\nPrecisely and even if you did have hits you know you got a year or two and then you went home but\nUm you know for Lu so Lu I mean I learned that um ethics kind of in his DNA\nAh but at the same time you know he saw himself as an artist and he saw himself as want us to do serious things and and take left turns and you know go in New directions and so the degree to which you\nKnow the record companies like oh okay great we've got to hit like now let's do take another walk on the wall side or walk on the website again and that kind of irritated him and you know of course he made Berlin which at the time was vilified\nA you know later to be you know resurrected and and uh I'd lie on the highest but you know at the time it came out it was regarded as a you know just an outrage and crazy move because it was you know such a a harsh and depressing record 'em [noise]\nSo you know he would turn on himself you know he would he would do whatever he needed to do\nTo to restore his standing once we have destroyed it stand you know because the next thing was rock and roll animal which was you know a big FM radio record of a big success at a big seller was alive album at a good one [noise] um yeah but then after Lou made that you know a record or two later remade metal\nA career as just an hour of just you know death in a guitar feedback you know it was again a gesture that was unsinkable before Lou did it and I'm\nJust I like I never wanted he wanted to have his music reach people and be loved and be popular but at the same time he distressed and that and wants to be like outside the mainstream and outside of that kind of acceptance\nExactly and it's almost as if he wanted to punish people for like [laughter] honestly I mean I think that was I think that was an element of it mhm mhm [noise] um so I'm ... and his album St hassle you you say that that album basically ended the period of his life\nWhere he describes himself as gay what what changed [noise] um well one\nThing was the end of his relationship with Rachel which was a huge it's documented quite movingly or in the song street hustler part call slip away where you know he says you know she took the the rings right off my fingers and\nYou know he in an interview on you know at that time you know said you know that was real she did that I mean essentially saying like Rachel you stole whatever jewelry was around and took off and [noise]\nUm I think they had been falling apart from lots of\nLots of theorize about why that is in some sense of\nI'm Rachel want me to make a transition that she was taking hormones whether Lew did or did not approve of that but one thing that happened was Lu met\nI'm Sylvia morale is sue became his second wife and you know began moving more into that relationship and getting serious and that was\nUm [noise] you know over the course of two or three years Lu got clean\nA got straight\nAnd um and his gay life became something that\nI mean he's still honored in certain ways a song like Halloween parade or a you know there would be references to it but he would never speak of himself as gay after that you know I think he had very complicated feelings about his um become a sexual life\nAnd even if he was out there as anybody could be he also turned on it and are\nOften not with that you know that much um\n[noise] bitterness but uh but still we would never discuss it\n[noise] you know so I I Want to play a different accept at St ... the ... not to slip away part that you referred to sure where the part that's about somebody overdosing\nUm and the person narrating the story is like so called just so indifferent about it it's almost upsetting to listen to you but it's it's yeah it's great music and it's great writing [noise]\nUm so there's the middle part [laughter] a a street hassle joined us anything about this this part\nYeah I'm Lewis drawing on the story of a a guy who used to be around the factory he was found dead\nOr industry or has been thought to be kind of that it was hit by a car that mean that was the official story the unofficial story that was that he had died of a heroin overdose in somebody's apartment and they dragged him out onto the street and just left him by the docks\nI'm as if he had you know had an accident of some kind\nI'm Lou turns that male character into a female character and then you know describes the guy who is the host of the party 'em urging\nGet just girls body out of his apartment [noise]\nLet's hear it this is Lou Reed [noise]\n\nYou know in Libya weaving in and it really was nice talking and I really wish that there was a little more time to speak\nBut you know can be handled trying to explain to plead so today I was there all the guys and and it's not like we see them but there was this new one could do and it was made you know I Would have been the first\nWoman soon during that live within the University of choosing majors\nA way that's really some you teen moms and I would you be moved here from the girl\nIt's either the minister's words and says I don't have to choose I get\nA loan and I knew that they know in a tree to his mind your brand new Orleans last being just lay around the yard is
