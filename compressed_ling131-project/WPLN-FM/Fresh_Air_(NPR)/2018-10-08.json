injuries and drawings are collected in the new book the flame his son my guest Adam Cohen wrote the forward\nAnd I'm also produced the album his father recorded shortly before his death called you want a darker\nAnd him as a singer and songwriter who's album like a man when gold in Canada and twenty twelve he was born in Montreal and Nineteen Seventy two enemy is going to talk with us about Leonard Cohen as a writer performer and father and tell us about working closely with his father in the final year of his life\nSongwriters have achieved the selecting reverence and despair his it crashed into beauty and his knowledge of broken is there it's informed by Judaism his practice of Zen Buddhism and his doubt\nSome of his many well known sounds include Suzanne selling Marianne famously raincoat Chelsea hotel number two everybody knows power ups on I'm your man and of course his best known most frequently recorded and performed song hallelujah\nAdam Cohen welcome to fresh air I just want to start by saying I Love your father's music I left his writing\nAnd I feel privileged to have had the chance to hear him in concert and to talk with him on her show and I'm grateful for the chance to talk with you today and thank you for being here when I interviewed your father and two thousand six after the publication of a book of his bones and songs he\nAsked to read a poem that he'd just written that hadn't yet been published but it is now published in his new book the plane so I thought it would be a perfect way to start with your father's reading of that home a street or from our two thousand six interview\nI used to be your favorite drunk good for one more laugh\nThen we both right out of luck unlock was all we had\nYou put on the uniform to fight the civil war I tried to join but no one like the side I'm fighting for\nSo let's drink too when it's over and let's bring to when we meet all be waiting on this corner where they're used to be a street\nIt wasn't all that easy when you up and walked away\nBut all the little story for another rainy day I Know your burdens have videos you will it through the night to ... says it's empty but that doesn't mean it's lived\nSo that strength to when it's over unless strength to when we meet all be standing on this corner where they're used to be a street\nView left me with the dishes and a baby in the bath\nOf his spine and it involved an incredible monastic effort on his part to [noise]\nTo be present and to deliver the way he did but\nThere's something about his work in general not just on the last to help them but in this book and in general you she she invites you into your own inner life because he takes the inner life seriously\nHe's not like one of these contemporaries I won't mention any names but there are many wonderful contemporaries of his who have in my estimation become misspell jacks there to sell jacks because there's somehow they succumb to the temptation of going back into their older catalog\nAnd their regurgitate things whereas this man was speaking from the very Ron that he found himself\nAt in life well\nLet me re introduce you if you're just joining us my guest is Adam Cohen and he's the son of Leonard Cohen and now there's a new collection of Leonard cons final lyrics homes notebook injuries and drawings and these are all collected in the new book the flame

fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Adam ... he's the son of the late Leonard con and there's a new collection of Leonard cons final homes lyrics and drawings and notebook entries previously unpublished and it's called the flame and Adam wrote the introduction to it\nI'm going to ask you to read a poem that's published in the new collection in the past you miss collection of Leonard ... works I'm so is there is something that you could choose that would be relevant to what we're talking about now\nYou know what I don't want to read this phones\nI think that I think in some way or another if we could urge people to um to consult to work with smaller samples otherwise it takes a kind of ... tone that I think he would have been very very reticent to uh to accept it\n[noise] I'm\nWondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his sons are read his homes there was this really dark quality but there was this like kind of\nExistential distance from it at the same time and it transcend than quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is troubling you by the idea of you you reading poems yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice his ...\nAnd spirituality is expressing at the same time and that you don't feel like you could\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which he talked about the solitude of the experience of the of reading and there's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that ah that this is\nThis is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nI appreciate you saying that as the sun but as a fan of your father's work I Will say that he performed his work in concerts to large crowds of people\nAnd there are so many performers who have performed his songs so they have the have his work as a life outside of his mouth and Adams and his work has a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in his room quietly reading his poems so\nI've always wanted to get on record\nAs say no and I'll go one step further with what you're saying just because I don't believe that they're contradictory in a sense I mean this is a man who's put the word hallelujah\nOn many millions of people's lips you know so that that's the sound of a preacher men or the ... of course when it's attached to song I supposed to lift and or an exist away songs have always existed I just mean that there's something about\nReading poetry that I'm feels instructional or a has a kind of ... to it I'm of a ... quality that I don't believe was intended there's something more beautiful about the notion of\nPeople quietly thumbing through this book in observing and as I say really taking the time with the jewels that are embedded in every line taking their own time\nNot with my metered with my voice\nBut since you've declined to read more pounds that you found that only ... not being ... in transit you\nKnow it's just it's it's I I'd be lying if I didn't say it was a little disappointing but I I can I can live with that so I thought I'd play your father reading another another problem with his\nFrom the interview that we recorded in two thousand six and there's a poem called titles and it was published in a book that he did in two thousand six of 'em homes and their ex so this is Leonard Cohen recorded in two thousand six on fresh air\nI had the title poet and maybe I was one for a while also the

home Adam gets you a little but we were talking about the connection of your father writing in solitude and the reader ... reading alone and has ... has [laughter] yeah and during his solitude yeah

recorded by the time you were born Suzanne selling Marianne that's no way to say goodbye burn on a wire Chelsea hotel who by fire I'm so\nDid you hear them all you do if you didn't believe me [laughter]\nDid you hear a lot when you were growing up I mean she's like when I was growing up I thought about\nAnd singers but I didn't think about songwriters you know I just thought about like what is the son and who's singing it um but but you were you at your father was a song writer she must have had an awareness that song writing was crafted something people actually did and\nPlay them around the house I don't know if even heard them and you're a you\nKnow of course I heard them yeah no I was a five year old or on the side of stages watching them being performed a farmer's land into the looking at it the faces of of audiences or you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the melodies and then as I grew older\nThat was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling of language and um\n[noise] then you grow older and then you then you sort of see how I remember um I remember I myself I was making a record at the time and I'd scripted and I asked my father for council is a dead you know meet me me me I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain\nAnd we were sitting on the corner Wilshire and ...\nAnd I confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record and was expecting him to put his hand on my shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't never stopped continue refining but instead he turned to me and said and scrap you record that's an amateur move\nSaid amateur move he says yeah it's not about how you feel about the record it's how the songs make\nThem feel and at that moment I realized that um\nThe la vida always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but I was also about their intention out he was holding up the baton that he had been\nGiven by the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and and something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that uh that\nBaton off the ground [noise] only when you have parents separated um five six from the don't remember so how much did you get to see a father after that\nI'm In a relationship now and the imperfection of\nA union between two people ... has been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father was able to stay in his children's life despite those complications and then some a was a remarkable is remarkable to me\nUm I my mother moved\nSister and I ... to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from him at all but just to follow her own whims and my father you know would often even\nPark a caravan I'm at the end of a dirt road just to be near us um he he's always been part of our lives\nVeto he's he always maintained a role um in in our life despite my parents' separation\nKaren has like a mobile home [noise]\nOh yeah the ... what do you call those like a like a jet stream kind of thing mhm\nYeah I remember my mother moved to my sister and I all the way to south of France where we lived uh\nAnd it was a long dirt road and he bought one of these sort of care of and jet stream type things they put it that the tea where the road met the dirt road and he just lived there [laughter] my mother didn't want him on the property so are you know every day after school bus would drop us off we'd see dead\nIn his care of in that I have four\nWell he did that and variations of that throughout my entire life and and as I say the the\nUm the deliberate ... which he contorted his own life and schedule to to make sure that he was present in our lives was ... feet\nAnd there's something really terrible that happened to you and then it in its own way as maybe responsible\nFor the revival of his career and for for um his reconnection to people um I ... around the world and that's that um he had an accountant or a business manager who like drain\nYour father savings and sold the publishing rights to your father's side that's kinda like stealing is sold to sell other publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like\nSuch a transgression um and like I think your sister who discovered that had happened like if I didn't even know [noise]\nYeah you know\nAs he often joked it is hilarious that he thought he could resolve his economic woes with song and poetry I'm In ... incredible [laughter]\nThat would the canon of his work with his devotion to black cutting pages and melody that that he built the life he built for himself and um when you experience this this episode that you're referring to it actually did compel him back\nOut of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um\nEpisode of his life which was to to discover that all this time ... made the heart grow fonder who knew\nYou'd always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that Kurt Cobain and others you know would quote him and um but it didn't result in the kind of mass appeal\nAnd lo and behold from this economic crisis a rose this most unexpected and\n[noise] festive of periods in his life I Want to say festive I mean it was incredible to see the um\nThe amount of universities to suddenly started teaching is works I'm studying is works or even read the whole rabbinical clan adopting his lyrics as liturgy um\nMadison Square garden and be able to you know twenty thousand cedars suddenly being feel they'd never sold more than six thousand tickets so thank
