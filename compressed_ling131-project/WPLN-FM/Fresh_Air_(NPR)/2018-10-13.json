castles low budget shocking height made him a hero to today's guest screenwriter and director John Waters\nWaters started his own filmmaking career setting new lows in bad taste most notably with a cult classic pink flamingos his film hairspray which was adapted into a hit Broadway musical was an affectionate and funny much to the teen dance shows he used to watch in Baltimore\nLast Sunday the Baltimore museum of art opened a major exhibits devoted to John Waters running through January six it's called John Waters indecent exposure and he's the first major retrospective of his visual art in\nHis hometown of Baltimore a companion catalog has been published compiling not only visuals from the works and photos of John Waters but also from other work that inspired him John Waters has been a frequent guest on fresh air in two thousand four Terry interviewed him about an exhibition at New York's new museum of contemporary art\nIt was a photographic series waters began in the early nineties\nMany of the photographs were tribute to his favorite films which not surprisingly include many old exploitation films and tawdry melodramas\nMost of the pieces Terry asked John Waters about in two thousand four also are included in the new exhibit at the Baltimore museum of art including a photographic sequence from the movie Peyton place he told Teri why that Phil means so much to him\nPeyton place for for first dirty book I ever read I Love grace metallic was that I've never read the book the Wii of Betty's crotch uh-huh [laughter] about dirty\nBut uh in Nineteen fifty six dollars pretty dirty\nAnd oh it's great you ought to repay plays a sequel stored it opens up Indian summer is like a woman for a [laughter]\nBut grey metallic is you know has had famous author shot of her I'm a lumberjack out in the dirty ponytail setting up a typewriter and I was obsessed I even went to her grave I went in her house where she wrote the book but Peyton place itself on the book came out I remember the ad campaign is how did they make a movie out of Peyton place or something like that\nBut they were very supportive which was very I'm very very encouraging and I always say that if if you've got a kid that doesn't fit in is rebelling in any way encouraging if your if your daughter comes home and she just had her entire face tattooed what you can you do maybe she'll open a tattoo parlor that will do well that's all you can do you got to deal with what you got\nSince you didn't feel guilty about watching things in being obsessively interesting interesting things that weren't supposed to be healthy [noise] did you go the other direction figured well I might as well planned up to the hilt and and be you know take on the ... of the pervert [noise]\nOh I never thought of it that way I I took one\nI had to create a persona for myself in the beginning when we may be movies because I didn't have\nAny advertising that no one knew who was what we had to think of a way to to publicize the movies and divine and I did that sort of as as a [laughter]\nI was the director and he was the same movie star and certainly I dressed weirdly but um it was always confusing I I never um [noise] my audience in the beginning\nWas never gay or straight who was gay people that didn't like other gay people let's say three [laughter] it was a hippie fit didn't like ... it was it was always the outsider of another outside of group that that's that's what my audience began with and certainly I'm\nI encourage that but it seemed to work because yes and in the beginning underground movies when I made them they were made in a way to offend the very people who would come there and I\nI the assassination which we did and and divine place Jackie Kennedy was shot in Nineteen sixty five and came out in sixty six [noise] believe me that was to go over very well at the time\nBut at the same time it was a liberal taboo I mean I liked the Kennedy I Love Jacqueline Kennedy or Jacqueline Kennedy is how she pronounces it I'm not so I I wasn't I was always making fun of things that I really really liked him respected\nWhy don't you describe what you did in your version of the Kennedy assassination lifted line in the will of Jackie Kennedy well\nThis was in a movie called each her makeup and it's about people that kidnapped models and force them to eat their make up a model of themselves to death and divine was not the star of it he was supporting player that America seem or divine isn't drag just weird dried but with no way gone because we were trying to\nEven offend I guess drag queens at the time by not taking it seriously\nAnd he starts looking through all these Jacqueline Kennedy magazines but there were many off at the time fan magazines and he starts to imagine themselves as Jacqueline Kennedy in the Kennedy assassination and we have the whole thing the capital ... I mean up pitiful version\nBut we have the show for our we have 'em all the people that were in the car we have Secret Service agents\nAnd I'm divided waving to the crowds are no crowds that was filmed on my parents' street and lose in Maryland I'm Mara ... avenue\nAnd a and a and then it is score to our classical music where there's one note that it's a gunshot and then divine crawls over the top of a car with the blood and everything and it's quite graphic but it was filmed so primitive later that's a nice way to say badly I'm black and white ah\nSixteen millimeter grainy over expose that when I took pictures on the twenty five thirty years later it began to look like the ... the one of the most famous a millimeter movies ever\nSo I'm ... I I I did a a photo of peace based on that pictures of something I did a long time ago and it goes around the wall around the corner of the wall because I I always joke that I'm a ... well I Believe in the world that the frame as the hype the frame as the advertising campaign so to me it was\nToo big for one wall would go around the wall [laughter]\nI'm In ... for any of our listeners who aren't familiar with divine who in this film that you're referring to like Jackie Kennedy devine was a very heavy man who who usually played a woman Indian movies and pattern himself in some of those rules on an Elizabeth Taylor\nAnd and what do you think of real drag queens at the time\nWhether they were square at the time you know I think ... divine helped make drag queens ally hip or are they all wanted to be best Myers\nAnd and [laughter]\nUm so it was they were really square they weren't happy forever now all drag queens or hip I mean you see 'em at Woodstock and they're all really funny and have a sense of humor and they have funny names and everything but but then they were very very serious I remember in Philadelphia there's a great movie called the queen about a drag beauty contest\nIn Philadelphia oh I Know where where you live and Harlow was the winner and a very very famous\nA drag queen but but we used Elizabeth coffee who was at the time I'm much more ludicrous and much more\nFunny and had a sense of humor about it and used to being a drag queen of as being um comedy terrorist which I think um was much more useful in film than than just a man trying to be a pretty woman\n[noise] you know early in your career you said that your work is really about the sadness normal people feel because they're not involved in show business\n[laughter] so what he said that was the ...\nThing I ever said I didn't mean it\nMost everybody secretly imagines himself in show business at every day on their way to work for a little bit depressed because there are people are fab they're not famous of America [laughter]\nI guess you really needed to be famous\n[laughter] um well I I I certainly can't complain about it I hate to hear people that are in ... perfect complained about any of that kind of thing what what on earth did you pick rep field to go in for if you didn't want people to\nRecognize you I've I've always said that show business is filled with the most insecure people of all that that we base a life on having to get approval of strangers from everything we do over and over and over on each project\nYou know in your book there's a lot of skills of\nMovies and I'm not to stills from movies that were transplanted in their time or you know violating some taboo in some small way [laughter] you\nAlso have to rush failed jail jail yeah but you also have a couple of photos of of ... and how to duty not not known as the most but okay\nNext fire a bell yes he was psychotic what kind of was the first thing and I was on the how to do to show my parents took me I was on the peanut gallery NBC Studios\nClara Bell was a psychotic clown who never spoke ... and shot you in the face with seltzer water 'em and you know captain kangaroo in clear about what the same person imagined that life\nI think ... was um a frightening and the best sense of the water was the first psychotic person I remember from my childhood his character\n... played clarinet yes if I knew that I\n... you know he was he was the first clerical\nHuh so is that your first brush 'em let's let's let's be real show business being in the peanut gallery of that duty show\nAnd I saw was fake it was all lie and I'd rather than be disillusioned child I was in the secret and I wanted to stay in on it\nSo you did puppet shows as a kid yeah\nFor a long time what kind of care hand puppets and I did Cinderella and then later punch and Judy but at the end I Would come out from behind the stage which is like breaking or a third world puppetry and fate of the kids you know stick out your ham of dragging puppet will bite it for good luck\nThree fourths of the kids cheered and they loved him and go crazy with the other ... the rest of them have nervous breakdown

Howard Cooper thank you [laughter] and he's a he's a designer now she's a designer who who was not known to me um\nShe's pretty famous should come to our song one of the first Japanese fashioned liberal for deconstructed fashion um she's been around quite some time hugely successful in Japan\nOkay you you you describe your luck as disaster at the dry cleaners\n[laughter] yeah I like her clothes she always has something the matter with him something of that so I I Love the idea when you spend more money than your shirt on an outfit for fashion no one thinks she spent money they think you got it for a nickel somewhere on her thrift shops but actually centered on purpose it's like getting dressed in reverse\nIt sneaky fashion it's wearing outfits that you lied to regular people just think it's something the matter with it and you've got a bad code on\nI mean I'm I see people on the street that are homeless that actually look like outfits that I\nPaid a lot of money for [laughter] and um I find that ... I I find it to life and my father used to that you bought that something that they saw you come and boy but they did see me come [laughter]\nI was eager to get it okay this is far too personal yum [laughter] so I'll Try it anyway [noise] um do you like costuming when it comes to actual that\nNo you mean to someone have to be in a certain outfit no I'm not a specific thank God but what somebody has on I always really think that if boys turned their belt halfway to the right what ... is in on the side Marlon Brando did ... ... it's a lot of confidence I like\nI like somebody that pulls often effort look look but no I I don't have to have somebody dresses an airline pilot for a car and I know that I Would start laughing is\nThere something that's inherently absurd at some point\nSacrifices from the acts up your own uh-huh [laughter] really it every person says and years and never in what way as well because the lengths that people go to the extremes and the conditions and the mental\nHappiness that everybody goes from what they'll do for ... is is never ending in mind boggling and very interesting to me and um and I don't think a lot of times people choose any of it\nI I I'm a friend of mine I ... I think I have it on this book we're um her mother had Alzheimer's and she for years so she knows a lot about Alzheimer's community and I asked them to people forget if they're gay or straight as the workers had never once they don't know who their family is I don't think anybody but no one suddenly doesn't remember if they're gay or straight\nDoesn't that prove really about you're born\nRight okay so I Want to call it something you say in the book you talk a little bit about being in therapy and you say a psychiatrist once told me early and treatment stop trying to make me like you and what a sobering welcome smack in the face that statement was yet somehow every day of my life is still a campaign for popularity or better yet a crowded funeral\nIsn't everybody in show business I'll do the same thing that they're insecure people that have to go into a field that we're strange which have to tell them they're good for the rest of her life\nI figured that out a long time ago um yes I thought it was a great singer ... I'm not there to make friends you're supposed to talk about the things that make you the most are comfortable but I'm paying for the first get my money's worth so I used to after about going to think of the things that maybe the most up to like to talk about which is what you're supposed to do with a psychiatrist [noise]\nUm I Believe in talking to her you know Freud said the best thing ever a redline for Britain is turning hysterical misery to comment on happiness what a great great long\nBut I find it such a paradox and let you spelled out there that you're the person who has like defied every convention in your life and in your art the person who you say even even you're a minority group you're an outsider of\n'em and I mean you turn that into an art and and a career and yet he tried to get your psychiatrist to love you and you say that every day in your life as a campaign for popularity isn't that a paradox [noise]\nNo I think it's probably being a healthy neurotic everything that I'm running out of your own or not enough but only a neurotic\nCares if everyone likes them you know and and the show business certainly it is a it is or politics all the same thing you have to get people to like you\nI'm and by writing books by making movies and everything I think you're continuing to do that at a crowded funeral is a nice thing I like that but the older you get the less chance that has been happening not some other reason to my younger friends [laughter]\nSo they can fill in like the Oscars when somebody goes to the bathroom to have somebody to sit in the seat I Want family [laughter]\nYou know because as\nAs you've said you've made a living selling shock a surprise surprise yeah and and some of your senses be additional your early fellows I paint them you guys have some very like\nVile we you know repulsive thinking people and I'm ... [laughter]\nI don't agree but OK okay there were there were\nCertainly using anarchy to get their point across and they were rebelling against I'm very particular worlds overtime and lusting after things that um maybe you shouldn't but um I think the morals of all my films were were quite obvious from the good guy won and every one of the movies\nNow I think people are really surprised by how it just kind of like\nNice and funny and easy to talk to you are like earlier in your career before ... before the ... it was as public or John Waters as there is now I think people thought that you would be this really peculiar person who might I'm really traffic and sales and\nAnd the old days and days and the town of marijuana and my car on the way the way you know I don't want to have a yeah I think in the beginning but I think through reading books maybe more and more my ...\nThe characters I think I Know director is usually about not that many Stephen King around here and ... why do they think I Would\nWell I I Want to thank you so much for talking with us now is really great to talk with you thank you very much sir\nJohn Waters speaking to Terry Gross twenty ten the Baltimore museum of art has just opened a major retrospective of is visual art and published a hefty companion volume both are called John Waters indecent exposure and the exhibition runs through January six\nComing up I review the Romanoff the new TV series from Matt Weiner the creator of Mad Men this fresh air [noise]\nComing up on the next bluegrass break down the taking of something that doesn't belong to you out the owners consent I'm a big with the assistance of Peter Rowan ladies choice bluegrass band Stanley and John literally will be exposing all manner of stealing [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Nashville", "day": "13"}
