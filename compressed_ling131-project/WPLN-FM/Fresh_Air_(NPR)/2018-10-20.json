written two novels and scripts for to television shows he and his father attended the premier a beautiful boy in Los Angeles last week\nLet's see we're seeing from the new film Nick played by Timothy shell a mate has disappeared for a bit and called his dad telling them Be Sober and asking to meet him for lunch his father David is played by Steve ...\nWhen I was carrying in and the kids\n... can you hear a field trip right now I'm just saying you handled on myself [noise]\nI Know they wanted you to be there that song [noise]\nI'm Sorry I'm\nSorry so\nPlease skin money where does this and I got through this is kind of work halfway right now I got that day soon get look like it's working out and do it just looks like it's working out what the how you can come home you know that when they get work please Mick [noise]\nInducing researching do research she got to help me get [noise] you think that you have this under control [noise] and I understand how scared you are\n... why do things differently than any different alright I'm attract craziness and you're just embarrassed 'cause I was like you know I don't think this amazing thing that you're special ... or something and you don't like who I Am now who are you near the day here this is why I Am\nToday we'll hear parts of terrorists interviews with the chefs first her conversation with David and the chef recorded in two thousand date she started with a question for David\nCan you talk a little bit about how he spends personality changed when he was using that\nHe he became unrecognizable or he went from being\nJust one of the most sort of light filled extraordinary people that I knew and he became\nThis coast a sort of coming in and out of the house I mean physically he changed you know he lost he was scared and bugs and he was\nJittery and and then his behavior changed I mean he went from being as I said this sort of a charming lovely kind open gentle person was ... he became belligerent and angry and depressed and argue\nYou look toward a higher power to give these strains and there's a St Nicholas let go and let God David you describe in your memoir how ... year you were or are still are in an atheist and raise net without religion um did you have to\nI too felt guilty when you're asked me about what I felt guilty for I felt guilty for that too when we heard from some people that the only way to get sober and stay sober is\nTo embrace that and they try to broaden it by saying you know God can be whatever you conceive him to be it's a higher power and things like that it was a definite would say that it was just an excuse\nTo resist but I think ultimately\nI learned and I think he learned that you could not deny some of those basic principles including the first one which is your new didn't agree for a long time it's just that he that he was powerless over his addiction he thought he was in control\nHe had to nearly died more than once before he finally I think accepted that and once you accept that I think you're in the door\nUm but I just I I think that that God thing you know in ... step programs and undercover it I think ... is a huge problem because I Try I spend a lot of time trying so hard to practice prayer and\nDoing all this stuff to make myself you know come to believe and ultimately you know when I sit with myself and the quiet moments you know when I'm Alone\nYou know I don't believe you know I think that for people who are just fundamentally you don't believe in God or any you know reason\nThey are at at a disadvantage in terms of getting help through these these kind of programs absolutely\nSo that the trip but but the other thing that I think is really important to ... we learned is that there isn't just one way there wasn't just one way to get healthier and sober and to stop using the first thing that they're telling me about when he arrived at this last program\nWhich he sat with a um counselor and the counselor said to him you know why are you here and by then he was a you know he was a perfect student of of of rehab and so he said what you know he thought the expected him to say which is I'm here because I'm a drug addict and alcoholic\nAnd the guy said well wait let's let's go now why are you a drug addict and alcoholic you know why are you trying to kill yourself that's what that rehab was all about it was about trying to figure out what was going on inside\nAnd that's what I'm you know ... ... everybody you know it's different for everybody but for neck I think that but I mean you know that's what he says that those three months were essential\nTo do that program not ... not rely on the higher power principle\nIt didn't rely on it completely no I mean they there was definitely that was there and and that was a part of that but um there was a lot of experimental therapies and stuff that they did there and you know I sort of\nGot to really go back and re experienced some of the traumas that experience growing up and I'm sort of relive them and and greed them enough for the first time really allow myself to grieve them\nAnd to come to understand who I Am an end to learn you know I've tried as it sounds or whatever to to learn how to how to love myself and you know today like I I mean I don't want to kill myself you know I I don't at all now I Love my life and stuff and yeah it doesn't\nHave anything to do with a higher power for me but uh for a time people it does I'm certainly not you know dissing anybody that feels that way absolutely\nDid you find that you know something that you could describe as a higher power\n[noise] I I learned to define that in in a way that worked for me which is a it's something about our humanity I Would when I went to ... I was told by someone before this was over you will believe in God that didn't that transformation didn't happen to me but I Do believe in\nPrayer it is a way it was a way that I got through I never planned to pray I never said I'm going to pray I'm going to do what they told me about\nAll of a sudden there were moments where I found myself praying and it was a way to get through ... what does it mean to you if you don't believe in God\n\nYou know it's it's a it's a really good question and I don't even know the answer I guess it was it was it was a it was a reflection of how desperate I was that unconsciously without saying I'm going to ... I was saying please please please save their please help heal my son I remember that's what I found it to myself over and over and over again [noise]\nUh and it was way be that way just to stay sane and its effect focused on something that you know that I could hold onto or maybe I was you know hedging my bats maybe I was praying in a way you know in case someone out there was listening\nNikki nicotine that there's um that part of what saved you from your math addiction was and degree a self knowledge\nThey were helped to acquire in your last rehab mhm and that I think was do we have in which you were diagnosed with having bipolar disorder which is basically manic depression um did that help getting a diagnosis and then getting the medication to deal with a diagnosis\nYes I I mean after you know it's a ... I think it's like\nVery very subtle and you know I Am on two different medications and one of them is a bipolar\nMedication and it's you know it's there's subtle I mean I couldn't even tell you necessarily\nYou know what the differences are or how it's helping me but I I think that ... that they it's definitely you know one little piece of the puzzle in terms of learning how to be able to live with yourself you know a little bit more on yet so I think that if you need it you know if you get a really good\nThink that's awesome after they uh Nick tells the story in his book but to me is so profound and it's done in just a beautiful way I think um [noise] he came to see\nUs I'm Karen like my wife and Jasper and daisy or we were in there so we haven't seen that for a long time in in ... you know let's let's like to join us we were doing on the family vacations and that came over to see us\nAnd we were hanging out we had a really good time it was you know we talked a lot and it was very open and he talked to the kids about what we've been going on and it was sort of to apologize to them in a way that's I think it was just so meaningful to them into caring and to me and we had a really good time and then she describes the day before he was leaving she got\nJust really annoyed you talked about is ready to kill the and all of a sudden it hit him that\nTomorrow are leaving oh I'm that's what's going on here I was studying my I I don't really want to leave party wants to stay here\nAnd be a child or going to be you know with my family and\nSo I'm sort of ... and he's going to hell of a sudden he said he felt he said that I I feel better now and and he went back on the rest of the trip was it was great we had a really nice less day but then he said what just happened he says another time in my life\nThat moment would have just been the beginning of a ... percent and it would have been the kind of decided whether ended up and they're going out to have a drink or to get some pot and then it's a mess and he said how could it be the fact that I'm On this new medication and I just thought it was such a beautiful description of the way that it all works together\n[noise] well listen congratulations to both of you on on on the books in on the ... you know ... ... good luck with some you know with continuing in and everything I I you know I Wish you

son Knicks addiction to mess has been made into a movie starring Steve ...\nIs your child's under Eighteen you can um force them to go into rehab right\nMost places you can it's it's yes you can it's not easy in some states it's really complicated you have to get judges orders\nYou have to essentially commit them a police officer maybe half has to come and pronounce them a threat to themselves or someone else but still parents do have the legal right to get their kids into treatment did you ever do that\nI never had to resort to any kind of legal means of getting into treatment but still I had a lot of leverage\nYou know he was living at home he he would be desperate he would want to come home he would want help so he would call me up and he'll be willing to go to treatment so I had some leverage I never had to do a formal intervention but people do them\nThey're dangerous or one of the pieces of advice I got over and over again from professionals is that they must be done by professionals by people who are trained to do interventions they know what's going on and they understand the risks but\nUm I never had to do that I was able to get into treatment other ways but whatever it takes whatever it takes to get someone to treatment that's what we got to do what were the other way well sometimes nickel just get tired of being out there and he would be so desperate he would you know he ... he just wanted to\nGet off the streets you know it wasn't necessarily even life threatening um and so he was willing to go into treatment because that was my deal I'll come pick you up you know drive you a treatment center check you in\nAnd so he would do it um but as things went forward I mean the last time that relapsed you know he's been sober for a long time it was after ... can I talk to you on your show\nAnd you know one day\nWere together and he said I cannot believe what I did I was at someone's house just almost automatic I opened up the medicine cabinet there was a bottle of I could then I took one I thought to myself just one\nWhich is common for addicts to you know that's the first thing that they'll say to themselves and to us\nAnd send the bottle was gone and he said\nI woke up this morning and realize that if I don't do something I'm going to be back on the streets within a week so he you know this was the first time I didn't have to say a word he got on the phone he calls\nUh playing that day to me it's possible to look back on that and say you know all the treatments before that were a failure here he was sober for such a long time and he relapsed again but to me it's the opposite it shows that the treatments has helped him so much\nThat he was able to recognize that he was in a freefall that it was so dangerous for him he he had learned what they teach in a lot of treatment centers this behavioral cognitive thing where you can interrupt\nEither the craving that would lead to relapse or you can stop a relapse early and if you can you know you've made so much progress one of the things they talk about with addiction is progress not perfection so so when they got in that play on that day\nI saw great great progress and since then he's been sober so\nAh it shows that it's possible I mean people think that treatment can't work a Knicks proof that it does [noise]\nSo let's talk a little bit about twelve step treatment programs you have a lot of experience with them because I think Nick had been in a ... step program\nIs probably going to you know a a ton of step program for parents Ellen on yeah yeah and then you visited them just just research for the book so you see you see you know positives and negatives with the top step program\nKill I think most people know what the positive\nUh parts are what are some of the problems you have to stop\nThe twelve steps are completely profound you know treatment for so many people but not most people and that's the problem that I have it's not what the twelve steps it's only many many rehabbed are based on this idea\nThat the twelve steps are the kids are the only way to stay sober that's my problem\nSo my problem with the twelve steps is only when it's forced and it's forced in many places Nick was kicked out of this and treatment programs because he wouldn't embrace the twelve steps\nAnd and so we have to understand that you know there are many ways to get sober and the twelve steps is one and it works for some people but there needs to be alternative\nBut I did go to Alan on meetings and what I found there was something different that helped me you know when it became addicted I didn't know other families who had kids who were addicts I\nI was ashamed and I felt that I was the only one and people tell me\nOver and over and over again go to Ellen on meeting Scott Allentown meetings I Would sort of roll my eyes and saying I'm not going into one of those rooms where people are you know whining and sitting around in a circle and I walked into one of those rooms finally and I felt\nYou know these are my people they know what I'm going through because they're going through it too so that comfort in that support was profound for me\nAlso going into these rooms you know I I was suffering so much inside and so I Would go through my day and I would have to put on the face that everything was okay and I had to work I go to my younger children daisy and Jasper school and and you know I had to keep it together\nI walked into these rooms and I didn't have to keep it together I was allowed to just sit in the back and feel you know whatever it was this just terror and other people were feeling as in I was able to cry and I was able to\nYou know there was no pretty tense and those rooms there was this openness it didn't make things go away but it made it easier to get through some of the days\nWhen it comes on a positive note [laughter] and and if it's OK ... if not prying into your son next privacy he sounds like he's doing really well now professionally as well as person that just gives all update on his life is that's not prying too much\nIt's not I mean this is really you know\nHe's an unbelievable person I mean the obvious that until I'm ... I'm president but he\nHit extraordinary has just this lovely person that he helps a lot of people getting stay sober I hear from people all the time you have kids who say I read next book I heard him talk and that's why I've gone into recovery\nIs really healthy he exercises every day he got married to this woman that we adore you know they were best friends when they were sixth and seventh grade\n... writing like mad he just had a novel or accepted\nSo you know we're just so lucky whereas if you're lucky I mean all these other things are are great but the main thing is that he's alive there were so many times when I didn't think he was going to make it\nGave a check thank you so much for talking with us and I'm pleased to my best regards to your son that I spoke with him once [laughter] on the show and I'm I'm so glad he's um he's doing well thank you thank you very much ... thank you so much", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "20"}
