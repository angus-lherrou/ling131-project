March Madness was seen by Ninety seven million TV viewers [noise]\n\nOur\nGuest writer Michael ... says the money and recognition the sport generates has led to a host of corrupt practices in the recruitment of players were the top college basketball programs\nTalented athletes as young as twelve for targeted for manipulation by St agents soccer love described as dealers in human athletic slash many of those corrupt practices were exposed in an FBI investigation which led to a sprawling indictment that rocked the basketball world last year\nIn the first of three trials in the case the federal jury yesterday convicted three men of conspiring to use cash payments to recruit players to college basketball programs including the University of Louisville it's legendary coach Rick Pitino wasn't charged but the scandal cost him his job\nHe's one of the subjects of soccer ... new book the last temptation of Rick Pitino a story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball I spoke to suck a lot of yesterday when the jury in the case was still deliberating\nWell my ... welcome back to fresh air you know any enterprise that generates large sums of money can be beset by corruption how much money just college basketball generate\nWill billions I mean it really depends on how you calculate it but directly to the universities and to the NC double a\nBillions but if you figure in the gambling money and money that's generated by recruiting sites in all these crazy ways you know you're getting into the four or five or six billion dollars a year\nRight and where does the money go\nThe money largely goes to be adults who run the games very little of it goes to the players or the players get the value of their scholarships so if you look at a program like Louisville which is program that I focused on\nThey generate about forty five million dollars a year in revenue they give out Thirteen scholarships that adds up to about four hundred thousand dollars a year\nThe rest of it gets spread out to the coach who makes eight million dollars a year just the assistant coaches and make as much as a half million dollars a year\nAll throughout the athletic department people are making six figure salaries it does not go to the players and what I call the unpaid workforce\nHow big is the NCAA a championship tournament March Madness\nJust about a billion dollars a year goes to the NC double a itself\nWhich is the non profit organization that runs big time college sports but the money that that tournament throws off and all kinds of different directions is where you get into the two or three billion dollars it's the kind of money that pro franchises are are making or generating the differences\nThat they're actually paying the players\nYou're right about the University of Louisville which you say it was kind of quiet commuter school\nUntil a new athletic director guy named Tom Juravich came in and had big ambitions and invested in big time coaches and new facilities stadiums and basketball arenas and and he made a ton of revenue from it did it\nAnd get into their inner circles and then to see what's in it for me can I deal this kid to a particular college can I associate him with a particular NBA agent\nAnd this is very much the scene on the grass roots circuit it's known and it's it's part of the background\nAre are there are kids who when they're you know twelve Thirteen fourteen kind of become celebrities kind of think of themselves as a business\nAbsolutely there are there are kids who you know this is their life in one of the things that really struck me\nWhen I have been around grassroots basketball is the kids who refer to themselves as being in the business of basketball because that's how it feels to them they may be twelve or Thirteen Years old but they're in the business of basketball\n[noise] Michael ... book is the last temptation of Rick Pitino the story of corruption scandal in the

adviser dot com\nThis is fresh air and we're speaking with writer Michael ... whose new book the last temptation of Rick Pitino is about a recruiting scandal in college basketball\nLast year a federal grand jury charged ten men in the case and the first three to be tried convicted yesterday Pitino was not charged but did lose his job in the scandal\nWhen these federal indictments were announced a year ago it was big news were people in the college basketball world shocked to hear that these things were going on\nThey absolutely were not shocked\nWhat the FBI I did was put names and faces to what\nMany people had assumed or knew was going on but there was an element of shock\nAnd what that was was that the FBI was on the case the FBI was knocking on doors the FBI was bringing parents coaches and players into interrogation rooms as opposed to the NC double a if you're in college basketball\nIt's an occupational risk that you may run afoul of the NC double a it was not considered an occupational risk that you may be visited by the FBI and maybe looking at prison time\nThat was a shock ...\nAnd has it had a major effect on college basketball programs I mean ... certainly was turned upside down they lost their coach what about others\nI think overall it has not yet had a big impact on college basketball\nYou know I mentioned that they do well in a fantasy land and part of that just involves putting your head in the sand so ... one of the most prominent coaches in college basketball\nThe legendary Mike ... coach K of Duke was quoted as saying this is a blip this is nothing you know this trial\nAll sliver of what really goes on well nobody believes that but the fact that coach case that it gives you an indication of the sort of institutional reaction to to what has gone on and\nA determination to sort of try to get past this without really changing anything\nYou know you're right that the question in the criminal case is whether this conduct violated federal criminal statutes but what\nReally at issue here is the fundamental hypocrisy if not corruption of the whole structure of college sports explain what you mean what kind of sports\nDoes not pay its workforce it generates billions of dollars\nAnd it doesn't pay and at a certain juncture that's just not defensible maybe when the money was a little less you could say okay they're getting their scholarships now you've got players generating ten and twenty and thirty and forty million dollars for a particular programs and they're not\nReal students their loyalty and their their responsibility is to their teen first which takes up forty or fifty or sixty hours a week\nAnd you're not paying them you know you are you are having their elders just spread the money around and they're not all by the way going into pro basketball or pro football some of them are just moving through and not necessarily getting a degree\nComing out with some injuries and yet the NC double a persists in the myth of the student athlete when everyone knows that if anything it's the athletes student you know the the athlete is what you're there for\nThem to come back to one thing you said earlier you said a lot of people knew that that shady things were going on and that there was a risk of running afoul of and see a regulations it as a whole new game if you have the FBI asking questions do you think that'll make a difference in the future\nI Do think it will make some difference but I think that difference will be just in the way that people conduct possibly criminal activity\nI think people will be more careful you're already heard these people you know on the recordings that the FBI took them you know talking about you know we have to do this and some underhanded ways we have to get it out of certain accounts so they knew they were engaged in criminal activity I think there'll be or possibly criminal activity\nI think they'll become more careful\nSunny the Cairo the former Nike\nExecutive the godfather of the grassroots circuit he told me these people forgot where the boundaries were you know they got too greedy he also saddened by the way you never do this kind of stuff on the telephone so there's an element of all of this that makes\nThis look like just common criminal activity it makes the three shoe companies seem like crime families on the on the basketball circuit so to the extent that all of this is true and I think it is whether it's criminal we don't know\nIt will continue to go on because there's too much incentive for it to go on I certainly think with the FBI on the case people would become much more careful\nAnd just so we covered this I mean ... you said that in some respects she went apparel companies look pretty bad and is what do they say about their role in in college recruitment in these charges\nThe apparel companies have been very quiet they have put out sort of analysis statements that this is not what we do um but they've been very very quiet there is a\nDefendants his name is James ghetto he's being represented by\nA lawyer hired by Adidas and if I like James ghetto who this does executive his father was a high school coach he's an insider who's a basketball inside or almost all of these defendants are well liked\nWell known insiders they're not people who operated you know outside the system I think one of the scariest things for people in the basketball industry to the extent that that they are alarmed is\nThese people were them they were family they were part of the basketball fraternity and Adidas and Under Armour and Nike are part of the corporate basketball fraternity and I don't think they are planning on much to change either if they can help it\nMichael ... thanks so much for speaking with us thank

Louis bringing into their life everything that they were supposed to not have to deal with any more after having left the city there was a vision of the suburbs when they moved in the Nineteen fifties as this kind of\n... of peace and you know lose various outrages under which they would certainly have filed a you know who's going to gay bars and acting out as a gay person\nYou know we're elements of that but it wasn't like we're going to make him straight you know I don't I just don't think that was part of it\nWe mentioned when you mention gay bars and and him being gay but he's also a lot of girls at the time I\nWell yeah that's true and let them there are people I mean this was a really I mean it it's a very it's an issue very much at the moment interestingly because I've kind of gone around the block\nSee anything he was on a like fluid in his actual LA\nYeah I mean one of his girlfriend's a describes him as inter\nAnd [laughter] it's a kind of interesting usage I think you know there was part of Lu I think that was up for anything and\nBut I've had gay friends with gay male friends like write to me and say you know you describe this element of flu but he was really gay\nAnd the other day I got one of those and it was you know as a pretty stern email that you know made me think about what I had written I had lunch with one of his former girlfriends she was saying look there's no way Louis gauge\nHis sexuality was something I think you know as you gauge the adage you saw what you wanted to see you know and I think Louis kind of hoping to going wherever that was\nAnd I think everybody had a language for it then well that's right they didn't that language didn't exist [noise] yes I did want a guy I just didn't want to say one thing about his parents because you know there really was this sense you know after the shock treatments of of lose never forgiving them for that\nBut when I left the velvet underground he went back and lived with his family I have a price on Iran or exactly yeah\nYou know and and uh I once said you know his first wife was talking about Lou being cheap and she was saying a guide you ever want to spend money we were living in these all these small places you would never ask his father for money and at that point in my research I I took loose story as you know the truth\nAnd I just said well with his father ever have given their money and she said of course he was giving them money\nYou know it is anything for you know he was ... you know he was the oldest son and his Jewish family and\nYou know his father was a very conventional man who would have loved to have a son that wanted to take over his accounting business you know he didn't get that he couldn't get around you know a lot of what lose life and you know even his art was like but you know on the other hand whatever Lou needed anything he was there and\nYou know that was one of the complexity flu dedicated his book of lyrics to his parents and his sister\nYou know a ... you know it wasn't as simple as a\nYou know as it might initially seen\nAnother thing that really nice like amazed me a reading about this\nSplit up and he went on his arm he didn't have any money not eat ... he got a job working for his father typing in his father's accounting office yes extending transgression is that [laughter]\nI Try to let it they don't have any I always see what's hey guys you know well my mother always said you know like a you know you should have something to fall back on and kind of typing was not for me\nUm you know I think it was just a way to buy time and make money and if they do right now I'm a date him yeah exactly yeah somebody told me a story I wasn't able to confirmed as but that the night Lou quit the velvet underground you know after a show at max is Kansas City\nUm that his parents were waiting for him in the car driving back to Long Island I mean I could never get that confirmed but it's certainly possible and he certainly did move back there immediately and you know they kind of relationship that was a [noise]\nYou know along with a you know this kind of you know festering anger that Lou felt him and he would never meet with them without his sister being there he always refer to them by their first names it was never like mom and dad\nUm and you know he certainly would characterize them in song you know in ways that you know must have made their skin crawl but ah yeah but in real life you you know got along with them fairly well she'll early\nIn the velvet underground period\nThey team up with Andy Warhol like Andy Warhol brings them under his wing he wants he wants to have a man she I'm kind of have yet to kind of expand his his his his reach\n'em and what worked and what didn't work about that connection with Warhol what were they went didn't work for lead\nWell let's you know that's very interesting question because you know um [noise]\nYeah ... ... a a Andy wanted a band in the same way you know it was just like oh you know movies are getting popular you know I'm just going to make some movies now and you know and says like we should have a bad you know rock and roll is going to be a thing and\nSo they found the velvet underground um you know through some you know on the artists who had gone to see them and thought they might work for ...\nUm you know a Andy Warhol and Paul Marcy has kind of like right hand man at the factory their studio\nDecided that the the velvet underground more kind of too boring looking so they got Nico yeah who was a you know a German model an actress and soon to be finger too young to be their lead singer Lewis not crazy about that\nBut I think he felt like Warhol was going to bring 'em a degree of disability\nThat was good it was important and that he would just go along with it he limited Nico sports is a patient as much as he could you know um she only saying you know a few songs\nOr the band was pointedly called the velvet underground and Nico you know like that is she's not a member of the band and as soon as he could he got ... you know he kicked Nico has the band as well\nAfter having an affair with her\nWell that's very true [laughter] ... it was you know part of those times\nUm and that was a you know so that was one of the issues of Warhol a Warhol was great because you know back then you know I was a kid in New York around that time Warner was in the newspapers all the time they are not\n... you know not art critics reading about it although that too but it's just like all this crazy guy you know he thinks that Campbell Soup cans or art and he went to this party the other day I mean every day it was in the newspapers do whatever he did got attention\nAnd ah you know Lou took advantage of that but that also hurt the velvet underground in that you know rock and roll\nThing and we are we're whoa seemed like a put a like a joke oh this is like an Andy Warhol version of a background you know for for people who have returned them you don't hurt our major mirror so\nYou know a drink of venture Li like once very mood you know certainly the first album and where the process of making the struggle more as a\nBlue filter or we've kind of a ... year ago and he's got to go our view this needs to be more pressure on operation and you know there's no way or the world was you know a rock and roll manager of you know\nMy guess is Anthony ... Curtis the author of the book Lou Reed uh life it's just been published in paperback\nAfter a break we'll talk about ... relationship with women including his wives and is trans partner Rachel I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh as [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new\nOur family foundation supports WHYY fresh air and its commitment to sharing ideas under encouraging meaningful conversation support for NPR comes from this station\nAnd from Amazon Prime video with the Romanoff a new series from the creator of Mad Men starring Diane Lane snow all widely Christina Hendricks into Andrew rattle a new episode every Friday on prime video\nAnd from ...

Curtis is written a new book about little read at a new biography called Lou Reed life [noise]\nLiberate second solo album after the velvet underground broke up a transformer which produced by David Bowie and you know always of course famous for all of his you know persona is and for his sexual fluidity what impact did working with David Bowie have on the lead in terms of\nHis self image and his persona\nWell you know Lou how complicated feelings about that um you know at the time it was a big opportunity I mean David Wu was kind of the you know the coming thing and uh you know bully you [laughter]\nYou know as with flu like there was a very conventional aspect of but we I mean much as he was a boundary breaker he always you know kind of respect your elders you know and and the people who had an important influence on him and Lou Reed was right at the top of that list\nAnd so she you know ... offered to produce transformer and restored\nYou know lose standing after the velvet underground and created a solo career for him and gave him his only hit\n'em they'll walk on the wall side was on that record um [noise]\nYou know so little of course you know once you got to hit that he desperately wanted your kind of came to resent it and you know thought of it as um you know just to kind of pop song and why do people sort of reduced me too that\nUh but at the time that he needed it she really needed it and he really watches it and I'm ... and ... guitar player ... who co produced that album with a with with David\nUh they created that song and also you know of other beautiful songs like you know perfect day and satellite of love that are that are on that record and uh you know made it such a you know such a significant album for Lu\nWho want to hear walk on that ... from that album and\nUm this was his only real like radio hit and it was a big hand I'm In the sun the lyrics are inspired by some of the trans women he knew from Andy Warhol was a factory so so let's hear it and then we'll talk about ...\n\nCame from Miami ... hitchhiked away across the U.S they loved her eyebrows on the way to shave their legs and then he was a she says the the\nTypical welcome and wild aside and said hey honey take a walk on the line of a [noise]\nMm [noise]\nAnd it came from now on the island\nThat's Lou Reed walk on why outside his album transformer which was produced with David Bowie I'm so that so that was actually a head friendly but if I can tell from your book like this attack he wanted to hit so badly finally has run and he sounds like he was actually kind of ambivalent about it\nWell that's you know there were you know he was pulled back and forth by you know his desire you know look Lou Reed grew up in an era where you know there was no I mean the velvet underground sort of created this you know where it was possible there to be a rock band and have credibility and not have hits before that you either had hits or you went home\nYou know [laughter] more than more gone way to go to Adam ... yeah yeah\nPrecisely and even if you did have hits [laughter] you know you got a year or two and then you went home but\nUm you know for Lu so Lu I mean I learned that um ethics kind of in his DNA\nAh but at the same time you know he saw himself as an artist and he saw himself as wanted to do serious things and and take left turns and you know go in New directions and so\nThe degree to which you know the record companies like oh okay great we've got to hit like now let's do take another walk on the wall side or walk on the wall side again and you know that kind of irritated him and you know of course he made Berlin which at the time was vilified\nOr you know later to be you know resurrected and and uh and lying eyes but you know at the time it came out it was regarded as a you know just an outrage and crazy move because it was you know such a a harsh and depressing record 'em [noise]\nSo you know he would turn on himself you know he would he would do whatever he needed to do\nTo to restore his standing once you have destroyed his standing you know because the next thing was rock and roll animal which was you know a big FM radio record of a big success at a big seller was alive album at a good one [noise]\nUm yeah but then after Lou made that you know a record or two later remade metal machine music which nearly destroyed his career was just an hour of just you know deafening guitar feedback you know it was again a gesture that went on ... before Lou did it and I'm\nJust looking at wanted he wanted to have is music reach people and be loved and be popular but at the same time he distressed and that and wants to be like outside the mainstream and outside of that kind of acceptance exactly\nAnd it's almost as if he wanted to punish people for like\n[laughter] honestly I mean I think that was I think that was an element of it mhm mhm [noise]\nUm so I'm ... ... you say that that album basically ended the period of his life where he describes himself as gay what what changed\n[noise] um well one thing was the end of his relationship with Rachel which was a huge it's documented quite movingly or in the song street hostile apart call slip away\nWhere you know he says you know she took the the rings right off my fingers and you know he in an interview on you know at that time you know said\nYou know that was real she did that I mean essentially they're saying like Rachel you stole whatever jewelry was around and took off and [noise]\nUm I think they had been falling apart there's some lots of lots of theorize about why that is in some sense of I'm Rachel wanting to make a transition that she was taking hormones whether Lew did or did not approve of that but one thing that happened was Lou\nHis second wife and you know began moving more into that relationship and getting serious and that was um [noise] you know over the course of two or three years Lu got clean a got straight\nAnd um and his gay life became something that\nI mean he's still honored in certain ways a song like Halloween parade or a you know there would be references to it but he would never speak of himself as gay after that you know I think he had very complicated feelings about his um his homosexual life\nAnd even if he was out there as anybody could be also turned on it and are\nOften not with that you know that much um [noise]\nBitterness but uh but still we would never discuss it\n[noise] you know so I I Want to play a different excerpt at St ... the ... not to slip away part that you referred to sure where the part that's about somebody overdosing\nUm and the person narrating the story is like so cold just so indifferent about it it's almost upsetting to listen to but it's it's yeah it's great music and it's great raining [noise]\nUm so I didn't know that the middle part of a street hassled you want to say anything about this this part\n[noise] yeah I'm Lewis drawing on the story of a a guy who used to be around the factory he was found dead\nOr industry or has been thought to be kind of thought he was hit by a car that mean that was the official story the unofficial story that was that he had died of a heroin overdose in somebody's apartment and they have dragged him out onto the street and just left him by the docks\nI'm as if he had you know I've been an accident of some kind\nOf a blue turns that male character into a female character and then you have described the guy who was the host of the party 'em urging his guts to get just girls body out of his apartment [noise]\nLet's hear it this is Lou Reed [noise]\n\nYou know in Libya weaving in and it really wasn't nice dog and I really wish that there was a little more time to speak\nBut you know get the hazard try and explain to some degree so today I was there all the guys in it's not like we can help ... there was this new one to do and it was made you know I Would have been the first\nWoman soon turn that into a universe choosing majors\nThe way that is really some teen moms nice we\nWould you be more kids around the girls\nThat there is the worst since I don't have to choose I get\nA loan and I knew that they know when a treaty is widespread it will only lead to being just when they ran the darkness gene by mornings you know they hit and run [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city":
