essays on\nSubjects including being a feminist nearly getting a victim when she was going broke trying to make it as a comic going from a four year relationship to being single again and then being in a relationship again and what it's been like as a black woman to be an interracial relationships\nPhoebe Robinson welcome to fresh air it is a pleasure to have you on our show so you started in comedy about eight years ago ten years hair okay okay I Know what was the gender race atmosphere in comedy clubs like for you and then\nI think it's the same as it is now it's a lotta straight white guys so women and some people color a few queer people you know it's a very white straight male dominated industry and um [noise]\nThat can be exhaust Dave I think is probably the most polite way to put it there is just the way that it seems like a lot of the white straight guys want comedy to be done and um if you don't do it that way if you don't do sort of hanging out that you do I think you can feel\nSort of lonely in a way that I Would say almost none of the other things I Do writing acting to to queens that stuff doesn't feel lonely but a lot of time stand up those incredibly lonely for me\nYou know you're right that male comics talk all the time about their body functions and their man parts but of women do it it's considered gross so what kind of reactions did you get when you were starting in comedy when you started to talk about a body issues and things like ... and a lot of you know men in the audience [noise]\nYeah I mean I think it just I just want to be clear that when anyone started doing stand up like your full trash you know what I mean like you you're just like not that great you're really started posting on personality\nI'm and you're hoping your jokes are kind of funny and you know I've been doing comedy for ten years and I think I've finally gotten to a place where I can acres is that allowed to have to believe it's oh so why bother I don't want to do that yet I don't want to I don't want to do it I'm not low Wayne okay I'm not going to [laughter]\n\nSorry I just really got to a place you know I think honestly the place I got to happened when I went on tour last fall with ... we did our why why tore across America and we were both kind of being like\nOh we're funny we've been doubting ourselves this whole freaking time at a law that has been informed by the fact that we have different energy they allow the male comics we care yourselves different maybe tell her jokes in a different way or different style\nHow hard it is to not see yourself especially if you're living in society or culture where you are so reflected at every possible turn I think it's hard to like um\nImagine what it's like to not have laugh and so you know I I Do think that like if there was like a two to queens that would have been\nA game changer for me to just like here to black women like young black woman oh well I'm thirty four but I'm like\nHey young black women [laughter]\nBut you know to hear to like young black women talking about\nOh this one time I got my hair done at the salon and they did that to my hair and like totally like messed it up\nI couldn't talk about by black hair woes and high school with like Laura she doesn't know she's a she just wakes up and she has ... ... ... ... like straight here like she didn't have to go through like what I had to go through and so\nI think in the end it worked out okay but I did have to do a lot of work on myself I did have to kind of like be OK\nWith being out numbered in a way and not letting that makes me so sad and then also I think I was very lucky to be a child in the nineties with like ... or\nYou know Martin Family Matters and girlfriends and all these sort of shows where you could still see you know like Tracy Ellis Ross or I could still see like queen ... and be like oh okay cool so I can kind of see what I could be like if I was you know an older black woman [noise] you're right\nAbout body image in your book and you say yeah since you were fourteen your brain has been consumed with all the way as your body is like not good enough meaning not attractive to straight dues and for failing to meet fashion industry standards and say even age thirty four with a deeper understanding of how we've been ...\nYou're still kind of fixated on it so how have you tried to overcome that because it sounds like you're like intellectual knowledge of how women have been a expected to conform to certain bodies standards ... is at a different place\nThan you are just kind of visceral like I gained too much weight kind of feelings\nI think that everyone has that sort of battle inside themselves about something whether it's body or you know I'm a writer was no other an analogies great moving on [laughter] but you know what I mean there's always that that thing that it's like that you ... you mentally you know better but\nConditioning still makes that soft outcome and so I think what I\nHave done is I have chosen to refocus that energy like I'm getting back into exercising\nBut not like I don't have a skill in a house is not about a number if you're just going like I Need to make sure I'm strong enough to get through the day rather than I I Want to make sure I look in these pair of jeans\nI feel more powerful the little bit of experiences that have gotten with like styling and doing like these photo shoots\nAnd again these are champagne problems I just went up ... I Know that but there there'll be like oh yeah they have a size four and it's like that is unacceptable to me to only have a size four is truly ignorant and inexcusable or I go to these like shoots and I tell people\nI'm a ten twelve\nThat's just what it is and they'll be like here's a six it's like how dare you surely it's like how dare you be like oh we'll be couldn't find anything in your size you didn't look 'cause I dress myself every day I dress myself every day and I find everything I Need to have\nThis sort of oh well we only have a zero to four so you either ... or you're you're screwed\nIs not how you should treat anybody I Would do these video games and Ninety percent of the stuff I wouldn't fit into\nAnd every time I didn't fit into something I Believe I'm Sorry and the Apollo time I would apologize after every single ... I'm so sorry and Mike they knew what size I was\nFour weeks before I showed up I is not my fault I'm decides that I Am\n[noise] there's an afterword and it didn't come to your book in part of your

or make me realize that I'm lovable I just had to sort of figure that out for myself and be OK\nIf I don't date someone for two years or two and a half years or five years and if I had been like find my soul mate on my partner by then does that mean that I'm a terrible person you know what I mean it's like all these like value systems you like placing yourself\nAnd it was all predicated on what someone else thought about me never once they check in and see how I felt about myself did you have to learn\nHow to a fully enjoy yourself when you were not with somebody whether it's going to go into a movie by herself or having dinner by herself [noise] um and just feel like I'm consuming this I'm watching this and I don't need somebody with me to fully appreciate the experience\nAbsolutely I mean I I did all that stuff where I just and you know you always think like you go out to like a diner or a movie go by yourself and you think everyone is just like dropping like you're at a

I gather you do a lot of research for your work um did you find that plantations in Barbados were much different than the ones in the United states\nYou know I'm not I'm not a full blown historian but you know given my readings from my sense of things that seems so life on plantations in the Caribbean was much more it's much more brutal [noise]\nThis is kind of an ironic thing to say but the sense of preservation of of um of one's workers a you know there were were expendable so the cruelty was a you know the death rate was much higher [noise]\nThe ah the conditions and circumstances of slaves lives were much more dire and I'm ... you know quite horrific to have to to do that research but some very important for me to show what that was like\nThe main character booked a is George Washington blood who goes by the nickname wash\nAnd he's a field work around those plantation but one day he gets a call to go serve the that the main house for dinner which is a terrifying prospect\nUm but the masters brother is their name is Christopher wild it goes by church there's a lotta nicknames and uh he's a naturalist and he's building a hot air balloon and he requested washed because assistant mainly just because he's like the right weight he's as for ... for the balloon\nUm and it's a moment the changes washes live forever because a bond forms between him and this was white man church\nA church will eventually help wash a skate but it's such an arbitrary moment an such an arbitrary change in the van this boy's life and not arbitrariness forever hearts wash\nChristopher does choose Washington because he sees him as\nBeing helpful to his experiment and that he is you know precisely the right weight a demand is arrow stat or which is you know kind of a cruelty and itself to to look at somebody and I think it out of them but then Washington many um surprises him\nWith his natural gets sick he has no\nNo idea you know that this this young man is just completely you just don't naturally a gifted at a drawing and um he has a a you know good sense for 'em or an article methodologies and and all of this he really comes into his own uh under touch\nBut um you know there is that sense and part of what I was trying to suggest to explore\nA into ... character is you know although he's an extremely liberal minded men for his time ah you know there are limits to his to his thinking that he is in a lot of ways still tethered by a certain ideas and notions a\nOf Sarah [noise] you know he's an abolitionist so he truly has a very general belief in the rights of men it's kind of a prescribed belief but in terms of applying this personally to people it's a it's a little bit more difficult for him\nRight in his argument for trying to end slavery is that slavery won't allow people to get him to have him if they allow such cruelty\nYeah that's one of his his main um ideas about it and you know this is central to his a philosophy\nSomebody who very much does feel a great affection or comes to feel great affection for Washington and so there's that dichotomy in his personality that so interesting to me\nSo they'll wash the skates from slavery and becomes a free man he not free from the time he lives in ... you know it was haunted by his time on the plantation and I think one of the points\nYou're getting up in the book is how much freedom is available to someone born into slavery and also how fear that people complicit in slavery the slave economy\n[noise] yeah exactly I think that can teach for instance\nLike to believe that because he has these in my ideas that he is and because he's actually trying to do something to end slavery itself you know I think he has a sense of himself as being quite a moral person and\nThis is Ninety point three WPN Len Nashville public radio Ninety One point five WTO mountains of Houma and Ninety One point seven W.

that Sunday and in the months leading up to that you know my fiance at the time gene I'm now my wife she'd be over and and my mother my grandmother is hooked up to oxygen and\nWe always had thought that she just had a bad bladder 'cause she was always excuse herself to go to the bathroom and you know like you know she's smoking right with the oxygen around her\nAnd it's oh gosh that's dangerous though they were so lucky the house didn't explode\nYeah so do you think your grandparents or different people and they were raising you then when they were raising your mother\nI Know they were I Know my my my grandmother and my mother did not get along\nAnd and I think a part of it was a ... my mother was their second child there first daughter\nAnd I really felt there was a lot of jealous when my mother felt this that there was a lot of jealousy that my grandmother surely had for my mother Leslie because that took Joe's attention away I'm\nJoe when Leslie always had a tight bond surely and Leslie's relationship was always front\nAh surely was also drinking to a lot of them um she should drink quite a bit when I was young but she was never really drunk on weekdays and she was drunk on weekdays quite a bit when my mother was young\nYou know had recurring nightmares as a town about monsters would you describe the nightmare\nThis recurring dream where I was in the middle of a field and on the outskirts of this field you know where they're just force and these tall\nLike like almost like naked alien zombies would would slowly come out but if I made eye contact with the monsters they would freeze\nBut the problem was I was surrounded by these monsters\nAnd so while I Would maintain eye contact to freeze one monster the monsters to my back would approach me so I'd have to spin around and make eye contact with those monsters but that of course would free of those other monsters and they would start creeping in every dream ended the same way in which they were on top of me\nAnd I vividly remember those dreams and and yes there in there in the book and and those were difficult to draw because um you know you're writing out scenes is one thing when you have a series of letters that make up words and make up sentences\nBut visually they don't look like anything but sketching out this book was difficult because you're facing these fears are facing these these nightmares or you're facing these people once again\nWhen do they stop these nightmares\n[noise] probably some time just before high school I imagine I met remember how I remember having them throughout elementary school and it's you know the way I went to I went to ... school in Worcester, Massachusetts and back then was kindergarten through eighth grade so I was at the same same school same building for all those nine years\nYour grandparents later told you that they often open up the bedroom door and find your sleeping right outside of it um did you have anybody to talk to these nightmares about\nNo no I don't believe I ever spoke to anyone that any of the trouble is you know my grandparents grew up in the great depression and they they you know it wasn't generation and so they certainly weren't the kind of people who thought you should talk about your problems I mean\nI'm a therapy would've been significantly helpful for me as a kid and and um and I go to therapy now and I'm open about that to help a distant ties you seeing someone was talking to somebody\nOn a professional level um and that's where for me are was such a saving grace because uh I I did work out some of these issues in my sketchbooks and and in my drawings\n... art classes and then you're in high school at the list or art museum and your your grandfather paid for these classes because he knew how absorbed you are with your with your drawing\nYou were really proud to tell your teacher that you had read a book about how to draw like marvel comics mhm and your teacher did not have the reaction you expected to do your teacher saying\nHe was the best piece of advice any teacher has ever given me throughout my education and I remember I can I brought in this book was so excited you know I thought I was get extra credit I read the whole book\nAnd without missing a beat he wouldn't even let me finish my thought his face turned just had like he just looked he had a grave look on his face and his name is Marc Lynch and he said forget everything you learned\nAnd and by that what he meant was that the that particular book really had like okay this is the way if you want to work for marvel this is how you have to drive ... this is how you have to draw muscles [noise] this is how you have to ask\nAnd so he as an as an educator of the art and specifically use teaching comic book classes you know he he would just see these young people are judging their talent based on the kind of comics they were reading\nSo he really helped me realize that a ... a comic doesn't need to be superheroes and it doesn't need to be drawn just the way the artist or drawing them professionally at and in that moment ah and and back then this was now the early nineties those thoughts\nReally figured you'd have to go and work for somebody else and drop somebody else who's character so that advice by by Marc Lynch really set me on this path of oh I could do my own thing and somehow carve out a nice little life for me doing just what I Want to do that's a possibility\nAnd he tells you you had your own style and that you should develop that he did that upset but did you learn anything nevertheless from the marvel comics books Oh absolutely you know from the how to draw like marvel comics with that though was actually useful for is\nCertainly a there's a lot about gesture so if you're having a character say throw a punch you want to be extreme you know the the punches like really real back or the punch has been fully blown but not right in the middle so and it definitely had a lot of good points of um [noise]\nYou know framing you're shot you know are there still a lot of value in that book and I still have the book um\nBut in regards to art style I think any sort of how to draw book I think one should be you know rural one is just have your own style [laughter] donate you ignore everything you're about\nMy guest is Jared J. ... his new graphic memoir hate kiddo how I
