oh he's a quid vacated\nIn spite of the evidence presented by American intelligence agencies and journalists when other reporters who has broken stories that have revealed new information to the public about that interference and about connections between the Trump campaign and Russia\nIs my guest Greg Miller\nHe covers intelligence and national security for the Washington Post\nThis year he shared a Pulitzer Prize for national reporting now he's written a new book called The Apprentice Trump Russia and the ... version of American democracy\nIt's a chronological narrative connecting many of the most important stories on the subject and adding new reporting to those stories\nGreg Miller welcome to fresh air is your story that you helped break the you consider the most consequential story of candidate or President Trump and his administration what\nI mean there there are several um\nStories of obviously many stories of the Washington Post broke that I had a a hand in one way or another uh ... obviously working very closely with some terrific an amazing colleagues here\nI think the one that jumps out for for many people as the story a that said that that former national security adviser Mike Flynn had not been honest about his conversation with the Russian ambassador Sergei 'cause there\nWe wrote the story saying that he in fact had discussed lifting of sanctions on Russia in those conversations and then lied about it to the White House or to news organizations including our own and to the American public\nUh and this was the sort of just one of many huge stories that we broke during that time and a couple of others that I was involved and include\nThe revelation that the CIA had reached a secret conclusion that Russia was not just trying to disrupt the election was ... was trying to help elect Donald Trump\nAnd then later when Trump was in office I broke several stories about his rough conversations\nWith foreign leaders ah we had the transcripts of some of those calls and the story about his um revealing of highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister in the oval office\nWith a ... or I guess that I really do have consequences Flynn was fired so and was fired within days yeah yeah so you know you helped write the story that Flynn\nHad cause with the Russian ambassador to the U.S surrogate Kislyak telling Kislyak that the Trump Administration would lift sanctions elect don't worry about it\nUh the sanctions imposed by the Obama administration and these cough happened\n[noise] did you face consequences did you get troll do a lot as a result of having a mask this lie\nI mean the ... ... ... ... absolutely so troll the lot attacked a lot um and that has not really a beta [laughter]\nI mean that that continues now not just for me but for a lot of reporters covering the ... that that's really highly politically charged time where we're living through\nI'm On the other hand we're things happened that had never happened to me as a reporter um several of us started getting\nCarts actual letters in the in the mail a thanks for readers from far away places um notes on on our even on my doorstep at home I Would walk through the neighborhood and suddenly people would stop me and thanked me and\nI mean that was that was felt great too and it was odd it was something I had never experienced\nWell let's take a short break here and then we'll taxing more if you're just joining us my guess is Washington Post reporter grant Miller he covers intelligence and national security he's part of the team that shared a Pulitzer this year for national coverage his new book is called The Apprentice\nTrump Russia and the ... version of American democracy we'll be right back this is fresh air\nMm [noise]\n[noise] um [noise]\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Greg Miller Washington Post reporter who covers intelligence and national security he shared a Pulitzer Prize this year and now he's written a new book called The Apprentice Trump\nAnd it kinda brings together a lot of stories about candidate and President Trump and the Trump Administration series that have been reported by meller and other reporters at the Washington Post\nYou know you're right in the book that Trump has avoided consequences for offenses that were long considered politically fatal often by lying in the face of overwhelming evidence Flynn however had noticed that community I was interested in that you used the word lying\nLying when used in the same sentence as Trump [laughter] is very controversial in the journalism world because mine implies intent\nYou know a fall to is when you speak something that isn't true line implies that you know it's not true and you're saying it anyways\nSo people are just weighing lack is worthy of using the word lie or not so you've used the word lie so I Want to ask you about how you decided to use it\nYeah I mean I feel like um it is a difficult\nDecision and we don't we don't throw that word around lightly we um we often get criticized at the post for being too reluctant to use that word and I think that's true to other news organizations as well but at the same time\nI mean we're here at this moment are you know we have a fact checker at the Washington Post who has documented\nFive thousand or more fall swords from this president since he's taken office many of them are false words that he repeats despite repeated corrections public corrections repeated efforts even by his own staff\nTo um to correct his misstatements I mean there is an intense I don't think there's any doubt that there is an intent or that it is part of\nIt's part of Trump's per se ... very complex personality it's part of it and it traces back to his origin as a as a as a public person um I mean we have run fascinating stories here at the post about a times earlier in his career when he would adopt\nPhony per sodas and call reports for Forbes on the phone and try to lobby them into inflating his net worth for magazines in magazines annual rankings I mean there is a there is an intense here and I don't have any doubt about that or or real any hesitation when appropriate from using the word lie\n[noise] after Flynn resigned under pressure um each spoke to Devin noon as the Republican chair of the house intelligence committee\nAnd you say that what he told you was basically the opening of what became an ongoing siege by Trump and his allies to discredit the FBI what did he tell you\nWell this is at a time when we're trying to figure out well we now know that Flynn had discuss sanctions would the Russians was basically cutting a deal behind his government's back with Moscow\nAnd not just raised a lots and lots of questions about well who else was in contact with ... with the Kremlin during the campaign if anyone rights that were there was digging by our news organization and many others and this was a conversation with the chairman of the house intelligence committee Devin Nunes has\nWho has who is read into all of the most sensitive intelligence on questions like this\nAnd I was asking him you know what else is there we are seeing lots of indications contact between Jared Kushner and and officials from Moscow and other members of the Trump Organization we already knew about Paul Manafort of course\nAnd he says that the FBI has been looking at this and all and it's all a dead trail\nAnd I pressed him because I could not believe that he was saying that there was already abundant evidence of contact you could say that that was incidental and meaningless\nBut he says it you know when I pressed him not even pizza boy delivery contact and it just struck me at that time that that was\nSo implausible that he was you know he was trying to throw sand and our eyes basically uh in my eyes as a reporter he was trying to um protect Trump and that that was um more important to him in that conversation that adhering to the facts that had already been established\nMy guest is Greg Miller who covers intelligence and national security for the Washington Post and\nHas written a new book called The Apprentice Trump Russia and the ... version of American democracy we'll talk more after a break and TV critic David being Cooley will consider had the season premiere such Saturday Night live and sixty minutes covered last week's

I'm not going to trust and not and I'm an anonymous source [noise]\nUm so what are your own rules what are your guidelines for using an anonymous source and for how to use them and and and also like who knows within the editorial hierarchy at the post who those sources are so they can be confident and do any fact checking that's necessary\nSo that's a great question Terry and it's really an an a really important one\nAt this moment because we do depend on anonymous sources um for a lot of the stories we do and frankly if we weren't able to use anonymous sources\nWe would really be unable I think to give our readers in the world an accurate picture of what's happening in the U. S. government inside the Trump Administration inside the CIA or abroad\nAs Bob Woodward says over and over again I Want when we say anonymous source the reporter knows who the source as it's the ... readers who are kept in the dark about the SARS but it's not like you know ended up leaving yelling you the information\nThat's absolutely right these sources are not anonymous to us um these are sources that um we know who they are um many in many instances their sources we have known for many years and have developed trust in because of how reliably they have given us information\nUm and you know frankly even in that case when we're writing sensitive stories I we talked earlier about the the Mike Flynn story and how we ended up\nHaving nine separate sources there's no magic number nine was not the magic number we had to get to to be able to go forward with the with the publication of that story could have been two or three it's more about the caliber of the sources their their positions and whether they have access to the information that they are providing\nA how trustworthy are they how much do we know about them inside inside the Washington Post there are lots of conversations at varying levels of specificity about that sourcing so sometimes you might be asked well what does the position of the ... where is the source and coming from from the story\nUm who are we talking about here and you can you can basically describe their positions in government\nSometimes if it's highly sensitive senior editors are going to want to know\nMore they're going to want you to identify your source and that you know that sometimes can get a that can get touchy depending on the nature of your agreement with source they are source be\nBut it's something you know ultimately despite you know we we all of these accusations and criticisms of our reliance on anonymous sourcing\nI mean the the record just sort of holds up the stories that we've written over the past two years attributed mainly to anonymous sources of almost all proven overtime to be accurate I mean there might be mistakes at the margins here or there were a news organizations aren't perfect and and then can we do make mistakes but\nAnd I know Marty Baron executive editor at the Washington Post talks frequently about you know the post and other news organizations um are always trying to get it right\nBut at this moment in our history where we are under such attack all the time and accusations of fake news\nYou know there's extraordinary care given to getting the facts and even the nuance exactly right\nIt it's really it would really be damaging to not just the Post's credibility and my credibility as a journalist but to the broader\nUm journalistic community if whenever we get things wrong there's a lot riding on the media right now in its ability to do its job and do it well and do it right let me try to give you one more example of\nThe reporting environment that we're trying to operate in just how much pressure we're under as reporters how much pressure our sources are under a as well um there came a time this past year when the Justice Department in Congress released the memos that former FBI Director Jim Comey had kept\nEvery time he met with Trump every time he meets with Trump something happens troubles him he goes straight to his computer type supplemental to record what ... what transpired\nOne of those talks about a conversation he had with Trump in the oval office and most of the coverage about that memo focused on their interactions about what Trump wanted him to do in terms of backing away from the Flynn investigation\nBut Trump has also complaining to call me in that in that setting\nAbout the leaks that are plaguing him at that point early in his administration he's complaining about how are people Howard news organizations learning what I'm saying into this phone and he points to the phone on his desk and the oval office\nHe's complaining about stories and he's talking as I read this memo I realize he's talking about me he's talking about the stories that I had written for the post\nCombing is talking about yes I agree with you sometimes it's great to put somebody's head on a hike as an example the Trump goes on a joke about putting Trump goes on to put joke about putting just said he believes reporters should be put in jail or in jokes about how once\nReporters spends a little time in jail they're making new friends suddenly they're willing to talk\nIt's a really disconcerting moment for anybody in journalism anybody who cares about journalism um but for me it it it was just eerie um to to think that he's talking specifically about stories I had written for the Washington Post\nThey're talking about heads on pikes reporters in jail chasing down sources it was it was unnerving it make you afraid\nWell let me let me put it\nIt made me afraid I I was confident enough\nIn my ability in in how I approach sourcing that I wasn't worried about that I work for a news organization that has my back um and that's a good feeling\nBut it is frightening anyway Kerry and I remember talking about this at home um when I saw this memo describing this document to my wife and what was in it\nAnd our seven year old was at the table with us and he heard me talking about it and using words like jail and he's following this conversation and I maybe it was being too careless as a parent and bringing the subject up in front of him but he started to cry\nA he started to get really worried and asked whether I was going to be put in jail um it is frightening it's um\nWe're just trying to do our jobs um we're just trying\nFulfill the role that the founders and vision for for the media in this country and it's an important mission\nMiller thank you so much for talking with us and thank you so much for your reporting\nThank you\nGreg Miller is the author of the new book The Apprentice Trump Russia and the ... version of

by focusing on three departments energy commerce and agriculture\nIf you're thinking that this is about boring bureaucracy consider that as Lewis points out the government manages a portfolio of risks that no private person or a corporation was ever able to manage ranging from forecasting and warning about hurricanes the national weather service part of the Commerce Department\nLotions have our own nuclear weapons one of the energy department's many responsibilities\nMany essential positions and the Trump Administration remain unfilled and some of the key positions Lewis says I filled by people who are uninformed about what areas they're supposed to be overseeing well others have conflicts of interest that political views that make them antagonistic toward the department or agency they're leading\nLewis started writing about this in articles published in Vanity Fair Greg Miller welcome to fresh air is your story that you helped break the you consider the most consequential story of candidate or President Trump and his administration what\nI mean there there are several um\nStories of obviously many stories at the Washington Post broke that I had a hand in one way or another uh

calls and the story about his um revealing of highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister\nLooks it looks like we're having a technical problem there and we played there on tape so we are now going to hear my interview with Michael Lewis sorry about that Michael Lewis welcome back to ... explain what the fifth risk is\nSo Wilbur Ross ... did you were you surprised at the choice of him to head the department of commerce since as you say commerce has more to do about data and I don't want to sound a just here\nBut I'm data and how it's collected and how it's interpreted has is changing so rapidly\nAnd I have no idea if he's kept up with what data means anymore\nWell we know he was falling asleep in meetings where he was supposed to be learning about the department and I know the people who try to explain to him how the department worked came away and these were Republicans who who were brought in to try to explain how the department work to have found that he was really utterly disinterested in anything betrayed so\nEven if he was an eighty he just wasn't particularly interested in the mission of the department additive at\nWhat became very curious is that the exposure of his finances they put them in a bad order with the White House you know he had to declare its financial holdings ... when he was nominated for\nThe job and it turned out he had two billion dollars less than the forms ritual is to calculated him having and four of us who watches this investigation discovers that he'd been aligned to the fore rich list all\nWhich then apparently caused

much attention being paid to what's happening in the White House and to the Mueller investigation and now to um the Kavanaugh's confirmation story\nAnd not as much attention is being paid what's happening on the cabinet level on the department level and I'm Wondering if there's a lot of action happening\nIn the department level like the three departments you write about you know agriculture commerce energy that most of us aren't paying that much attention to even though it's it's being reported on\nBut it's not it never seems to be like the sexiest story\nAnd never will be and that's the problem is like\nCourse we're not paying attention to the thing that matters most\nThere is this enterprise that is not a triple a prize the society we ... doesn't function without the government government is is it's been subjected to decades and decades of abuse and scorn in his collected rough and this guy has come in with a sledgehammer\nAnd is is having at it and nobody's paying much to know he's paying much attention because of slow moving story and this to me you know\nOne aspect of the fifth risk is the go a lot of the risk that the government manages\nAre very long term slow moving risk climate change would be one of them income inequality ... would be another ah cleaning up uh you know horrible toxic waste sites that can pollute rivers and\nRuin lives in another they are all kinds of examples of very slow moving problems that are dealt with in a slow way but they require a long term approach\nAnd on top of this enterprise has been has been thrust is very short term\nAttitude I mean the ... the Trump Administration has incredible kind of living from news cycle the news cycle and the public is go along with it and that's the that's that's the frightening thing to me\nAnd you see a lot of action happening as a department that all that kind of level of government where things are being done we positions aren't being replaced where people are being appointed who aren't really um appropriate for the position\nAnd people and they're people who have the ability to dismantle critical functions of the government who also have a financial incentive to do so because they have some conflict\nSo let's get back to the Commerce Department which you write about in ... three ask the kind of spam includes the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in L. A. Noah and you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department Israeli Noah first of all what they're doing in the Commerce Department\n[laughter] it's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent of its for sixty five percent or so of the budget it goes to this one thing I Know it eats the Commerce Department and they simply don't National Weather service as a National Weather service is a bit and now there was a ... is the biggest part of no\n... and how do they get their back in the seventies or Nixon was contemplating a reorganization of government and\nUm he was going to put the no ... in the department of interior and the secretary of interior of the time came out against the Vietnam War next next and got ticked off and just shoved into the Commerce Department is an act of vengeance so if there doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there\nAnd it is it's the single most important institution within the Commerce Department\nA and it does it eats most of the resources and it and what it does um is absolutely critical and er into this place Trump is put the most really about the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nAnd you're talking about Barry Myers who is the C. E. O. N. accuweather I that sounds actually like a good fit he runs a weather Prediction Center okay [noise]\nI'm so here's the problem\nAre typically the person who runs NOAA has as a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's a ... you know as a giant science operation\nUm the problem is that the national weather service or which has been a ... a fabulously\nShould I mean people don't pay much attention to it but but but weather prediction has gotten generally\nDramatically better over the last few decades we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings a faster than we used to be able to give them\nAnd I mean ... and just the you know the daily forecast has gotten better uh all of that saves lives and property or if that's the mission of the national weather service to save lives and property to do it it has to\nCommunicate with the public uh it it has to let the rest of it as it has to be good at communicating with the public and Barry Myers a has been on a two decade mission to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the public so that accuweather\nCan do it instead and that's how accuweather gets paid and so he has had bills introduced in Congress just actually forbid the national weather service from from doing anything but warning ... right in advance of a a a weather event that might kill you at the problem with is is that\nWell in the first place if the the the the the data that that is required to generate weather prediction\nIs all paid for by the taxpayer I mean that that these billion dollar satellites that are hovering over us the uh the ... the ... the network of radar stations across the country that the national weather service spends the bulk of its money accumulating the data that it didn't make it available for free\nTo companies like accuweather so that they can go and you know advertise the whether there's no real reason why the taxpayer should have to pay for this twice\nMy guest is Michael Lewis his new book is called the fifth risk we'll talk more after a break and Terry Gross and this is fresh air [noise]\nSupport for

part of the court landing team will send a list of Seventy four questions he wanted answers to Seventy four questions to the department of energy what were some of the questions\nHe wanted lists of uh names of anybody in the department who attended meetings that were associated with climate change\nHe was trying to identify people who might be hostile to the fossil fuels industry I think so the department didn't actually respond by giving him the list of names but he ... the bigger point was\nHe came in in what were they interpret it as a hostile spirit I'm signaling that the new administration was not did not approve of various attempts the department of energy was making to wean us from fossil fuels and it is you know part of the department of energy's mission to\nEngage in and fund basic research in alternative energy\nSo you know your previous book about the science of of risk and about trying to kind of clout to find a way how the human mind works when it's assessing risk that book was called the undoing project do you feel in a way that your new book could have been called the undoing ... because in some ways\nDepartments and you know I and the Trump Administration are getting on ... ... there aren't a lot of people to replace the people from the Obama administration yet and some of the people who have been put in positions to run those departments are antagonistic toward those departments\n[noise] so yes but there's actually there's actually a direct connection between the undoing project my last book and this is what got me into this book in the first place [noise] one of the insights that drops out of the work of the psychologist Dan economists and Amos diversity who are studying the way people judge risk\nIs that when you changed the odds people don't sets it especially with catastrophic risk you take something that it is a one in a million chance of it happening\nAnd change it to one in ten thousand people don't feel that and I was thinking of that when Trump came in and approached the federal government the way he did because\nOne way of thinking of the federal government is is this vast portfolio of risks many of them potentially catastrophic risk the risks of a pandemic or are the risks of a a nuclear accident or the risk of a terrorist attack or the ... I Want to after\nAre not risk that most people are thinking about the risk that the nuclear waste site in half or Washington leeches plutonium into the Columbia River and poison the whole Pacific Northwest and I thought Trump's approach\nIs effectively taking lots of you know one in a million or want to know how a hundred thousand risks and making them more likely making them all more likely\nBecause he's putting people in charge of the risk you don't know anything about it and I thought this society doesn't feel it it kind of interest you showed you that people don't really feel this and that insight is what got me going in the first place\n[noise] so you used to work on Wall street lay back in the day and you wrote about that experience in your first book liars poker last month mocked the tenth anniversary of the financial collapse of two thousand eight the market has more than recovered over that time\nBut some people are starting to say this might be another bubble um\nHow are you interpreting having written a book recently about risk and having you know been having written about the financial crisis what you've done I'm I'm saying what your thoughts are about whether we really are now in terms of financial stability and and and world markets\n[noise] well um I think the question the question you're asking me to predict the bad things going to happen next\nWell I I Know that's not really your job but\nNo it's not my job but you know if I ... I I Would love to have one ... outlandish prediction on the record not that I think it's going to happen but like it's a sort of thing that if it does happen I think a lot of people will go oh my God that's exactly where we were headed all\nAssuming Donald Trump remains president for a while\nI think there's at least the possibility of the risk\nThat he will try to default on the American debt selectively like he'll say or the Chinese are trying to sell their treasury bonds is causing disruption in the treasury bond market they stole money in the first place from us we're not going to pay the Chinese back this is a a larger way of saying that\nI think the risk now in the financial system is political risk\nI at the banks are much better capitalizing better regulated and they were ten years ago I don't think there's going to be a directly a banking crisis but I think there could be a crisis in faith in the dollar and in us credit worthiness our deficits are exploding\nWe have a president who has a history of defaulting on debt\nHe's riled up lots of emotions hostile emotions to foreigners who hold the debt I'm a ... that wouldn't shock me and that would trigger a financial crisis or so\nAnd if you're curious about financial crisis\nWell because the dollar is the world's reserve currency lots and lots of people hold it assuming it's going to be more or less stable\nThey'd be a flight out of the dollar a U.S treasury bonds of the benchmark for a ... of risk a risk was asset in the world would everybody kind of measures themselves off of it's assumed to be\nYou know better than gold if that if that is called into question and then treasury bonds are going to collapse in the interest rate which the U.S government can borrow is going to skyrocket\nUm this is the doomsday scenario and I'm just kind of playing with it here but if you asked me to like\n... predict what might trigger a the next financial crisis I think it's I think I Would predict it some sort of political event and it would be that sort of thing and if that happened you know it's fun when you predict things funding sort of predict things where where ... when they happen they make

the federal government under Trump\nA lot of the government as a often dismissed as being a bureaucracy that slows down anything\nSo I was down enough and prevent anything from getting done and that it just like layers and layers of of bureaucrats have like managers and I'm too lazy stupid people is it has your has your understanding of like our bureaucracy change through writing these stories\nOh my God I so I didn't know what I was going to find when I start knocking on the door of the Energy Department or the agriculture department the Commerce Department\nAnd I turned out having exactly the same experience that political people have when they're appointed to these jobs running these places and have these if some preconception but vague preconception of what the bureaucrats are like um this happens over and over again that that a new administration comes in\nIf they have kind of contempt vague contempt for the people who were there and four years later they walk out and say those are the most amazing people I've ever worked with I I expected to be briefed and be you know baby kind of informed by these people I did not expect to be inspired by them\nThe kind of person
