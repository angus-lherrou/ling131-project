outcome will determine who controls the house and the Senate in this very divisive era as well as who governs key battleground states the results could be determined by who has the right to vote\nSince the ... election over twenty states have adopted new restrictions on voting such a strict voter ID laws cutbacks to early voting and aggressive purging voters\nSince plenty fourteen hundreds of thousands of people were purged from the rolls in states that have a so called use it or lose it policy which you lose people from the rolls if they haven't voted frequently enough\nIn Georgia alone that policy purged an estimated a hundred seven thousand voters according to a new investigation by American Public Media's investigative unit\nAnd twenty Thirteen the Supreme Court struck down the heart of the voting rights act\nBut current ballot initiatives in several states could make it easier in the future to register to vote in those states and to crack down on gerrymandering\nAnd I guess Ari Berman has been covering developments in voting rights and voting restrictions he's the author of the book give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America\nHe's a senior writer for Mother Jones are reporting fellow at the nation Institute and there's also written about voting issues with the New York times magazine and Rolling Stone\nAri Berman welcome back to fresh air before we talk state by state and get into specifics is it a coincidence that there are voters being perjure asked for IDs ideas that many citizens don't have in several states\nIt's not a coincidence and let me just give you the big picture of what's happening with voting rights right now\nSo since the twenty ten election\nTwenty four states have implemented new restrictions on voting so nearly half the states in the country have tightened their voting laws\nTo do things like require strict forms of photo ID to cast a ballot or make it more difficult to register to vote\nOr to cut back on early voting periods or to close polling places or to purge the voter rolls and many of these restrictions on voting are playing out now in the ... elections in critical states like Georgia\nNorth Dakota Kansas et cetera\nWhere there are very close elections\nSo is it a coincidence that all of this is happening [noise]\nIt's not a coincidence this has really been a major strategy within the Republican Party\nAfter the two thousand eight election when Republicans gained control of a number of really important states in twenty ten\nThey began to introduce a wave of new restrictions to tighten access to the ballot than those efforts were basically given a green light by the Supreme Court when it removed a critical part of the voting rights act in twenty Thirteen and the Shelby County versus hold her decision\nInstead of those states with the longest histories of discrimination no longer had to approve their voting changes with the federal government that allowed states in the south that previously had to prove their voting changes with the federal government\nPlaces like Texas and Georgia North Carolina in Alabama to implement these new restrictions on voting so I think you're seeing a national effort\nBy the Republican Party to try to restrict voting rights and it's playing out in the states all across the country\nSo we've talked about the current election in Georgia where Brian Kemp the secretary of state is also running for office\nSo let's take a look at Kansas where the secretary of state is also running for office in this instance it's Kris Kobach who's running for governor what are some of the ways in which he's restricted voting rights in Kansas\nAnd not just any secretary of State Kerry I Would say that Kris Kobach is the most high profile secretary of state in the country and he has really been the leader\nIn the Republican Party when it comes to restricting voting rights this is the guy who was named vice chair of Donald Trump's election integrity commission which was formed in a very high profile way and then shut down before it actually did anything but it requested voter data\nFrom all fifty states which set off a huge fire storm last year Kobach was the guy who told Donald Trump that three million people voted illegally in the twenty sixteen election no legitimate evidence has been put forward by Trump or Kobach to support this then the less Kobach is really the guy who was formed intellectual case\nFor restricting voting and what he's done in Kansas is a few things he\nWrote a law that was passed by the Kansas Legislature called the safe act\nThat did a few concrete things when it came to restricting voting the first thing it did is that it required proof of citizenship to register to vote meaning that you had to have a a passport or birth certificate or naturalization papers to register to vote\nThis law blocked one in seven cans ... almost thirty five thousand people from registering to vote in that state's the federal court actually struck vat\nThat there was almost no evidence of voter fraud in Kansas to justify the potential disenfranchisement of tens of thousands of voters so so that part of the law has been struck down but another part of the law of voter id law where you have to show government issued id to be able to vote\nThat part of the law remains in effect and I looked at the numbers in Kansas\nAnd over twelve hundred ballots have been tossed since Kobach was secretary of state of Kansas because voters showed up at the polls without having the right id\nBut Kobach only won his primary his Republican primary by three hundred and fifty one votes and now he's locked in a very close election with Democrat Laura Kelly\nWho's a member of the state Senate and independent candidate Greg Orman\nAnd even the smallest reduction in turn out to shift the race and call box favor and the government Accountability Office did a study of Kansas voter id law and they found that Kansas voter id law in twenty twelve and it was first in effect reduce turn out by ... percent\nIn that state with the largest drop off among black voters young voters and first time voters and these are all people that are going to be less likely to support Kobach than the traditional Republican base\nYou say that Kris Kobach was actually the source of President Trump's false claim that millions of people voted in legally in twenty sixteen and if you compensate for all of those illegal votes Trump would have won the popular vote and not Hillary so what is called that do to plant that idea\nKris Kobach met with Donald Trump after the election basically ... was a disappointing for a cabinet position he was under consideration to be head of the department of homeland security\nAnd the ... study not a very legitimate study but nonetheless it was a study that he gave Donald Trump that purported to show that three million people had voted illegally in the twenties sixteen election and shortly after this meeting with Kobach\nTrump tweeted that millions of people voted illegally and when I interviewed Kobach for the New York times magazine last year he told me that he was the source of Trump's claim\nAnd showed me this study that purport to show this however when the author of that study who was a professor at Old Dominion university testified in a federal lawsuit challenging Kansas proof of citizenship law\nCalled Buck's own expert disavowed that study and basically said it didn't show anywhere near that three million people voted illegally\nKris Kobach has also been an advocate for a new question to be added to the census and the census might not seem like it's actually a voting issue but it is a voting issue called back advocated for adding a question about citizenship are you a citizen [noise] um how does that\nApply to voting rights\nIt's a huge issue because census data is used to draw voting districts it's used to draw districts for state legislatures its use to draw districts for the U.S house it's used to determine\nHow many electoral votes each state has so the census was instrumental when it comes to voting and what happened according to court documents\nIs that Steve Bannon at the time the chief strategist to Donald Trump\nCalled commerce secretary Wilbur Ross who's in charge of running the census and says I Want you to talk to Kris Kobach about adding this question about us citizenship to the census and what Kris Kobach told Ross is he suggested wording for the citizenship question and then he said\nIt's needed because right now in his words illegals or being counted when it comes to representation I I don't want to get to tactical hear Teri but the the way that districts are drawn\nEveryone in a given area is counted when it comes to drawn a district in deciding what level representation an area should have what Kobach wants to do is restrict those districts to only counting people who are citizens if you did that\nAreas with lots of non citizens places like Texas and New York and California would have much less representation\nThan places where there's a lot more citizens if Kobach has his way\nDistricts are going to be drawn only based on citizenship what that will mean is that will be a major power shift to Republicans because generally speaking areas lots of immigrants tend to vote democratic if you exclude them from counting than despite the massive demographic change we're seeing\nIs that the districts are gonna become more conservative and this question about us citizenship hasn't been asked on the census since Nineteen fifty and there's a tremendous fear that if it is asked\nLatinos Asian Americans other minorities whether documented or undocumented are going to be afraid to respond to the sense is that the areas where these people live will get fewer political seeds less money less political representation than they otherwise what an affair and accurate census\nSo where does that stand now this question\nRight now there are six different federal lawsuits challenging this question the most high profile lawsuits is being led by New York and sixteen other states and basically what they're saying is that this question is going to have a major league suppressive effect\nOn people responding to the question that you're going to see how many people are afraid to give their citizenship on the census because they're worried about Donald Trump's immigration policies and they don't want to tell Donald Trump what their legal status\nIs and that's going to affect the entire senses and so if the centrist is unfair to centrist is inaccurate and so many things to the census does is going to be unfair and an accurate as well\nMy guess is Ari Berman author of give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and senior reporter at Mother Jones\nAfter a break we'll talk more about voting restrictions and ballot measures that may expand voting rights and look at the Supreme Court with Brett Kavanaugh on the bench and how it would likely respond to cases pertaining to voter suppression in voting

Americans in the state can't vote because they have a felony\nConviction so ten percent of people in the most important swing state in the country that has routinely decided presidential elections aren't able to participate in aren't able to vote in twenty Eighteen and this ballot initiative would restore voting rights to up to one point four million people in Florida\nThat would be the largest infringement of new voters since the passage of the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five so despite all the suppression we're seeing in Georgia in North Dakota and Kansas in other states\nFlorida has a chance to give the right to vote back to more people than at any time since the Nineteen sixties and and that's the good news that help doesn't get drowned out by all the bad news\nSo Rick Scott the governor of Florida who you described as the chief enforcer of the felon disenfranchisement law he's running for Senate against three term incumbent mouse and\nHe is and so here you have a situation where the architect of a policy that has disenfranchised one point six million ex felons in Florida is running for office and the people disenfranchised by rex\nHim and previous governors and Florida have restored voting rights to many more people than Scott has Jeb Bush the governor of Florida restores voting rights to Seventy seven thousand ex felons\nCharlie Crist Jeb Bush's successor restore voting rights to a hundred and fifty five thousand ex towns in Florida Rick Scott has only restored voting rights to three thousand people in Florida\nDuring his eight years as governor so he has implemented this felon disenfranchisement law in the most restrictive way possible and it's not just his race Florida could also elect\nThe first black governor in their states history Andrew Gillum but you have a situation where five hundred thousand half a million disenfranchised African Americans\nAren't able to vote potentially to elect the state's first black governor\nSo in the past have certainly been a lot of voting related court decisions that have\nBeen appealed as high as the Supreme Court the Supreme Court now has added Brett Kavanaugh not to the bench what's his position on voting rights he\nHas from the cases we've seen a pretty alarming record on voting rights heat up out of voter id law from South Carolina and twenty twelve that the Obama administration had opposed and said could disenfranchise tens of thousands of minority voters in that state\nBut a cabinet wrote the majority opinion upholding this law\nAnd he basically said that even if there was no evidence of voter fraud that states could enact new restrictions on voting and that sets a very broad precedent\nFor Republican controlled states like Georgia like North Dakota like Kansas to enact new restrictions on voting and even if there is no evidence\nOf the kind of fraud that they are purporting to crack down on\nThey can uphold these measures as legal ... even if they just say that they are intended to in ... words or promote the integrity of the election and so he is going to be joining\nA very conservative court already this was the same Supreme Court remember and Terry and twenty Thirteen that got at the heart of the voting rights act\nAnd he is going to be less open to potentially striking down these restrictions than his predecessor Anthony Kennedy who was already pretty conservative on these issues was and so now we're facing\nThe most conservative court on civil rights issues since the Jim Crow era and there is a tremendous amount of fear that Brett Kavanaugh is going to give a green light to the kind of voter suppression efforts that we're seeing playing out in the ... election right now\nThe chief justice John Roberts is now considered to be the swing vote in the court with his record on voting rights\nIt's amazing to me that Roberts is now considered the swing vote on the court when he has really been the most aggressive advocate on the court\nFor limiting voting rights and this goes back many years when John Roberts was a young lawyer in the Reagan Justice Department all the way back in the Nineteen eighties he led efforts\nTo weaken the voting rights act that was a key part of his portfolio and then when he joined the Supreme Court he authored the twenty Thirteen decision that got the heart of the voting rights act and ruled that those states the longest histories of discrimination no longer needed to prove their voting changes with the federal government Roberts mocks the idea\nThat voting discrimination was still widespread pervasive and his words and in fact everything that we're seeing right now which seemed to contradict that the fact that there are so many new barriers to voting\nBoth in states that were covered by the voting rights act place\nOrange says that weren't covered by this one provision of the voting rights act like Kansas the fact that there is such widespread voting discrimination that we're seeing right now which seem to argue not just for keeping the voting rights act intact\nBut if anything strengthening it to have more protections against voting discrimination but instead the Supreme Court did the opposite and voting rights advocates are extremely worried that all of these new restrictions on voting when they go before the Supreme Court are basically going to be upheld\nThe argument for voting restrictions is fraud that you have to do this to prevent fraud if you look nationally and voting fry how pervasive hazard than\nEvery study shows that voter fraud is a very small problem in American elections not non existent but incredibly rare that from two thousand to twenty fourteen according to one study there were only thirty one cases of voter impersonation out of one billion votes cast\nSo even in states where there are no voter ID laws like New York where I live it's a very difficult to commit fraud in New York but we do is we sign our names at the polling station and they have to check\nThat the signature on file matches they signature that were signing when we go to vote well if I wanted to commit voter fraud in New York in a state with out of voter id law I Would have to find a voter\nI Would have to know what their addresses I Would have to know what their signature looks like I Would have to know that they hadn't voted already\nAnd I would be facing potentially five years in jail a felony conviction a tremendous fine and I would only be shifting one extra vote after all of that\nSo it doesn't mean that voter fraud never occurs but the penalties for voter fraud are already very high the mechanisms that we have in place already deter people from doing it\nIf you try to commit fraud you're most likely to get caught and then you're are only shifting a very small number of votes one vote usually most\nAnd so what I see based on the data is that the number of people prevented from voting by restrictions on voting is exponentially larger than the cases of voter fraud were saying\nWell let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is journalist Ari Berman

somebody that you have to make millions decisions that day but I loved about feeling of collaboration with every little bit of the crew\nAnd sort of just helping to create like a space where we could all kind of go to work together and you're almost like parenting like you're just trying to get the best out of every body and I found that really gratifying\nIf you're just joining us my guest is

blood you gave such an amazing performance and this year\nYou're a teen evangelical preacher and a small port town in Southern California turn of the twentieth century um during the early days when they are discovering that there's oil there and\nUm there's an oil man played by Daniel Day Lewis is a bit of a con man and also of incredible capitalistic comes to town and wants to\nGet as much of the oil there as possible you want some money from oil and you and have become antagonist\nAnd in in one scene in Oregon here he's basically told by one landowner that he'll sign over the oil rights to Daniel Day Lewis if Daniel Day Lewis agrees to be baptized by you\nAnd your makeshift church so this is a scene where you're ... him and I should just say parent that ugly\nThat the Daniel Day Lewis character of earlier in the film he's taken in a boy whose father was in was killed in a mining accident\nAnd then when the boy goes deaf as a result of another uh oil accident I'm Daniel Day Lewis sends him away to a school okay so here's the scene with my guest Paul day now\nDaniel Day Lewis\nShe's for celebration are you a student of\nThe laws cages you Julie I'm going\nTo speak to him it's All right\nJohn nice\n\nDo a machine [noise]\nCome here and you wrote and grows and wells but you have\nAlso brought your bad habits as your back lighter\nYou lost did after women\nAnd you have a band in your child your child that you raise your the band and all because he was sick at USC and she'll say now I Am a synergism should say it loud I Am a student and I'm a student\nLoan Daniel I'm a I Am a center I I'm Sorry I'm Sorry lord I watch the law of blood you have a band that your child\nI've about much I Will never backslide whenever but ... was lost but now I Am so lost but no I don't

what\nDo you do [noise]\nWow [laughter] Paul do you know and Daniel Day Lewis in a scene from the tea seven seven film there will be blood\nI'm actually mentioned you are the slapping sounds that you're hearing at the end of that scene that's Paul ... character like slapping the devil loving the devil out of Daniel Day Lewis\nA also getting even with Daniel Day Lewis was beating them up around there and in the film that that it's almost like this incredible operatic do what did you think of it that way when you're making it\nIt was sort of intense just to hear that you know that it's time for me I I'm Irish sort of cast the last minute mess and I started about four days after I was trapped in this part\nNew initially cast as the preachers brother\nYeah and then they moved due to be yeah the the teen preacher is that why does do characters ... became twins were they not twins and before we were just brother brother but now that you were playing both Ross so they saw something in you where they wanted you to play the bigger\nPart yeah I suppose so but you know why why so sort of sort of wire was going back there is is just listening that quick you know gave me um a few in which was I just remember the the two days before I started\nSpending went up to sun down in my church alone um you know he lives church and\nThat was a really sort of um beautiful couple of days just sort of trying to learn the script and make contact with the ... the parents\nI don't know why that's when I went back to\nIt was your idea to to learn your part while sitting in the church\nWhile I was just suddenly on location and I was like what okay how well they want to Monday and [noise] okay I'm going to go to church and learn what seems um [noise] it's funny because that quip to quite a long scenes so that was a sort of seen we film for all all day long and uh\nI Believe our first set up was probably some kind of wider let me some kind of master shop and uh I I slapped Daniel as you said in the end towards the on the scene think we're supposed to once we get that part just stop you know 'cause we're we're going to be doing this all day and\nAnd I remember ah the first take forgetting and just slapping him many times and as soon as we cut I remembered that I was supposed to stop\nAnd I went oh God um and I think I'd ... I even have to live in a rented as I Am and you know oh my God what is that and he just said that's how you doing\n[laughter] you know and I was like okay [laughter]\nMy guest is Paul dino he co wrote

dad you know\nAnd we found that totally I get it yeah unseen their core changes\nIn love and mercy are so beautiful and still unpredictable and um so what did you have to learn those words like you to know how to play those scores let alone the sequencing of them\nNo no no no and I really started from basics and um and that was just so beautiful to have the piano opened up to me through Bryan I'm because the voice things did he teach you the court's not Brian a guy named area and isn't as bad as um helped me out and uh you know just started practicing day by day\nAnd same with doing vocal exercises you know and and and that's a really nice routine for somebody preparing for something let's say let me do thirty minutes a day of of singing at first and in this amount of piano and slowly you know learn you learn your chops sort of build them up get comfy\nBut I'm the other really fascinating thing about learning through ... through Bryan as his left hand the bass notes\nReally incredible um and that's really what changes the court off and he's not always you know emphasizing the route note um would you would say if you're playing a genealogy she's often emphasizing a different um note or in the voice thing and that changes the entire sound of the court and it's actually something that I Believe Paul McCartney\nGot from listening to the beach boys and started doing as a bass player which was kind of quite revolutionary at the time\nSo for him in the music to not you know necessarily be landing on the ... you know really changes the feeling behind the cord and uh so I learned so much uh and and and I miss it you know listening to that\nI don't listen to them often because it really sends a chill through ... and you know I Do miss listening to his music\nWell
