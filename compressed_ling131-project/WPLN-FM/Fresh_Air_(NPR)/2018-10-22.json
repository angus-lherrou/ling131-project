done\nIs fresh air and Terry Gross my guess Melissa McCarthy is known for her comic roles and movies like bridesmaids and the heat and for her impersonation if President Trump's first press secretary Sean Spicer on Saturday Night live\nNow she takes a different direction in the new film can you ever forgive me which is based on the two thousand eight memoir of the same name by Lee Israel\nIsrael who died in twenty fourteen had a moderately successful career writing biographies of people who had fallen out of the popular consciousness like actress to the bank cat and gossip columnist Dorothy ... gallon\nBut after her biography of as stay laughter flopped she couldn't find a publisher for her next book about vaudeville star Fannie Bryce\nHer rent or her cats that bill Israel deployed her writing skills to forge letters by literary luminaries like Dorothy Parker Edna fervor no coward and the actress Louis Brooks and sold the letters to collectors\nReviewing the film and the New York times AOL Scott wrote me Israel may be the single most interesting movie character you will encounter this year\nLet's start with a clip from the film in which Israel confide your secret to jak hop a fellow alcoholic who scrape spy on charm wet and numerous scams in hospitals jak as played by Richard II grant each of these characters has an acerbic sense of humor [noise]\nThat wants to hold my friends a bit [noise]\n\nQuite by accident I find myself in a rather [noise]\nCriminal position I come from\nLast criminal activities of Austrians voted to crochet I mean [noise] embellishing [noise]\nDocument [noise]\nBeautiful trees\nLiterary letter writer [noise]\nLittle tricks lawn mowers\n'cause if you're not understanding the world of elite collectible literary artifact was was thrilling to be full gene pieces of paper to go ...\nI Am selling to come home she goes [noise]\nThat there was a waste of a secret I should've gone out they're not in Iraq and told the wrong because I get a better response because if you total run [noise]\nThat's the only one without [laughter] you\nKnow this McCarthy welcome to fresh air and love you and this new movie so congratulations on it this isn't really different role for you you play somebody who is very funny in a caustic sarcastic did her way\nBut I wouldn't call it movie a comedy and there there isn't any physical comedy ... in it and you're very our physical comedy so I Know you start in St Vincent an a dramatic role but do you consider this movie a new direction for you [noise] um I think it's a\nTicket for ... hand advance financial committed to the communities they serve by warning forty three fellowship since two thousand Fifteen deserving high school seniors more information is online at eight to four seven dot com [noise]\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Melissa McCarthy she's starring in a new movie can you ever forgive me which is based on a memoir by Lee Israel\nWho when she started being unable to sell new book ideas decided to forge letters by literary greats and make money selling those four letters as if they were originals\nSo something else you're very famous for as your role and bridesmaids and the most famous or maybe I should say infamous scene [laughter]\nBlend the bride and the bridesmaids get food poisoning as they're trying to like really expensive fancy bridal dressing yet um you know bridesmaids dresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms so you end up sitting on the bathroom sink in your expensive gallon that you're trying on and the whole scene is very intentionally gross\nAnd I'm Wondering how you felt about that scene because part of the of the scene part of a point of the movie is that you know women can do gross had comedy just as men can\nAnd it really wasn't the point of it oh okay ...\nNone of us felt that way about it and that that scene was actually kind of in jak did into the film\nKind of late into the process and I think at first everyone bristled data and thought we don't want to do this grossing for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't find it funny\nBecause it did feel like for lack of a better way to determine for more like a guy move and do you remember us talking about it and they said what if the the only thing that appeals to me does seem funny and kind of\nThe the type of thing you watching go thank God it's not me I said if we just play the ... the horror and the embarrassment of it\nBecause we are things like this do happen and I said if it's less about gross for gross and more about oh my God I Can't make the euro swallow me up\nAnd if you play I think how maybe more women would do it in terms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like yeah look at this we were all desperately even though we were friends with in the movie saying like\nOh my God look somewhere else like we couldn't escape it and then I then I think we started to reconcile with the facts of like it could be funny for the sheer sake of being like what is the worst thing that could happen to you and and how do you kind of like just like a horror movie get through it\nIs interesting to hear you say that 'cause the second half of my question [laughter] within it'd be OK some women found that liberating that you know women can do gross out humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality of by doing gross out scenes so you're ... really interesting because you're saying that's that's not really what was intended but\nIt wasn't intended it was really talked about because I'm I'm I'm not one for bathroom humor or stuff like that I think sometimes there's that\nWouldn't barest for the character and I think that's showing the character kind of going through such a vulnerable humiliation that\nWe can all laugh at it because in some way we've all done it we've all fallen said the wrong thing had some shaming thing done and I think I think at least for myself that that was the connection to that's a real human experience even if\nThat particular action hasn't happened to most people\nMost McCarthy something else that you're famous for [noise]\nIs um insults [laughter]\nInsulting oh no [laughter] I'm not real life or maybe in real life I wouldn't know no I don't know why are you not [laughter] but the most famous example of that is and this is forty\nAnd there's there's a feud between your teenage kid and ... and Leslie man's teenage kid and this becomes a feud between the three parents and they're all called in to meet with the principal\nAnd the ... the other ... couple have threatened you so you're all just kinda going at each other in the office so yes let's hear that same it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said that my son was an animal and then if I didn't keep him on a leash that he would hit him with his car\nDid you say that that's that's ridiculous who talks like that you do say or you know what I said was that we need to keep an extra our and our kids because with all the technological advances having to learn to use them responsibly\nNo no what he what he said to me was he called me and what language Catherine language I mean I can relate to what they do not balls to me unless I say it can you please not talk like that Catherine music manage for her thing next door so very\nAmusing man maybe if I look more like this fake Kabul was that there are bank commercial that's what you look like like your bank commercial couple none of this talk\nIf productive I Would like your and my legs and kick you vote in a job with my phone just really scaring me this is what happens in your corner corner me I Will shoot drew you to you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits roll at the end of this is forty uh it's just you kind of him and thriving insults in that scene in it and just go back on and on with more over the top insults is that's something that you're famous for outside like and the real world being able to [noise] to do really funny and self\nNo I Know I Do not go round insulting people um I Hope ever um I don't know if it's a cathartic part of the work that you know you do something so kind of like yourself and maybe it's why I don't do it in life I get it all out on a screen but\nYeah one of the first time I watched that back I kept saying I didn't say that I never say that and the first time a sitting with with that said we're watching you say it he said all of it and I\nI didn't remember saying most of it which made me feel slightly crazy and I was just trying to say ... anything that came up to the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything\nSo um you know maybe it was just that so much kind of free free word association that I didn't kind of logging into my memory\nHad you improv insults before\n[noise] yes I've had a\n... and only have played a lot of kind of very assertive um characters that you know I think in the heat\nOr especially part of part of the part of the characters DNA was just to literally say anything just to kind of ... people down and I think\nHer own authority so it was a big part of that character you're very impressive detective and that very aggressive detective um\n[noise] there is a fun to it I mean it would never want to do it in real life but it's part of the fun of getting to act you do\nThese things that you would never do your Boulder your harsher you know you're you're just ripping insults at someone and are there is if there is a fun to it because hopefully you know you you don't do it in your real life\nMy guest is Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new film can you ever forgive me we'll talk about growing up on a farm after a break and John Powers will

I. E. A. dot org\n[noise] this is fresh air let's get back to my interview with Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new movie can you ever forgive me when we left off we were talking about her early stand up comedy career so um did you perform at gay clubs\nI did duplex is one of my favorite places to reform I just loved it also because you know the heckling wasn't there which is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer than probably better than I did I didn't um [noise]\nWhen you went into a regular comedy club something that I really didn't like was there's this element there was always one\nOne guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go clubs club like are you actually the same guy\n[laughter] it was the always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like your job off [laughter] and you're just like what like what does that ever worked for you that any woman ever been like oh\nMy God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my chop off [laughter] like I just every time or something in that vein and especially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly shove now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it and they're going to keep doing it\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet you would have to kind of truly humiliate them not in a joking way because strangely just trying to indicate to them that like I don't want to do this I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane\nSo I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stopped talking\nWhat was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to a heckler God\nI don't think it was my favorite I think some more work the more I hated it um\nIt usually would dissolve into some kind of thing about oh you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not how was your mom's basement you know I've always kind of go down that road like this so surprising like can I get a show of hands from women who who is in crazy about this guy\nWeb streaming has made possible by David last gallery of fine art gallery located in the ... neighborhood of Nashville showing work in a variety of media by contemporary artists working in the southeast and beyond open Tuesday through Saturday current exhibitions at artists that David last gallery dot com\nOh no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who\nEven though I think she's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels like to his core\nAnd then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like so I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what's the first of all there is no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAt the Oscars if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there somebody there was a comedy club owner like tapping his watch and sang times so I Know there's\nThe light oh ever present or not to ever not be heated light that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the white man I Would have flash it at like ...\nYes and when that light flashes it is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know\nThe stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics ... you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like a whole my God it's a really big deal yeah\nAnd ... other people's time here stealing it yeah you're taking it out or they're going to get less but the first time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something much to my surprise and as they laughed he flashed the light from the booth\nAnd I thought it was kind of a non verbal applause from the manager kind of like ... like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up because I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on the laugh\nTo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great [laughter] so I kept talking in the late kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me he is really encouraging me and then I\nI got up to finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me I'm In a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I and I truly didn't know\n[noise] so you you're one of the women who has taken on like producing and and writing films and has been an attempt\nTo make sure that you can act and material that means something to you that you care about and give yourself good roles because\nYeah I think it's often hard for women to get good roles [noise]\nI think it is and I think you know I don't think a day goes by where I don't realize how lucky I Am and I never minded how much extra work I always thought I Want to be a part of making these three dimensional flawed\nYou know often challenging but to me really real women I just thought so many things I read ... kind of\nI don't even know what in the in the breakdown you would describe them as pleasant I was like I don't know how to play pleasant like what it who who cares there's nothing to think your teeth into it's like [noise]\nAnd they have a nice relationship and their houses I just thought oh my God like who who wants to watch that I don't I didn't want to play it and I also thought all the people I Love and like\nAre filled with\nQuirks and eccentricities and isn't that why we always love or even disliked people take we're we're a bundle of all these different weirdness is and so often I I've I felt that everything I read for female character was really bland and and\nOften a bummer just kind of everyone's having fun and then in would come to a woman to go like car all\n[laughter] ... feel I thought oh my God how many times can I just randomly walk into a room and say the guy's name I'm like why does and she ever walk in and go like what's going on this is fun [laughter] why she always a bummer\nI just I didn't know how to play it I felt like I don't have the skill set to play this 'cause I don't know why she's doing it\n[noise] I'm Wondering if you feel that you've been affected by the me too movement\nWhich you know I mean like Harvey Weinstein fell several actors\nTheir careers or at least temporarily ended because they were ousted for assaulting Oregon Ratzinger mental behavior yet to two women so like a as somebody who is both you know as an actor a writer a producer has the kind of\nChange and climate been meaningful\nFor you can you feel the difference do you feel that women are being more empowered and Hollywood now\nEvery little inch I Will take every centimeter forward it will take I think the more we talk about it and the fact that it is becoming less acceptable\nYou know I think I think the treatment of of women just can't be dismissed you can't treat half the population\nSo poorly and have it be like me you know boys there has to be repercussions and it's happening in all fields which is what I think is so important about me too it's it's branching out to everyone it's all women that need help that need money for representation it's saying that we're all in it together and\nI think the more we we linked up and in ... strength and numbers it can't be for the worse\nWhen Melissa McCarthy I Want to thank you so much for coming on our show I've greatly enjoyed it I Love you in your new role and can you ever forgive me and let's continue the conversation some other time [laughter]\nI Would love to this has been a just a dream I Love the
