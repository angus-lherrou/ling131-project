Frank ... own at this time of his death out there last include all the buildings that had been transferred from Fred Trump to the children\nThey included both the buildings that had been transferred down to one city owned it was it was pretty much as ... empire and it sold them you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York developer name or be shown in the price tag was just over\nSeven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learn through the ... the documents that we went through the thoughts sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars and what the banks would value at out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that that empire was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much less\nSo it wasn't like the ... century that down Donald Trump may it definitely wasn't just the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the IRS\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely got away with it so it's true that the virus actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe're describing the story I mean in fact the IRS ours did push back some and especially on the lower valuations they've placed on buildings and made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning from three million more bucks\nOn that return but the way it really works in this world is you have you know you've got\nAn agency that is pretty over matched\nOverworked an auditor who can walk into a session and can extract a few million dollars that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy families who are the most expensive legal and accounting helping who can gauge in these very sophisticated maneuvers to\nAvoid or evade taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more of the request of an odd or\nThey're looking at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more meanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of\nSimply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard but budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at just going to state tax returns\n[noise] um so then I'm going to ask you to choose either the art of the deal the art of the comeback or The Apprentice\nAnd tell us what was actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the show based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals\nI'm thinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David order to come by [laughter] go for it [noise] [noise]\nAh well for the publishers are coming back in Nineteen Ninety seven minutes this story of a sort of you know pulling himself up I'm Out of the mark of his casino collapse\nAnd through shows grit and determination and why are we negotiating skills getting himself back on his feet well within a few weeks of the publication of this book\nSo happens to coincide with the time when you actually took possession of one quarter of his father's\nReal estate empire through one of these very elaborate tax schemes that we describe in the story\nSo at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the map it actually cause it's perfectly with the moment when he was just taken possession of twenty five percent\nOf this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way\nNot a word of that made its way into the book the art of a comeback\nI'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice and the song money money money money\nThat happened in two thousand and four\nI'm right as the sale had gone through the the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Trump and yet when you watch not opening scene it's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane as there that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene that fried Trump belt and paid for\n[noise] I'm Wondering how\nYou feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the mess of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and his great negotiating deal making\nAbilities\nAnd so many people still believe the math and Donald Trump is still putting\nForward in that it's interesting when I think about that I think you have to sort of I go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stock\nAnd I think that we've ... I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken I think a good first stop in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think that the power of the story is\nYou know I think the whole careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents off I think it's really hard to refute the story um it's harder for you because it's absolutely true and the documents are there and in a lot of them are the source documents of the Trump family themselves\nUm but I think it will take time for us to sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um but I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times those basically sealed off to everybody except that the three reporters working on\nThis story and all the documents that you drew from that you've got access into were locked up in this room [noise] um ... who cleaned it who is allowed\nTo clean up [laughter] we uh we did not have a cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody this I did come in one day with a with a little documents and [laughter]\nI thought it was great but we uh yeah it was uh just the three of us for a year\nUh yeah it's a pretty messy [laughter] for a little ... little Custer phobic Shiite imagine [laughter] but other people now are you were locked up in this room [noise]\nUm actually if people knew our our editors new but I think there was a lot of sort of a mystery mystery surrounding it we are kind of kept to ourselves and uh yeah it was it was difficult everybody you know the people keep asking you what you're up to and um but we uh we tried to keep a lid on it as best we could well thank you for your reporting\nAnd thank you for telling us about it Suzanne ...

chefs first her conversation with David and Nick chef recorded in two thousand date she started with a question for David\nCan you talk a little bit about how your son's personality changed when he was using the F\n... he became unrecognizable or he was from being\nYou know just one of the most sort of light filled extraordinary people that I knew and he became\nThis coast a sort of coming in and out of the house I mean physically he changed you know he lost your skin and bugs and he was\nJittery and and then his behavior changed I mean he went from being as a ... sort of a charming lovely kind open gentle person was ... he became belligerent and angry and depressed and argumentative and he did things that were just inconceivable that he would do\nIn your memoir how ... year you were or are still\nAre in an atheist and raised in it without religion um did your eye to\nEye to felt guilty that you asked me about what I felt guilty for I felt guilty for that too when we heard from some people that the only way to get sober and stay sober is\nTo embrace that and they try to broaden it by saying you know God can be whatever you conceive him to be it's a higher power and things like that it was an ethnic would say that it was just an excuse\nTo resist but I think ultimately\nI learned and I think he learned that you could not deny some of those basic principles including the first one which is you know Nick didn't agree for a long time it's just that he that he was powerless over his addiction he thought he was in control\nHe had to nearly died more than once before he finally I think except about and once you accept that I think you're in the door\nUm but I just I I think that that God thing you know in ... step programs and undercover I think ... is a huge problem because I Try I spent a lot of time trying so hard to practice prayer and doing all this stuff to make myself you know come to believe\nAnd ultimately you know when I sit with myself and the quiet moments you know when I'm Alone\nYou know I don't believe you know I think that for people who are just fundamentally you know don't believe in God or any you know reason to this world or anything I think that they are at at a disadvantage in terms of getting help through these these kind of programs absolutely\nCertain that the trip but but the other thing that I think is really important to ... we learned is that there isn't just one way there wasn't just one way to get healthier and sober and to stop using the first thing that they're telling me about when he arrived at this last program\nWhich he sat with a um counselor and the counselor said to him you know why are you here and by then he was a you know he was a perfect student of of of rehab and so he said what you know he thought the expected him to say which is I'm here because I'm a drug addict and an alcoholic\nAnd the guy said wait let's let's go now why are you a drug addict and alcoholic you know why are you trying to kill yourself that's what that rehab was all about it was about trying to figure out what was going on inside\nAnd that's what I'm you know ... everybody you know it's different for everybody but for neck I think that but I mean you know that's what he says that that that those three months were essential\nTo do that program not ... not rely on the higher power principle\nDidn't rely on it completely no I mean they there was definitely that was there and and now as a part of that but um\nThere was a lot of experimental therapies and stuff that they did there and you know I sort of got to really go back and re experienced some of the traumas that I experience growing up and I'm sort of relive them and and grieve them enough for the first time really ... allow myself to grieve them\nAnd to come to understand who I Am an end to learn you know tried as it sounds or whatever to to learn how to how to love myself and\nMyself you know I I don't at all now I Love my life and stuff and yeah it doesn't have anything to do with a higher power for me but as for a time people it does I'm certainly not you know dissing anybody that feels that way absolutely\nDavid did you find that you know something that you could describe as a higher power\nI learned to define it in in a way that worked for me which is a it's something about our humanity I Would when I went to ... I was told by someone\nBefore this is over you believe in God that didn't that transformation didn't happen to me but I Do believe in prayer it is the way it was a way that I got through I never planned to pray I never said I'm going to\nPray I'm going to do what they told me about all of a sudden they were part moments where I found myself praying and it was a way to get through ... what is pretty mean to you if you don't believe in God\n\nYou know it's it's a it's a really good question and I don't even know the answer I guess it was it was it was a it was a reflection of how desperate I was that unconsciously without saying I'm going to ... I was saying please please please save Mac please help heal my son I don't remember that's what I found it to myself over and over and over again [noise]\nUh and it was way be that way just to stay sane and it just said focused on something that you know I could hold onto or maybe I was you know hedging my bats maybe I was praying in a way you know in case someone out there was listening\nNikki nicotine that there's I'm not part of what saved you from your math addiction was and degree a self knowledge\nThey were helped to acquire in your last rehab mhm and that I think was do we have in which you were diagnosed with having bipolar disorder which is basically manic depression um did that help getting a diagnosis and then getting the medication to deal with a diagnosis\nYes I I mean that's the you know it's a ... I think it's like very very subtle and you know I Am on two different medications and one of them is a bipolar\nMedication and it's yeah it's ... I mean I couldn't even tell you necessarily you know what the differences are or how it's helping me but I I think that ... that they it's definitely you know one little piece of the puzzle\nIn terms of learning how to be able to live with yourself you know a little bit more and yeah so I think that if you need it you know if you get a really good doctor that knows what they're doing you know and they can help you I think that's awesome after they\nUh Nick tells the story in his book that to me is so profound and it's done in just a beautiful way I think um [noise] he came to see us I'm Carrying my my wife and Jasper and daisy\nOr we were in this we haven't seen that for a long time and and care and said you know let's let's invite neck to join us we were going on a family vacation and send it came over to see us\nAnd we were hanging out we had a really good time it was you know we talked a lot and it was very open and he talked to the kids about what had been going on and it was you know sort of the apologize to them in a way that it's I think it was just so meaningful to them into caring and to me and\nWe had a really good time and then he describes the day before he was leaving he got\nJust really annoyed by you talked about you know he's ready to kill me and all of a sudden it hit him that\nTomorrow I'm leaving oh I'm that's what's going on here I'm sending my I I don't really want to leave part of me wants to stay here\nAnd be a child again it'd be you know with my family and\nSo I'm sort of ... and he's going to hell of a sudden he said he felt he said that I ... I feel better now and and he went back in the rest of the trip was was great we had a really nice last day but then he said what just happened he says another time in my life that moment\nWould have just been the beginning of a descent and it would have been the kind of dissent that rid of ended up and they're going out to have a drink or to get some pot and then some math and he said how could it be the fact that I'm On this new medication and I just thought it was such a beautiful description of the way that at all\nBoth of you on on on the books in Amish and variety neck and you know 'cause you could have good luck with some you know with continuing it and everything I I you know I Wish you wish you well thank you both so much\nThank you Terry Terry\n... about his struggle with

have to essentially commit them a police officer maybe half has to come and pronounce them a threat to themselves or someone else but still parents do have the legal right to get their kids into treatment did you ever do that\nI never had to resort to any kind of legal means of getting into treatment but still I had a lot of leverage\nYou know he was living at home he he would be desperate he would want to come home he would want help so he would call me up and he would be willing to go to treatment so I had some leverage I never had to do a formal intervention but people do them\nThey're dangerous or one of the pieces of advice I got over and over again from professionals is that they must be done by professionals by people are trained to do interventions they know what's going on and they understand the risks\nBut um I never had to do that I was able to get into treatment other wave but whatever it takes whatever it takes to get someone to treatment about what we got to do what were the other way well sometimes Nick would just get tired of being out there and he would be so desperate he would you know he ... he just wanted to\nGet off the streets you know it wasn't necessarily even life threatening um and so he was willing to go into treatment because that was my deal I'll come pick you up you know drive you a treatment center check you and\nAnd so he would do it um but as things went forward I mean the last time that relapsed you know he's been sober for a long time it was after ... can I talk to you on your show\nAnd you know one day we were together and he said I cannot believe what I did I was at someone's house just almost automatic I opened up the medicine cabinet there was a bottle of I could then I took one I thought to myself just one\nWhich is common for addicts to you know that's the first thing that they'll say to themselves and to us\nAnd soon the bottle was gone and he said\nI woke up this morning and realize that if I don't do something I'm going to be back on the streets within a week so he you know this was the first time I didn't have to say a word he got on the phone he called the handled and treatment center in Minnesota He was on a plane that day\nTo me it's possible to look back on that and say you know all the treatments before that were a failure here he was sober for such a long time and he relapsed again but to me it's the opposite it shows that the treatments has helped him so much\nThat he was able to recognize that he was in a freefall that it was so dangerous for him he he had learned what they teach in a lot of treatment centers this behavioral cognitive thing where you can interrupt\nEither the craving that would lead to relapse or you can stop a relapse early and if you can you know you've made so much progress one of the things they talk about with addiction is progress not perfection so yeah when they got in that play on that day\nI saw great great progress and since then he's been sober so\nAh it shows that it's possible I mean people think the treatment can't work a Knicks proof that it does [noise]\nSo let's talk a little bit of that twelve step treatment programs you have a lot of experience with them because I think Nick had been in a ... step program is probably going to you know a ... step program for parents\nAlgernon yeah yeah and then you visited them just as the search for the book do you see you see you know positives and negatives with the ... step program\nSo I think most people know what the positive\nA part time but what are some of the problems you have to stop the twelve steps or ...\nFor so many people but not most people and that's the problem that I have it's not what the twelve steps it's only many many rehabbed are based on this idea that the twelve steps are the kids are the only way to stay sober that's my problem\nSo my problem with the twelve steps is only when it's forced and it it's forced in many places Nick was kicked out of this and treatment programs because he wouldn't embrace the twelve steps\nAnd and so we have to understand that you know there are many ways to get sober and the twelve steps is one and it works for some people but there needs to be alternative\nBut I did go to Alan on meetings and what I found there was something different that helped me you know when it became addicted I didn't know other families who had kids who were addicts I\nI was ashamed and I felt that I was the only one and people telling me\nOver and over and over again go to Ellen on meetings got Al Anon meetings I Would sort of roll my eyes and thing I'm not going into one of those rooms where people are you know whining and sitting around in a circle and I walked into one of those rooms finally\nAnd I felt you know these are my people they know what I'm going through because they're going through it too so that comfort in that support was profound for me\nAlso going into these rooms you know I I was suffering so much inside and so I Would go through my day and I would have to put on his face that everything was okay and I had to work I go to my younger children daisy and Jasper school and and you know I had to keep it together\nI walked into these rooms and I didn't have to keep it together I was allowed to just sit in the back and feel you know whatever it was this just terror and other people were feeling and then I was able to cry and I was able to\nYou know there was no pretty tense and those rooms there was this openness it didn't make things go away but it made it easier to get through some of the days\nOn a positive note [laughter] and and if it's okay like ... if not prying into your son next privacy he sounds like he's doing really well now professionally as well as a person that just gives all update on his life is that's not prying too much\nIt's it's not I mean this is really you know I think he's great what can I say he's he's an unbelievable person I mean the obvious dad and so I'm I'm prejudiced but he\nHit extraordinary has just this lovely person he helps a lot of people getting stay sober I hear from people all the time you know kids who say I read next book I heard him talk and that's why I've gone into recovery\nIs really healthy he exercises every day he got married to this woman that we adore you know they were best friends when they were sixth and seventh grade\nHe's writing like mad he just had a novel or accepted\nSo you know we're just so lucky where this little lucky I'm I mean all these other things are are great but the main thing is that he's alive there were so many times when I didn't think he was going to make it\nGave a check thank you so much for talking with us and I'm pleased to my best regards to your son that I spoke with him once [laughter] on the show and I'm I'm so glad he's um he's doing well thank you thank you very much about Terry thank you so much", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "19"}
