for skateboarding and skateboarding so sensitive to being portrayed in film by outsiders\nAnd that's understandable because it's often butchered but when I was maybe nine or so skateboarding gave me a real sense of especially more my early teens gave me a real sense of community outside of my home\nAnd I think a lens that I ended up seeing a lot of life through which is you know taste in music close um [noise]\nThe treatment of authority and just a sense of perverse closeness or they just made an impression on me\nSo I'm the group of skaters who you were friends with our aspired to be friends with what was that culture like\nIt was a lot of different things you know I was always terrible I always wanted to be great I think I still would trade a lot of achievements for certain

going to be a great skateboard her but you\nUh yeah as a matter of factly okay and I loved it and it was there was such bombastic personalities such twisted sense of humor now with a twenty year lens

pain in my life\nAnd more emotional [laughter] good for you [laughter] yeah I'm\nI'm at my scars aren't have scars are inside [laughter] ... yeah and just the general recklessness which are related

and he's known for starring in movies like Superbad\nMoney ball and the wolf of Wall Street\nI Want to ask you again about all The Simpsons scripts that you wrote when you're a kid did you ever try submitting one of them\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting them\nWould you be willing to share a story line or a joke from one of your early script\nHere's where I'll say I think the strongest episode was I was in a file since a young age and my parents were incredibly ah let's just say how would I put it\nThey encouraged me or let me watch movies beyond my age because they saw how interested I was in film so perhaps ignored the content matter if certain so [laughter] but I maybe should have waited to see till I was older so I had seen the godfather to really young age 'cause it's my dad's favorite movie\nAnd I wrote a Simpsons godfather spoof\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten now I think is a I I was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the analogy between the characters from the godfather and the ... and The Simpsons were clever for a nine year old\n[laughter] who was who\nMarge was Don Corleone [laughter] because I have a nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer so she would be the chess player sort of quiet low key chess player that would become the dog\nNo excuse me she's Michael so OK okay barges Michael a grandpa Simpson is is Don he dies right away though so Marge is Michael way to ... and\n... know Homer see that would be that would make margin Homer siblings so even in my nine year old mind I knew that was not going to work so Homer is\nA K [laughter] I like Ike Lewis Diane Keaton like why are you going to go legit you know [laughter]\nBut ah Lenny and Carl homers friends from work or when he was afraid to do and Carl was sunny\nAnd I don't know I mean it's not actually clever but for a nine year old I was like wow it's interesting that you have the um fishing or the or or even I guess the wherewithal to know who would be the character equivalent of who tend\nTo think of that story and character in that way and to make connections between things I I think that's pretty great what are some of the movies that were beyond your age as a kid that your parents let you watch because you love movies so much\nI'll tell you story that I I find interesting because\nI mean I saw everything I devoured film like I continue to I Love it so I'd ran through so many films and I would go to the newsstand and you know your parents take you to the magazine stand when you're a kid and you flip through magazines or if there's a magazine she on the corner and they're out another place or something\nI Would look through the film magazines I was just so interested so I Would ask them often can I\nSo basically it came down to two films that I wasn't allowed to see [noise] um they said we're so mean you you don't even realize how lucky you are you cannot see kids and you cannot see a clockwork\nOrange well kids is all about kids similar to the kids in your movie\nAnd it's a seminal movie in my life kids is a huge influence on me as a filmmaker but this film is in the opposite of kids where kids is so beautiful and it's ... and it's the world ending tomorrow burn the world down\nAnd this film mid nineties is all about connection and hope even if it's dysfunctional connection and hope and\nThose are the two movies I wasn't allowed to see so of course I made it my mission to see both of them right away I think I was eleven or twelve how did you do it\nUm a friend of mine who ... who was older had both cassettes at his house\nAnd I saw kids and I was like I Love skateboarding I Love New York this is about kids skateboarding in New York I completely was too young to understand the AIDS subplot or main plot I guess\nAnd so I completely wasn't affected by that so I was just like this is the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life it wasn't till I was older than I understood\nThe HIV aids plot Marta ... couldn't win over my head so I just took wow this is subversive and this is dangerous you know [noise]\nAnd then I saw a clockwork orange and I had to go to my parents like a shell of a child and be like you were right I saw it [laughter] any disturbed and I need to talk to [laughter] like\nYou know like a ... I Want to do is tell them that I disobeyed them but I was too shook up not to speak to them about what I had seen what shape you also about the film\nI think the raping ultra violence was just too of course it was to have you so so hard to watch as an adult let alone a kid what are your parents say to reassure you [noise]\nWell first of all they were like you should listen to us because we're telling you this stuff for a reason yeah and then of course didn't for many many years and realize they were trying their best I think\nUltimately it did make me braver as an artist in life because I Do think about that and I think ultimately there's something about me that draws me two\nThings that are difficult and maybe I'm uncomfortable with comfort and I think my acting career says that when I really dissect it as well\nMy guess is Jonah Hill he wrote and directed the new film mid nineties about a group of skate boarders in their mid Nineteen nineties we'll talk more after a break\nAnd marine card in will review a new book about Emmett Till a fourteen year old African American whose murder in Nineteen fifty five in Mississippi galvanized the civil rights movement\nI'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air [noise]\nThen you've our family foundation supports WHYY is fresh air and its commitments are sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation [noise] support for NPR comes from this station\n[noise] I'm from western hotels and resorts westerners committed to the wellbeing of travelers with offerings\nLike having leave adds a super foods are ex menu and gear lending for one workout years left behind at home [noise] west and let's rise learn more western dot com [noise] and from the NPR wine club where members receive NPR inspired\nLines like weekend edition cabernet and wait wait don't tell me Murillo available to adults Twenty one years or older learn more at NPR wine club dot org\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nAmong a group of teen skate boarders in the mid nineties [noise]\nYou know it's been interesting to like first the kind of\nLike I'm coming to manhood onscreen 'cause she was started in your teens I'm super bad you a lot in your early twenties yeah\nAnd and now and like in the past I don't know bunch of years five six seven years you started playing more dramatic roles\nYou know in films like Wall Street and Moneyball how did you get the word out to film directors that you are interested in making the transition to more dramatic well [noise]\nJust by choices you know um I had seen the puffy chair which I loved and I reached out to the ... brothers after super bad came out I was like I Would love to work with you\nAnd they gave me this part in Cyrus which is a film that I Love is that um was a great experience with John she ... she told me and then in ... and then Bennett Miller was making money ball and Catherine had talked about me to ban it and then bet it's off Cyrus and cats\nThen in the interim or\nI continue to do some comedy films that were funny and fun and then a\n... heard about the wolf of Wall Street and I asked you audition\nAnd um\nI knew that was going to be a fight to get that part but I I knew I wanted that part really badly and then when I wanted to write and direct I think I had a lot of opportunities to do that if I wanted to make a mainstream comedy\nUh\nAnd when I really thought about it I was like wow things in my life are happening that are intense\nAnd am I going to be happy\nJust doing what is expected of me or what my heart really want so I have to figure out who I Am I have to figure out how to love who I Am\nAnd I have to figure out what my voice is as a filmmaker and when I looked to my heroes like Mike Nichols or Barry Levinson or people got started on comedy and ended up having great filmmaking careers\nI looked at their first films and a lot of times they came from a really personal place and they weren't just funny they were they felt like life and they felt like all the pain and joy of life [noise] why don't you hear a\nScene from a Wolf of Wall Street\nWhich was directed by Martin Scorsese and written by parents winter who was also the show runner for the HBO series Boardwalk Empire\nAnd so this this this is a movie that I'm a based on the story of Jordan Bell Ford who was a corrupt stockbroker who made his fortune in penny stocks schemes\nAnd eventually went to jail for for fraud and in this scene Jordan played by Leonard Leonardo DiCaprio is in a diner and he's approached by Donny A's off played by you\nEventually becomes a business partner but this is their first meeting um so you start the scene [noise]\nMe [noise] such a gun on here [noise]\nAnd I try to\nA feel for what you do actually I just you know call\nWhen you're only thing I think we live in and building\nSwell fools ... there's a little ...

to Trump appointees Neil Gorsuch who replace the late Antonin Scalia after Mitch McConnell block President Obama from choosing Scully a successor and Brett Kavanaugh who replaced Anthony Kennedy after Kennedy retired\nNow the chief justice John Roberts is also considered the most likely swing vote in a court that has five conservative justices my guest David Kaplan says the court has reached the point where justices are often seen as political proxies of the Republican or Democratic Party\nHis new book is about how the court became so politicized and so powerful\nOf the justices the book is based in part on ... interviews with several of the current justices as well as past justice is sixty five law clerks who worked at the Supreme Court and congressional and White House officials dating back to the Reagan Administration\nA lot of the interviews were done on the condition that he not named the source Kaplan is also a former legal affairs editor at Newsweek where he covered the Supreme Court for a decade his new book is called the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court's assault on the constitution\nDavid Kaplan welcome to fresh air\nSo one of the main themes of your book is that the court has become so politicized you can predict tell each justice will vote it's become politics by another name elaborate on that idea for us\nWell on those hot button issues like abortion and same sex marriage and voting rights and gun control and campaign finance you pretty much know ahead of time where they're going to come out so the larger question I'm trying to asked in the book is whether the court ought to be as interventionist\nAnd as involved in American Life\nAs it is and enduring for example the recent Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings you heard questions about specific issues like abortion or presidential power\nBut nobody asked whether the court is properly involved in so many of these political and social issues because everyone pretty much assumes a that it ought to be\nIn what sense do you think that the court is overstepping\nThe court docket is almost entirely discretionary the justices decide which cases they want to hear and too often they choose to hear cases involving issues that I argue would better be left to the political branches that cheaply means Congress\nOr state legislatures and they do so for a variety of reasons but I I think the thread that runs through [noise]\nThe views of most justices most of the time and I interviewed a majority of them for this book I interviewed the my background I can indicate which ones I interview that was the terms of the deal I the attitude you get is if not us who will do so some will look out the window in point of the capital\nIn such areas of the law I don't think you'll see Kevin recused himself anymore than Clarence Thomas ... part of that is it's hard for justice to recuse himself\nOr hurt herself at a lower court you can always substitute in a new judge you can't do that\nOn the Supreme Court there nine justices if one doesn't sit in the case then you're down to eight they don't like even numbers of justices but we'll we'll Kavanaugh bend over backwards in in such cases to try to undo the concern people have that's\nSuch dime store psychology is beyond my pay grade they're certainly isn't any indication in his opinions to date of a bias but you know his performance after Dr Ford testify\nTalking about how this was a vast left wing conspiracy the Clintons and all that even if he apologized for try to in the wall Street Journal op ed piece I think that in some respects\nA leaves him\nIn an even tougher position than he might in a sexual harassment case there are a lot of cases it if they don't involve the Clinton specifically obviously they involve politics and a cabinet or you could argue showed huge true\nPartisan shelf in that twenty minutes of testimony I Would be justice concern in that area\nWhat kind of cases do you think that might influence\nWell you could imagine campaign finance\nAppeal coming up they're going to be more of those and depending on who brings it\nYou know are are there Republican interest where their democratic interest I think even if he's not in fact biased the appearance of by a bias is a real one\nHaving said all that there are all kinds of reasons of course to criticize justice Thomas's performance on the court for the last Thirty years and I do so in my book but I'm not sure you can point to a lot of cases in the area of of\nA sexual harassment or regulation of the workplace 'em and say that\nThomas ruled the way he did out of ... or bitterness from his hearings back then\nI don't know if this was after last February or not but last February they lived in New York magazine cover story headlined the case for impeaching Clarence Thomas with stories of other women besides Anita Hill who had stories of sexual harassment ... um regarding Clarence Thomas\nSo it's um it's a story that keeps you know coming back to life\nIt does and some folks could argue that maybe it was silly generous it was unique and it was dated but the Kavanaugh stuff brought that all back\nTo light and as you point out now we've got two justices under a cloud separated by Thirty years that is really bad\nFor the court it's bad for the courts prestige I think it helps to an end feeble Congress we have a lousy Congress for any number of reasons but one of the reasons as various congressmen and senators would tell me they don't act is 'cause they know that the justices across the street will act and I also\nElections and the way that we saw in two thousand sixteen twenty twenty five percent of Trump voters said they didn't like Trump's temperament they didn't agree with the with a lot of what he said but they voted for him simply because of the Supreme Court\n[noise] so um it in terms of how politicized the court has become\nI'm President Trump supported Brett Kavanaugh through the hearings and Trump insulted Christine Blasey Ford who made the allegations of sexual assault [noise] are you concerned are their concerns out there that Kavanaugh will feel beholden to Trump and therefore\nCome to conclusions in ways that support the Trump Administration when the Trump Administration is involved in that case\nI think they're all kinds of legitimate bases for criticizing Cavanaugh I thought his testimony\nAfter Dr Ford was appalling I thought Kavanaugh's performance of the press conference the White House was a ... of a justice but I think the notion that now that he's on the Supreme Court he's going to feel beholden to the president who appointed him is misguided one of the great aspects of the system\nWhich has lots of laws is that once you're on the bench and have life tenure you really don't have to look down Pennsylvania Avenue with any degree of loyalty because the president can't do anything\nAt that point other than tweet so I think by and large most justices or throughout history have\nSuccessfully proclaimed and demonstrated their independence from the president's so pointed them look at the Nixon tapes case in Nineteen Seventy four were unanimous court ruled against Richard Nixon that doesn't mean you kind of a friendship\nWith the president and various FDR appointed justices remained friends with FDR butter on my list of criticisms of and concerns about Brecht cabinet or the fact that he's grateful to this president I don't think will affect his decision making I think most justices most of the time\nOnce they're up there they're free and clear\nI hadn't known of Brett Kavanaugh before he was nominated to be a Supreme Court justice but you write that some people some insiders were surprised that he wasn't on\nTrump's first list of a potential nominees the one that the one that that ended with the core such nomination and you say some movement conservatives\nCalled Kavanaugh\n... milk toast to lacked guts and again this was before his nomination this was during the course that nomination why was he called ... ... ... to lacked that\nOh the they would say he was such because of an opinion he wrote in one of the Obamacare cases where he didn't reach out and strike down the statue which is what the movement conservatives wanted instead he said\nThat his court the federal appellate court in Washington or should not be hearing the case deciding the case at that moment on procedural grounds there was a technical issue that we we ... I won't go into details on but he wrote what I thought was a measured\nScholarly legal opinion saying the case isn't quite right for us it's a timing issue I thought it was a good solid opinion do I remember that doesn't matter but I think he was taken out to the woodshed by a lot of movement conservatives who said why didn't you do\nOr the right thing here and that was the chief strike\nAgainst them now I happen to think that Kavanaugh on the court will wind up being less of the arch conservative that Thomas and Alito\nBe I Would predict the capital will be closer\nTo what passes for the center of the court that chief justice Roberts is now the swing vote and I think he's institutional wisdom his affection for the court and for its own reputation may lead him in ... on some occasions\nTo rein in the courts power in the way that chief justice did decisively show\nIt'd be Obamacare ruling upholding the statute back in two thousand twelve I think Kavanaugh will\nVeer on occasion closer and then in that direction than for example Neil Gorsuch\nMy guest is David Kaplan former legal affairs editor at Newsweek and author of the new book about the Supreme Court\nCalled the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court's assault on the constitution we'll talk more after a break and Ken Tucker will review singer songwriter ... new album I'm Terry Gross and ...

author of the new book the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court assault on the constitution he's also former legal affairs editor at Newsweek\nSo we have to Trump appointees on the Supreme Court now Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh Justice Scalia\nWho was replaced by Gorsuch uh was an originalist\nWhich means uh interpreting the constitution as it was intended to be interpreted by the founders when it was written\nAnd not considering it a document that has to be updated for the times that we live in and Thomas considers himself an originalist or a texture lest I say that not really understanding the difference between those two\nTerms but um is Gorsuch are Kavanaugh an originalist or texture list or do they not subscribe to that point of view\nI think they would both call themselves card carrying originalists and to some extent ... having said that I'm In my book originalism is bunk because even original is\nOnly use originalist originalism when it suits them when it doesn't suit them they ignore it I think it's a lot of nonsense and of course the most important thing\nAbout the whole original is a a a a trope is that if you look at the constitution and I've read mine a lot there is no cause in the constitution that says Val show interpret me based on what you thought those who wrote in\nIt's nonsense was something you say about originalism is that because you're trying to literally follow at the founding fathers meant when they wrote the constitution\nAt a time when there was slavery at a time when women did not have equal rights\nYou say that originalism favor as a status quo fixed in the Eighteen century and it tends to favor the halves of that time and to this favor all other such as minorities and other unpopular lead against and maybe we can add women to that\nAll true but of course the constitution is not written as a set of regulations some constitutions the world are written that way when you use phrases like a equal protection of the laws or due process of law\nOr no unreasonable searches and seizures when you write things as such general terms you necessarily are inviting those who interpret you whether they are judges or presidents or senators I'm to use their own\nJudgments as to what it means that's why you write a constitution\n[noise] do you think that justice is in general have become more politicized in recent years than they've been in the past yes okay why do you think that is\nI think in part because the selection process that we use now and the better if more cynical\nA process that White House is used to pick nominees results in such candidates you know the Brett Kavanaugh is a competent judge show was Neil Gorsuch but they weren't chosen to go some of their stellar credentials those were unnecessary requirement for getting chosen\nThey were chosen because I thought they vote the right weight\nIn the same way I think that ... was chosen by Bill Clinton and it's so do some Sonia Sotomayor for example was chosen by Iraq Obama and you know you can blame presidents that are blamed the Senate but I I think you in the first since that you need to blame the court because it gets involved\nSo often it raises the stakes of who sits\nOn the court so if the court is in effect going to govern the country on so many key issues then you really need to look at how you think individual members of the court are going to vote when you do that politics the role of a politics necessarily becomes heightened it wasn't\nAlways that way when John Paul Stevens was picked by Gerald Ford in the mid Nineteen seventies\nAnd it wasn't for that reason and I could give you half a dozen a dozen other examples those days are long gone I Would like to see the return of those days\nDo you think that politicized politicization of Supreme Court nominees but includes how Mitch McConnell blocked Merrick Garland from even coming to the Judiciary Committee after he was nominated\nAbsolutely and and listen if the Democrats get control\nOf Congress of this this time around or in two years twenty twenty I think you'll if they can get their act together because they're not really good at playing dirty or you may see them raise the stakes you know they talk about ... about getting rid of life tenure at the Supreme Court that would require\nA constitutional amendment but if you want to increase\nThe size of the court pack the court as it were all you need is an act of Congress if the Democrats control the house in the Senate or the White House\nIn twenty Twenty one I don't think\nCourt packing is off the table at all and if you want to get back\nThe Merrick Garland seat and if you want to take back control of the court\nJust add to more seats a point to liberals\nWeb

people are ... it's a pretty good gig gig [laughter] yeah [laughter] um so the lifetime appointment issue has been challenged by many people because now that people are living to such\nOlder ages than they used to when the Supreme Court was first created you know and when the constitution was first written\nUm the president's power to appoint a Supreme Court justice that's become a much bigger power than it ever was ... cousin part of the extension of\nThe lifespan of Americans [noise]\nUm so you know some people including you have proposed changing the lifetime nature of the appointment why do you think we should consider changing it and what are some of the suggestions you have well\nWould lower the stakes of any particular\nNomination if for example there was a single term of Eighteen years as many others have suggested in which I endorse I think that would lower the temperature it would allow once you kicked in the system over time because she couldn't make courage justices leave\nIt would allow every president to get your nominations you'd have a new justice every two years I think that would be a great idea it will never happen [noise]\nUm I mean I think the most creative idea that I came across was not so much a single term but by staffing the Supreme Court randomly I'm with a rotating series of nine judges picked among the chief judges\nOf the twelve lower federal appeals court in the country\nIf it was just\nAny bunch of judges picked and maybe it wouldn't be a nine of twelve maybe it will be five of twelve then you might\nActually give forced to the idea that the court as a neutral body it rules based on law not personality not based on the political views of this or that justice\nBut that these more anonymous lower court judges and the chief judge is of course are rotated based on seniority the system might look\nMore like we have long imagined it to be the idea that the court is politicized is not a new issue\nIt's just far more dramatic than it used to be and it cuts against what we all learned in civics class which is that the law is supposed to be neutral or government of laws not men and women and so forth having said all that any of these changes are incredibly unrealistic\nBut they have a Kevin thank you so much for talking with us it's a pleasure thanks for having me\nDavid Kaplan is the author of the new book the most
