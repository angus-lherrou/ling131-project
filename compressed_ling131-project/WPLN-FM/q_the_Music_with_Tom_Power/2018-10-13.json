a bit earlier Brett was talking about the kind of moment Canadian country musicians are having right now down to the U.S\nAnd I wondered if there is a bit more cried among Canadian country singers now to one hundred percent\nThis year in the last couple of years we've had more artists that are really making a name for themselves in the American country marking the worldwide country market healing to Canada you looked at my boys Hi Dolly how well they are doing Lindsey oh he's doing extremely well um before you know in the nineties we had\nCherry Clark ... Twain and Paul Brown now whereas now James Parker band is doing really well and they're getting some airplanes I'm very proud of like a great guys I Love James and I'm very lucky that I not had a chance to play the operate a number of times play all over the United states and its\nIt's building a everyday so Canadian country music is getting its time and I'm very happy to be in that back to the dressing\nYou know 'cause I think that for a while they're migrating contributions were going on in the eighties and nineties they were kind of adjusting themselves to become a little bit more American I mean that you would hear them come back up and they got a little bit more of a drawl yeah you know but maybe there's a border pride there too\nWell I think there's a pride but the thing is that the border is the borders is there we we know that there's a difference between Canadians and Americans we're very proud of those differences\nBut at the same time music there's not really a border you look at trick you look at the weekend Bieber Mendez unless your car up\nTheir music is produced in Toronto their music is produced in LA New York it doesn't matter they got an amazing washing their amazing talent\nCountry music is actually falling behind to a degree because the stars were big was the last five six years whereas now country music is just catching up to that in Canada but we're producing records and British my record in Saskatoon it's getting played on American radio right beside Blake Shelton and Brad Paisley and it said\nI'm John power this issue of the

lives\nJosie Lucy or where they're proud of it I mean they talk about in their music and although they're banning might seem suggested I was terrified or not partners romantically anyway you're going

teaches\nUm [noise] teachers\n\n\nTime that song called creature in the sun when they stopped by the cue studio I mean I had to get one question out of the weight first how did Josie Carol and Lucy Niles first meet\nUh we met when we were going to man often in fact only runs the university that both her mom's went to and then we ah we met up in the mail\nHow do you remember what you had to be a whole but there are a hundred percent drugs they definitely have French fries and Coca Cola [laughter]\nI probably had like a little bit of everything right at your style um what were your earliest impressions of one another\n[noise] um okay I definitely knew that she was gay and then she was like romance thing or like a friend of mine that's how I met during his and kind of right and then like we're like listening to music and we like all the same songs or whatever and\nThere's like a ... just a couple of times I mean that and we just like bam daughter how does it go from what like what do we like all the same songs were listening to same songs in our in our race our dorm rooms and then you start writing did you get\nOut of the habit um okay so we moved in together and we were kind of like winding down our old band we'd like been through like a few members and stuff are just like kind of tired of it we're like really kind of out of the time actually we\nDidn't know anything at all about like the music industry that much and we like put out a tape\nAnd no one really cared about it so we were like super bomb like really sad or like you know what I guess it's not meant to be and I honestly you know and they say like you start looking for love and it finds or whatever like cave are never going to be famous and then like the last one we started writing our friendship [laughter]\nBut it's clear that make you feel like of course was going to happen yeah yeah we've always been like really cocky and I had like crazy dream your first time you're going to do is called sex object\nTold me about it ... this is one of the first thing we ever wrote um when you were like hanging out and um\nWe're living with um a few other people um we run out of we'd we were looking

diary one hundred percent clear of the time before partner when you maybe weren't as open about your sexuality and your music so we'll start with you when did that change\nUm okay so our old Ben free there is I was open about my sexuality and I've been like I've been like\nHard game for like a really I got here but it's just like our whole thing is to be like we don't want to like make a big deal that were gay like why not gay who cares yeah right right we thought it was like really cheesy to like talk about your sexuality allowed or sometimes ... changed for you\nUm well I think like what happened was that like we're just trying to navigate like a man's in the world right and just like not sure like what\nWas like how to how to act but then when we dropped all of that and surrendered to the forces within ourselves which is ... yeah then things really started to get moving [noise]", "show_name": "q the Music with Tom Power", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "13"}
