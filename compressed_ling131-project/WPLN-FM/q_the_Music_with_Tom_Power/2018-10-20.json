R. I. public radio international\nToday Steve Earle was on the show one of the most legendary voices into the country music a guy who was never afraid to speak out about social issues in the past and this was at a time when we just didn't really speak their mind that has never change coming up you'll hear his thoughts on politics in country music today first off so cut out the latest album so you want to be an outlaw\nThis is Steve Earle with a song called fire ...\n[noise] well I'm a model bar wearing bondage to fire him wearing ... and now the new plan ... value around Bahrain ... well\nAround ... on a lot of primary line ... around the to the ...\nI ran out of Iran as\nNa na na\nLaugh as a hobby shop plan to have 'em up above\nMe and my mom [noise]\nFair to say we want to be an outlaw is less overtly political yeah I mean we were in Canada really yeah we were in Ottawa than I that Trump was elected 'em by the bunny rate told me the other\nDay that she went onstage thinking that someone would be saying that she won't be off same with me and\nWe were all to up so we knew as the set role and it was a to set show too because we play came up like get our town and went back then the other seven seconds that was kind of hard to get there are just starting to what really bad by the time or whatever the second set\nUm I've thought about altering\nThis record then I decided I'd written it to be a certain thing and I decided to stick with it it's a country is record I've done my part I think the next year is going to be justice country\nBut way more political [laughter] where does that fit now what what the current state of politics and country music I don't know that there is one I mean there's there's there's a kind of never has been but not on purpose just not\nThat I'm\nJust not that the artist we're [noise] we're not necessarily political people it wasn't encouraged\nUm you know I think um [noise]\nNot everybody should write political songs because not everybody does it you know I Do have pretty good job of it but you know still piss people off sometimes when you got to make a decision about it and I don't\nHold anybody responsible for being political music or not be employed music national you know like people talk about they outlaw band one of the reasons that I wanted to do this was\nTo set the record straight about what outlaw was it was a term that came up after it at all really happened but it was the idea that a lot of people now want to think that that's in terms especially some artist I mean I think that it's about drugs and and and behavior\nThey're always drugs in country music George Jones was not going to the liquor store at four o'clock in the morning on where there aren't a liquor store is open at four o'clock in the morning in Tennessee are bars\nFor that matter so you know I never thought about that before until yeah I'm not he was ... George had a free base thing going on you know and and you know but people didn't talk about that and and so the legend became that he was going to the liquor store so you know it what outlaw was about was\nReally it starts because Doug song the late great ... Douglas quintet told Jerry Wexler if he wanted it was interesting progressive country music he should sign willy Nelson he did and Willie made shot down willy\nAnd faces in stages Whalen heard those records and went in Seventy two and made hockey talk here as he took him till Seventy three they get to get RCA to release it\nOutlaw was about ... really smart country acts that deserved it realizing that there were what ... rock acts had artistic freedom that they didn't have to try to make that kind of her record\nDo feel home in Nashville Now when you're there\nUm got I've got a lot of history there are still got a house there I've never felt to harm anywhere but New York city\nTo Nashville at any way now feel like a day when you went there in the magical wonderland in Seventy three\nDon't know that it ever did I mean I I was I was uncomfortable there from the beginning but I was okay we'd be uncomfortable at that point in my life so I just didn't really care\nAustin at the airport there that I Walk past that statue of Barbara Jordan you know who is you know\nThat's the Texas I left there nobody could imagine a Republican governor in Texas there's never been one and so things change a lot in Texas Tennessee was kind of always conservative and um Texas wasn't I don't believe in people\nTrying to force their idea of morality based on religion on other people and and that happens there are a lot and I just I watch my friends moving from LA and New York to national on the theory that\nIt was easier to protect their kids from you know bad system that was gangs and the truth is it's kind of a toss up and you know my son\nAnd my youngest son is growing up in and\nAnd um you know in New York City that never occurred to him that people aren't all colors and don't speak all these different languages are much more cosmopolitan environment where he's growing up to where my other two sons did and um and for me personally\nI just reached a point where I got kind of tired of being behind enemy lines politically and I I Want to be able to walk out my front door and see a mixed race same sex couple holding hands because it makes me feel safe is white and heterosexual as I Am\nBut is there a hope I mean I I Know from listening to\nThe Stanley ... was spoke out for democratic causes when he was in the Stanley Brothers and just out of the Stanley Brothers right\nDo you mean Carter was a supporter of the Allman brothers band you know great aunt just passed away I mean\nThere is no history of people who play southern music will say southern music even as a gigantic term well avoiding for like do you feel about it but if you look at the who's who's making socially conscious music right now it's all coming out of out of hip hop mainly yeah I'm at ... or we too far gone to the country\nMusic is that never going to happen I just don't think that that right now our country music is is the there's two kinds of commercially successful music you know as far as selling records and in any kind of numbers and that's mainstream country and hip hop and\nYou know mainstream country a lot of it is hip hop for people that are afraid of black people so\nYou know I don't know that that I think it's kind of intentionally apolitical it's kind of party music right now the best music coming at nationals being made by women for the most part you know Miranda Lambert last record is standing at the big ... Chris Stapleton he's great there um\nYou know it it's not about making political musical one way or the other it's just a matter about what I'm comfortable with and when I'm not I I Do what I Do I don't apologize to anybody that gets our towns are pretty political record in copper had roads of very political record so I've always done it and\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nDid you hear the music on CBC Radio NPR I public radio international I'm telling our [noise]\nToday the incredible root beer is on the show rising star from Edmonton, Alberta\nRecently released her debut full length albums safe haven in just a moment you're going to hear about her dazzling arrived dream but first to another live performance from here in Studio cue this is Ruth be with your vision good luck\nSpend all day and I'm trying to sneak yeah yeah oh\nWell who's was that's still\nA ...
