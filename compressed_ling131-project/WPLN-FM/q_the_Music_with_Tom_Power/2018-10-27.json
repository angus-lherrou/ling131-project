public radio international I'm Tom power [noise]\nEighteen years ago Lee Ann Womack was busy establishing her singing career in the heart of country music in Nashville, Tennessee\nShe already had a couple of records under her belt at that point but then everything changed as soon as she released this massive country pop crossover hit [noise]\nBig valid you still hear a wedding as you might feel here on the radio when you're lying\nHerself she wasn't prepared for all the tension that came with releasing I Hope you Dan it follows her around for a pretty long time and after a wild land really felt like that big hit it was more of a detour than anything else so that we had well Mac is\nBack on the path she originally set out on getting back to her roots and to do that she had to leave Nashville she returned to her east Texas home surrounded\nHerself with friends and family got down to work or do you record is called the lonely the lump sum and the gum she stopped by the cues studio with her band to perform some of it live you're about to hear her perform all the trouble but just before she launched into it she took a moment to explain a little more about this\nUh I made this record in east Texas and I just kind of want to know record you reflect on my east Texas rates and there's a lot of different kinds of music there and and I think all the trouble encompasses a lot of different kinds of music like spiritual and country and ... rock's a little bit and\nLose lose yeah you know this is this is some ... to hear this this is all the trouble on cue ...\nI got oh the trouble I'm ever going to need I got oh\nTrouble I'm ever going to need a God oh troubles and we'll go ooh me and I just don't\nOh man no ...\n\nIn a\n... said that when when that'll happen he said I think they expect me to be Billy Graham now what did you mean by\nThat had a major effect on me and my career nearly what does that mean well I have a lot of people coming to meet with these stories about how the song affected them and and their life and\nAnd um I used to sell its not preachy but the song is do hopeful and has such a spiritual element to it\nThat just feel like people\nWanted to you know kind of an burden themselves from these stories and things\nAnd I I wasn't prepared for what you mean you were young he was a well I was too young probably I I just I'm going to be one of the ... yeah you know I I just I thought you know I'm going to sing drinking cheating songs on this country singer white lightning [laughter]\nSo you know it was just a little bit of a of a detour uh from

this record in east Texas not too far from where she grew up at a place called ... studios in Houston legendary studio that's no not for its cutting edge equipment but for using vintage recording equipment so I had to ask what was it like to step back in time and record an album there\nIt was not nearly as nice as is modern day studios but it's an old star studio and they have these great echo chambers and a very old studio and so uh it's still very much like it was\nA back in the day so George Jones cut all of his early hits their Willie Nelson cut nightlife there a lot of really cool artists have recorded there and um\nThe people that worked out they love music for the sake of music and they they have not gotten jaded by you know working in LA or national or somewhere like that and so they um\nThey go in there every day like what are we going to create today not how are we going to make a record that's going to sell ... million copies you know they're not in that frame of mind and so um\nIt ... it was refreshing girl and and it just put me in a different frame of mind and I knew it would\nYou wonder why\nCome on [noise]\nVery long\nMe along\n\nKnee no\nAnd Americans

with the idea of writer's block right maybe even lived through it yourself you know even if you're not a writer but just that feeling of hitting a wall you're trying to work on something creative\nThat well of ideas and your brain just seems to be suddenly empty and you don't know how to fill it up again well that's where a fear of and then found himself but he started writing his latest record under his stage name hummus\nSo dealing with writer's block he turned to a couple of legends for help it called up the\nOne of the greatest living bass players peanut ... you know and the drummer James Gatz in their names you might not recognize but you can only heard their music these guys are played with Elton John at the Angelo John Mayer and back and bill withers and now\nThe Bahamas so when Bahamas or a fee sat down to jam with these guys it sparked that something in him it sparked the inspiration he was looking for and what he was inspired to do is open up more personally perhaps them before\nYou started writing songs about depression about loss and about being abandoned by his father so yeah that that might be enough to get rid of the writer's block but here's sang the song as you hear on this record earth tones but not sad songs to kind of catchy their soulful\nYou might even find some dancing do a song about yeah again parental abandonment you're going to hear more from a fee in just a minute but first\nHere's the second tract offer it's ... it's a good way to try things out 'cause it's called the opening act for the issue we do have some\n\n\n[noise]\nWell I Know it is made it to people can see we don't feel bad\nBecause with the opening asking us to places and so on but [noise]\nI Want to try and say yes even if it's not the better for me that's fine but\n\nThat's um\nThat's the opening act should we be songs from ... new record or as I like that [noise] I like it [noise]\nSo what's what's that signed up in that song is like a subversive a critique of the state of affairs at the music industry soon and uh\nAnd perhaps a you know a big part of my life is opening up for other bands you know we I mean we get to do a bit of everything which is nice\nAnd for the most part I really liked that position because you're just kind of the underdog nobody knows who you are going to win them over and you can play whatever you want and and it's a wonderful opportunity to experiment and we you know you can play new songs and you can do all kinds of things um\nBut sometimes you are like playing you know a festival in June ... requires headlining and you're playing at three PM and it's just like dude and the front row who are like on June ... dot com like waiting for that show to begin\nAnd just that sometimes that interaction as a performer you know can sort of salary a little bit [noise] um anyway so I probably just wrote those first versus kinda with that in mind um but yeah I think I think it's just kind of like it's a it's a critique\nAnd a celebration I guess where we're at well there's also a great line and I try to remember what it is but it's something along the lines like don't don't blame me for the Internet\nThe line is are now the music industry and you can't blame me but on the Internet yeah yeah so yeah it's just it's just fun with words you know I'm just that's sort of been part of my writing for a long time it's just trying to find cool way to put the words together and you know sounds cool but it doesn't do another track this is no expectation\nHa ha ha ha ha ha\n\n\nNo explanation and [noise] I mean we have no expectation [noise] he's just with me [noise] oh really is [noise]\nWe have all that they need to I Would live in [noise]\nThere's just something about the need\nTo", "year": "2018", "show_name": "q the Music with Tom Power", "city": "Nashville", "day": "27"}
