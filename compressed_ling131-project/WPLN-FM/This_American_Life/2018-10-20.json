Hi I'm actually in room a lemon certain effects can you hear me can you hear me [noise]\nAfter that the seven minutes of silence on the recording just like total silence nothing happens except ... every now and then turn just\nLaughed to herself [laughter]\nOne minute and forty seconds after the phone call then it's quiet there's no other sounds from forty four seconds and then when the recording you're here [laughter] [noise]\nNow and then she tries to door handle again thinking she told me later you know this can really be true like this cat this got to be with us going to work\nOne wall because it has the hallway on the other side and Eighteen minutes after car locks herself in she hears people she hears some German tourists walking towards her down the hall and fortunately she actually has the skills\nFor this very situation\nGermans come to the door of the room they whisper to each other for\nA little bit and then they do nothing [noise]\n[laughter]\nHer husband is that an audition he's also a singer and it's from it's turned off she takes her mom there's nothing bad she finds her mom and rainy and then somebody taps on the door the hotel room and cause where are you okay\nCan you come to the door the person asks [noise]\nOh [laughter]\n\nOh my God Knows is really weird thing to say to somebody as you're getting less clear is\nCouldn't help herself nobody wants to look like I'm not you know [noise]\nApparently the Germans when they found this\nVery sweet Jamaican housekeeper and twenty two minutes after cameras locked in to housekeeper set her praise\nGod I was so happy to see her and she was how nice oh my gosh she was so nice\nI Know this is a weird question but like is it appropriate to tip in a situation like\nThat [laughter]\nI don't know I didn't think of it than\nNot turned remember is she's just an opera singer right an opera is all about the spectacle you know eighty people's on the stage and horses and of vengeance and big grand feeling it was really it would really be hard to get further from that\nTo what happened to her in that closet right all the action takes place in a space not much bigger than your body it is the simplest pot imaginable there's literally no movement in the spot if someone were to stage this as an opera how would that go [laughter]\n[noise] um it might be minimalist music actually a right\nLike just repeating theme over and over and over again with me yelling help\nAnd you know people say those kinds of things in interviews and then I put the quarter to be under the story and it makes it nice and they put a little funky music I'm driven\nBut when we did this interview like three or four weeks ago\nI wrote a witness and if a once in my life I don't have to let the story stop here I'm actually going to be an opera house very soon I can retire with this I can take this to the next logical step to step it never gets you to step you need\nAn opera house for and it turns out I actually have a hookup for the kind of music that car and just talking about this because of his name is Philip Glass [noise]\nWritten a number of minimalist operas [noise]\nThey've been performed here in this very stage since the Nineteen eighties I stand on the beach just this\nPast fall and so I called Phillip and he sat down to write I took her name right now I'm pleased to present here on

the world please welcome Philip Glass [noise]\n\nThink we're joined by a man Emily browser\nOn shallow and of course this is all about car and go free metro soprano hiring\n\n[noise]\nAnd what happened next in this one school was transformed into a musical by a team of people who usually do this on Broadway pretty much everybody involved in this to cast the chorus the musicians the director Michael Mayer awesome Broadway words and music are by Lin Manuel Miranda [noise]\nProbably\nBest known for writing and starting in in the height or he will be your narrator\n\nIn the train was called
