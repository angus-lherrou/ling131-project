out and the counselor had to catch it and on and on like that\n[noise] men Susan flipping through one of those time life books rock and roll through the decades sixties she has long brown hair she's

eighty two sixteen the cashier at thrift way foods supermarket in Cincinnati where I Lived the place is packed all twenty five registers or going people are lined up halfway through the back of the store I look up and this is Jordan\nShe smiles we talk she doesn't have many items so I checked\nI Can't recall one thing we say to each other although I remember being distinctly disappointed to hear that she's married she has me some kind of business card her husband's probably something having to do with the building of redwood decks she seems happy\nMeanwhile there's a line of last minute Christmas shoppers mounting behind her\nI tell her to hold on I'm trying to get my break we can catch up\nShe says great steps aside [noise]\nI keep signaling to my manager but there's no one to

here all the time I'm sure I'll see around\nI worked at two or three for two more years I never saw Susan Jordan again\n\n\nThat drives me crazy that I never saw her again if I hadn't run into the store I don't think I'd care but somehow having her play what to me seems like a huge role in my life when I was a kid\nAnd then getting just a taste of what it would be like to talk with her as a peer\nI've never forgotten that\nI Know it's ridiculous but after years of thinking about her imagining what she's up to wondering if she ever things about me I just had to find her\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nI start with my only lead to one former employer of hers that I Know\nMy mom I like uh do you want to know I'm calling I Do I Do\nYou remember she was in Jordan right\nIs that George\nIs that George yes it's bringing about but I Can't place a she was our babysitter oh OK chicken like can my pet one\nOf the many ideas that Susan introduced to our household was the concept of the nickname I think that's all I Want to say about chicken legs in my pet a gun to my mother to fill in gaps in my memory of Susan but she didn't remember much more than I did\nAt that time she was taken all on a truck\nAnd every time I Would come home they would always try to get me to take drugs with them or something and I I really didn't do it much at all\nAnd um it was really it was it was tough to come home and\nI I guess I must have been suffering a little bit I missed I really miss my little brothers\nAnd my little sister and they were gone and I was I guess it may be trying to substitute\nI think maybe that's one of the reasons that I remember that we remember usa fama those because I think it works both ways I think that we felt if that didn't make you feel closer to us I think that we we responded and well\nI was desperately I guess I was looking for a family that I mean it\n[laughter] it's only you knew you probably wouldn't hire me but I mean\nPeople are complicated now what I really wanted to do with spend more time with your mom and dad but I was terrified [noise] I mean I I just couldn't I couldn't do it I was shy you know a lot of times they it was I thought they were asking me to stay longer and talk\nAnd I would just run out and I'm sure they were [laughter] and they probably know what's wrong with her but I just couldn't do it\nSo you sort of talk to us instead so yeah I was comfortable around kids because you know I had kids in my family [noise]\nUm or\nI'm\nRetired and subjective are hard times came up I hear a subtle hesitancy into what\nI thought it was embarrassment but that wasn't exactly it wasn't until we've been talking for hours that I realized what it was\nShe was waiting for the other shoe to drop\nShe hadn't forgotten that are passed it happened she just forgotten that I witnessed part of it interfere it became clear the one that have been going under our entire conversation was that I was calling to say she damage me by exposing me to it\nI don't think I was to kind of accent because there was a lot of turmoil in my life and in my family and that's what my fear is that I had some kind of negative impact on people\nAnd and I know probably I did on a couple of people but they were my age but um\nYou know you just want to remember yeah I was a baby that are the kids love me blah blah blah [laughter] but uh\nI Would be devastated if I heard anything different Mm\nThere are parts of the past you don't want to go back to ... parts of yourself you don't want to go back to\nThe proceeds from Jordan the upper left that I remember\nIs he or she just as soon forgot\nAnd it turns out I'd also done my best to forget what I was like right there\nI didn't think of myself as where it all with who's in Jordan reminded me in the gentlest terms possible\nWhen I was nine of anxious and bookish\nTo see him as an insult that I just kept thinking these kids don't know how to play when I went to your room

didn't remember that ... had hardly any dolls\nYou didn't seem quite as playful as other kids that I had they not just in a more serious than general mainly I think that's what I did was try to play\nOr\nPerhaps the most amazing thing about this whole story is how little I remember as a deceived us about each other even if they had deceived us about ourselves as Susan said at one point each of us remembered what we need to do about the other I needed to remember that part of Susan but she doesn't think about much her talk much on the face of hardship\nShe said she must be remembered the

was very clear to me that this was the diary of the future prime minister of Israel [laughter] to me [laughter] um that that I Would one day be prime minister and it would be very important for\nHistory for people to know the the thought of a young Zionists as he prepared is way to lead his nation [noise]\n\nAnd that our our regular listeners during this American Life might remember that that you've been on our program describing your experience in Israeli Army summer camp\nThat was right before I started writing this diary\nGreatly me another sure let's see um\nThere's so much wrong with Jews in Israel that I'm going to have a job ahead of me one thing it's a lack of any strong Jewish identity among most Jews this attitude seconds me huge ... of the world's stop worrying about

Wednesday I'm getting more and more angered by the effects of Arab propaganda they blame the Jews for everything and the world including Jews go along with it entirely ridiculous I mean I really thought this was this was a testament for the ages I really thought that this writing\nWas powerful and persuasive to anyone who would predict would immediately become as scientists [noise]\nAt sixteen I it's such an inflated sense of myself there is so much going on in my life than that I can remember and I wasn't recording it instead I was creating this ridiculous fantasy of you know\nI'm not just a sixteen year old kid who's you know having crushes and\nYou know a hopeless geek who can't get a girl a kiss them and being scared and confused about growing old I'm I'm the future prime minister of Israel and everything you know goes through that but I don't know I mean maybe\nThe maybe keeping a diary where when tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain you know kind of person in a certain kind of situation\nMay may maybe maybe other people in another kind of situation need to actually make up a little fantasy ... yeah I think um I didn't have much anxious about\nBeing the future prime minister of Israel is very calm and confident and comfortable with it and I had so much anxious about every other aspect of my life [laughter]\nI Know it's just kind of a maybe it was a good solution you know it was a good way to deal with this with with what I was going through to have this base where I could just be you know one of the great ... and\nI Wonder what are the sixteen year old Adam Davidson would feel it knowing that finally you know an audience for a million people was was getting some of the reading from this diary\nI think this would feel so small to that sixteen year old this would feel so\nNothing\nI mean I remember I was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel and and I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions won't affect\nMillions of people like how is that enough motivation you know just to have your petty little craft and your petty little family and your small little apartment like [noise]\nYou know it just seemed to [noise]\nAnd I mean they have the kind of life that you know I mean basically I I Want my for myself\nWhat you're saying though is that the sixteen year old you would be cringing at\nYour thirty year old does your thirty year old version is cringing at\nSixteen yeah that's very true yeah he would be very very disgusted to be heard this this radial tease\nIt would seem like I had settled in the ... that are way\nThese days staff writer for the new\nHistory origin I came to us from a graduate student Hillary Frank was studying trying it the New York academy apart and she mailed a radio show a story that you wanted to get on to the program in which he had done is that she had recorded the interviews\nAnd then to edit\nThe quotes that you've gotten which you would do is that she would record by dubbing and recording on to her shiny red boom box\nIt was crude yes but the story sounded remarkably like stories and this American Life\nNow for one reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it on the radio but this week's show however we had to put together another story using that same style which we added music do here at the radio station to make it fully sound like story on our show\nIs history about an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate\nUniversity is a pretty straight place\nEntertainment for most people means fraternity kangaroos\nIt's not the sort of place you'd expect people to watch you guys sitting on another guy shoulders pretending to be a giant\nIt happened by accident in Nineteen Ninety four my friend's got with the top\n[noise] there was beginning of the school year and we were [noise] um [noise] got aboard one night and we decided to go up to the quad and I guess basically got up on a on phones back and he started yelling and screaming about\nHow giant he was and how magnificent he was and I'm actually right after that I might have gotten that far back and said yeah you know I also try it [laughter]\nAnd uh I guess that really struck a chord in me I thought that was a pretty I mean as I\nDo\nA lot about it um [noise] it actually good for me thinking along [laughter] peculiar path\n\nScott and talked about the idea one night in the dining hall\nThe next day on the weight of class he saw signs all over campus and that that in both pretty\nHigh in nine feet tall come see giant man eight pm on the quad\nScott had no idea who put the money\nHe learned later that the science were posted by a guy who had overheard him talking at dinner\nThat decided he would go to the cloud is a mess aside time and undertake the challenge\nHe would need to create a character and the question for the giant\nGiant man a booming voice\nPart or even know exactly it was something like you know\nI'm old I Am trying you know just the you know loud but just kind of weird [laughter] you know sort of [noise] adjusting rams left [laughter] way you know I don't know\n\nIt's kind of asked his college friends who does the actress giant man's leg\nThey grab some ... before heading up to the plot\nOf Lincoln to wrap around the middle and high Buddha\nAnd lack currently way like the guy I think\nWe pick up a point in the bushes put on and I um [noise]
