P. L. N. dot org\nIt's a school trying to do the right thing school trying something new trying to keep it student's safe so they bought handguns seven of them got nine millimeters to use the shooter comes into the building and a week and a half before school started\nAfter a bunch of training the running to first drill in the school building with a gun French and the boxes\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] the buildings mostly empty no kids around it's a district in rural Ohio the greatest record 'em a condition that we not see their name on the air\nThe day people on this team only to teachers all do it for the rest of the guidance counselor to custodians through administrators who run the school one of them is the only woman on the team this year was pollock watch them doing this we used to so I'm explain how this works exactly okay\nSo the seven guns are locked in these small safe they've been installed in locations of the school I saw the run a bunch of drills\nAnd then all of them the goal was to run to the nearest safe get the gun out of the safe and they get to where the shooter is as soon as possible and they time each drill okay we're going to pay for this was one of one listeners they're allowed to gunshots from blanks\nThat fire during his drills so the first little glitch they came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble\nGetting into the safe you have to put your finger on the sensor is like a hundred\nAnd it's a little tricky\n\nThere's a share of that meeting he's playing to shoot [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John ... is the principal for grade six to twelve and he's running from his office starts by the cafeteria [noise] he's got a gun he's wearing a bullet proof that he's holding a walkie talkie very focused very aware of the clock is ticking he told me that every few seconds\nAnd one of these shootings another to kill not enough of this way\n\nMary wearing if in the elementary when [noise]\nFail a mature waiting to building also has middle school and high school right so the principles running down the hallway\nAnd he's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are but there's a door there and it's locked this happens automatically wonderful goes into lockdown the heat and the two guys with him are stuck ... for his keys and he's trying to find the right one\nDriving he's trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\nDrugs\nAre showing up to [noise] door opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right there [noise] so that's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything they're just timing the response\nWasn't great that was the target is the first yeah oh yeah it was it was the doors\n\nSaid so controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like\nTalked to John the principal about that yeah I'm for a long time she agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even now he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he said he's not a gun guy didn't grow up with guns had never used one\nThey came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have it some police force mhm so if a shooter gotten the building they could be waiting a long time for helped\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right thing to do but you know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away you were you worried because you realize that you're on your own and and\nSo I wanted to learn [noise] so I went out\nAnd started learning how to shoot a gun and out of the handle a gun\nAnd which is different you know first time you should have gone that's pretty scary it was scary to me [noise]\nAfter that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd would exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target ... close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision this was a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around how close do you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target\nYou've got to shoot that target Cindy can mess [noise]\nI Can't miss [noise]\nBecause they're Simon is\nThere's a possibility of somebody else getting hurt\nAll right and I can't let that happen [noise]\nI Can't let it be me who hurts\nA student in my school\nOf course he might have to she wanted a student and a lot of these shootings that to the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating or or thinking [noise]\nI I wouldn't have believed it [noise] but these\nThings don't stop happening\nThey just continue to happen\nAll\nThe shootings do just continue to happen\nToday and I personally have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare for like the staff at the school [noise]\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shooting it looks a pass to dissipate the future [noise] knowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish if she gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nThat one of our Saturday we have people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put it measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly\nCan and it's still not enough to we have people who have invented something that actually seems to work and help from\nThe BBC Chicago this American Life America last [noise]\n\nOr\nEdwin ... will never be\nPretty school just trying to figure out the best ways to prepare for gunmen there's an example out there that might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida just a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained their students are new procedures they should follow in that exact situation\nJust came after a total overhaul of the schools emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nI don't think that if they weren't prepared to say I mean they knew what to do it is\nStill even with that\nIf you have people that are going to return to their families\nDid the training they received to save lives that day were didn't it such an open question when our producers Robin semi and went to park on to talk to teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for what they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane warnings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDouglas is a school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so upgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments\nMost of all ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher not news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she's an enthusiastic teacher a planner\nShe believes in a good hard thank and being proactive once she and the other teachers had been trained they ran their students are all the new drills the whole school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying we know the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the cage and go through all the emergency procedures\nThis is what we do for ... for every period for every this is what a ... black and this is what we do it for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the kid was you have to do it with each and every class\nBecause they wanted to make sure that the kids knew the procedures that it was like ingrained in their mind and that they knew so if they were ... silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nSchool colors silver burgundy\nTheir on an alternating schedule [noise]\nMelissa says her kids took the drill seriously on a scale of one to ten I Would say we were totally prepared like a ten\nThe school told every teacher to cover the tall rectangular windows in our classroom doors with paper\nAnd leave the paper up all year just in case if there were one it would make it harder for an active shooter to see\nAnd that's a lesson from previous shootings get out of sight\nShe knew it was real [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nFor like the next Ninety second says kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running don't stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there was another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building um and I was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction\nWow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people in\nYes it was [laughter] yes it was and what happens there were terrified people reading and I just I could not in all consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that [noise]\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught you can choose to follow the protocol and follow your instinct for some teachers that wasn't a choice at all [laughter] [laughter]\nIn her classroom must have better attendance sheet out of her emergency folder\nShe kinda Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway [noise] the group is small enough to fitness apply a car that someone had told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and moved there\nIn the closet it was hot and dark except students faces live by their cell phone and Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third floor the freshman building she ... she is on the tax cuts that says there is a shooter there's a shooter and my floor\nUm and so my my friend Sara says\nDrill or actual and she says actual my window is blown out and then she told us she had been graced by a bullet she was grace in her arm by a bullet thank God\nAnd I didn't hear from her for a while in our when I\nWe heard noises in the hallway um we got really quiet um I had had a flashlight part of my phone on so that we could kind of like eliminate the closet without having a light on\nAnd when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key\nUm and so then I could hear movement in around and then somebody not comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police officers that this is a police anyone in here and then there was like kind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police if anyone in here and I was like ... I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is up\nWeb streaming is made possible by diversify trust and independent wealth management firm offering an integrated approach to the investment trust your state and philanthropic needs of individuals' multigenerational families institutions and retirement plans learn more a diversified trust\nDot com for the shooter so I Know they had their weapons drawn she really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were cops\nAnd so I just very slowly ... than you pulled on the handle push it open and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started you know giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] what's it told me that actually it was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy how her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yells to you know Scott below to close the door and grabs the handle with two hands and pulls it closed\nUm [noise] so her door was open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway\nStacy is the teacher who's our most grade is she survived [noise] got Beagle in the room next to this day seized at the same things stay seated\nWaited a little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the doorway do\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting drills of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we think and talk about them are still statistically rare but now Melissa and actually have been in that rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both told me that having a\nPlaybook for what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class [noise] now I Move us all to a closet [noise] but they also both had ideas coming out of this about ways they could have been better prepared and\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with guys in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has saved lives and mass shootings I really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help did more kids survive\nBecause of it what might have worked better Cheryl Johnson research is what's effective in these drills at Xavier University and has a training instructor for Alice love to big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters Alice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfits safe havens international\nHas its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnson didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of those things I knew that done at Douglas like paper over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much it's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms also code ran all the codes their colors and meanings\nConsumes I talked to said no to this too\nI'm a big advocate for not using codes and all I I if I say could read your takes a split second for your brain to go ... shooter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I say there is a gunman in the pool [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked redound in yeah [noise] but the idea that this is all you do that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options many more ways to respond to a shooting [noise] sometimes you standing room sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter\nLike a cafeteria gym\nBecause the last resort you cite basically trust your ability to make a decision\nAnd told her to ask her how she eats dinner doorway grabbing a dozens of scared student [noise] remember it was a break from her school's protocol\nCheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet\nI wondered if she may be believed actually did the right thing pulling in kids the problem with that\nAnd unless you're there you don't know [noise] you know what exactly happened now does she probably save lives probably in in that situation at at work with the gunman being in a different building yes one thing that was part of their training at Douglas was barricaded in your door basically pushing lots of furniture up against your classroom door\nBut most and actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did those actually had\nDone it and she followed the protocol locked him barricaded her door right away\nIt would have been way harder to tell the kids in her room from the hallway\nShutdown barricade herself first\nFewer kids would admitted in\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school\nMy daughter's nine fourth grade\nLast year she did a traditional lock down at her school sweating hide\nBut when I asked her what the journalists for she said I don't know exactly and say\nI keep thinking about that one shooting the red like Indian reservation shooting and how that one a classroom with students did a traditional lockdown squatting behind because they practiced it\nAnd how and investigator on that case told me\nThat Israel did not help them at all that have been better off without it\nAnd the researcher who told me we should not do drills at school\nTo traumatizing for kids we don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\nI don't agree with no drills at all\nI Want my daughter to know everything [noise]\nAllowing her to know about barricade him [noise]\nAnd I want to know about renting and fighting back\nI Want her to know that active shooters because the thing to reckon with [noise]\nI Want her to know there's nothing that can keep her completely safe\nOne more thing I'd say to my daughter's school Charles point about dumped the codes\nWe call it like it is\nI don't want someone to come over an intercom and tell my daughter code red\nI Want someone to say listen I there's a person with a gun in our school of course I never want someone to say that at all\nOkay okay [laughter]\nBreeze with me [laughter] [noise]\n\nAfter a few minutes he's kind of brush enough to talk\nHe tell Sandy he wants to shootings to stop so you want to take action somehow\nAnd then Chad's suddenly switches gears and starts filling out his feelings about guns and gun control\nYou know before I was going on in this world [noise] it can go if ... because district for drug drug stores are still able to get through and now\nHe plans to get a concealed handgun license when he turned Twenty one later this year to build those are actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun they believe in a Second Amendment but they're also advocates\nFor universal background checks in tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and accessories like bump stocks I personally by however Sandy says they don't push their political beliefs on survivors\nWhen they're doing outreach their primary goal is to support but it's impossible for grieving parents to avoid the politics around guns there is a whole movement of conspiracy theorists who believe that the U.S government stages mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed\nAlex Jones of course is famous for saying that mass shootings are fake he's now a defendant in several defamation lawsuit when the Philips is ran into him face to face and a gun control of that he accused them of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life and your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and done it and I'm listening to him just going you are so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of them it looked like a shouting match with about to start until Sandy's stopped dead broke it up I reached out to jump through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists\nNoticed truth ... trolls families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting this can get dangerous after the Philips his son gave\nInterviews in Aurora he got death threats and had to get the FBI involved demanding was threatening him ended up in jail so hope fears are one of the things the Philips has learned parents about they tell families to brace themselves\nOh mhm [noise] mhm [noise] mhm\nWatching Loni in any in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with her daughter shooting they got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home\nTheir daughter Jessie was in college at the time she got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at a multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started Jesse's friend called Sandy from the theater the minute I picked up the phone there was\nScreaming job\n[noise]\nHorrible screaming in the background panic and he said um there's been a shooting like what is he talking about 'cause Jesse had been at a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left a food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in an open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but she's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been hit twice and it was when he said that that I went\nWhy isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said I trust\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was slowed it was so horrific and took to never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their ...\nJesse with one of twelve people killed that night another Seventy people\nWere injured and then five months later there was another mass shooting\nWere twenty first graders insects educators died\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted the Phillip says\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings and asked that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents there [noise]\nAnd he said they didn't even have to think about it they immediately said yes\nBecause they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after Jesse died [noise]\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown Sandy says they felt\nNervous uncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence\nYou know it's like walking into a funeral or people that you don't know and I remember saying to my husband and we walked in the room and I saw their faces [noise] he said that's what we looked like five months ago\nWhich is that look like\nThey're hanging on to each other um they've been trying so their eyes are red they're walking almost robot like their bodies are moving that they're not really there\nI realized that's what I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nShe wanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back Sandy sad that was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw\nHas said there was also a strong and instant sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away from [noise] well they were there they ran into parents from other mass shootings to parents from Virginia Tech in Tucson these parents have lots of kids suddenly and violently and places where they thought that they were safe\nThe filters now had parents that they can lean on to this was a moment that launched the Philips as to what's become their life work they could see the need there no experts on what to do when your child died in the mass shooting\nThe only experts are the people it's happened to to help them find each other money and Sandy had set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nPlus a bunch of other practical things everything from medical bills and cherries scams that use kids go to to raise money how to get your child's body home if you live out of state however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nWant you to get back to normal light moment rather should they should [laughter] you're not sure he was you were shouldn't you know ... you're right I'm not to shrink person on there will be the shooters were obsessed with this will you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nThe Phillip says in a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand that the grief never fades old relationship start to fall away\nWe believe are closest to disappear which makes us informal support groups even more crucial\nWithout support looks like over time what it means to the parents who got it [noise] I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida\nWho lost their son in the shooting at Parkland on a kitten that store at and let them at their house there is something was neck he was the captain of Parkland swim team who's about to go to the University of Indianapolis on his win scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid\nWho collected different flavors of Oreos and waited for a Supreme drops Mitch said they've just reached a point where they were becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared play less and watch Scarface together the day of the shooting mentioned on the phone calls and tax all day from people who said they'd heard neck was okay one person said they heard\nHe'd been moved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting and others at a police officer with giving him a ride home and then a nurse at a local hospital that she thought patient who mash next description but might not even need the door at still hadn't are directly from neck they went to uh marry out that law enforcement designated as a meeting area\nIs out in the ballroom with other parents and waited\nEvery time the phone rings you jumped and think his name calling from somebody else's phone um [noise] the media was calling you give any comments can we have to find your son and I was just like [noise]\nYeah and I'm at two o'clock in the morning is the this FBI car and then they start pulling one family into rooms at a time and the years like strange from nature and\nThen their names were called out\nEven walking into that room you have this tiny little hope that they're going to say like we we couldn't even find yourself and you know and I hope that she was somewhere else and have to keep I'm thinking maybe you walked home and and then you do the math in your head like to take that long\nTo her house and then they told us the news that he was gone he was shot than he was never brought to the hospital it'll\nJust like a nightmare second nightmare\nNext body was still at the school because he died instantly and the building was still a crime scene it'd be two days before they could see him on a could want it to look at his injuries Mitch did not\nHonest says this is just how her brain works she's an ER nurse she needs details the director at the funeral home wanting to protect her called the medical examiner's office to ask about neck\nAnd the person that answer the phone and said oh I'm let me let me take a look what's the name again is Nicholas where it takes to swim or clothes farmers perfect [noise] I think it's meant that there is nothing on his face or his head like he was he was perfect", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This American Life", "city": "Nashville", "day": "13"}
