[noise] but these\nThings don't stop happening they just continue to happen\nIn\nThe shootings do just continue to happen\nToday and I personally have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare like the staff at the school [noise]\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shooting it looks a pass to just pay the future knowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish the shooter gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nLike one of our Saturday we have people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put it measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly\nCan and it's still not enough to we have people who have invented something that actually seems to work and help\nThem WB easy Chicago it's this American Life America last [noise]\n...\n...\n... ... will never be pretty school just trying to figure out the best ways to\nDumb and do good high school in Parkland, Florida just a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained her students or new procedures they should follow in that exact situation just came after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nBut I don't think we could have been more prepared than any work day and I mean they knew what to do we knew what to do\nAnd even still even with that and he still has that\nHas happened to people that are going to return to their families\nDid the training they received to save lives that day were didn't it such an open question what our producers Robin semi and went to park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane warning a bank robber nearby an active shooter Douglas is a school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so\nUpgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments\nMultiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher not news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she's an enthusiastic teacher a planner\nShe believes in a good hard to think and being proactive once she and the other teachers had been trained they ran their students are all the new drills they'll school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying when you know the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures\nDishes what we do for ... for every period ... this is what a ... black and this is what we do for two days two days we went over the procedures with the kid might have to do with each and every class because they wanted to make sure that the kids [noise]\nNew procedures that it was like ingrained in our mind and that they knew so if they were apps and silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nSchool colors silver burgundy their on an alternating schedule [noise]\nWas it says her kids to the drill seriously on a scale of one to ten I Would say we were totally prepared like a ten\nThe school told every teacher to cover the tall rectangular windows in our classroom doors of paper\nAnd leave the paper up all year just in case if there were one it would make it harder for an active\nShooter to see and that's a lesson from previous shootings get out of sight\nShe knew it was real [noise]\n\nFor like the next Ninety second says kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running don't stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group\nKids that are running towards the freshman building oh man I was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way because\nThe way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the media center area the quad\nIt sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction wow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people and\nYes it was [laughter] yes it was ... there were terrified people running and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught you can choose to follow the protocol and follow your instinct for some teachers that wasn't a choice at all [laughter]\n\nIn her classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency folder\nShe kinda Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway group is small enough to fitness applied closet someone told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and moved there in the closet it was\nHot and dark except students face as led by their cell phones and Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third for the freshman building she tax she's on the tax to us that says there is a shooter there's a shooter and my floor\nUm and so my my friend Sara says drill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told her she had been graced by a bullet she was raised in her arm by a bullet thank God and I didn't hear from\nHer for a while in our went by\nHeard noises in the hallway and we've got really quiet um I had it has a flashlight part of my phone on so that we can kind of like eliminate the closet without having a light on and when I heard the\nWith the key um and so then I could hear movement in the room and then somebody that's comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police have said this is a police anyone in here and then there was I\nKind of like a pause and and they're like this is the police as anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is a police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is a police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time they set it on like afterward I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly I the handle and I opened it really so it gets even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they had their weapons drawn\nShe really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were caught\nAnd so I just very slowly ... than you pulled on the handle push it open and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] was uh told me that actually it was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy hold her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yells to you know Scott below to close the door and grabs the handle with two hands and pulls it closed\n'em so her door was open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway\nStacy is the teacher who's our most grade is she survived [noise] you've got Beagle in the room next to this day seized at the same things stay seated\nWaited a little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the doorway do\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting drills of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we think and talk about them are still statistically rare but now Melissa and actually has been in a rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both told me that having a play\nUp for what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class now I Move us all to a closet [noise] but they also both had ideas coming out of this about ways they could have been better prepared\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with God's in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually have save lives and mass shootings I really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help did more kids survive\nBecause of it what might have worked better Cheryl Johnson researches what's effective and these drills at Xavier University and the training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters Alice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfits safe havens international\nHas its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnson didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of those things I knew that done at Douglas like paper over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much it's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms also ... all the codes their colors and meanings\nConsumes I talked to said notice to\nA big advocate for not using codes and all I if I could read your takes a split second for your brain to be OK code red meat fad means that the shooter means I have to do that\nThe full keeping classroom doors locked rebounding yet but the idea that this is all you do that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options many more ways to respond to a shooting sometimes you standing room sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more access like a cafeteria gym\nAs a last resort you cite basically trust your ability to make a decision\nI told her about athletes her how she eats the doorway grabbing a dozens of scared student remember it was a break from her school's protocol Cheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed to actually did the right thing pulling and kids the problem with\nThat and unless you're there you don't know [noise] you know what exactly happened now does she probably save lives probably in in that situation at at work with the gunman being in a different building yes\nOne thing that was part of the training at Douglas was barricaded in your door basically pushing lots of furniture up against her classroom door but most and actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did those actually had done it\nAnd she followed the protocol locked him barricaded her door right away\nIt would've been way harder to pull those kids into her room from the hallway\nShutdown barricade herself first\nFewer kids would emitted in\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school\nMy daughter's nine fourth grade\nLast year she did a traditional locked down at her school squatting hide\nBut when I asked her what the journalists for she said I don't know exactly and say\nI keep thinking about this one shooting the red lake Indian reservation shooting and how that one classroom students did a traditional lockdown squatting behind because they practiced it\nAnd how it investigator on that case told me\nThat Israel did not help them at all that have been better off without it\nAnd the researcher who told me we should not do drills at school\nTo traumatizing for kids we don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\nI don't agree with no drills at all\nI Want my daughter to know everything\nAllowed her to know about barricade him [noise]\nAnd I want to know about running and fighting back\nI Want her to know that active shooters because the thing to reckon with [noise]\nI wanted to know there's nothing that can keep her completely safe\nOne more thing I'd say to my daughter's school Charles point about don't take codes\nI don't want someone to come over an intercom and tell my daughter code red\nI Want someone to say listen I was a person with a gun in our school of course I never want someone to say that at all\nOkay [laughter] okay [laughter]\nAgreed with me [laughter] [noise]\n\nYou know after a few minutes he's caught his breath enough to talk\nHe tell Sandy he wants to shoot him to stop so you want to take action somehow\nAnd then Chad's suddenly switches gears and starts filling out his feelings about guns and gun\nControl you know before I was going on in this world that can go through as ... because they're strictly Jersey drug stores are still able to get through and now\nHe plans to get a concealed handgun license when he turns Twenty one later this year the filters are actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun they believe in the second amendment but they're also advocates\nFor universal background checks in tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and factories like bump stocks I personally by however Sandy says they don't push their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing outreach\nTheir primary goal is to support but it's impossible for grieving parents to avoid the politics around guns there's a whole movement a conspiracy theorists who believe that the U. S. government stages mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed Alex Jones of\nCourse is famous for saying that mass shootings are big he's now a defendant in several defamation lawsuit when the Philips has ran into him face to face and a gun control a bad he accused them of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life and your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and ... and I'm listening to him just going you are so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of them it looked like a shouting match was about to start until Sandy stopped dead broke it up I reached out to John through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists\nNoticed truth ... troll families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting this can get dangerous after that Philips a son gave interviews and Aurora he got death threats and had to get the FBI involved the man who was threatening him ended up in jail\nOr one of the things the Philips has warmed parents about that\nMhm [noise] mhm [noise] [noise]\nAfter watching Lonnie and Danny in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with their daughters shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home in Texas this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time\nShe got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at the multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started Jessie from called Sandy from the theater\nThe minute I picked up the phone there was screaming just\n[noise] Arnold screaming in the background panic and he said there's been a shooting like what is he talking about 'cause Jesse had been\nAt a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left a food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in and open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but she's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been hit twice and it was when he said that that I went\nWhy isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said I trust\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was so low it was so horrific and took the no never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their ...\nJesse was one of twelve people killed that night and other Seventy people\nWere injured and then five months later there was another mass shooting\nSandy Hook were twenty first graders and six educators died\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted the Phillip says\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings and asked that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents they're\nSandy said they didn't even have to think about it they immediately said yes\nBecause they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after Jesse died [noise]\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown Sandy says they felt nervous uncomfortable\nMaybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence\nYou know it's like walking into a funeral or people that you don't know and I remember saying to my husband and we walked in the room and I saw their faces and he said that's what made it looked like five months ago\nWhich is that look like [noise]\nThey're hanging on to each other um they've been crying so their eyes are red they're walking almost robot like their bodies are moving but they're not really there\nI realized that's when I looked like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nShe wanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back Sandy said it was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw but the filled suicide there was also a strong and instant sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away from [noise]\nWell they were there they ran into parents from other mass shootings to parents from Virginia Tech in Tucson these parents have lost kids suddenly and violently and places where they thought that they were safe [noise]\nThe filters now had parents that they can lean on to this is the moments that launched the Philips as to what's become their life work they could see the need there no experts on what to do when your child\nWhat's happened to sort of help them find each other money and Sandy had set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nPlus a bunch of other practical things everything from medical bills and charity scams that use kids go to to raise money to how to get your child's body home if you live out of state however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nThey want you to move on what they want you to get back to normal light mon rather should they should [laughter] you're not sure he was you were should and you know ... you're right I'm not the same person on there will be the shooters were obsessed with this well you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with this\nThe Phillip says in a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand that the grief never fades old relationship start to fall away\nPeople who were closest to disappear which makes this informal support groups even more crucial\n[noise] without support looks like over time what it means to the parents who get it [noise] I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida\nWho lost their son in the shooting in Parkland on a kitten that store at I met them at their house their son's name was Nick he was the captain the Parkland swim team who's about to go to the University of Indianapolis honest when scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid\nWho collected different flavors of Oreos and waited for a Supreme drops which said they'd just reached a point where they were becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared play less and watch Scarface together\nThe day of the shooting Mitch an honest about phone calls and tax all day from people who said they'd heard neck was okay one person said they heard he'd been moved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting and others at a police officer with giving him a ride home\nAnd then a nurse at a local hospital said she thought patient who match next description but by that evening the door at still hadn't heard directly from Nick they went to uh marry out that law enforcement designated as a meeting area\nThey sat in the ballroom with other parents and waited\nFor the phone rang he jumped and think is Nick calling from somebody else's phone um [noise] the media was calling you give any comments can we help you find your son and I was just like [noise]\nYeah and I'm\nAt two o'clock in the morning is the this FBI car and then they start pulling one family into rooms at a time and the airstrikes claims from nature and\nThen their names were called out\nEven walking into that room you have this tiny little hope that they're going to say like ... we couldn't even find yourself and you know and I hope that he was arrested and have to keep on thinking maybe you walked home and and then you do the math in your head like to take that long\nTo our house and then they told us the news that he was gone he was shot and he was never brought to the hospital\nTo second nightmare\nSecond nightmare\nNext body was still at the school because he died instantly and the building was still a crime scene it'd be two days before they could see him on a could want it to look at his injuries Mitch did not\nHonest says this is just how her brain works she's an ER nurse she needs details the director at the funeral home wanting to protect her called the medical examiner's office to ask about neck\nAnd the person that answer the phone said oh I'm let me let me take a look what's the name again is Nicholas for a taste a swimmer swimmer is perfect [noise] I think it meant that there is nothing on his face or his head like he was able
