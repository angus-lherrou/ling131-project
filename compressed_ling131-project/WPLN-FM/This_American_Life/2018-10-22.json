Hi I'm actually in room eleven thirty sex can you hear me can you hear me [noise]\nAfter that the seven minutes of silence on the recording just like total silence nothing happens except every now and then turn just last to herself\n[noise]\nOne minute and forty seconds after the phone call then it's quiet there's no other sounds from forty four seconds and then on the recording you're here [laughter] [noise]\nNow and then she tries to door handle again thinking she told me later you know this can really be true like this cat this got to be with us going to work\nOne wall of the closet has the hallway on the other side and Eighteen minutes after car logs herself in she hears people she hears some German tourists walking towards her down the hall unfortunately she actually has the skills\nFor this very situation\nGermans come to the door of the room they whisper to each other for a little bit\nAnd then they do nothing [noise]\n[laughter]\nHer husband is that an audition he's also a singer and it's from it's turned off she takes her mom there's nothing back she finds her mom and ready then somebody taps on the door the hotel room and caused where are you okay\nCan you come to the door the person asks [noise]\nRight here oh [noise] [laughter]\nThere and I\nMy current news is really weird thing to say to somebody and you're going to rescue\nCouldn't help herself nobody wants to look like or not you know\nApparently the Germans when they found is very sweet\nJamaican housekeeper and twenty two minutes after ... walked in the house keeper setter praise\nGod I was so happy to see her and she was how nice oh my gosh she was so nice\nI Know this is a weird question but like is it appropriate to tip in a situation like\nThat [laughter]\nI don't know I didn't think of it than\nTurn remember is she's just an opera singer right an opera is all about spectacle you know eighty people from the stage and horses in of vengeance and big grand\nTo get further from that\nTo what happened to her in that closet right all the action takes place in a space not much bigger than your body it is the symbolism pot imaginable there's literally no movement in this plot it's among which is staged this as an opera\nHow would that go [laughter] [noise]\nUm it might be minimalist music actually a right [noise]\nLike just repeating beam over and over and over again with me yelling help [noise]\nYou know people say those kinds of things in interviews and then I'll put that quote at the end of the story and makes you sending put a little funky music I'm driven maybe you've heard our show [noise]\nBut when we did this interview like three or four weeks ago I wrote a witness and if a once in my life I don't have to let the story stop here I Am actually going to be an opera house very soon I can retire with this I can take this to the next logical step to step it never gets you to step you need an opera house for\nAnd it turns out I actually have a hook up for the kind of music that car and just talking about this because of his name is Philip Glass [noise]\nWritten\nA number of minimalist Auburn [noise]\nThey've been performed here in this very stage since the Nineteen eighties I stand on the beach just this past fall\nAnd so I caught Phillip and he sat down to write and so today right now I'm pleased to present here on the Brooklyn Academy of music up or

world please welcome Philip Glass [noise]\nBy a man Emily browser\nAnd cello and of course don't mean this is all about car and go free metro soprano\n\n[noise] [noise]\nAnd what happened next in this one school was transformed into a musical by a team of people who usually do this on Broadway pretty much everybody involved in this to cast the chorus the musicians the director Michael Mayer often Broadway words and music are by Lin Manuel Miranda [noise]\n\nProbably best known for writing and starting in in the height or he will be your narrator\n\nIn the plan was called operation remind them

know what we're going to wait for you because I didn't want to be like oh hey you're just a lot of their not handle whatever\nSay\nMr Fantastic is gone and his his name's either [noise]\nAnd co gave me a look but I can only describe as divorce dies [noise]\nToward that point I was convinced that we would be married forever and\nThen once I saw the divorce I was like oh I guess this could end\nIf it ended it would look a lot like that and so now [noise]\nAnd the two of us are running around the house or something like my marriage is falling apart like cats slowed and refined diving but we have another major problem in the house which is the debris might\n[laughter] [noise] we've actually\nWorse than that because they were their parents did they might say what's called ... most of which means they have a yeah you you might know it just says they've a parasite in them and as a result they're under afraid of cats\nAnd the unafraid of people in the way we discovered this was that my wife was watching TV and she looked next to her and there was a mild [noise]\nHe was watching TV also\nShe's green and he just looked up at her like you were a little like hey what's going on [noise]\nI don't like this show either\nI don't know why all those women who would want to marry that one guy [noise]\nEverybody she pushed him off the couch and he didn't even run away he didn't even hurry which is a bird in then did for my [noise]\nHe just walked in the kitchen like a room mate like five [noise]\nHow's it going the other room I just ...\nAnd many of the confessional into the mouse scam in the kids yeah [noise]\nIt was like I'm not here to make friends [noise]\nI'm here to win [noise]\nI was here before they came I'll be here when the John I'm a mouse [noise]\nThat's\nA real mouse like cats it's used up [noise]\nThat night I'm I'm sound asleep and my wife wakes me up by grabbing my face [noise]\nShe says mo my name's Mike [noise]\nMr Fantastic found the mouse you need to get the mouse and I showed up and I said oh we have a cat we do everything for the cat we give him food we give him an apartment that he thinks is the world [noise]\nSet aside from that area in the apartment for him to poop and the week lean more often in the area where we were [noise]\nWe have a gentleman's agreement [noise]\nMaybe in the unlikely event that mouse should walk in a jar [noise]\nMaybe we'll kill 'em miles [noise]\nNever splitting miles a gallon [noise]\nAnd he will be protected [noise]\nAt some ... father [noise]\nMy wife says Moe get the mouse and they stood up and I see what maybe the strangest Cabo Iowa ever witness in my entire life\nI've been mapping the mouse the mouse why doesn't the air and yes walks back as far as I [noise]\nI mean yes yup walks back\nI really thrilled [noise]\nToy is the law and [noise]\nI have a serious sleepwalking disorder so as I Am watching this I'm not even really sure it's happening [noise]\nI'm doing it I got this stream before [noise]\nMy wife says well get the mouse and she hands me a call [noise]\nAnd it's been a walk towards the mouse and the mouse walks towards me [noise]\nAnd I put the cup over the mouse a put a magazine under the cup I take the cup in the back yard and they put the mouse into the forest where I can only assume that he walked into the mouth of a wolf [noise]\nAnd from that day forward we have called it now to choose to [noise]\nI I Want to point out\n\nA few minutes ago I preface the story with the Massachusetts based upon [noise]\nCats who choose to\nWhich we all agreed as a group not funny [noise]\nJust moments ago [noise]\nI concluded the story with another massive choose to stay on [noise]\nThat was nearly identical [noise]\nAnd that was mouse to choose to [noise]\nWhich means\nIn a way it's like we're married [noise]\n\n\n[noise] okay so this is Ira cutting in rerun would you\nSay that today in twenty eight teams make is about to open the show on Broadway\nAnd one

shuttle bus to get taken to the cat standing in a cab to go home and we were the only two passengers on the back\nYou show your sit back there because I really\n[laughter] okay [laughter]\nWe heard him say this but we didn't believe him [noise]\nWe should have believed him\n'cause that's exactly what he dead he's been\nThe party line name in more than the airport and the call and I were in the bad humor and Kevin playing up the wild ride\nYeah [noise]\nAnd then he hit the brake really hard\n\nAnd then we had another car in the intersection [noise]\nMust be done about the nickel those falling into the luggage scary in front of her\nI don't fly into the air and headed towards\nIf I was walking distance they would probably take me like ten seconds up because I'm flying to take me
