went searching for somebody named Susan Jordan who he and his sister Kate and their parents knew for about a year when I was growing up in Cincinnati\nThese are the things that I remember about Susan Jordan me and her three in the background I'm telling you about the day camp I went to that summer I Can't get myself to shut up and they had alligators and snakes I can hear myself telling her and this one time this one alligator got out and the counselor had to catch it and on and on like that [noise]\nMen Susan flipping through one of those time life books rock and roll through the decades sixties she has long brown hair which incredibly skinny [noise] it's Nineteen Seventy five\nShe's wearing bell bottom Levis a faded Jean jacket she points to a picture of a bloated man in the powder blue rhyme stumped jumpsuit sitting cross legged on a stage before a crowd of crying women [noise] that's my favorite picture of Elvis she says there's information seems somehow personal an important

a couple of hours until her parents got home from work [noise] we didn't know any adults like we loved her December before I started to grade after being with us for a year to and got another job\n\nLast time I saw it was Christmas Eve Nineteen eighty two I'm sixteen a cashier at thrift way foods supermarket in Cincinnati where I Lived the place is packed all twenty five registers or going people are lined up halfway through the back of the store I look up in their shoes and Jordan\nShe smiles we talk she doesn't have many items so I checked them through as well as I possibly can't I Can't recall one thing we say to each other although I remember being distinctly disappointed to hear that she's married\nShe has to be some kind of business card her husband's probably something having to do with the building of redwood deck she seems happy\nMeanwhile there's a line of last minute Christmas shoppers mounting behind her\nUntil it hold on I'll Try to get my break we can catch up\nShe says great steps aside [noise]\nI keep signaling to my manager but there's no one to relieve me\nI keep granting behind Susan making apologized gestures\nI can still remember standing there holding on one bag of groceries smiling back or me\nFinally test me on the shoulder\nBut I come in here all the time I'm sure I'll see around\nI worked at two or three for two more years I never saw Susan Jordan ago\n\n\nThat drives me crazy that I never saw her again [noise] [noise] [noise] if I hadn't run into the store I don't think I'd care but somehow having her play what to me seems like a huge role in my life when I was a kid\nAnd then getting just a taste of what it would be like to talk with her as a peer\nI've never forgotten that\nI Know it's ridiculous but after years of thinking about her imagining what she's up to wondering if she ever things about me I just had to find her\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nI start with my only lead to one former employer of hers that I Know\nMy mom I like uh do you want to know I'm calling\nI Do I Do you remember Susan Jordan Wright\nIs George\nGeorge yes it's bringing about but I Can't place a she was our babysitter oh OK chicken ... one\nOf the many ideas that Susan introduced to her household was the concept of the nickname I think that's all I wanted to say about chicken legs in my pet a gun to my mother to fill in gaps in my memory of Susan but she didn't remember much more than I did\nAt that time she was taken a lot of drugs\nAnd every time I Would come home they would always try to get me to take drugs with them or something and I I really didn't do it much at all\nAnd it was really it was it was tough to come home and\nI I guess I must have been suffering a little bit I missed it I really missed my little brothers and my little sister\nAnd they were gone and I was I guess maybe trying to substitute\nI think maybe that's one of the reasons that I remember that we remember used to follow those because I think it works both ways I think that we felt if that didn't make you feel closer to us I think that we we responded and well\nI was desperately I guess I was looking for a family that I mean it\n[laughter] if only you knew you probably wouldn't make but I mean that\nPeople are complicated now what I really wanted to do with spend more time with your mom and dad but I was terrified [noise] I mean I I just couldn't I couldn't do it I was too shy and know a lot of times they it it was I thought they were asking me to stay longer and talk\nAnd I would just run out and I'm sure that we're [laughter] and they probably know what's wrong with her but I just couldn't do it\nSo he sort of talk to us instead yeah I was comfortable around kids because you know I had kids in my family [noise] [noise] oh\n\nUm every time the subject for hard times came up I hear a subtle hesitancy towards ...\nPercent better was embarrassment but that wasn't that exactly no it wasn't until we\nBeen talking for hours that I realized what it was\nShe was waiting for the other shoe to drop\nShe hadn't forgotten that are passed it happened she just forgotten that I witnessed part of it interfere it became clear the one that have been knowing under our entire conversation was that I was calling to say she damage me by exposing me do it\nI don't think I was too kind back then because uh there was a lot of turmoil in my life and in my family and that's what my fear is if I might have had some kind of negative impact on people\nAnd I know probably I did on a couple of people but they were my age but um\nYou know you just want to remember yeah I was a baby that are the kids love me\nBlah blah blah [laughter] but\nI Would be devastated if I heard anything different\nThere are parts of the past you don't want to go back to ...\nParts of yourself you don't want to go back to\nThe prisoners in Jordan here for life that I remember\nIs he or she just too soon forgot\nAnd it turns out I'd also done my best to forget what I was like\nI didn't think of myself to swear at all but Susan Jordan reminded me in the gentle terms possible\nWhen I was nine I was anxious and bookish\nNot to see him as an insult that I just kept thinking these kids don't know how to play\nWhen I went to your room I didn't it didn't seem like you had a whole lot of toys I Hope I've got to strike but it just seems like there were mostly books and more educational things\nI mean I remember you had planned it in your room a chemistry set and I didn't remember that ...\nHardly any dolls you didn't seem quite as playful as other kids that I had begun that ... more serious than general mainly I think that's what I did was try to play\nAnd\nPerhaps the most amazing thing about this whole story is how little I remember as a deceived us about each other even if they had deceived us about ourselves as Susan said at one point each of us remembered what we need to do about the other I needed to remember that part of Susan that she doesn't think about much her toughness in the face departure\nShe said she must be remembered the side of my family that I just take for granted that it was common our house that there are books there wasn't much fighting\nIt was the first time in my life where I had ever seen that keeps people lived differently than the way I left and that that's what I did I did I wanted from I Know\nYou can try to return to childhood by looking at photos are visiting the old neighborhood or listening to recording or you can find someone who knew back then someone you haven't seen since they still carry with them themselves the picture of you to some clouded by the years in between\nThe remember you better than you remember yourself and you could do the same thing for them

that that I Would one day be prime minister and it would be very important for\nHistory for people to know the the thought of a young Zionists as he prepared is way to meet his nation [noise]\n\nOr or regular listeners during this American Life might remember that that you've been on our program describing your experience in Israeli Army summer camp that was right before I started writing this diary\nRemain other sure let's see um\nThere's so much wrong with Jews in Israel that I'm going to have a job ahead of me one thing is the lack of any strong Jewish identity among most Jews this

[noise]\nCan I ask you to just read one of the passengers were you talk about Israel\nSure let's see\nI mean I have this thing from January fourth Nineteen eighty seven I memorized the hope ... which

fantasy of you know\nI'm not just a sixteen year old kid who's you know having crushes and you know a hopeless geek who can't get a girl with terrorism and being scared and confused about growing old I'm I'm the future prime minister of Israel and everything you know goes through that but I don't know I mean maybe\nThe maybe keeping a diary one tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain you know kind of person in a certain kind of situation\nMay may maybe maybe\nOther people in another kind of situation need to actually\nMake up a little fantasy ... yeah I think um\nI didn't have much angry about being the future prime minister of Israel is very calm and confident uncomfortable with it and I had so much anxious about every other aspect of my life [laughter]\nI Know it's

Wonder what are the sixteen year old Adam Davidson would feel\nIt knowing that finally you know an audience of a million people was was getting some of the reading from this diary\nI think this would feel so small to that sixteen year old this would feel so nothing\nI mean I remember I was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel and and I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions won't affect\nMillions of people like how is that enough motivation you know\nJust to have your petty little craft and you're petting little family and your small little apartment like [noise]\nYou know it just seemed pathetic\nI mean they have the kind of life that you know I mean basically I I Want my for myself\nYou're saying though is that the sixteen year old you would be cringing at your thirty year old just as you're thirty year old version is cringing at

when we were angels\nHistory originally came to us from a graduate student and we frankly studying drawing it the New York academy apart and she mailed a radio show a story that you wanted to get them to the program in which he had done is that she had recorded the interviews using her little micro cassette answering machine\nAnd then to edit\nThe quotes that you've gotten which you would do is that she would record by dubbing and recording on to her shiny red boom box\nIt was crude yes but the story sounded remarkably like stories and this American Life\nNot for one reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it on the radio but this week's show however we had to put together another story using that same style which we added music do here at the radio station to make it fully sound like story on our show\nDid a story about an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate\nUniversity is a pretty straight place\nEntertainment for most people means fraternity tigers\nIt's not the sort of place you'd expect people\nTo watch a guy sitting on another guy shoulders pretending to be a giant\nIt happened by accident in Nineteen Ninety four my friend's got with the top half\n[noise] there was the beginning of the school year and we were [noise] um [noise] aboard one night and we decided to go up to the quad and [noise] but it's basically just got up on a on phones back and he started yelling and screaming about\nHow he was a magnificent he was [noise] and um [noise] I think actually right after that I might have gotten back and said yeah you know I also try it [laughter]\nAnd uh I guess that really struck a chord had heard that was pretty amazing\n\nBecause I bought a lot about it um [noise] it actually good you know start thinking along [laughter]\n\nScott talked about the idea one night in the dining hall\nThe next day on the weight of class he saw signs all over campus and that that in both pretty\nHigh and nine feet tall come see giant man eight pm on the quad\nScott had no idea who put the nuts\nHe learned later that the science were posted by a guy who had overheard him talking at dinner\nScott decided he would go to the cloud of dust specified time and undertake the challenge\nHe would need to create a character in a costume for the giant\nGiant man a booming voice\nPart or even know exactly it was something like an\nOld I Am trying you know just the you know loud but just kinda weird [noise] you know sort of [noise] thing [laughter] way you know I don't know and\n\nGot asked his college friends hold on to act this giant man's leg\nThey grab some ... before heading up to the plot\nOf blanket wrapped around their middle and high Toyota\nAnd a flat really way like the guy I
