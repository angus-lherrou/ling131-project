a good thing it was when we had it I don't know about you but may I spent a full week obsessively reading\nAbout judge Kavanaugh and watching videos on line and calling\nPeople to discuss it and I know this is just daily life and are totally to buy the country these days but can I say for me again for me of all the moments we've had these last few years\nWhere red America and blue America look at the exact same about income to radically different conclusions\nAnd to me this one feels the worst of all I think because the original hearing itself with Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh the testimony was just so wow like it was so many hours and then both witnesses were so emotionally wrong\nThat even watching it was a motion was upsetting [noise]\nAnd then since that hearing we've had this week of waiting for the FBI report which held us all for a week in that same state vegetation and disbelief Republican disbelieve the Democrats Democrats just believe that the Republicans [noise]\nBut even in moments like this one there are people who haven't picked aside and incredibly sometimes those people are the ones who have to decide I mean like they had to cast a vote in the United States Senate\nAnd it does not seem fun for them\nToday and I shall we have somebody in that situation and our first act Arizona Senator Jeff flake [noise] no second act we leave Washington behind we have somebody who is literally deciding\nOn a man's life or death [noise] no real experience or understanding of how to do it [noise] but those people having to make these huge decision ... they are not comfortable with hall [noise] WB the Chicago Tribune American Life America stay with us\nBy\n[noise] to Senator Jeff flake was one of the central players in the drama on Capitol Hill this last week turn on the TV and you'd see is tortured face\nHe dragged his decisions down to the wire over and over he was undecided didn't seem like a no on Kavanaugh there was a yes that was let's wait a week there's your flake who made the Senate wait for a new FBI investigation than he was a yes again\nA producers W chase and spent a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode she did recording him for months and then he tried to pass\nAfter the cabinet of hearing watching what is going through and talking to him about how we made a choice is there's always the first thing I Want to talk about is the elevator okay it's a big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator here and tell you that's not a true story it's not what changed his mind\nI was there right behind the women yelling [noise] that's why my recording isn't clear as what you heard on CNN [noise] just staring at flake peering out from the elevator\nHe just stood me up for an interview Jeff Flake space can be a little deceiving he looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside he's just like humming a little tune\nIn this case though I think he was miserable he just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh ... dashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters and around the corner to get to the elevator to get to the boat and now he was you\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nAnd what they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country flick and declared that he will be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination\nThan English confronted by a mob of screening protesters the youth wing of the Democratic party Jeff Flake crumbled ... was one of the two women in that confrontation has had her play good morning good morning when that elevator dorm close to with Senator Flake did you think that history might change\n\nOr ... and Maria Gallagher and the other woman at the elevator the always hedge how influential they were lots of others don't reading things like it was the elevator pitch that altered the trajectory of American history\nAn on line said support the heroes who convinced fleet raised over thirty thousand dollars in a couple of days lots of people love this version of events and I think it's because they just want to believe protest works so much of these last\nWeek has been people watching the same stuff on TV and seeing what they want to say here's how I Know that story about the elevator about how it changed Jeff leaks mind is not true first of all I saw him she had no when asked about it by other reporters\nInto the women you this morning that they have any flaw here my\nWhole so we talked about it wasn't the there was a\nIt was the thing is just not the thing that convinced him protesters don't affect him like that I've seen him confronted by protesters over the healthcare bell the tax vote the dreamers\nIn for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them they're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal stories sexual assault\nIt's everywhere and it's a lot\nJust the day before ... and I got in an elevator on the other side of the building he was in the middle of a story about Lindsey Graham before women jumped on the elevator with us they were being a hero to shirts and I believe women T shirts they were filming hand and calling out do you believe women Senator Flake\nOut he's leaving the Portland we support what do you believe we live in one way and therefore we believe women we thank you what do you have to say please have something you can say that went in right now in the survivors\nGlad we're having this er into this\nAre you going to do the right than\nBecause it affects you and people like that [noise]\nThe week making fun of themselves we talked about this before like lots of men his age she doesn't connect you well to emotion\nWeb streaming is made possible by diversify trust and independent wealth management firm offering an integrated approach to the investment trusts estates and philanthropic needs of individuals' multigenerational families institutions and retirement plans learn more at diversified trust dot com\nI Want to just say going into a day like this undecided is both very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now\nI don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nDo you know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would not [noise] the one time he spoke in the hearing he sounded just as insurer as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nThis is not a good process but it's all we've got and I would just urge my colleagues to recognize that we are Twenty one very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent\nAnd India and there is likely to be as much doubt a certainty going out of this room today and uh and just have a little humility on that front so like\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because I think you can't understand what happens at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happens here\nThan eight after the four cabinet testimony Thursday night fleet stays up all night freaking out over what to do\nSome close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talked to lawyers going over what was said\nHe found Ford credible and convincing but he came back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony no one else could put him in the room that night he found Kavanaugh credible also in his anger wasn't is off putting to him as they thought it might be his staff said they'd never seen him like this\nWas agonizing to say it really was more so than anything in a decision on a boat and um\nIt's been it's just it's\nA debate for staff discussions late last night too and\nIt was that was pretty raw [laughter] you know [noise]\nThe next morning of course like finally released a statement he's going to vote yes on the judge\nWhatever you do say in the head and you've got to come back to\nPresent to them in a sense\nHe goes to the elevator get yelled at on TV than to the committee meeting you know that part [noise] meanwhile Chris Coons democratic senator from Delaware is on his way to the meeting with a bunch of reporters and and he gets the news that flakes he yes he choked up reportedly says\nAnd then we each make choices for our own reason I'm struggling sorry a lot of tears in the\nCouldn't stop the FBI report was a disgrace to basically they didn't follow up on any leads he said was not the investigation he'd asked for last week he was mad frustrated kept going off the record and raging he would not tell me about his conversations with Jeff Flake after they both read the FBI report\nI'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate here\nAs soon as flake voted friday he fled the capital I talked to him in the car\n[noise] people are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes he said why did you vote yes I Am presumption of innocence he told me over and over he was satisfied with the FBI report [noise]\nDo you feel better now you're kind of back among people you had kind of a week with the ... you know the Democrats celebrating you but you're kind of back among among your people\nAsk people stuff terrible chocolate chip are only about a party\nThere is no bipartisan right now there is no pile to stand in the middle of the quote a film that Robert Deniro was not in the kind of don't ever take sides with anyone against the family\nEver [noise]\n\nChase ... program I turn out of this recording that we found a Justice Anthony Kennedy Kennedy of course is retiring judge who see Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for the swing vote on the Supreme Court for years and being questioned into cue an egg back in twenty ten\nI stand here today just just a potential colleague starting the confirmation process how has the process changed since you went through it well I like my own [noise]\nYou know remember the\nSenate is a political party and they have to act in a political way\nAnd it's really not for me to tell\nUs how to structure that process\nI Do think ah\nIt has the obligation\nTo recognize\nThe necessity of preserving the neutrality\nOf our court and\nDo\nWhat you should ask is whether the judge has the temperament commitment and\nUh the character and the learning I think\nThe judge shouldn't be broadly read\nMyself was of fascinated with political theory at you know if if you ask what makes a good judge of going to get us an autobiography you know so you you have to be careful about the [noise]\nSome some southern southern southern southern slanted a method of as a really very difficult position [noise]\n\nKennedy was speaking to an audience could in high school students people asking state cases they'd always wanting to be on the Supreme Court no by the way he's funny he's a good talker and explained his job how it works\nWe will meet um just the nine of us and uh and discuss the case uh we begin with an order of seniority for the most senior judge or to the\nLeast senior and if the case is the one in which there is a great issue is a public policy involved um we know that were required to make a decision or the courts have been divided on it\nAnd let's assume that it's a five four case that it's not just reverse or from it's a question that the rationale\nThe reasons that you'll get\nAnd let's say five to four\nOr five in the majority don't have a lot of back slaps on high fives in thumbs up\nThere there's there's a moment of off\nWe realize one of us will have to write an opinion that commands the allegiance\nOf the American people\nAre an opinion that explains\nTeach the principles of war or the\nPrinciples of the constitution that controls will result\nIn when we issue that opinion and say an unpopular case we draw down on a capital of\nTrust and we make a withdrawal on the trust that in the public has been our institution\nAnd it is our job always to replenish\nOr by hearing to our judicial oath by hearing that the principles of neutrality\nThat's the way our ... works [noise]\n\nHow much do I don't know if this tells us anything profound about Anthony Kennedy or the Supreme Court but it's just kind of fun to hear how he talked about this\nI was meeting one time with our judges and attorneys in Alabama\nAnd I think it was a Saturday morning\nAnd for my schedule or there's are both was nine o'clock in the morning and they were dressed casually ready to play golf or tennis and they were gracious enough to hear me for a few minutes so I said well do you have any questions and one attorney raised his hand and said\nNow you have all that tremendous amount of reading to do all of those briefs or how do you possibly do that I said well I'm I have four clerks and divide them up among the course of course I have to read them all and they're very difficult cases\nOver the weekend just before argument and I like music I have opera playing in the background and I sometimes have cases that\nAre worn out for cases sometimes to opera cases [noise]\nWell the minute I said that I I kinda knew I lost the odd that they were too polite to roll their eyes but\nIt sounded kind of what intellectually\nPretentious or here's some eastern guy talking about the opera and\nBut ah so I thought I lost the audience but I was safe because a attorney in the room raised his hand\nIs all I have a rule like that when I write those rates I said oh it is that either one six pack refinances expect [noise]\nI said I think I remember your last one it was a three six pack [noise]\nWho's done wire like beer\nThanks to the farm club the Palm Beach is recording of Anthony Kennedy coming up the total and complete amateur has to decide to death sentence is only previous experience in these matters watching law and order that's in a minute to talk about big radio when our program continues\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n\n\nJust American Life from Eric last today's program the unhappy to siders stories of people who are saddled with difficult momentous decisions to make decisions that will determine someone's face for the rest of their life decisions that way on them like one of our program today was about a judge to is about a jury and we'll just get right to it\nThe story comes from the pod cast heavyweight if you haven't heard heavyweight it's hosted by one of our regular contributors here and a former producer of this American Life Jonathan Gold steam\nAnd the premise of the show is that each episode people come to Jonathan was something in your life that they want to fix they want to deal with they want to make right with another person usually it's something I've been living with for a long time and they're uncomfortable with\nAnd John is in ways that kind of bumbling detective Colombo figure but one who actually is kind of bubbling an awkward but he gets the people to sit down and talk and has things out many of the episodes are really funny or the one that we have today is a more serious wind\nDoing his job to go to Dan\nIn two thousand and eight San received a letter for jury duty\nThe death penalty and that's all it would've taken\nPreventing the death sentence only required one dissenting vote votes fan could have cast so they would have been no miss trial no hung jury and instead of the death penalty Paul story would have gotten a life in prison without parole\nAnd that would that would have been nice to know [noise]\nI could have changed [noise]\nUm [noise]\nAfter the article was published something else happened something spend never expected or wanted\nPaul stories mother Marilyn got in touch\nShe reached out with an email filled with the sentiments of forgiveness she addressed given me if I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and\nKnowing knowing that there's that forgiveness to Trump's so weird like it it wasn't something I can completely understand\nFor spent it didn't make sense why would Maryland want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive himself for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that and like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her message ... how do you mean\nWell I I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as a a ... ... it just floored me I'd I didn't know what to say\nSan was never able to write Marilyn back\nAlready did began to reply but I didn't have the courage to [noise] finishers and that sort of you know there's so much pain in there and\n[noise] I feel like it really wrecked things up [noise]\n\nA few months after spend receive Maryland's email an execution date with that the state would put pause story to death on April twelve of two thousand\nHappened Glen and Judith cherry the parents who the victim came forward it seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied\nTo cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against capital punishment in a video they released publically Judith cherry presents a statement which reads in part we do not want to\nTell stories family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son they are innocent of his deeds based on this testimony was only five days to spare\nPaw stories execution was postponed\nWhen news of the stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance an opening to finally respond to Maryland's email but he didn't it's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want\nI I Need to apologize for not [noise] not doing what I should have done to begin with for not following my good for not Brian [noise]\nShame leads to inertia\nAnd it's even the most casual reader of the fundamental physics will tell you entered object will remain and our until it has acted upon by an external force in other words it takes a little nudge and who better to supply a little nudge than a little knowledge and so I write Maryland a letter\nI Know this is a really sensitive and deeply personal issue would read\nAnd I hope I'm not being too forward I ask Marilyn as she remembers a juror by the name of spanberger\nAbout a week later I received a note back via email thank you so much for your letter Marilyn writes\nI have no ill will toward Mr burger I have offered in my email address as well as my phone number with no reply she also forwards her original emailed to span the once you spend two years ago the one he can't stop thinking about when I read it\nI'm expecting a grand gesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even uses the word instead\nIt's just six short sentences which Marilyn thanks for the article and says she shared it with her son cartoons breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark I understand that span\nConsumed by guilt would read so much into so little but what I don't understand is why Maryland sent in the mail in the first place [noise]\n... I don't I\nLike I have a couple of little things if you're if you get back to ... some\n... some of the stuff I don't know some cookies [laughter] yeah OK\nMarilyn lives in Fort Worth Texas the two of us meet in a hotel suite downtown where I Can't stop offering the food that she can stop refusing view on the coffee or tea Maryland is Tom Allen stately with smiling eyes so she's in ... boots and a crop blazer all in black\nShe sits on the end of the couch next to an empty armchair and tries to give me a sense of what her life was like before the trial\nI was always slice of the party I mean I was a jokester\nAll makes you you have melons because she's going to keep the policy going [noise] I was always kind of the ones that everybody went to people know you can call me in the middle of the night you know if you need somebody to come pick you up you know Paul Marilyn she'd get up she'll go do it\nSince the trial Maryland doesn't feel like the same person every day she's reckoning with the horror of her son's crime and worrying endlessly about safety in prison for friends have fallen away the thing that's hardest though\nWere you know look upon her son she says that everyone's pass judgment on Paul written him off is worthless and unreliable and they blame him for her pain\nAnd I even had a family member were powerless to cost about this and that was a very hard for me it's like they wanted everything to be okay but that's my chow and I love him and I'm not going to ever stop fighting for him\nFighting for men working with her son's lawyers to changes sentenced to life in prison\nPiles appeals more exhausting\nIt took up all over time and energy update which affected the hospitality job she worked at for over Thirty years\nIt became extremely hard for me to concentrate at work and I feel like it cost me my job\nAfter losing her job Maryland that lost her house she was forced to move in with her younger son\nSo it's kind of like you know at my age where I thought that I'd be getting ready to retire I'm starting over so that's a hard thing\nThen I'm In I'm\nTen years after the trial and everyone your friends or family have all moved on to in Maryland right fans article she signed him someone like her ... someone who never gotten past that final day of the trial\nWhen they actually gay defendants the death penalty I thought I had that I\nHadn't really died they didn't even register because I'm just like you know what just happened when ... died\nYou know my whole time that I was just look at the jurors to try to read okay what are they thinking what are they doing [noise]\nUm I wanted them to know if I can only tell them what kind of person he has and I want people to know you know everybody's ... they assumed that if you involved in a heinous crime like that the true a monster but he wasn't a monster\n[noise]\nIf you know OK so she is going to come up Maryland and I have been talking for about an hour and a half when the front desk\nFor us I think that probably is then is it ... ... as the and spends and spends\n[laughter] I Hope I get there before he gets it [laughter]\nBut before we get a chance to practice arts fans span this at the door [noise]\nThat I've done and it's very nice to meet you there is some errands here now how do you\nSpend your ... okay\nI get a lot of spin lingers in the door the hotel room sit down a have a seat over there uh he's the spectacle neatly dressed in a collared shirt and sweater he looks around and clears his throat um [noise] a little nervous [noise] so\nThere were there were the last time Maryland in ... and then in the same room was ten years ago at the trial\nMaryland was seated behind the bar spent sat and the jury box but today he sits down in the empty armchair beside her to do in the world you can't quite bring himself to look at her as he tells Marilyn what it was like to receive or email you gaze is down in his lap\n[noise] it was very surprising and um [noise] I read and re read it and I even read again\nSo her letters or never went anywhere I Want to say what do you say about that\nI don't want to write a letter that's trying to make me feel better you know what I mean\nFrom the moment the vote was cast I regret I saw I'm doing wrong", "show_name": "This American Life", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "08"}
