P. L. N. dot org\nRemember in the news was boring and politics is boring that happen right\nI'm not imagining that you're there I was there that happened in our lives I miss it I didn't appreciate what a good thing it was when we had it\nI don't know about you but me I spent a full week obsessively reading about judge Kavanaugh and watching videos on line and calling people to discuss it\nAnd I know this is just daily life and are totally divided country these days but can I say for me again for me of all the moments we've had these last few years\nWere red America and blue America look at the exact same event and come to radically different conclusions\nAnd to me this one feels the worst of all I think because the original hearing itself abducted forward and judge Kavanaugh the testimony was just so wow like it was so many hours and then both witnesses were so emotionally wrong\nThat even watching it was emotional it was upsetting [noise]\nAnd then since at hearing we've had this week of waiting for the FBI report which held us off for a week in that same state vegetation and disbelief Republican disbelieve that the Democrats Democrats just believe that the Republicans [noise]\nBut even in moments like this one there are people who haven't picked aside\nAn incredibly sometimes those people are the ones who have to decide I mean I had to cast a vote in the United States Senate\nAnd it does not seem fun for them\nToday and I shall we have somebody in that situation and our first act Arizona Senator Jeff flake or second act we leave Washington behind we have somebody who is literally deciding on a\nMan's life or death [noise] no real experience or understanding of how to do it [noise] but those people having to make these huge decisions they are not comfortable with hall [noise] W. easy Chicago just American Life America stay with us\nBy judge [noise]\nTo Senator Jeff flake was one of the central players in the drama on Capitol Hill this last week turn on the TV and you'd see is tortured face\nHe dragged his decisions down to the wire over and over used undecided didn't seem like a no on Kavanaugh there was a yes and was let's wait a week is Jeff Flake who made the Senate wait for a new FBI investigation than he was a yes again\nProducers though ha to spend a lot of time with Jeff Flake of last year you may remember the hour long episode she did recording him for months and then he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill and she was with him in the days before and after the cabinet of hearing watching what is going through and talking to him about how we made his choices there's always\nThe first thing I Want to talk about is the elevator okay it's a big story Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator near and tell you that's not a true story that's not what changed his mind [laughter]\nI was there right behind the women yelling [noise] that's why my recording isn't clear as what you heard on CNN [noise] just staring at flake peering out from the elevator\nHe just stood me up for an interview just like these can be a little\nA lot of the time when inside he's just like humming a little tune\nIn this case though I think he was miserable he just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh ... dashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters around the corner to get to the elevator to get to the vote and now he was you\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nAnd what they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country flick and declared that he'll be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination\nThat English confronted by a mob of screening protesters the youth wing of the Democratic party Jeff Flake crumbled ... was one of the two women that confrontation has had her play good morning good morning when the elevator dorm close to where Senator Flake did you think that history might change\n\nOr ... and Maria Gallagher and the other woman at the elevator the always hedge how influential they were the last of others don't and reading things like it was the elevator pitch that altered the trajectory of American history\nAn online site support the heroes who convinced fleet raised over thirty thousand dollars in a couple of days lots of people love this version of events and I think it's because they just want to believe protest works so much of these last week\nHas been people watching the same stuff on TV and seeing what they want to say here's how I Know that story about the elevator about how it changed Jeff weeks to mind is not true first of all I saw him she gives had no when asked about it by other reporters\nInto the women you this morning that they have any last year my\nAlso we talked about it wasn't but I Do think there was a\nIt was a saying she's not the thing that convinced him protesters don't affect him like that I've seen him confronted by protesters over the health care bill the tax vote the dreamers in for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them\nThey're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal stories sexual assault it's everywhere and it's a lot\nJust the day before Lincoln I'd gotten an elevator on the other side of the building he was in the middle of a story about Lindsey Graham women jumped on the elevator with that they were being a hero shirts and I believe women T shirts they were filming hand and calling out you believe women Senator Flake\nOut easily Portland\nWe support what are you one way and therefore we believe women we thank you what do you have to say please something you can say that went in right now in the survivors glad we're having this or is it is\nDid it affect you and people like that [noise]\nBenefit ... [noise]\nIt's like making fun of himself talked about before like lots of mend his age she doesn't connect you well two emotions\nAnd he walked into the hearing to listen to the doctor for it and judge Kavanaugh not sure what to do [noise]\nYou explain what happened next I Want to just say going into a day like this undecided is both very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now I don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nDo you know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would not\nThe one time he spoke in the hearing you sound to justice\nThe end of the day this is not a good process but it's all we've got and I would just urge my colleagues to recognize that we are Twenty one very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent\nAnd India and there is likely to be as much doubt as certain to go out of this room today and uh and just have a little humility on that front so like\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because you can't understand what happens at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happens here\nTonight after the Ford Kavanaugh testimony Thursday night sleep stays up all night freaking out over what to do\nSome close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talked to lawyers going over what was said\nHe found Ford credible and convincing but he came back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony no one else could put him in the room that night he found Kavanaugh credible also in his anger wasn't is off putting to him as they thought it might be his staff said they'd never seen them like this\nWas agonizing to say it really was more so than anything any decision on a boat um\nThere's been this just\nHadn't debates staff discussions late last night too and\nIt was that was already raw you know [noise]\nNext morning of course freak finally released a statement he's going to vote yes on the judge\nWhatever you do I say in the end you've got to come back to\nThat person up to the medicines\nHe goes to the elevator get yelled at on TV than to the committee meeting you know that part [noise] meanwhile Chris Coons democratic senator from Delaware is on his way to the meeting with a bunch of reporters and and he gets the news that freaks yes he chokes up reportedly says\nAnd then we each make choices for our own region struggling sorry a lot of tears in the capital\nCouldn't stop the FBI report was a disgrace to basically they didn't follow up on any leads he said it was not the investigation he'd asked for last week he was mad frustrated kept going off the record and raging you would not tell me about his conversations with Jeff Flake after they both read the FBI report\nI I'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate her\nStudents flake voted friday he fled the capital I talked to him in the car\n[noise] people are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes he said why did you vote yes I Am a presumption of innocence he told me over and over\nHe was satisfied that the FBI before do you feel better now you're kind of back among your people you had kind of a week with the ... you know the Democrats celebrating you but you're kind of back among among your people\nAsk people about stuff or a chocolate chip are only about a party\nThere is no bipartisan right now there is No Child to stand in the middle of the quote a film that Robert Deniro was not in the kind of don't ever take sides with anyone against the family [noise]\nEver [noise]\n\nChase ... program which turn out of this a recording that we found a Justice Anthony Kennedy Kennedy of course is retiring judge to seek Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for the swing vote on the Supreme Court for years and being questioned into cue in a back in twenty ten\nI stand here today just is a potential colleague starting the confirmation process how has the process changed since he went through it well I like my own [noise]\nYou know remember the\nSenate is a political party and they have to act in the political away\nAnd it's really not for me to tell\nUs how to structure that process\nIt has the obligation\nOr to recognize\nThe necessity of preserving the neutrality and the independence\nAnd integrity of our court\n\nYou should ask is whether the judge has the temperament commitment and\nOther character and the learning I think the judge should be broadly read\nMy self was of fascinated with political theory you know if you if you ask what makes a good judge you're going to get an autobiography you know so you you have to be careful about that\n... southern southern southern southern Senate a method of as a really very difficult position [noise]\n\nKennedy was speaking to an audience putting high school students people asking ... cases they'd always wanted to be on the Supreme Court no by the way he's funny he's a big talker and explained his job how it works\nWe will meet um just the nine of us and uh and discuss the case uh we begin with an order of seniority for the most senior judge or to the\nLeast senior and if the case is the one in which there is a great issue is a public policy involved um we know that were required to make a decision or the courts have been divided on it\nAnd let's assume that it's a five four case that it's not just reverse or from it's a question that the rationale\nThe reasons that you'll get and let's say it's five to four\nThe five and the majority don't have a lot of back slaps on high fives in thumbs up\nThere there's there's a moment of off\nWe realize one of us will have to\nWrite an opinion that commands the allegiance\nOf the American people\nUh an opinion that explains\nTeach\nThe principles of war or the principles of the constitution that controls the result\nAnd when we issue that opinion and say an unpopular case we draw down on a capital of trust and we make a withdrawal and the trust in the public has been our institution\nAnd it is our job always to replenish\n'em by hearing to our judicial oath by hearing that the principles of neutrality\nThat's the way our ... works [noise]\n\nI don't have one more story I don't know if this tells us anything profound about Anthony Kennedy or the Supreme Court but it's just kind of fun to hear how he talks about this\nI was meeting one time with our\nJudges and attorneys in Alabama\nAnd I think it was a Saturday morning\nAnd for my schedule or there's are both with with nine o'clock in the morning and they were dressed casually ready to play golf or tennis and they were gracious enough to hear me for a few minutes so I said well do you have any questions\nAnd one attorney raises Hanna says\nNow you have all that tremendous amount of reading to do all of those briefs\nAh how do you possibly do that I said well I'm I have four clerks and\nDivide them up among the course of course I have to read them all and they're very difficult cases I Will take them home and read the brief the second time over the weekend just before argument and I like music I have opera playing in the background and I sometimes have cases that\nAre one application sometimes to opera case [noise]\nWell the minute I said that I I kinda knew I lost the ... they were too polite to roll\nIt sounded kind of what intellectually pretentious thirty I heard some eastern guy talking about the opera and\nBut uh so I thought I lost the audience but I Would say because the attorney in the room raised his hand\nOh it wants to expect brave and it just expect [noise]\nI said I think I remember your last one it was a three six pack [noise]\nWho have done [noise] wire like beer [noise]\nThanks to the farm

today's program the unhappy to siders stories of people who are saddled with difficult momentous decisions to make decisions that will determine someone's face for the rest of their life decisions that way on them that one of our program today was about a judge at two is about a jury and we'll just get right to it the\nStory comes stretching the pod cast heavyweight\nIf you haven't heard heavyweight it's hosted by one of our regular contributors here and a former producer of this mechanized Jonathan Gold steam and the premise of the show is that each episode\nPeople come to Jonathan was something in their life that they want to fix they want to deal with they want to make right with another person usually it's I mean they've been living with for a long time and they're uncomfortable with\nAnd Jonathan but he's a kind of bumbling detective Colombo figure but one who actually is kind of bubbling an awkward but he gets the people to sit down and talk and has things out many of the episodes are really funny uh the one that we have today is a more serious wind\nYou know here's Johnny book staying\nAll I had to do was declined the death penalty and that's all it would have taken\nPreventing the death sentence only required one dissenting vote votes fan could have cast so they would have been no miss trial no hung jury and instead of the death penalty Paul story would have gotten a life in prison without parole\nAnd that would that would have been nice to know [noise]\nI could have changed\nUm [noise]\nAfter the article was published something else happened something spend never expected or wanted\nPaul stories mother Marilyn got in touch\nShe reached out with an email filled with sentiments of forgiveness she addressed given me if I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and\nKnowing knowing that there's that forgiveness that felt so weird like it it wasn't something I can completely understand\nPretend it didn't make sense why would Maryland want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive himself for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that and like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her message ... how do you mean\nWell I I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as that are like ... it just floored me I I didn't know what to say\nSan was never able to write Marilyn back\nAlready did began the reply but I didn't I didn't have the courage to\n[noise] finishers and that sort of you know there's so much pain in there and\n[noise] I feel like it really wrap things up [noise]\n\nA few months after spend receive Maryland's email an execution date was set the state would put pause story to death on April twelve of two thousand Seventeen\nBut then something unexpected happened Glen and Judith cherry the parents of the victim came forward it seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied\nTo cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against capital punishment in a video they released publically Judas cherry presents a statement which reads in part we do not\nWant to pile stories family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son they are innocent of his deeds\nFive days to spare Paul stories execution was postponed\nWhen news of the stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance an opening to finally respond to Maryland's email but he didn't it's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want\nI I Need to apologize for not [noise] not doing what I should have done to begin with for not following my good for not Brian [noise]\nShame leads to a nurse or as even the most casual reader of the fundamentals of physics will tell you\nEntered object will remain unnerved until it is acted upon by an external force in other words it takes a little nudge and who better to supply a little nudge than a little knowledge and so I write Maryland a letter\nI Know this is a really sensitive and deeply personal issue would read and I hope I'm not being too forward I ask Marilyn as she remembers a juror by the name of spanberger\nAbout a week later I received no back via email thank you so much for your letter Marilyn writes I have no ill will toward Mr burger I have offered in my email address\nAs well as my phone number with no reply shows or forwards her original emailed to spin the once you send two years ago the one he can't stop thinking about when I read it\nI'm expecting a grand gesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even uses the word instead\nIt's just six short sentences which Maryland Thanks for the article and says she shared it with her son cartoons breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark I understand that span\nConsumed by guilt would read so much into so little but what I don't understand is why Maryland sent in the mail in the first place [laughter]\n... I I was joking I\nLike I have a couple of little things if you're if you get a package at all or some\n... some of the stuff I don't know some cookies [laughter] yeah OK\nMarilyn lives in Fort Worth Texas the two of us to meet in the hotel suite downtown where I Can't stop offering a food that she can stop refusing view one of the coffee or tea know Maryland is tall and stately with smiling eyes so she's in slacks boots and a crop blazer all in black\nShe sits on the end of the couch next to an empty armchair and tries to give me a sense of butter life was like before the trial\nI was always life either party I mean I was a joke sure\nI'll make sure you have melons because she's going to keep the policy going I was always kind of wanted everybody went to people know you can call me in the middle of the night you know if you need somebody to come pick you up you know Paul Marilyn should get up she'll go do it\nSo since the trial Maryland doesn't feel like the same person every day she's reckoning with the horror of her son's crime and worrying endlessly about safety in prison for friends have fallen away the thing that's hardest though is that the people who remain\nThe people closest to her you know look upon her son\nShe says that everyone's pass judgment on Paul written him off is worthless and unreliable and they blame him for her pain\nAnd I even had a family member was our powders to cost about this and that was a very hurtful it's like they wanted everything to be okay but that much how and I love him and I'm not going to ever stop fighting for him\nFighting for him men working with her son\nPiles appeals more exhausting\nIt took up all over time and energy which affected the hospitality job she worked at for over Thirty years\nIt became extremely hard for me to concentrate at work and I felt like it cost me my job\nAfter losing her job barely then lost her house she was forced to move in with her younger son\nSo it's kinda like you know at my age where I thought that I'd be getting ready to retire I'm starting over so that's a hard thing\nAnd I'm In Manhattan\nTen years after the trial and everyone or friends or family have all moved on to in Maryland right spends article she signed him someone like her ... someone who never gotten past that final day of the trial when\nThey actually gay defendants the death penalty I thought I had that I\n...
