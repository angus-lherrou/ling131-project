did this project and get started it was kind of an accent and certainly my part of it was but I did do the first one with Dave Weiner back in the early summer of two thousand and three and it's the team plus years now and it was incredible fun I'm\nI'm Dave wider and I am a media hype and I'm I'm always trying to find new forms of human expression using technology and I in a real sense among the creator of pod casting\nSaid Weiner came to the Berkman Center at Harvard law school and I was a fellow there\nAnd [noise] um I was sitting in one of the conference rooms of Berkman Center [noise] and

radio for the Internet Chris it's like a Web blog which is what we called blogs back then except it's with audio\nAnd he said will have some fun I Know programming and syndication you know radio with the world needs is a MP three audio files that can be syndicated and so we set to it in about two months later he said I think we've got it and I said what are we doing it\nWorld [noise] I don't know what kind of\nDemocratic experiment this blog idea really amounts to well um\nGosh changes all the time when we first started doing this it was just a bunch of people sort of a writing pillow world and being amazed that it was it possible to do that uh\nYeah he did the heavy lifting on Europe was rooms of programming but he had taught me how to do it with him in and I did my on my part when it could but he he he knew what we were doing it [laughter] and I was just on the right\nIt is no coincidence that spring of two thousand and three was the start of the Iraq War\nPresident George W. Bush has launched war against Saddam Hussein we can tell you that these targets of opportunity has been hit\nJohn let me ask you first of all of our crew there are you and er and ... and all are well\nWe're a little excited David and I'm sure is obvious but yet we check\nIn the American media in particular had totally dropped the ball they didn't see what was coming they all endorsed it no sort of the consequences\nAnd the blogging and eventually pod casting became one way for ordinary people to speak their mind on the subject that you know the great wise focuses I had completely missed not was the beginning it was people looking for a way to speak their\nMind [noise] there I Want to ask you the route political question which which has to do with the Bush administration and the and the war in Iraq\nIt seems to me we've never had less debate less dissent more confusion\nA more general mass deception about what we were getting into than we've had\nIn the last six months or a year since nine eleven it has not been an explosive period of expression comment criticism investigation democracy in short a what's missing a big question I don't really know I mean it's the one thing\nUh had it written about her so I felt like she really been kind of like a race for music history if you're not sort of written about ah there's no record of your work we all know of course it she's an icon and amazing\nUh but I just really felt like she you know her working and everything she done had been quite minimize\nAnd ah after we had our conversation for power in the blood I didn't want to get off the phone she said to me that she didn't want to get off the phone she's had allowed and I was like\nOh my God that's amazing ripped\nOut and um I really left that injury wanting to think about writing an an authorized biography of Buffy ... Marie\nSo Bobby was hard to put the trust him someone to tell your story\nNot really and I was so glad that I'm\nI'm you know a couple of years earlier I had read and read his first book we ought to know [noise] um because there's so there's so much that comes through in her writing that she's a beautiful writer she's real intelligent and she is real funny\nAnd she can see if she can just kind of see be between the lines of um [noise]\nUh both the show and the business and that's always been real important to me both of them and there really is a difference between the show and the business and so she could see that I kind of been abused and kicked around by the business that the show is still a little ... a whole lot of fun for me and I think that's one of the places we really connected on\nWell you're so funny and like your music is so full of hope I mean it's none of none of the things that have been sort of like done to you arguably has dampened your spirit\nAt all and I I Am one thing I Love this book does is it do set the record straight on a couple of things that I think people get wrong about your puffy for example you didn't play Woodstock\n[laughter] [laughter] I Know I think if we would start a Andrea in the book she points\nThat out yeah people almost every concert in the U.S someone will come up joined you say you know we're so good at Woodstock I just love you you were just a best friend\nAnd I would start [laughter] what do you and I spent some time with Joni Mitchell and may tell her the same thing we were so good at Woodstock and she wasn't there either I don't know I guess they might I don't know what they were ah smoking that day but you know drugs right and they were there on the\nAssumption is that you would be because you were such an important part of that time so I feel like people just create the scenario they wish that had existed\nBut it's interesting that this myth of some times bigger than the actual story itself and it and it leads me to some of the challenges he must have had injury I mean you knew Buffy was born in a reserve somewhere around Nineteen forty one but there aren't\nA lot of records from that time was what what is it like to put together a complete story above your life with such low information to go on\nI like the fact when I'm because I Do care so much research and I really care mostly about sort of people's lived experiences so\nBeing able to like just spend so much time with Buffy like she was so generous with her time we were on the phone constantly so she really was able to fill in so many different gaps where she could and then I Would be able to sort of bring 'em a different sort of lends from\nThe music industry point like the fact that she's never been nominated for induction into the rock and Roll Hall of fame and these other huge life that's Donovan gets a lot of credit for her song you just you know terrible I'm very frustrating so these kinds of things are where I can bring my lunch to\nIt I think this would be I think this is the part of the book that I find the most fascinating is is when Andrea on earth things about you that you have perspective on it and we we feel like you and I both\nIs just take a listen to this\n[noise]\nAnd not Cracker Barrel from Tchaikovsky or from track off with a cracker\nBarrel or if you're just tuning in by the way this is not Saturday afternoon of the opera I was speaking with other legendary Buffy ... Marie and our official bark for Andrew Warner so Buffy your first crush was check off you\nA little girl so piano when I was by age three and I fell in love with it the way all the other kids love sports and Barbie dolls I loved\nMusic and I I started playing fakes confiscated very young age but after you you found something interesting in Buffy the love of ...\nWell I you know I think one of the things I just thinking about what it is to um come out of trauma and where you place your trust in people my assessment was that you know it makes a lot of sense for one's first crash to be one and natural musician I'm a dead natural reason\nAnd do you find safety in in um sort of someone's you know hypothetical arms that isn't there at all but ... you can take a lot of comfort in from their music because you love it so much and I think ... and that was sort of my assessment was that it makes sense\nThat you know a a young girl who's coming out of sort of uh some traumatic situations in her childhood what gravitate towards like a dad gay classical musician and and I think I think it's a beautiful you know there's a lot of there's a lot of hope there but there's also a lot of sort of that darkness that we we moved through as well\nAbove the is it is a challenging for you to relive some of this and the writing of this book to talk about early trauma intimate partner trauma um ... episodes of heroin or these hard things to relive\nNo it it wasn't hard to relive and I think but it it\nIt's something that I've held back on\nOffering is part of my showbiz bio yeah I'm ... and ... uh you know the respect really is neutral because I really think that she is a superb writer you know when we first started Andrea said you know if there's anything you don't want to talk about we just won't but and I and I don't think anything ever came up that we didn't want that we weren't both interested in exploring\nAbsolutely and I and I feel like from the very beginning you were very clear one you didn't want me to put you on a pedestal and I'm not super interested in that myself 'cause I don't I think actually when you put them on a pedestal you're doing them quite a disservice like you're not actually treating them as a person and I really think that all\nAll of us needs to be treating each other as a as people because I sort of create community ... compassion models ways to live and our environments um\nAnd I think that that I just think that's a that's so important I can still be a fan of your work and I was still obviously deeply sided with you um but I also\nI also want to see you as a real person and I think that was that was pretty vital to the the writing of the biography like that\nAnd I think I think that ... a share Andrea dug into the songs which made me happy because for me it's never been a boat I'm being a show business personality so much as the contents of the songs is what I was trying to get across yeah that's why I wasn't so mad at Donovan you know [laughter]\nI I wanted to get the message out and Andrea seem to be responding to those things in the songs that I had really intended and I felt as though we were both aiming for the same target mhm\nThey're either issues around that that brings up an interesting point because the the focus on the songs I'm ... and the way that record labels and other people in the business didn't want to focus just some of the songs or something that comes up a lot in this book some that I didn't know about it and I found really interesting you describe the feeling of a lack of creative control over your music especially when it's\nYou tell me a little bit more about that [laughter]\nWell it was a little bit on I mean I\nHad just gotten out of college thought it was going to India I was playing trying my Lockett folk singing and manage village do pretty good vanguard records one or two signed me I went to sign with them I almost signed with Blue Note which is a jazz very well by the way\nUm but I went into vanguard and they said who is your lawyer and I said I don't have one they said that's OK you can use hours\nThey signed makes us feel I mean [noise]\nAnd um you know a lot of the early people in management they ... they just didn't know what to do with me you know they didn't mean to be mean to me or [laughter] you know a particularly colonial about it or you know any of that\nThey just didn't want to do with me they um many of them wanted me to where you know come up like Pocahontas infringes\nThey wanted to play that you know the most dumped them come from a you know real New York show business thing we had thought I have a gimmick [laughter] and they will and they still they they didn't know some of them were afraid of the fact that I was outspoken I think they didn't know what to do with that they thought that I Would offend\nThemselves and also I wasn't very smart about social things I didn't grow up\nLike in a social climbing environment or in a business environment where the family all has you know they're talking about business at the table and there wasn't a lawyer in the family ... I'd never met any of those people\nIn party and go drinking after either they got an actor too\nYoung and when you don't when you kind of a ... when you kind of you know I don't know I go home and rice\nWine for me and for me to go to a an after hours by our everybody's getting half ... and I don't drink at all\nUm I even unintentionally insulted some people I didn't mean to but for instance in ... there was celebrating the in the sixties and they'd\nGet over this four hundred year old bottle of wine and I'd say oh no thanks I don't drink and that's not\nCool [laughter] I didn't know that you were supposed to kids businessmen on the cheek I hold back from that and because they didn't go out drinking after hours where did you ... and the ... and everybody else went that's the way the business deals were made so I missed a lot of business opportunities and social opportunities for\nMemory with I felt like this book was I felt like it was you taking control back from these people who try to control you you know well\nThis is Ninety point three WPN\nLand Nashville public radio Ninety One point five W ...

Bush has launched war against Saddam Hussein we can tell you that these targets of opportunity have been hit\nJohn let me ask you first of all of our crew there are you and er and ... and all are well\nWe're a little excited David as I'm sure is obvious but yet we check\nIn the American media in particular had totally dropped the ball they didn't see what was coming they all endorsed it no sort of the consequences\nAnd the blogging and eventually pod casting became one way for ordinary people to speak their mind on the subject that you know the great wise folk of our society it completely missed not was the beginning it was people looking for a way to speak\nTheir mind [noise] you know I Want to ask you the route political question which which has to do with the Bush administration and\nThe and the war in Iraq it seems to me we've never had less debate less dissent more confusion\nA more general mass deception about\nWhat we were getting into than we've had in the last six months or a year since nine eleven it has not been an explosive period of expression comment criticism investigation democracy in short or what's missing the question I don't really know I mean it's one thing\nThe traditional places where I Would go to find out about musicians of that kind of iconic status\nOr had it written about her so I felt like she really been kind of like a race for music history if you're not sort of written about uh there's no record of your work we all know of course that she's an icon and amazing uh but I just really felt like she you know her work and and everything she had been quite minimized [noise]\nAnd ah after we had our conversation for power in the blood I didn't want to get off the phone she said to me that she didn't want to get off the phone decided allowed and I was like\nOh it's amazing to reach out and\nUm I really left that injury wanting to think about writing an an authorized biography of Buffy ... Marie\nSo bumpy with her to put the trust him someone to tell your story\nNo not really in I was so glad that I'm\nI'm you know a couple of years earlier I had read and read his first book we ought to know [noise] um because there's so there's so much that comes through in her writing that she's a beautiful writer she's feeling television is real funny\nAnd she can see if she can just kind of see the between the lines of um [noise]\nUh both the show and the business and that's always been real important to me both of them and it really is a difference between the show and the business and so she could see that I kind of been abused and kicked around by the business that the show is still a little ... a whole lot of fun for me and I think that's one of the places we really connected on\nWell you're so funny and like your music is so full of hope I mean it's none of none of the things that have been sort of like done to you arguably has\nDampened your spirit at all and I I Am one thing I Love this book does is that it does set the record straight on a couple of things that I think people get wrong about your Buffy for example you you didn't play Woodstock\n[laughter] isn't that funny [laughter] I Know in order to make if we would start a Andrea in the book she pointed that out yeah people\nAlmost every concert in the U.S someone will come up joined you say you know we're so good at Woodstock I just love you you were just the best friend\nAnd I would die [laughter] what do you go I spent some time with Joni Mitchell and may tell her the same thing it was so good at what started she wasn't there either I don't know I guess they I don't know what they were ah smoking that day but you know drugs right and they were there\nOn the assumption is that you would be because you were such an important part of that time so I feel like people just create the scenario they wish that had existed\nBut I did it interesting that this misses some times bigger than the actual story itself and it and it leaves me to some of the challenges he must have had injury I mean you knew Buffy was born in a reserve somewhere around Nineteen forty one but there aren't\nA lot of records from that time was what what is it like to put together a complete story of buffets life with such little information to go on\nI like the fact when I'm because\nCare mostly about sort of people's lived experiences so\nBeing able to like just spend so much time with Buffy like she was so generous with her time we were on the phone constantly so she really was able to fill in so many different gaps where she could and then I Would be able to sort of bring 'em a different sort of lends from the music industry point like the fact that she's\nNever been nominated for induction into the rock and Roll Hall of fame and these other huge place that's Donovan gets a lot of credit for her song you know just you know terrible I'm very frustrating so these kinds of things are where I can bring my lens to it\nI think this was the I think this is the part of the book that I find the most fascinating is when Andrea on earth's things about you that you have perspective on it and we we I feel like you and I both learn something new about your story an example of that is just take a listen to this\n[noise]\nI'm not Cracker Barrel from Tchaikovsky or from try coffee Cracker Barrel or if you're just tuning in by the way this is not Saturday afternoon of the opera I was speaking with\nOther legendary Buffy ... Marie and our official bark for entry Warner suffer your first crush was check off\nA little girl is piano when I was by age three and I fell in love with it the way on the other kids love sports in Barbie dolls I loved\nMusic and I I started playing fakes confiscated very young age but after you you found something interesting in Buffy the love of ...\nWell I you know I think one of the things I just thinking about what it is to um to come out of trauma and where you place your trust in people my assessment was that you know it makes a lot of sense for one's first crash to be won a natural musician I'm a dead natural revision\nAnd do you find safety in in um sort of someone's you know hypothetical arms but isn't there at all but ... you can take a lot of comfort in from their music because you love it so much and I think ... and that was sort of my assessment was that it makes sense\nThat you know a a young girl who's coming out I was sort of uh some traumatic situations in her childhood what gravitate towards like a dead gay classical musician and and I think I think it's a beautiful you know there's a lot of there's a lot of hope there but there's also a lot of sort of that darkness that we we move through as well\nAbove the is it is a challenging for you to relive some of this and the writing of this book to talk about early trauma intimate partner trauma um ... episodes with heroin or these hard things to relive\nNo it it wasn't hard to relive and I think but it it it's something that I've held back on\nOffering is part of my showbiz bio yeah it's like ... or you know the respect really is neutral because I really think that she is a superb writer you know on when we first started Andrea said you know the ... and you don't want to talk about we just won't put it on and I don't think anything ever came up that we didn't want that we weren't both interested in exploring\nAbsolutely and I and I feel like from the very beginning you were very clear one you didn't want me to put you on a pedestal and I'm not super interested in that myself 'cause I don't I think actually when you put them on a pedestal you're doing them quite a disservice like you're not actually treating them as a person and I really think that all\nAll of us needs to be treating each other as a as people because I sort of create community crates compassion models ways to live and our environments um\nAnd I think that that I just think that's a that's so important I can still be a fan of your work and I'm Still obviously deeply sided with you um but I also\nI also want to see you as a real person and I think that was you know that was pretty vital\nI think I think that oh shit Andrea dug into the songs which made me happy because for me it's never been a boat I'm being a show business personality so much as the change of the songs is what I was trying to get across yeah that's why I wasn't so mad at Donovan yeah [laughter]\nI I wanted to get the message out and the Andrea seem to be responding to those things in the songs that I had really intended and I felt as though we were both aiming for the same target\nMhm but there are you there were issues around that that brings up an interesting point because the the focus on the songs I'm ... and the way to record labels and other people in the business didn't want to focus just some of the songs or something that comes up a lot in his books from that I didn't know about it I found really interesting you describe\nThe feeling of a lack of creative control over your music especially when it came to your first record label on on on on vanguard he told me a little bit more about that\n[laughter] well it was a little bit on I mean I\nHad just gotten out of college thought it was going to India I was playing and I'm trying my Lockett folk singing and manage village\nDo pretty good vent got records wanted to find me I went to sign with them I almost signed with Blue Note which is a jazz very reliable by the way um but I went into vanguard and they said who is your lawyer and I said I don't have one they said that's OK you can use hours\nThey signed me to a seven year deal I mean\nAnd I'm you know a lot of the early people in management they ... they just didn't know what to do with me you know they didn't mean to be mean to me or [laughter] you know a particularly colonial about it or you know any of that\nThey just didn't want to do with me they many of them wanted me to where you know come up like Pocahontas infringes\nThey wanted to play that you know the most dumped them come from a you know real New York show business thing we got to have a gimmick and they will and they still they they didn't know some of them were afraid of the fact that I was outspoken I think they didn't know what to do with that they thought that I Would offend\nThemselves and or also I wasn't very smart about social things I didn't grow up\nIn a social climbing environment or in a business environment where the family has you know they're talking about business at the table like there wasn't a lawyer in the family or business I'd never met any of those people\nIn party and go drinking after either they got an actor too\nYoung and when you don't when you kind of is when you kind of you know I don't know I go home and rice wine for me and for me to go to a an after hours by our everybody's getting half ... and I don't drink at all\nUm I even unintentionally insulted from people I didn't mean to but for instance in ... there was celebrating me in the sixties and they'd\nGet this four hundred year old bottle of wine and I'd say oh no thanks I don't drink and that's not\nCool [laughter] I didn't know that you as opposed to kiss businessmen on the cheek I hold back from that and because they didn't go out drinking after hours where the ... and the ... and everybody else went that's the way the business deals are made so I missed a lot of business opportunities and\nSocial opportunities for memory\nWas a felt like this book was I felt like it was you taking control back from these people who try to control you you know", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018",
