F. L. in Montreal and you know there's all and not just me every comic you want to have that that really killer ten minutes you really want to just do the type that you really have to grab their attention\nAnd it's nice to know that you know usually they're my own fans coming out to my shows and and I really I don't have to ... I'm already gotten that ... that passed that first level of dating if you will and when you get to know me better yeah\nBut until then I was kind of known to be more of like the more the subtle you know a character actor wasn't famous but the ... a good hand on the set of ... which is all I wanted to be it was just to be a good character actor I didn't you know it was not in the cards I thought for me to be no notice them is\nI I felt like well I thought I was older and I felt like I just\nI just felt like I had that character look and I I just wanted to be a character I had no desire to be leading anything so I just wanted I just said if I and I think that the fear of like going back into medicine if this fails was always weighing in my head so\nI was like man if I can to score a couple of road like oh you're that Dr from knocked up and have to go back to my day job in my mind I still one for him I always have that thing in my head like okay maybe I have to go back and so\nBy the time I'm a ...

look in the Blu ray DVD of hanging over one\nThere's me in the desert I'm doing this improper ten minutes and it's not listed as refined do you see be kind of an ... it is like I'm literally channeling me being really mad at the demons of at the world for you know cursing my life with cancer I remember that Italy and I was just like shouting of screaming in the most\nPolitically incorrect things I still don't remember what I said but it was just raw as I've ever been on any set and I just remember yelling allied and and I got this big applause at the end of it and uh\nI went to Todd I was like man this is this is this is what I mean so therapeutic so I just remember\nThinking that and I would think about ... cancer while onset just to get me into character plain mister chow as aggressively as I did so they kind of taught me that life is you know\nIt's the whole adage of life is short so you might as well while you're here just make the most to whatever opportunity you got and I definitely channel that in the hangover movies because it was like that that right there it's just kind of you know\nWhen I think about it it's it's it's complicated for me to watch it because especially the first one because I ended up thinking about ... and and then\nBut also on a on a on a on a positive side side I ended up thinking like wow this is this is you know just don't think

factor and all the reasons perhaps you you thought you had to be a doctor do you remember seeing Asian Americans on television in comedy but you were young\nTap Merida is only one I really remembered you know from the karate kid you know and a Henry Cho when I was in college\nAmerican comedian or from Knoxville, Tennessee gossip ... he's really funny and he'd be he was on Jay Leno a lot I remember he was a big influence and then\nMargaret Cho was really the pioneer into this to this day she is still like the the I don't know she is kind of the godmother of contemporary Asian American Asian Canadian comedy she really is just kind of the reason we're all here\nLooks like the next clip picking because\nThey had a real problem with me because I look it's way that I talk this way

the conversation\nWas about how far we've come how we've far we've come in and representation how how far become an Asian American representation in in cinema\nAnd the point and I'm not I don't have a clip of this I promise but the point we had come from being like sixteen candles with long ... sixty got up and do you remember that one that was another kind of what you saw on TV right\nI mean I I think now you know crazy Rich Asians that is like the first project I the first major movie that's become this global head where\nI don't think about oh what's in it for me you know the the first movie I've done where that that is really hit where I'm like\nI Am so happy for the movement as opposed to the movie John Chu the director is like this is not a movie it's a movement and we're all drinking offer that Kool Aid while we were filming it just is not about\nI mean we all news really not about us is not how to get to that at least for me not how to get to that next level which like I

for beer I public radio international Tom power\nThe theme song for NBC's called his community [noise]\nOne of the breakout star so that shows and other than John you just heard the first part of my conversation with him in front of a big crowd at\nJ. F. L. forty two in Toronto hundreds of people shut up to the theater to hear him talk about his career so far going from medical doctor to comedian or in the second part of the chat we talked about how ... community made him a better actor but first more on Asian American representation\nIn comedy which is something can thinks about a lot these days\nI think about it all the time any you know I think about a lot more because knowing that\nKnowing I Am who I Am and knowing that I'm ... you know knowing that I I have a voice I the only thing I can be right now is just to be myself in in in to an end to have my work express whatever I'm thinking in and that's why I like stand up so maybe that's why like stand up so much because I just\nDo it for you like to do it for therapeutic reasons they just tell me it's better to shoot a movie like crazy Rich Asians and then be at home like feeling sorry for myself you know so I I feel like there's\nI guess the messages to just keep moving forward I guess it's been nice talking to you and talking so much about them you know\n[noise]\nWhat age do that was my conversation with Ken Jon comedian actor and Dr ... J. F. L. forty two in Toronto\nYou could watch out for his Netflix special it comes out in twenty Nineteen if you want to see some video footage of our interview you can find that on Twitter at the CBC Radio cue and if you want to see that scene and community he was talking about where his own email to the creator of the show Dan Harmon was dramatized had to CBC dot CA slash cue to check that\n\n[noise] [laughter]\n[laughter]\n[noise] [laughter]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nMy cue on CBC Radio one serious acts and once again I Am an for P R I or public radio international\nOn how old you are and I got I'm going to sound like Colombo right now but I'm realizing even though I'm Still in my early thirties that there's an entire generation of adults now who have very little memory\nOf life before the Internet and when you ask these people like to grow up on line to get some pretty interesting answers so take el mills for example\nAs a kid growing up an auditor she always had a camera in her hand she shot home videos these turned into shorts sketches eventually into short films now not so long ago a kid like Elvis probably destined for film school\nEl mills have something else in mind she started her own channel on YouTube people started watching elves videos pretty much immediately these days for YouTube channel has more than ... million subscribers she goes on tour people lined up for hours to meet her after the shows I mean it's a dream come true right\nAccording to el mills yes and no you're about to hear that all that attention all that fame all that success in a new media space can be kind of overwhelming even if it is something you've always dreamed about\nI always wanted to be in the movie the TV but then when you chew became a thing when I was like in like five six middle school and like I knew that was what I wanted to do because it's just so accessible to drop out of school right yeah\nI dropped out uh I did a semester where a auto you for marketing up cool a but then my YouTube channel is blowing up and I decided I wanted to focus on that so I decided to take a semester off here\nAnd I haven't gone back how ... how did that go with your folks both of them were like shocked at first um because I was I was a academically driven um but um my mom was very supportive she says whatever you want to do\nUm and my dad was just a little concerned for sure but now he totally understand that they cause he just didn't understand like the whole world and that well yeah I mean\nWhen your parents were ... they there was no YouTube now so to them it probably does seem like staring into a camera from the older generations perspective obviously I understand what it looks like it looks like just someone making little videos on line yeah but so much more than that this the\nOn social media world has become a whole different thing ... insane now are so tell me about how long does it take to make videos when the ones I figure like between for sick sometimes eight ten minutes how long do they take it to me [noise]\nI'd say a solid week of like straight work so like every day every hour I'm working for a week it's become a huge production at this point yeah I just keep I keep raising the bar and just keeps getting bigger and bigger\nAnd part of this is is getting so much of yourself in this to you you're given a conscious decision that you wanted to reveal a lot of yourself and that's yeah\nI I I I just find my life I don't know if this is not specific to say but I find very interesting [laughter]\nI just find that\nIt's not me it's the people in my life I find them fascinating they're all such characters to me and I find that in any person you mean you could turn them into a character I like the idea of like showcasing that because I found my family specially very interesting and ... but also just so unique like you've never seen\nSomething like that before you ... some of the most personal things a person can view if you talk about in these videos are connects play one to listen to the\n[laughter] humans are so strong to repress I figure that out in front of me see on your first one I had known for Fifteen sons went out and I may have had a little too much to drink person\nI almost made it wasn't trying to pull me aside and I told them everything and he told me\nLawson who you are your feelings are much more has something to celebrate the went back to Ottawa than a day out you know [noise]\nI Know you should have been distances they came back home and September now you know why\nThe future but he would almost four million views covered by news outlets all over the world of view [noise] coming out yeah\nMe coming out that that he has a video of me crying and my dad was for a very odd that as almost four million is\nHow do you decide to do it but let's start with how do you decide that this is how you want to come out\nI'm just so bad it being vulnerable which is surprising if you look at\nSo I find being vulnerable on camera is kind of loophole to that because when I'm being vulnerable shirt is being showcased to millions of people but\nAt the moment in at the time of me being vulnerable I'm by myself for the camera so I'm like catching the system and being able to being vulnerable without having to be vulnerable to a loophole yeah love it\nTell me about the moment you made that decision though to do that do you remember was there a time was or space where you some where you're at a table in the back of a car like when did you decide I was going to make this video\nIt's when I decided it's one I figured out as bisexual I was like okay now I Need to tell people because it's something that's been like a like a weight on my shoulders for a long time and I as keeping a secret and I know I knew my my mom would especially she knew I was hiding something for me so I knew it was time to just kind of like\nReally sad pressure and so I just thought\nIt was like I thought making the coming of it it will be like killing a ton of birds with one stone like I Would not have to sit down every friend and sit down every family member and tell them how to do that you didn't tell personally feel about that [noise]\nYeah I I realized after their ultimate no no no there's some people like I didn't tell my sisters\nI just found out through video because they were raised very religious they are very religious Christian folk yes exactly and so there were ... off the very upset by that um they shouldn't find out what the rest of the world they should find out oh just maybe a few seconds before hand but I get it yeah I I I I learned from that experience so\nThat after that you start getting thousands and thousands of more people subscribe to YouTube channel is that something you noticed\nYeah that that Comey on video blew up\nLike nothing I've ever seen before it changed the videos venue we're making afterwards\nIt changed in the sense that I I started putting a lot of pressure on how good the videos are like because I felt like a lot of the ... the coming of video blew up because there was like\nA you know I came out and everyone's just trying to be supportive but I think a lot of it was they they were intrigued by this story telling and how I made the actual video itself and so I was like really worried that the next video is not as good or something so that to a change\nReally but it wasn't like oh I Need to give way more myself now\nKnow a little bit ... right after the command video I was like okay I Need to do more and he'd go bigger\nAnd and you can play another cookie or how did you\nMake a living on the little ... like my ... was the last well maybe and I just got a good idea\nOf German very very visual one\nI have an announcement I was you know on the way you want to use the bottom where our ... me [noise]\n[laughter]\nSo that's about ... video called I legally married my sister's boyfriend\n[laughter] I married
