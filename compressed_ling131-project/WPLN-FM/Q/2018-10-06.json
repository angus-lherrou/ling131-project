afternoon at one\n[noise] [noise]\nYou are listening to chew on CBC Radio one serious exam one sixty nine NPR\nI public radio international non power\nWelcome to the show if you're going to retell an old story particularly the kind that people cult classic you better have a pretty good reason for doing so a star is born is one of those certified classic films and you can sort of see why\nIt's like the perfect music business story it's about two people falling in love one a budding singer on her way to the top of the other a legend who is let's say struggling\nAnd it's a story that's already been told in Hollywood three times most recently by Barbra Streisand and Chris christopherson back in Nineteen Seventy seven\nSo when Bradley Cooper decided to remake star is born again this time with Lady Gaga doing the Barbara Streisand part he knew he had to bring something new to the table and he also smartly knew that a film about music\nAin't really good without well music\nMusic to my\nBradley Cooper ...\n...\nCooper singing music to my eyes on\nThe song co written in produced by a guy named Lucas Nelson Lucas also appears in the film business ... band you promise of the real\nBut according to Bradley Cooper Lucas brought more than just music newest star was born he was the basis for his entire character\nKnow some probably help with that but apparently at all not what will you but when Bradley saw Lucas Nelson backing up meal young so I had to start by asking Lucas Nelson just what it was that this big movie star Bradley Cooper who saw in him\nA lot of what he really liked was sort of the camaraderie that we had with each other and the band and that um\nYou know there were no sort of special effects Neal actually had the screen covered in burlap that was behind the stage with a with was the big burlap seed bag he covered this and he had ... on the stage and it was just [noise]\nIt's just pure jam rock and roll legendary Neil Young song [noise]\nI think I think through Neal come ... most beautiful things you're not going to say they say that as a Canadian while Iowa [laughter]\nYou're right and I always feel like there's two types of people that I meet in this world and there Neil Young fans and not Neil Young fan if you don't like any all young and I find out like if we're on a date or something then suddenly my phone rang and my mother will really need help somewhere\nUp at all [laughter] he did a difference though in in you know understanding music enjoying vulnerability music and loving great music and the realities of actually being on the road and I have a buddy of mine who says that half the if it's similar to you and your young he says half musicians he may want to be musicians\nUh the the new manager comes in and says hey you know I like what you're doing ... she was working at it you know she was take out the trash in a restaurant you know and\nIt can be almost devastatingly easy\nAre in order to say well I better you know what I'm not quite sure I like this but\nI got to do it because what else am I gonna do [laughter]\nYou know I I got to play music and then maybe I can get famous and then I'll be able to do whatever I Want after that yeah 'cause all have enough money to do it yeah you know so a lot of people sort of compromise\nAnd there isn't a right or wrong on it really you know you've got to make a living you know ... that's the thing is that when you see somebody who is able to make a living\nAnd keep who they are\nYeah that's really worth the title celebrity that's when we really can celebrate somebody that's one I think it's worth it because\nIf you see somebody out there like like Gaga like Stephanie or Bradley who's made it and the successes there but the fame is almost more like a symptom of the success because they just driving their driven they want to do the best they can and what they do and that is worth celebrating to me\nAnd I and I will say well I Know just from playing folk music I play the traditional music from Ireland yeah when we talk about how to do it we would talk about artists who seemed to have maintained the right way to do this thing exactly the right eye celebrities you're talking about because your dad comes up a lot\nOh yeah you add wars ... William ... better but Willie Nelson of so many people is is the right way to do it and I I'm I have to ask her it just does he ever talk to you about this\nAh well yeah court sort of I mean dad and I talk about a lot of things where you know we get philosophy philosophical we see things\nEither die and uh and I you know\nHe's taught our family our family my mother and my father or are there do the good people and they raised as with you know a\nConscience and yeah I think about them when I'm making decisions in life all the time\nYou ... you know and it you know\nI don't think it matters though that I was a musician or what\nIt's all about staying true to who you are really life you know resisting temptation is it to the temptation to lose oneself for again like the Beatles said um gain the world and lose your soul you know um\nWe were talking about the space between us oh what's that song\nAnd the people who hide themselves the on new ... never blames the truth then it's far too Lee's ... as a\nOr within within you without you\nWithin you without you one of the more beautiful lyric Lee songs I you know I Love George Harrison too you know because George was one of those guys I mean the Beatles Paul McCartney you down to earth people you know yeah they sure they're around a lot of famous people and there's a scene that always around people who are elevated like that in different ways but\nThey've kept you know they're about goodness they're about bringing goodness to the world and love to the world\nAnd standing for something and they have something to say like in Jackson says in the movie if you don't have something to say you're not going to have legs\nLook if it's been great talking to you before we go I'm a star as boring as I get the feeling going to influence a whole new generation of musicians what are you hoping young artist take away from watching a star is born\nI Hope that it inspires young people and old people it doesn't matter how old are you know ... to\nWant to do to want to slow down and do something for yourself you know and then have something to say I think the rat race gets us all caught up in what we feel like we have to do to make ends\nHave to spend all their ... all of our time if ... you know making ends meet [noise]\nYou know but even so if you have a little even the hardest working of us you know in in countries where people have nothing you know they have\nArt and they have music and they bring that into their lives and they didn't riches their lives despite the haves and the house and have nots you know in life and and I think that so no matter what you do in life if you can sort of\nFind music you know I think you'll you'll do better things will be better looking for talking to me the name in absolutely it was a pleasure\nYou could be Lucas Nelson playing with his band promise of the real in a star is born to the movies are today fast track is also out today and on it you'll find that\nWhen\nHave the\nKnow no one man\nTo re\nA\nUm\nNa\nYeah them on knees\nStar is born a mismatch tracked Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper thing I don't know I Love that song co written by Luca smell some\nAnd I don't know [noise]\nMhm [laughter] mhm [laughter]\n[laughter]\n[laughter]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] you were listening\nTo cue on CBC Radio one serious exam one sixty nine for public radio international\nWhich goes by ...\nIf you're one of the forty thousand people showed up at B.
