like staying and Elvis Costello and feisty Katie laying all gathered to celebrate Leonard Cohen music one year after he died\nI realized the last time I had the chance to talk to Adam Cohen about his father's music was just weeks before Leonard Cohen passed away that would actually the first interview we aired when I started hosting cue\nConversation focused on what would be his final album you

you for having me in the forward to the same you talk about Leonard's notebooks your father's notebooks almost as if they were an extension of the man himself can you tell me more about this new book the scraps of paper that surrounded him\nAbsolutely of course this is a man who is devoted to black cunning pages from a very young age and [noise] there were scraps of writing everywhere at all times and he would wake up early every morning and\nWas the sort of devout sense of purpose that\nResulted in a tower song in this in these terms in terms of excellent work and um he wasn't doing it for a for anything but I'm a sense of vocation calming\nAnd uh it's true to to know my father was to know a man who had no books practically falling out of his pocket and they were in every drawer and as I sit in the forward I even found one in the in the freezer one time when he told me to get some tequila\nSo of course my work as an imprint of his or her and my thoughts you know I'm also in this peculiar position where I Am I'm this reluctant ambassador of a of the of all things going these days\nSo I feel deeply embroiled and it's it's a badge of honor but I Do it with some level of discomfort as well\nI can I can hear that and that can I can certainly understand that I mean I I think about everything you've done since your father's passing or just\nLast album do you want to darker than to distribute concert in Montreal last year that we spoke about and now you're here talking to me and you're talking to so many people out the flame this this final book of poetry\nAdam you've done so much to help us whether that was your intention or not but to help us more in your father and and and to understand your father and to\nTo appreciate your father's work you've done so much to help us I Want to thank you for that\nOr you're most welcome those of gracious words from you and I appreciate them have you giving yourself\nThe same chance like ... how are you doing I I was just curious because I Know that\nI Know even when you say when my father passed you know I I I was so deep and this is just you know my dad I Would just so deep and organizing the funeral and organizing the gravestone and organizing the cremation and are organizing the party organizer Irish and and organizing to you know the music and all that stuff that by the time\nIt was over I realized I hadn't really I hadn't really aggrieved at all you know what I mean\n[noise] I Know exactly what you mean yeah you know it's um it's a curious too curious thing to be\nTo be my father son in this world he's left such a remarkable imprint on sending when he's touched and I'm I'm going through his papers there are still so many matters that I'm dealing with\nAnd\nHe comes to me and dreams still I'm embarrassed to say it's been two years since he's passed almost and uh\n[noise] you know I'm I'm even\nThat was tasked with finishing a few more songs of his that he that he that we'd started together on the last album and so his voice is literally still in my life um [laughter] so it it's a it's a\nBizarre to bizarre and delicious entanglement um\n[noise] I mean a long story short I I Believe that there are some really beautiful new songs of honor gone that no one's heard that uh that are at some point going to come out oh my God that's been that's amazing\nIt's extraordinary that he has left so many poems um that were actually recorded and many of them um we started on the last record on while we were making you want to darker\nAnd sometimes I Would implore him even though I knew he was in a delicate stayed at sea dead just just read this just read this poem to a to a metronome\nAnd we'll look at it later and there's some of my favorite poems of his are actually in the vault and I was tasked with finishing them and that was also beautiful about them is that unlike a the the very the the gravity\nAnd the nature and the tenure and the tone of want a darker and these have a sort of more missed so romantic a\n... a kind of tone that resembles his older work something more romantic so that's also more surprising is that daunting for you to have to to finish her father's work like this\nIt's such a luxury it's such a treat and as I say it's been a meditation because I have a little studio in my backyard and\nI go there with a a mug of coffee and and areas again this singer is powerful distinct voice who happens to be particularly stirring for me 'cause it's my father and the sense of responsibility and an at the same time as I say you know with\nThis this feeling like um how wonderful\nThat ah\nThem see them to see them to completion for\nNot just for me because I'm part of the family business but for all the people out there who are who are going to hopefully delight in hearing his language that in the middle contribution of his\nUm [laughter] you know that there are these there are these songs that exist that you want to finish these incredible powerful readings that were set to music and it's going to surprise people skin surprise and delight\nGetting any timeline next year it's I Believe\nAt I mean we really generous before we say goodbye and the forward that you're up for the flame you cut a line from one of your father songs I came so far for beauty and I left so much behind\nWhy did that line come to mind when you were thinking about your father's life and legacy\nIt reminds me of a few times um towards the end where we'd sit on his front lawn\nAnd pause would would occur\nIn conversation and he would reflect on all of the compromises that he made\nAll of the all the romances he left all the family a scene that he felt to move you hit poorly acquitted himself of\nAnd he said you know of all the strategies I tried to employ really nothing nothing really works nothing offered this solace to work blanketing pages being a poet offered me and I felt like she was apologizing\nAnd uh\nOf course that song immediately came to mind just became so far for beauty he left so much behind but of course that wasn't the truth is at all you know [noise] the amazing impact that he had on our lives on anyone's life he came into\nAdam I really appreciate you taking the time to time I know it's as you mentioned I Know it's a complex thing to do but I I'm I'm incredibly grateful that you did your always a gentleman thank you\nAdam help pull together a new collection of previously unseen homes written by ... it's called the flames and the book is out everywhere is tomorrow coming up on the show Justine ... she was Mallory and family time she's written a new book exploring not just fame but what happens when fame\nStarts to go away [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nYou were the cue on CBC Radio one serious I Am one sixty nine\n... public radio\nDon't know how often do you think about fame like the level of fame but you can't even walk down the street without being stopped\nKnow frame by the way I Do not bad [laughter] because the radio frame but you know the fame that the Selena Gomez is of the world have to deal with the Justin Bieber is people are following you around every move\nIs reported on and gossip magazines Instagram and the ... I mean there's got to be pretty crazy life is the one that Justine Bateman knows a lot about\nJust being Bateman played Mallory Michael J. Fox his sister on family ties back in the Nineteen eighties\nBack then Justine couldn't go anywhere or do anything without swarms of fans following her around shouting her characters named Mallory Mallory\nBut then one day something changed all that fame began to disappear and the way she puts it losing fame was like sand slipping through your fingers\nWhat kind of effect does that have on a person you sky rocket to the heights of fame where you can even eat in a restaurant but people are approaching you to slowly crash back down where you're you know anonymous\nJust being Bateman this is not something I Would normally bring up with somebody but just being Bateman gets pretty honest about it in a new book she's putting out it looks at how disorienting it can be when you first experience fame and how sharing it can feel as soon as it's taken away\nJesse Bateman took some time to look back on an all starting with the moment she realized she was famous I think\nYou know it was a ... a slow build a\nFor the first year or so but I'm probably in crowded places like the mall or an amusement park or I'm an airport and you realize quickly that you can't stop moving\nAnd then when it starts that started slipping\nThat's when you first notice it and and not to make it sound like you like and entitlement thing like you expect to be treated like that yeah but you are I'm prepared to your rather prepared to deal with being overly accommodated\nYou're prepared to deal with that and then when somebody when it becomes intermittent\nYou're like oh I'm and I do I need to be prepared to deal with this or do I need to just kind of just relax and she was like maybe they don't recognize me and it's all about\nHow can I be set up to deal with what you're going to come out in the ... and when it started fading almost completely I had to keep telling myself or made it better for me if I just said I'm not famous I'm not famous for not famous at all it all at all\nAnd then if somebody did recognize your did try to overly accommodate me\nI could just see it as as bizarre behavior\nDo you have a different perspective on it because you were in the you're in it in writing this book than people who can write about for fame and more of an edict way like from the third party prospective\nAre absolutely I don't I and and there are you know a lot of books written on fame yeah I'm a lot of them take a hit and historical approach um a lot of them seem to take a I'm sort of than approach like\nHear all these different famous people and this is this is why I like them this is why we like them or ... these and these were my few encounters with some of the famous people but what I really wanted to do is bring the reader into the whole experience the whole life cycle and not just hey here's what it's like to be famous but\nReally here's what this entire life cycle is like and\nAnd submit to the reader that that fame as a social construct and I I dropped parallel between this creation society has made of fame where the shooting ladders game board in that around two thousand\nWe almost insisted that that game board become larger\nSo that more people would have opportunities to be famous and I just think that that um the striving for that\nLimits us individually to becoming the best people we can be\nJust made me think so much for talking to us really appreciate it well my pleasure thanks for getting such good clips Justine basements new book is\nCalled fame [noise] the hijacking of reality is that everywhere tomorrow I'm going up on cue scary ... dying guard is going to take human side of the world of a not so famous\nBut the ultra rich like the one percent of the one percent gene better themselves into the world to research his brand new novel ... years about walking to the cues studio to tell you all about it and I'm going to tell him about an investment opportunity I think he might like\nTo talk about his book read actually\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nYou're CBC Radio one serious ... sixty nine hand from the R I or public radio and you're\nTo you know I spent my name funny power maybe you know someone like someone who enjoys a a good glass scotch but not the kind of scotch that you could pick up at the liquor store more like the kind where if you have enough of it in one night you may as well have sent a kid to college for a year\nThis also might be the kind of person who owns a nice watch or five maybe haven't actually met someone like this but you can imagine someone like this ride to kind of watches they wearing the risk of bubbly buy you a couple of houses in Vancouver in Toronto the stuff they have in their back pocket to probably cancel out all your debt\nBarry Cohen is definitely one of those people very common is the fictional protectionist in a new book\nBy Gary ... called lake success and if you read one of Gary novels before you know a lot of this work takes this kind of funny but also reflective look at the times that we're living in Gary stand guard is here with me in Studio right now and I should point out also wearing a pretty nice watch\nOh thank you it's great to be here you're a bit of a watch guy or a little bit of a wash nerd um this watches interesting it belongs to Richard Nixon space advisor back in the seventies risk yeah yeah so this was probably privy to a lot of\nDrunk and ran the Nixon White House you know or Jews colonizing space or that's the exact lots for that's exactly what did you get 'em through a friend of mine who was a large dealer and it was an originally at Christie's auction oh Mike yeah it's got a lot of uh probably known as they say\nThat's what they say it's a very ... is your fictional character I Know you spend a lot of time with these ultra rich people the ... thirty five thousand dollar ... uh what what did you learn about\nYeah I remember we was drank an entire thirty five thousand ... scotch and I realized that we had just drank too Hyundai Sonata is worth of uh\nOf sky to the days me better it pays pretty good but I'm not sure how they send out is good um\nIt was very stressful or these guys are ... you know they they're stressed out all the time they drink quite a bit so there were times especially when\nThey're hedge funds were taking that I ended up going home at five AM and my wife was sort of an button the my shirt for me 'cause my fingers wouldn't work and I was born in Russia so I Know how to drink a few a Dram or but it was you know they're not very happy people that was the big\nThe higher I went up the food chain from you know sent a millionaire the billionaire I was like oh my God these are not happy people [noise] um they lead these very moded existence is where they don't really leave their Upper East side apartment there club there Hamptons stayed there for their fund and so\nI became sort of the hedge fund whispered I Would take him to things like cheap Korean or Indian restaurants and they'd be like oh my God this actually tastes great ... what a life you live\nWhat were you curious about what questions you have for them well\nThat was the question is I knew that many of them came from these sort of lower middle class backgrounds they grew up in the edges of places like New York or Naples or Moscow and my my sort of feeling was and I also came as an immigrant so I knew the sort of the hunger in their ... and the idea that\nYou know we grew up with tough parents the only thing that could make up for it with billions of dollars right um so I wanted to see if upon achieving that well if if if things actually did improve\nBut you know studies show that if you win a million dollars in the lottery or you lose a limb and about a year and a half you're basically back at your same level of happiness and that's something that I found true for almost all the people I interviewed\nYeah I've heard people say that once you can pay your bills once you can pay your bills and once you're\nYou're you're safe and you're like you know once you get you to death paid off in any money after that it's not really going to make any happier\nBut it also works your perceptions I mean I I met a currency trader at a bank and and you know and he said I'm so the problem in this country is to play the middle class and I am the middle class and I said wait how do you define the middle class they suggest people struggling earning between two and four million dollars yeah for folks were ...\nJust become these sort of weird gated communities where nobody really understands how the world works and I think that that that because that is our leader in the United states that leads to problems like a certain election in two thousand six team\nI Can't begin to know your time you know I don't know or is he grew up in Russia I was\nBorn in the Soviet Union or in a dictatorship and now I'm living in the United states so yeah it's just bad news keeps following me around against what was your impressions\nOf American wealth when you were growing up\nEverything seemed incredibly wealthy you know we were we started out we were on section eight housing public housing food stamps all that stuff and ah\nThere's a scene in the eighties movie called Moscow the Hudson with Robin Williams that kind of capture that moment where the Robin Williams cat the character walks into an American supermarkets these five hundred different types of coffee and he says coffee coffee coffee and he has a heart attack\nAnd and that's kind of how we felt almost all the time when we came to America so this is a long\nTime sort of obsession early interest you've had in the lives of the super wealthy\nWell when I was a kid you know I remember watching the movie Wall Street and we were the poor the poor kid in my a Hebrew school called the ... school of queens and I was wearing\nA coat made out of some Soviet ... or something that had a very unattractive smile and I would read ... was my nickname so we were very poor and and and back then at least I wanted to I really did want to make money I remember watching Wall Street thinking oh my God this is a the Charlie Sheen character up until he gets arrested that's that's the life\nBut after ... is spending time with these guys I'm almost allergic to money 'cause I see just how how how little it does for anybody and these poor families you know um\nWhat hedge fund wife was telling me my I have a little kid and he was applying to schools private schools in New York which can cost fifty sixty thousand dollars a year and so I Love the diversity of this one school because some of these parents ... somebody's kids their parents aren't even hedge fund managers there just doctors or lawyers\nYeah right [laughter] poor thing for the Senate if I I feel like I'm I'm being unnecessarily harsh here 'cause I feel like I can but one of the things that the your book in the ... looks at is the inner lives of these hedge fund managers of the of the billionaires\nAnd at one point um your lead character buried counties criticized for like not having much taps not having an imagination yes not having a real soul so did you learn anything about the inner lives of hedge fund manager and\nThis is Ninety point three WPN Len Nashville public radio Ninety One point five WTO ... in Ninety One point seven W.

style and organizing the cremation and are organizing but the party and I are going to occur Irish and [noise] and organizing to you know the music and all that stuff that by the time\nIt was over I realized I hadn't really I hadn't really grieved at all you know what I mean\n[noise] I Know exactly what you mean yeah you know\nIt's um it's a curious too curious thing to be a\nTo B my father son in this world he's left such a\nRemarkable imprint ton sending when he's touched and I'm I'm going through his papers I there is still so many matters that I'm dealing with and\nIt comes to me and dreams still I'm embarrassed to say it's been two years since these past almost and uh\n[noise] you know I'm I'm even\nThat was tasked with finishing a few more songs of his that he that he that we'd started together on the last album and so his voice is literally still in my life\nUm [laughter] so it's a it's a bizarre so bizarre and delicious entanglement um\nMake a long story short I I Believe that there are some really beautiful new songs of honor going that no one's heard that uh that are at some point going to come out oh my God that's been that's amazing\nIt's extraordinary that he has left so many poems um there were actually recorded and many of them um we started on the last record on while we were making you want to darker\nAnd sometimes I Would implore him even though I knew he was in a delicate state it's a dead just just read this just read this poem to a to a metronome\nAnd we'll look at it later and there's some of my favorite poems of his are actually\nTest with finishing them and that was also beautiful about them is that unlike\nA ... very the the gravity and the nature and the ten year the tone of you want a darker and these have a sort of more miss so romantic a\nIn a kind of tone that resembles his older work something more romantic so that's also more surprising is that daunting for you to have to to finish your father's work like this\nIt's such a luxury it's such a treat and as I say it's been a meditation because I have a little studio in my backyard and\nI go there with a a mug of coffee and and there he is again this singer is powerful distinct voice who happens to be particularly stirring for me because it's my father and the sense of responsibility and an at the same time as I say you know this\nThis this feeling like um\nHow wonderful that\nThe the songs exist in that I'm going to bring them see them to see them to completion for not just for me because I'm part of the family business but for all the people out there who are who are going to hopefully delight in hearing his language that in the medical contribution of his\nUm [laughter] you know that there are these there are these songs that exist that he wanted finished these incredible powerful readings that were set to music and it's going to surprise people and it's going to surprise and delight\nGetting any timeline next year it's I Believe Adam even very generous before we say goodbye and the forward that you're up for the flame you cut a line from one of your father songs I came so far for beauty and I left so much behind why did that line come to mind when you were thinking about your father's life and legacy\nIt reminds me of a few times um towards the end where we'd sit on his front lawn\nAnd the pause would would\nOccur in conversation and he would reflect on all of the compromises that he made all of the all the romances he left all the family a\nScene that he felt that it hit poorly acquitted themselves of\nAnd he said you know of all the strategies I tried to employ really nothing nothing really works nothing offered the solace to work blanketing pages being a poet offered me and I felt like she was apologizing\nAnd\nOf course that song immediately came to mind which is you know he came so far for beauty he left so much behind but of course that wasn't the truth at all you know the amazing impact that he had on our lives on anyone's life he came into\nAdam I really appreciate you taking the time to time I know it's a ... as you mentioned I Know it's a conflict of a thing to do but I I'm I'm incredibly grateful that you did you're always a gentleman thank you\nAdam help pull together and your collection of previously unseen homes written by a hundred and it's called the flame and the book is out everywhere tomorrow coming up on the show Justine ... she was Mallory on family time she's written a new book\nExploring not just fame but what happens when fame starts to go away [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nYou're the cue on CBC Radio one serious and one sixty nine\n... public radio international\nI don't know how often do you think about fame like the level of fame where you can't even walk down the street without being stopped or recognized I call it CBC Radio fame\nBy the way I Do not been caught CBC Radio fame but you know the fame that the Selena Gomez is of the world have to deal with the Justin Bieber is people are following you around every move is reported on and gossip magazines Instagram and the ... I mean there's got to be pretty crazy life it's one that Justine Bateman knows a lot about\nJust being Bateman played Mallory Michael J. Fox is sister on family ties back in the Nineteen eighties\nBack then Justine couldn't go anywhere or do anything without swarms of fans following her around shouting her characters named Mallory Mallory\nBut then one day something changed all that fame began to disappear and the way she puts it losing fame was like sand slipping through your fingers\nWhat kind of effect does that have on a person you sky rocket to the heights of fame where you can even eat in a restaurant but people are approaching you to slowly crash back down where you're you know anonymous\nJustine Bateman this is not something I Would normally bring up with somebody but just being Bateman gets pretty honest about it in a new book she's putting out it looks at how disorienting it can be when you first experience fame and how sharing it can feel as soon as it's taken away\nJesse Bateman took some time to look back on it all starting with the moment she realized she was famous\nI think you know it's a it's a ... a slow build a for the first year or so but\nI'm probably in crowded places like the mall or an amusement park or I'm an airport and you realize quickly that you can't stop moving\nAnd then when it starts that started slipping\nThat's when you first notice it and and not to make it sound like you like an entitlement thing like you expect to be treated like that yeah but you are I'm prepared to your rather prepared to deal with being overly accommodated\nYou're prepared to deal with that and then when somebody when it becomes intermittent\nYou're like oh I'm and I do I need to be prepared to deal with this or do I need to just can I just relax and feel like maybe they don't recognize me and it's all about\nHow can I be set up to deal with what you're going to come out in the ... and when it started fading almost completely I had to keep telling myself or made it better for me if I just said I'm not famous I'm not fans are not famous at all it all at all\nAnd then if somebody did recognize your did try to overly accommodate me\nI could just see it as as bizarre behavior\nDo you have a different perspective on it because you were in the you're in it in writing this book then people who could write about fame and more of an edict way like from the third party prospective\nAre absolutely I don't I and and there are you know a lot of books written on fame you know I'm a lot of them take a and historical approach um a lot of them seem to take a I'm sort of than approach like\nHear all these different famous people and this is this is why I like them this is why we like them or these these and these were my few encounters with some of the famous people but what I really wanted to do is\nBring the reader in to the whole experience the whole life cycle and not just hey here's what it's like to be famous but really here's what this entire life cycle is like and\nAnd submit to the reader that that fame as a social construct\nAnd I I dropped parallel between this creation that society has made of fame with the sheets and ladders game board in that around two thousand we almost insisted that that game board become larger\nSo that more people would have opportunities to be famous and I just think that that um the striving for that\nLimits us individually to becoming the best people we can be\nJust be leaving thanks so much for talking to us to really pursue well my pleasure thanks for getting such good cliffs\nBasements new book is called fame [noise] the hijacking of reality is that everywhere tomorrow I'm going up on cue garish dying guard is

know I said my name ... power maybe you know someone like someone who enjoys a a good glass of scotch but not the kind of scotch that you could pick up at the liquor store more like the kind where if you have enough of it in one night you may as well have sent a kid to college for a year\nThis also might be the kind of person who owns a nice watch or five maybe you haven't actually met someone like this but you can imagine if someone like this ride to kind of watches they wearing the risk of bubbly buy you a couple of houses in Vancouver in Toronto the stuff they have their back pocket to probably cancel out all your debt\nBarry Cohen is definitely one of those people buried tone is the fictional protagonist in a new book\nBy Gary ... called lake success and if you've read one of Gary novels before you know a lot of this work takes this kind of funny but also reflective look at the times that we're living in Gary stand guard is here with me in Studio right now and I should point out also we're in a pretty nice watch\nOh thank you it's great to be here you're gonna watch guy or a little bit of a wash nerd I'm just watch as interesting it belongs to Richard Nixon space advisor back in the seventies risk yeah yeah so this was probably privy to a lot of\nDrunken rancid the Nixon White House you know or Jews colonizing space or that's the exact words for that's exactly what did you get a ... through a friend of mine who was a watch dealer and it was an originally at Christie's auction oh Mike yeah it's got a lot of a ... that's\nWhat they say it's a very Cohen is your fictional character I Know you spend a lot of time with these ultra rich people the ... thirty five thousand dollar ... uh ... what did you learn about\nYeah I remember we was drank an entire thirty five thousand ... budget scotch and I realized that we had just drank too Hyundai Sonata is worth of a\nScottish today's me better it tastes pretty good but I'm not sure how they say not as good as\nIt was very stressful uh these guys are you know they are they're stressed out all the time they drink quite a bit uh there were times especially when\nThey're hedge funds were taking that I end up going home at five AM and my wife was sort of an button in my shirt for me 'cause my fingers wouldn't work and I was born in Russia so I Know how to drink a few uh grams or but it was you know they're not very happy people that was the big\nThe higher I went up the food chain from you know sent a millionaire a billionaire I was like oh my God these are not happy people in the lead these very moded existence is where they don't really leave their Upper East side apartment there club there Hamptons stayed there for their funds and so\nI became sort of the hedge fund whispered I Would take him to things like cheap Korean or Indian restaurants and they'd be like oh my God this actually tastes great ... what a life you live what were you curious about it\nAs soon as I knew that many of them came from these sort of lower middle class backgrounds they grew up in the edges of places like New York or Naples or Moscow and my my sort of feeling was and I also came as an immigrant so I knew the sort of the hunger in their souls and the idea that\nYou know we grew up with tough parents the only thing that could make up for it was billions of dollars right um so I wanted to see if upon achieving that wealth if if if things actually did improve\nBut you know studies show that if you win a zillion dollars in the lottery or you lose a limb and about a year and a half you're basically back at your same level of happiness and that's something that I I found true for almost all the people I interviewed\nYeah I've heard people say that once you can pay your bills once you can pay your bills and once you're you're you're safe and you're like you know once you get your debt paid off in any money after that it's not really going to make any happier\nYeah but it also works your perceptions I mean I met a currency trader at a bank and and you know and he said I'm\nProbably the country's the play the middle class and I am the middle class and I said wait how do you define the middle class they suggest people struggling earning between two and four million dollars for folks were folks so you know so I think places like Manhattan have just become these sort of weird gated communities where nobody really understands how the world\nWorks and I think that that that because that is our lead in the United states that leads to problems like a certain election in two thousand six team\nI Can't begin to know you know I don't know if a if you grew up in Russia\nI was born in the Soviet Union or in a dictatorship and now I'm living in the United states so yeah it's just bad news keeps following me around against what was your impressions\nOf American wealth when you were growing up\nEverything seemed incredibly wealthy you know we were we started out we were an section eight housing public housing food stamps all that stuff and\nThere's a scene in the eighties movie called Moscow the Hudson with Robin Williams the kind of captured that moment where Robin Williams ... character walks into an American supermarkets these five hundred different types of coffee and he says coffee coffee coffee and he has a heart attack\nAnd and that's kind of how we felt almost all the time but what we came to America so this is a long\nTime sort of obsession early interest you have in the lives of the super wealthy\nWell when I was a kid you know I remember watching the movie Wall Street and we were the ... I was of course kidding my Hebrew school called the ... school of queens and I was wearing a\nCoat made out of some Soviet ... or something that had a very attractive smell in the ... was my nickname so we were very poor and and and back then at least I wanted to I really did want to make money I remember watching Wall Street thinking oh my God this is a the Charlie Sheen character up until he gets arrested that's that's the life\nBut after ... is spending time with these guys I'm almost allergic to money 'cause I see just how how how little it does for anybody and these poor families you know I'm\nOne of hedge fund wife was telling me my I have a little kid and he was applying to schools private schools in New York which can cost fifty sixty thousand dollars a year and so I Love the diversity of this one school because some of these parents ... some of these kids their parents aren't even hedge fund managers there just doctors or lawyers yeah right [laughter]\nPoor thing for the but I say that if I I feel like I'm I'm being unnecessarily harsh here 'cause I feel like I can but one of the things that the your book in the ... looks at is the inner lives of these hedge fund managers of the of the billionaires\nAnd at one point um your lead character buried counties criticized for not having much taps not having an imagination yes not having a real soul so did you learn anything about the inner lives of hedge fund manager and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "Nashville", "day": "02"}
