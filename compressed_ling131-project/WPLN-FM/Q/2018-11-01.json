I said Michael Caine he said he didn't have movie out fake and he said you got to be stuck it so I said oh say is the way thanks very much uh they said well let me give me some advice or should OK yeah fine what\nIs it really took took lowly took slow and does say too much\nAnd they look down at my shoes and I was wearing shorts shoes and they said I never wear sway choose which one should never wear sway chew so she went on he said because I just told you you're going to be famous you're going to be stuck it\nAnd what I'd done is I'd I'd made the mistake of retiring too soon you know because I went on I went on to get an Academy Award for a ... second Academy Award for the side of the house rules or I might disagree\nThen a lot of had a wonderful life and I'm Still we're still working uh I'm I'm doing a picture of the moment in Czechoslovakia\nOr and I am I'm eighty five years old and I've had this wonderful life and I thought what a terrible mistake I made him in retiring at that time and then there was another thing why I wrote the book is you know from a mistake by somebody else and it was ... by several people actually\nI was watching the TV and and there are a load of young people being asked what they wanted to do with their lives\nAnd everyone was saying their career and that but I notice that several of them said they wanted to be rich and famous\nWhich I thought well this is entirely the wrong attitude I mean when I started as an actor I just come home from Korea\nAnd I didn't know it but I had malaria which has an incubation period I collapsed with Korea way way the ... malaria came out of hospitals than looking haggard way the way they are a very strong company accent\nAnd I became an act to not to become rich and famous I became an act to knowing that I Would never be rich and famous it was obvious you couldn't do it you couldn't make it to me I couldn't do it I became it to be the best that I could possibly be or something I wanted to do which would be an actor\nAnd that's all I ever did and I only had to compare myself to my last performance I didn't compare myself to other people because they will always be better actors in may and ... and and and the point I wanted to get across to young people but it was to go ahead and do what you want to do and find will take its course\nIf you gotta you gotta if you haven't you didn't have any way or why why did you want to do it even though you knew that even though you knew that it will be such a struggle [noise] well\nIt's because I enjoy doing it I was an amateur act to when I was younger before I went in the um being a youth club I was an advertiser actor and the alternative was to work in a factory yeah\nI've I first became an actor I was working in ... by some factory packing better but fame never occurred to me all the evidence to me was to be as good as I possibly could be a what I chosen to do which I thought was a lesson\nAnd and that idea of persistence there Michael is is is what gets me is even when one of my favorite stories in the book is Christopher Nolan comes to you approaching you about playing Alford the butler in in the dark night he was pretty persistent to right oh\nYeah like a good one Sunday Morning and I was walking past the front door my house in the country which should cut off and on our shoulders man standing there with a script in his hand\nAnd I I listen to the door to him and he came in and I didn't know who he was until you say these films that have done indeed done three of the great films are saying and he said he was Christopher Nolan and a symbol of what what what what what what you want me to do should this go Batman Begins\nSuffer a Batman films such as I said oh I ... I was thinking that we said well I'm I'm too old to fly by a man who am I going to be am I going to ... to butler [noise]\nSo I said what do you want me to play he said the ...\nSo I said oh really ... what a Web site at dinner is or would you like another glass of red blind to it but what do I say he said no he said Michael if they put them that he said the butler was by man's foster father when his father died and then he said\nYou read the script ... says or does he live there and made them in in the country and England\nI send my driver of bringing it to you in the morning you should know want you to read it now I'm taking it with me I didn't realize what I Know now\nChris is very secretive about everything that he did so I went and he had a cup of tea with my wife in the kitchen and I read it fell in love with it and came out and said yes oh wow and that's how I got Batman has started\nMine is an old I I I've enjoyed as much as being a young actor but I'd say it's more the story of how Christopher Nolan got you again like I don't think it's well he he regarded me as a lucky ... kept saying no to the other way around you all my life each um I mean\nI've been so lucky we are never made a ... movie\n[laughter] and ah Michael Cain and blowing the doors off you're right about how comedians love to do Michael Caine impressions I Want you to listen to one of them with me

first one to have them and he was the first one to have announced a machine on the phone\nAnd not Cody Monday and he wasn't in and he said in in that voice said Peter Sellars is not made and nobody people know that\nMight okay before we say goodbye one of the things you talk about in this book is that part of your process as an actor is just observing people study how people act in their ordinary lives so you can bring that reality to your performances and we talked about that we talked about acting on on the inside but I I Want to know as someone who's been watching people carefully
