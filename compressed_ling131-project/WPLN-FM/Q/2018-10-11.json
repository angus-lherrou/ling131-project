have never realized in their lives that that you know that they are part and parcel of this at their behavior has been not\nIdeal um but within the confines of when they grow up and how they grow up they were acting like everybody else about it I could see\nGenerally it's an interesting time to be having this conversation beyond the book\nYou talk about a director asks you to kiss him before I'll give you a part in the film comes out and says that's completely on true I mean a lot of the current moment is about survivors to come forward stories like you and and whether or not there believe so I just want to know how is it how does it feel to write such a painful moment and then just have a denial thrown back at you like that\n[noise] um\nYou know I don't think about that I I certainly think about Dr Ford and how the kind of went our own greed just it was yesterday I couldn't even watch yesterday and President Trump apologized\nUm you know to the ... you know on behalf of the

incensed in or any of those\nBut that doesn't get anything done ultimately there has to be on something on the other side of this and certainly I I personally could not thank Dr Ford more as a human being as a woman I think are deeply deeply and profoundly and we have to keep going\nAnd I can't imagine what it's like to to say something that's so hard to say and then have it'd be doubt it\nYeah

a teenager gathers releasing a new documentary called the song and the sorrow\nTakes a closer look at her father's history with mental illness and as you're about to hear it really blows open the general conversation about mental health as well I started by asking her what it was\nThat encouraged her to finally make such a personal documentary\nIt was one of those things where uh the director ... Clark she came up to me and she said do you want to make a documentary about your dad\nAnd I was like okay and then it took three years so it wasn't really like uh I didn't really think about it too much and it just kind of happened threat to three years every once in awhile nor would show up and sell me walking around her playing music or interviewing people um so it wasn't yeah I didn't really\nKnow what I was getting into when I said yes [laughter] I feel about it in a great you know just um [noise] I think it's a really a great a tool I guess to be able to talk about mental health and to be able to explore my own history and and all of that um\n... when you were growing up did you know that he was this famous songwriter this ... Canadian summer I didn't\nI didn't I had I mean I knew that he wrote songs and he played music um that was about it I I knew sometimes his songs that come on the radio and we were in like ... or something you know and you'd hear Anne Marie seen when a dad songs and\nUm but I don't know just it was something that kind of wasn't really talked about I didn't really know and you know during my years he was mostly a you know playing not he wasn't really playing they chose I never saw him play much except community fundraisers and like school friday concerts\nAnd if you don't so much fried your age and yeah\nYeah it was it was really cool and he was always really generous with his tiny always doing stuff like that\nWhat was the relationship your dad had with the success of like snow bird and put your hand in hand I only know it through\nAnything about my dad's career directly from him so\nPart of the great thing about this documentary with it I got to really go back and see so much about him and there's some really great interviews from the early seventies when things are just starting to happen and\nYou know he's living in a house on the east end of the island with you know no phone plumbing and you know snow where does just become a massive hit and put your hand in hand is about to be too and it's it's um it's interesting to see him because he really wants nothing to do with the money part of things\nUm and that yeah I think that sums it up he was very bad with money he gave it all away [laughter] and ah\nAnd it was it I think charming but also you know made life very challenging\nFrom time to time I bet it did so your mom in the film says that your dad was never properly diagnosed\nMhm like he was diagnosed as depressive um but post mortem diagnosed as a bipolar from really digging into his you know what was going on in his life and\nUm yeah it's a strange funny thing really\nDid people start to kind of map together for you and I'm like oh well now some of that stuff just makes sense yeah took a long\nTime for that it took a lot of reading about mental illness and I'm discovering kind of my own depression anxiety and stuff [noise] before I really\nStarted to even I guess yeah I had a\nBit of knowledge of what was going on but I didn't really until you experience it yourself or you know witness someone going through it I don't think you can really understand it but um we didn't talk about it in our house so I didn't know what was going on\nI mean people just kind of didn't talk about it all back then\nYou know and they're so there wasn't language to put around it and I think that's you know one of the things I've learned from reading is that\nNot being able to talk about it keeps people from getting health and it's you know that's the biggest thing the stigma about mental illness is is the big the greatest barrier to early detection treatment and so that's what my goal is to get people talking\nSo after your dad's death your dad died by suicide um you you become introspective you kind of retreat into yourself at least that's what I get from the film right\nI mean I was always fairly shy and as I became a teenager [laughter] um but yeah I definitely went into my room for a few years and learned how to write songs and\nUm yeah\nI definitely lived inside a sort of bubble for a long time of not really knowing who I was er where I was going oh\nYeah [noise] um but I think yeah grief took a long time to unfold and I feel like I'm just starting to\nLive a life of my choosing you know where I'm actually making the decisions and not just following\nThe river so yeah yeah like I don't even even when I first met you Katherine I'm having everyone several you know that's that's Catherine McClellan nice to meet or do you know do you know her dad is you know\nYeah it was definitely challenging to to live under that shadow and I I don't [noise]\nYou know they want want me to to be like him or to do what he did and it's funny because I feel like I kind of I have done that of by accident you know I've followed in his footsteps and now I'm really honored to to be part of that lineage and I really I'm excited to share his music with people and and to tell a story because\nOn lots of levels you know it keeps his music alive which kind of keeps him alive\nBut it also is enough change to talk about the hard stuff\nMy name's Tom power doesn't seem to Q.

the confines of when they grow up and how they grow up\nThey were acting like everybody else they could save\nGenerally it's an interesting time to be having this conversation began to book\nYou talked about a director asks you to kiss him before I'll give you a part in the film she comes out and says that's completely untrue I mean a lot of the current moment is about survivors who come forward stories like you and and whether or not there believe so I just want to know how how does it feel to write such a painful moment and then just have a denial thrown back at you like that\n[noise] um\nYou know I don't think about that I I certainly think about Dr Ford and how to how to read just it was yesterday I couldn't even watch yesterday and President Trump apologized\nUm you know to the ... you know on behalf of the country um for justice Kavanaugh's ill treatment\nAnd that's a great just as far as I'm concerned egregious and um [noise] I you know it's it really is you can be outraged and you can be you know incensed and or any of those\nBut that doesn't get anything done ultimately to have to be on something on the other side of this and certainly I I personally could not thank Dr Ford more as a human being as a woman I think are deeply deeply and profoundly and we have to keep going\nI Can't imagine what it's like you to say something that's so hard to say and then have it be doubted\nYeah mhm I you know I I was raised in the forties was born in the forties raised in the fifties came of age in the sixties you know you it's hard to think that people would take you seriously\nI mean it's ... that's the hard part so you know overlooking that we're finding a way to navigate through that is one second nature to me a ... because that's all there was so um I don't I Can't pause\nA and feel what it feels like to be a you know treated with such great disregard and how you're not believed and your trivialize ... you can't ... it it takes too much time to stop and feel it you have to just keep piling on\nThis was a a really powerful book and I I Want to thank you for coming in I I started to be interviewed by asking you about the title of it as he never said I Want to end it was something of evidence for either I'm gonna ask you about the cover to cover all of point to several people listening on the radio so the front\nWe had a big part of a discussion in the office about our or interpretations of covering the only reason I ask of ...\nBut we'll do the conversation was ... so if you're on the cover seem vulnerable does she does she seemed tentative ended on the back is to you now you're you're laughing you're you're joyful you seem genuinely happy is is that intentional or do something to be taken from those two images well\nI think it's a fade out fate in if if if nothing else just an age wise you know a lot of um I'm twenty seven and the one about the one in the back I'm like ... you know probably close to seven eight sixty eight or something ah\nAnd if nothing else it's just about longevity\n[laughter] but do you see your sister does I feel like the same person do you\nAs the one in the front and back [laughter] no no I mean\nIt is the same person I feel very much the same ingredients but um I I have the ... of history holding up my legs so different than I had in the front cover girl\nAnd do you think that writing it all out like you did reliving these moments as giving you an additional sturdy means\nYes no question yeah absolutely\nDon't tell me more about that I Would have voted to how do you feel them\nWell I didn't for so long I was uh when I was just finishing this book last a year um\n[noise] I think what month was I doing this I was\nI had done a play on Broadway and um my son Sam was finishing up a\nA graduate degree master's degree at Columbia and I would go over to his apartment in Brooklyn everyday after this Sunday matinee so this was in may or something of last year\nHe was the only one of my an anyone that I Would sit and read some of it at the end because I couldn't figure out what I learned my son\nSam I have I done this but what if I was like looking for what did they gain what did I learn what was the meaning of all of this I just wasted seven yeah I don't know what I'm doing and why I what am I learned\nAnd and Sam said my God mother stop stop and think from one minute don't you see how different you are today than you or seven years ago how differently you see yourself\nAnd I went oh oh\nYes yes\nAnd he was right it took me a moment to really through gather it all up to realize that I\nI in that seven year period was able to incorporate feel\nThe the reality of my own history of my accomplishments I've always before that felt like\nAny bit of accomplishment I'd ever done with it and it looked like I was a cop with a big crack in an when drizzle out in you know very quickly and I would go back to feeling that it was a failure and I realized that I didn't\nFeel that way anymore that was just gone I had something that I had done all of my own on my own two feet and after all this time I owned it\nWhen you have to place all of us would love to get him so I Would get to talk to you again for talking to me thank you so if you're a new memoir is called in pieces [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nYou are listening to you on CBC Radio one serious Sam wants to be nine and from here I go to the public radio international\nA used to be not that long ago a pretty big deal for a band to get their music video on TV like if you remember like me sitting down and watching much music or MTV for hours and hours and hours on end there is this feeling that any of the songs you heard there or saw there\nClearly made it right it wasn't even bigger deal if a band you saw much music wasn't even signed to a record label or didn't even have any records out at all when the pursuit of happiness got this kind of rare opportunity back in eighty six it really changed their lives\nJust a few weeks earlier the ban hold a bunch of their gear down to queen street west which is a street and downtown Toronto they set up their instruments in front of an empty parking lot they got a power there is to film them on a video camera and that became the official music video for a new demo read they recorded called I'm an adult now\nAs soon enough that video that homemade video was edited a heavy rotation on much music\nRight next to ... and Duran Duran but this was more than just an underdog success story for the pursuit of happiness\nAs you're about to hear given their video on much music helped them break down some of the barriers between the underground and the mainstream all the way across the Canadian music scene these days in the eye why music video elected pursuit of happiness is feels like a time machine it takes you back uh Toronto to uh Toronto that doesn't really exist anymore\nLove junk was the debut album by the pursuit of happiness there was actually released turned Thirty years old this month and to mark the occasion mo Berg front man and founder of the pursuit of happiness stopped by the cues studio to take you back that old era of Toronto and that moment that changed his wife\n[noise] Hi I'm\n[noise]\nMm\nYou're listening to cue on CBC Radio one serious ... public radio international I'm Tom\n\nLadies\nAnd very under CBP I think that's about all this year to see requirements that once they're snow bird I found that she made famous there she made famous after it was written by gene McClellan in one of the most beloved singer songwriters\nEver to make his home in Prince everyone ... songs went on to be recorded by Elvis Presley Bing Crosby Loretta Lynn ... Juno ward even saw a lot of his music become massively popular in the states you remember I remember he also\nWrote to put your hand in hand from and that's on but the next person you're about to hear from a gene McClellan was just known as bad I kind loving dad who unbeknownst to his children was secretly battling depression before dying of suicide in Nineteen Ninety five\nFor years cats in McAllen worked through her own grief by building a musical career of her own and lately she's been working to better understand the father that she lost when she was just a teenager Catherine releasing a new documentary called the song and the sorrow it\nTakes a closer look at her father's history with mental illness and as you get back here it really blows opened the general conversation about mental health as well and I started by asking her what it was\nThat encouraged her to finally make such a personal documentary\nIt was one of those things that are the director ... Clark she came up to me and she said do you want to make a documentary about your dad\nAnd I was like okay and then it took three years so it wasn't really like uh I didn't really think about it too much and it just kind of happened threat to three years every once in a while and then I Would show up and tell me walking round or playing music are interviewing people um so what ... yeah I didn't really\nKnow what I was getting into and I said yes [laughter] I feel about it may great you know them [noise] I think it's a really a great tool I guess to be able to talk about mental health and to be able to explore my own history and and all that um ... when\nYou were growing up did you know that he was this famous songwriter this but love it\nI had I mean I knew that he wrote songs and he played music\nUm that was about it like a\nNews sometimes his songs that come on the radio when we were in like ... or something you know and you'd hear Anne Marie saying when a dad songs and\nUm but I don't know just it was something that kind of wasn't really talked about I didn't really know and you know during my years he was mostly I you know playing not he wasn't really playing big shows I never saw him play much except community fundraisers in like school friday concerts\nReveals emerge prior to your age and yeah\nYeah it was it was really cool and uh he was always really generous with his time he was always doing stuff like that\nWhat was the relationship your dad had with the success of like ... to put your hand in hand\nI only know it is through kind of research and watching interviews and stuff 'cause we never talked about it never\nNope I'm no we never talked about that stuff I didn't know anything about my dad's career directly from him so part of the great thing about this documentary with it I got to really go back and see so much about him and there's some really great interviews from the early seventies when things were just starting to happen and\nYou know he's living in a house on the east end of the island with you know no phone no plumbing and you know snow where it is just become a massive hit and put your hand in hand is though to be too and it's it's um it's interesting to see him because he really wants nothing to do with the money part of things\nUm and that's yeah I think that sums it up he was very bad with money he gave it all [laughter] and ah\nAnd it was it I think charming but also you know made life very challenging\nFrom time to time I bet it did so your mom in the film says that your dad was never properly diagnosed\nMhm like he was diagnosed as depressive um but post mortem diagnosed as bipolar from really digging into his you know what was going on in his life and um yeah it's a strange funny thing really\nDo the piece of start to kind of snapped together for you and I'm like oh well now some of that stuff's just makes sense yeah took a long time for that it took a lot of reading\nAbout mental illness and I'm discovering kind of my own depression anxiety and stuff before I really\nStarted to even I guess yeah I had a bit of knowledge of what was going on but I didn't really until you experience it yourself or you know witness someone going through it I don't think you can really understand it but um we didn't talk about it in our house so I didn't know what was going on\nI mean people just kind of didn't talk about it all back then\nYou know and they're so there wasn't language to put around it and I think that's you know\nOne of the things I've learned from reading is that not being able to talk about it keeps people from getting health and it's you know that's the biggest thing stigma about mental illness is is the ... greatest barrier to early detection treatment and so that's what my goal is to get people talking\nSo after your dad's death your dad died by suicide um you you become\nIntrospective you got to retreat into yourself at least ... that's what I get from the film right I mean I was always fairly shy um as I became a teenager [laughter] um but yeah I definitely went into my room for a few years and\nLearned how to write songs and um yeah I definitely lived inside a sort of bubble for a long time of not really knowing who I was er where I was going oh yeah [noise] um but I think yeah grief took a long time to unfold and\nI feel like I'm just starting to live a life of my choosing you know where I'm actually making the decisions and not just following\nRiver so yeah yeah what can only him even when I first met you Katherine I'm I think he ever was\nDo you know her dad is you know I have is definitely challenging to to live under that shadow and I I don't\nYou know they want want me to to be like an were to do what he did and it's funny because I feel like I kind of I have done that of by accident you know I've followed in his footsteps and now I'm really honored to to be part of that lineage and I really I'm excited to share his music with people and and to tell a story because\nOn lots of levels you know it keeps his music alive which kind of keeps him alive\nBut it also is enough change to talk about the hard stuff\nUh my name's Tom power you're listening to Q. I speaking with a musician Kevin mckell and about\nA new documentary the song and sorrow she examines a relationship in the history of her father the late great Canadian songwriter gene McClellan and the depression he battled for much of his life and which she has struggled with herself and that's that's quite a thing to come out with yourself to to talk about that this documentaries well\nYeah I guess I've been talking about a long time just among friends to and onstage and it doesn't feel uh that part doesn't feel vulnerable\nBut ... but at what point did you realize that you shared that with your father or\nThose kind of a slow discovery I'm\nA ... in my early late teens early twenties I started realizing that I had this problem with depression and\nI think that was where the real journey of discovery started happening was because I started to get really afraid that I might end up like my dad and and so\nIt was out of pure you know self a determination that I didn't I didn't want to end up like that and I didn't want to suffer the way he suffered and I didn't Alto want other people who suffer the way that our family suffered and so I just kind of\nMade myself better I made myself get better or at least I made myself or you know get some tools ...\nGet on the road to getting better because I Know because that's how I can really do\nYeah I mean we all have our own challenges whatever they are and you just have to have to have\nIn the documentary and a documentary your mom talks about it I think I can just what I Know no disrespect like I totally understand this but she didn't want the kids to see your father's illness is this something that you have to navigate with with\nYour family yeah I mean my daughter she'll be Thirteen this month and a lot of you know the early years of her and I together I was a single mom and so when I you know there was some pretty rough bouts of depression in those early years and\nYou know there'd be a week where I was just on the couch and I had to explain it to her and I was like I'm actually not feeling very well today and that she got older I was kind of able to explain more of what I was going through and um lots of people in our lives with a issues that\nWould affect her directly that I kind of had to talk to her about and\nSo she's so great you know when I she sees make 'em in the door and maybe I'm not having the best date she uh you know she'll be like a cup of tea [laughter] that's awesome and so I\nI mean there's also something just very sweet about um when it's just you and your kid in the world together you have a special relationship and we definitely\nTake care of each other pretty lovely does she seemed the doc [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "Nashville", "day": "11"}
