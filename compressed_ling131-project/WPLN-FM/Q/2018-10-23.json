S. I Love you\nBut why she might be best known for is her breakout role the one that led to her first Oscar shot her into super stardom\nBoys don't cry boys don't cry was released a huge claimed back in Nineteen Ninety nine critics praise Hillary Swank performance as brand and Tina transgender teenager which was pretty groundbreaking roll\nIt was hard to find transgender characters anywhere and film or a TV at at that time but looking at that film now in twenty Eighteen it is it's often challenging to see it in the same kind of light\nI mean consider the backlash got your hands and face earlier this year for being cast as a transgender character\nI had the chance to ask Hilary Swank about her thoughts on all of it and a little bit about her new film what they had which deals with something that every child has to go through at one point or another what to do with your parents when they get old we talked about that when she stopped by the cues studio during the Toronto international film festival [noise]\nSo I read this thing about you I'm a talker I Want to talk about what they had a I heard that when you you do a very simple thing with scripts to help you focus on the character that you're playing is that right you write something on the page\nOh well it's not very simple actually it's really and complex because um it's my character analysis and break down so it's like a pet the Bible\nI thought it was like one line per page\nOkay I Know what you're confusing I got it so what I deal with the script is\nContends that story the story of the stories about into one sentence\nAnd you're going to ask me what I was this one about but it's it was now over a year and a half ago so I'm not going to get the exact sentence but what it is is I take the essence of this story\nAnd in one sentence I say what is this story about and that is on the front of my script but then the inside is really you can barely see the lines\nWhat do you do that one line well why do you need to crystallize or like the\nUm because I feel like that is the essence of the story and that everything should lead back to that essence and if it does and it usually doesn't make the movie\nDo you remember an example you can give me I I Know I was gonna ask you I was going to ask you about what you're up for this film but you don't remember that's fine you remember\nUm I think like if we go back to maybe boys don't cry I feel like that is a movie that transcended gender and it was about love\nSo it was you know it was about something bigger that we can all relate to because everyone wants to give a lover be loved right everybody that's the one common thread through no matter what race or gender or what your created says that's the one through line so\nI think everything had to go back to that in from the scene that's kind of folk that example\nBut what ... is is a story that seems like it's about why should be clear it's it's a it's about an older woman with with all summer as your your your mom in the film you're coming down you're you're trying to talk to the father and the mother try and fought the father into letting you put the mother into ... and the father go to a facility as well but I also feel like that that film just about love to\nEspecially your industry especially but I mean if\nYou really think about if you say oh tell me about you\nI'm a they say what they do yeah and I am and I'm so I said well I'm an actor you know that that's what I and that's for since I was Fifteen that's what I have been doing and so so much of who I Am is defined within and taking time off made me realize that I'm so much more than that\nUm and there was freedom in that somehow I don't know I don't know how to say do\nYou think that changed the way you acted\nWell that would also happen on the flip side is it made me fall in love with acting in a whole different way because I appreciated all the opportunities that it gave me and it to see the world in a different way to walk in someone else's shoes and I'm\nExpand my ideas of how I Walk in the world you know every character I play from boys don't cry to ... million dollar baby to conviction to Freedom Riders these stories of these women all of them being true other than a million dollar baby\nI'm are just they are in me now and I see the world and a richer way because of them so it's been life and reaching it's been um\nIt's incredible it'd be an actor\nAnd so I have a deeper appreciation after stepping away for a little while so nice to meet you nice to meet you too thanks for coming to thank you but if the economy award winning actor [laughter] it's true I think Hillary swagger latest film is called what there\nSo nice to get to talk to her was Frank my name is Tom power you're listening

in Toronto the directors guild of Canada words as may highlight the achievements of Canadians in film and television here's some winners from last night Paul after Barry one production design for his work on the film the shape of water\nYou might remember he won an Oscar for that to ... well Tacoma the Alan King award for excellence in documentary for the documentary about the tragically hair long time running\nBut the biggest awards of the night were for lifetime achievement these winter directors because here in\nNorman Bailey and Allen ease of bumps when I was on unit that long ago we were supposed to talk about her new album the thirtieth anniversary of her album Bush lady but given that we're talking about the directors guild awards allergies and I also ended up talking about the importance of telling diverse stories\nMy my main interest was education so I did a lot of tools\nAnd then they wanted to do this to you\nAnd other stuff instead of that when they were learning to history of Canada which was really close\nKnit was really designed to get people to hate us and I thought what but I Do and the only answer that could come with I thought the children have to hear another story and I'm a story to tell it and that's always telling\nThe talents of bumps a when that whole conversation is available on our part cat another award to mentioned this time I had a candidate last night Julia Louis Dreyfus was honored with Mark Twain prize for career achievement in comedy below her from being a lane and Seinfeld or recently at veep\nWhile accepting the award she had this to say a native of Washington suburbs in Maryland she's a graduate of the holes in our school that it's also the alma mater of Dr Christine Blasey Ford who accused Brett Kavanaugh of groping or in high school was up in the war Julia Louis Dreyfus made reference to Dr Ford's testimony as she recalled\nHighschool performance up to play serendipity saying I can remember every single aspect of the play that night so much so that I Would testify under oath about it but I Can't remember who drove me there or who drove me home [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nTwenty years ago that share her massive jam\nProbably [noise] so you hear how how she sort of sounds like a robot no one had ever really heard anything like that before you might now know that that's\nThe result is something called auto tune this software program that tons of musicians me pretty much every musician uses\nNow um that takes a note that might be a little bit flat ideally take note that might be a little bit flat or a little bit sharp and it makes it the perfect that you're looking for but used kind of turned up on a lab and turns your voice in the down a little bit look like a robot and you hear that now with you know calling us the bunny bear and T pain even beyond the abuse auto tune\nI don't think it's a stretch to say the auto tune is one of the most revolutionary inventions and all the music history so one of the producers here on cue wanted to track down where auto tune came from and the answer led her to an electrical engineer who\nOnce worked for Exxon I'll let him pick it up from there\n[noise]\nOn a student was designed to be used in a way that you don't know it's we use to fix the pitcher singers there was this having that you can adjust so that you can't control the rate that the pitch moves to the correct note\nAnd just for fun I allow that control to go to an instantaneous transition I did that just because I knew that no one in their right mind would ever use that setting sure use it in the song believe [noise]\nAnd uh that's the first time people could here on earth to being used as a distinct sound [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nMy name's Andy held them brand new policy\nI worked for axon for three years doing physical science processing and then I started my own company and about ten years later I got involved with this\nAnd in the early Nineteen Ninety five I was reading at a trade show with my distribution company the owner of the company was there and he had his wife there we were having lunch and we were talking about what products that we might do next\nAnd she said well why don't you make me a box it wouldn't have we sing in tune I knew that I could do that\nBut I looked around the table and every ... every one look more or less do jak then that the idea [noise] so I went on to do something completely different\nAnd uh I did that for about six months or so and then I figured well what can I Do so I talked to her idea had merits so I went ahead and do created auto tune within a few months I had that back at the same trade show\nAnd ah there was a big head so that's where the genesis of big idea\nFor me and despite some of the negative feelings about auto tune what what what impresses me is the threat\nOf ... which all students use most everybody is familiar with is just as in pop music\n[noise]\n\n[noise] ...\nHow could you know\nMan you're the one\nWay\nBut it's also used in country and western\nThe moon living buddy ... common majors used in reggae\n\n\nInfusing Bollywood and\nSee since he was last year behind this Mike ... been really busy\nSheds been hosting the Peabody Award an Emmy winning series hip evolution which just remarried its second season on Netflix he's been interviewing somebody hip hop's biggest stars for that while also working on a massive new record up his own\nCalled a short story about war the concept record that follows three different characters the sniper the stone throwers and the fool each track takes you through the different perspectives on things like greed and the environment capitalism\nWhich might sound pretty dark but as you'll hear and just a minute if you know the guy at all I mean of course the entire message is just underlined with hope\nFor the record drops this Friday here's a bit of a preview of what to expect recorded live and accuse studio to shed which sniper on cue\nMm Mm\nYeah yeah so um I wrote a poem about\nAnd it starts out with a young boy than we thought and running as a lawyer\nAnd all around them or the light from the town\n[noise] the only learned that the whole world with the devil\n... and in fact the whole world would that world\nEveryone threatened to their core\nAnd so we trained and became a nice [noise]\nEventually climbing to the top\nI was not loving land from the land\nPlane you're the last\nTen how we need I Need to understand and demanded documentary about the last month and I never touch that had different from a young began to see the only thing [noise]\nI didn't get the plant these real clean linking these where you had to leave in the ground\n... you got\nSniper from higher\nAnd higher and higher French catching how about how you can always renting\nThe band is dirty their hands dirty to ban is kill or be killed ...\nFrom school and you grow up and you're in the business world and they tell you if you want to be successful you that is that people eat at it\nPeople eat at a story\nYou got it and paid me pockets and take my boss to make one wrote something about guns and I don't run and I don't miss it I don't know what I'm going to give them I don't know I Know I don't think so and I\nAnd I brought them behind the only thing but in any bonded\nMono lake that's facing the mom and pop of Reno would\nFind people\nBook you know the land is dirty their hands dirty man already saw that I\nMean really shattered ... studio snipers is one of the characters you'll meet on his new record a short story about war with shops on friday yeah and it's it's\nThe second the first you know when he stopped by I I had to kick things off a little bit of a catch up with what he's been up to since he was last here\nHow are ya I'm doing great have you on about being here have you on All right oh I feel good yeah ah this is a new room\nYeah I should say if you listen to this on the radio were upstairs yeah I kinda wish I could see the older I gotta yeah we'll go we'll go after and now you're doing this incredible hip evolution documentary\nYeah the body award winning or how do you how do you find sitting down with these people they looked up to you your entire life I'm guessing well again you know what it's like\nI guess you know what I mean yeah like a you know you you\nSit across these people in there and they're really fascinating\nAnd or their contributions obviously to the culture and the music that that I Love and it's given so much to my life\nUm you know are are remarkable and then uh you know the cool thing and it's the same thing I felt when I was doing you know your job is uh\nIs these people are also stunned as stunned as you are by them they're stunned by what they've been able to contribute and or be a part of so um yeah they're they're super super fun conversations interesting\nHave you had any moments of ... can you name the one particular moment of like wow I just can't I Can't believe I'm here right now\nI mean the one I'd have to say stands out the most is cool her who's kinda recognizes the you know the father of hip hop and uh we have the opportunity to interview him or in front of his building in the Bronx where he grew up in where he kinda famously started throwing his party's in this particular style that\nYou know became hip hop so that was very surreal he's not a guy that's very public he doesn't do a lot of interviews you know so\nTo be with the guy that basically started hip hop at the place where he started hip hop yeah you know and look at the building and speak to him and hear his story and then kind of gays out at New York and the world\nAnd it all moved to the beat of this music that he has a Thirteen fourteen year old\nPioneered so I I'd rather see I got to think that some of his mhm like getting to talk to each other like either on this show or or or any type of evolution of getting to talk to some of these great mind ... must have impacted this new record somehow [noise] um no\nIt's a weird thing is only indirectly but I'm not in the sense of like cleaning anything from there like musical genius oddly enough you know if there's anything that impacted this record I think it's kind of the experience of meeting so many people\nAnd meeting them in these particular situations like you and I are in but I mean we know each other so you know when you sit across from a stranger for example and just that dynamic of\nYou know you're coming with whatever you're coming with however you're feeling that day or whatever nerves you might have to they also are nervous 'cause they're about to be interviewed on the radio you know in front of the country or whatever and that energy and what we bring in our posture that we bring to social situations to\nEconomics too political conversations that is basically what this album is about so very indirectly well not necessarily indirectly but not in the way that people might think that these experiences of impacted the music but\nThey have impact and if not like you you you hang out grand master flash for the record sounds like grandma exact not like that exactly there's all these things yet but it\nDoes like it's a very unique kind of experience to meet so many strangers into yeah\nI always think that the other person is super cool and and confident and or strangely aggressive\nYou know what I mean this is what the albums about that what's in your imagination about another human being so you so when someone comes in and you know when you when you'd be in the studio you're doing hip of religion and someone comes in and you haven't been before and they're kind of a big deal to choose someone you\nThe you know there aren't that well yeah and you are scared a little bit yes and they seem a little I don't know if the grass was the right word\nWell I mean you and Matt before they walk in I met here were very senior sell it for the worst and a lot of the album is about why\nAnd why why do you have you have an answer [noise] um well fear you know like I'm but I'm\nLike this question of is it all illusory because it is because how many people come in to the studio to talk to you that strangers and your brain see yourself in the worst how many of them actually attack you or like zero percent yet like very yet I'm almost nobody yeah virtually zero percent\nSo then why do we ah approach each other with that posture and not just each other but you know the album is is also political in a sense why do we approach you know our politics and you know our our financial\nUm um\nSituations also like with with that kind of posture of either defensiveness or or aggression yeah\nWhy why why a concept album at all then why not a song about [noise] um because actually the first thing they grabbed me was this concept was basically a story that appeared in my imagination and I'm right away\nI started to see all the parallels to our world so that is really it's it's the thing that inspired the whole album so that's why it's a concept album otherwise ah yeah I mean\nI liked I actually liked to be a little bit more plain spoken in and to the point but um but it's it's been a while to her for me at all I mean the the the ... record but before that it's been awhile since last how long it's been ... ah first first last shot album last rap album was like\nFive years ago so does it feel like a bit of a risk to come back with that kind of a grand concept ... I'm\nNot really I mean in the sense that like it felt the ... it felt like the most inspiring ... inspired thing that I had with a meat to make um I started recording a whole bunch of different songs and a lot of them were very very different in tone like I I wanted to make\nBill weather's type music you know music that just makes you feel so good um and I made some signs like that but I'm at the end of the day this was the project that was coming together the most clearly the most quickly just about the most inspired so I'm\nGlad you told me about when I ran into you on this side of the road you come back for basketball and I was even thought mentioned yes you told me about this record okay in a way that was a little bit of can you believe this town\nWeb streaming is made possible by diversify trust and independent wealth management firm offering an integrated approach to the investment trust your state and philanthropic needs of individuals' multigenerational families institutions and retirement plans learn more at diversified trust dot com\nOr you can also find scheduled for all of our program channels and listen to a live stream of any of our programming on line learn more about connecting with Nashville public radio at W.

first thing I'm an architect I might they say what they do yeah and I am and I'm so I said well I'm an actor you know that that's what I and that's for since I was Fifteen that's what I have been doing and\nSo so much of who I Am is defined within and taking time off made me realize that I'm so much more than that\nUm and there was\nFreedom in that somehow I don't know I don't know how to say do you think that changed the way you after\nWell that would also happened on the flip side is it made me fall in love with acting in a whole different way because I appreciated all the opportunities that it gave me and it to see the world in a different way to walk in someone else's shoes and [noise] um\nExpand my ideas of how I Walk in the world you know every character I play from boys don't cry to ... million dollar baby to conviction to Freedom Riders these stories of these women all of them being true other than a million dollar baby\nI'm are just they are in me now and I see the world and a rich away because of them so it's been a life and reaching it's been um\nIt's incredible it'd be an actor and so I have a deeper appreciation\nAfter stepping away for a little while so nice to meet you nice to meet you too thanks for coming to thank you that's Academy Award winning actor [laughter] it's true I think Hillary swagger latest film is called what they're\nSo nice to talk to her

Toronto the directors guild of Canada words is meant to highlight the achievements of comedians in film and television here's some winters from last night Paul after Barry one production design for his work on the film the shape of water you might remember\nJeffrey ... took home the Alan King award for excellence in documentary for the documentary about the tragically happened a long time running\nBut the biggest awards of the night where for lifetime achievement these winter directors ... normally Bailey and Allen ease of bumps when Alan Keyes was on cue or not that long ago we were supposed to talk about her new album the thirtieth anniversary of her album Bush lady but\nGiven that we're talking about the directors guild awards allergies and I also ended up talking about the importance of telling diverse stories\nMy my main interest was education so I did a lot of a tool in schools across Canada to educate their student I learned that the students to you\nAnd other stories that have been when they were learning to a history of Canada which was really\nFor me it was really designed to get people to hate us and I thought what behind you and the only answer that could come with I thought the children have to hear another story and I'm a story to tell it and that doesn't\nSound nice of bumps when that whole conversation is available on our podcast another award to mention this time out of Canada last night Julia Louis Dreyfus was honored with Mark Twain prize for career achievement in comedy show her from being a lane and Seinfeld more recently as veep while accepting the award she had this to say\nA native of Washington suburbs and Mary Lynn ... she's a graduate of the whole to arm school that it's also the alma mater of Dr Christine Blasey Ford who accused Brett Kavanaugh of groping her and high school was up in the war Julia Louis Dreyfus made reference to Dr Ford testimony as she recalled high school performance of the play fair and deputy saying I can remember every single aspect of\nThe play that night so much so that I Would testify under oath about it but I Can't remember who drove me there or who drove me home [noise]\n[noise] you can't push [laughter] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\nExactly Twenty years ago that a share her massive hobby jam\nFoley [noise] so you hear how how she sort of sounds like a robot no one had ever really heard anything like that before you might now know that that's\nThe result of something called auto tune the software program that tons of musicians me pretty much every musician uses\nNow um that takes a note that might be a little bit flat ideally take note that might be a little bit flat or a little bit sharp and and it makes it the perfect that you're looking for but used kind of turned up on a lab and turns your voice and it sounded a little bit look like a robot and you hear that now with you know calling us the bunny bear and T pain even beyond seas use out of tune\nI don't think it's a stretch to say the auto tune is one of the most revolutionary inventions and all the music history so one of the producers here on cue wanted to track down where auto tune came from and the answer led her to an electrical engineer who once worked for Exxon I'll let him pick it up from there\n[noise]\nUpon assumed was designed to be used in a way that you don't know it's been a huge and to fix a picture of singers [noise] there was a setting that you can adjust so that you can't control or rape the pitch moves to the correct note\nAnd just for fun I allow that control to go to an instantaneous transition I did that just because I knew that no one in ...\nThat's the first time people could hear auto to being used as a distinct sound [noise]\n[noise]\nMy name's Andy held the bran and I created a punishment for\nI work for X. amount for three years doing physical size processing and then I started my own company and about ten years later I got involved with digital signal processing for music\nAnd in the early Nineteen Ninety five I was meeting at a trade show with my distribution company the owner of the company was there and he had his wife there we were having lunch and we were talking about what products that we might do next to\nHim she said well why don't you make me a box of when we sing in tune I knew that I could do that but I look around the table and ... every one looked more or less dejected that the idea so I went on to do something completely different\nAnd uh I did that for about six months or so and then I figured well what can I Do so I talked to her idea had merit so I went ahead and created audit within a few months I had that back at the same trade show and uh there was a big hit\nSo that's where the genesis of big idea for me and despite some of the negative feelings about auto tune what what what impresses me is a threat\nOf genres who was shot as soon as you almost everybody is familiar with is just as in pop music\n[noise]\n\n[noise] okay how can you know\nAnswer is no\nWay\nBut it's also used in country and western\nChild will everybody in the last comment is used in rag eight\n\n\nShed been hosting the Peabody Award an Emmy winning series about evolution which premiered its second season on Netflix he's been interviewing somebody hip hop's biggest stars for that while also working on a massive\nNew record up his own it's called a short story about war it's a concept record that follows three different characters the sniper stone throwers and the fool each track takes you through the different perspectives on things like greed and the environment capitalism\nWhich might sound pretty dark but as you'll hear and just admitted if you know the guy at all I mean of course the entire message is just underlined with hope for the record drops this Friday here's a bit of a preview of what to expect recorded live and accuse studio\nTo shed with sniper on cue or\nMm Mm\nYeah yeah so um I wrote this home about\nA young boy than we want to know lord\nAnd all around them either like from the town of wars or\nWill only learned that the whole world with the whole ... and in fact the whole world would that world\nEveryone's frightened to their core\nAnd so we train them became [noise]\nEventually climbing to the top [noise]\nI Would not love the man from the land\nPlane you're from the ... and how we we don't need to understand the man in the last month and I never touch that had different from a young began to see the only thing [noise]\nI didn't get the planet seems real landing and these were you saying that leap in the ground\nI've found you guys\nAnd higher and higher bench catching about how\nYou can always renting\nThe band is dirty their hands dirty man it's kill or be killed that\nFrom school and definitely you grow up and here in the business world and they tell you if you want to be successful you got to step on people eat at it\nFor people to ensure\nYou got it and pay to me pocketing take ... to make the wrong something done but I don't run and I don't miss that I don't want to know know what I'm focused on them I don't mean pro with no no I don't think so and I didn't\nI go then to go in there\nI think the only thing but in any by\nPhone number that's based on the you know\nEveryone by people\nCan't demand is dirty their hands dirty man already saw that I [noise]\nI mean really shed with ... studio snipers is one of the characters you'll meet on his new record a short story about war\nWith shops on friday yeah and it's it's all that good check and tell you more about these characters and just a second but first you know when he stopped by I I had to kick things off a little bit of a catch up with what he's been up to since he was last here\nHow are ya I'm doing great have you on about being here have you on All right oh I feel good yeah ah this is a new room\n[noise] yeah I should say if you're listening to this on the radio were upstairs yeah I kinda wish I could see the older I gotta yeah we'll go we'll go after and now you're doing this incredible hip evolution documentary\nYeah Peabody Award winning or how do you how do you find sitting down with these people they got hooked up to your entire life I'm guessing well again you know what it's like I guess you know what I mean yeah like\nA you know you you sit across these people in there and they're really fascinating and or their contributions obviously to the culture and the music that that I Love and it's given so much to my life\nUm you know are are remarkable and then uh you know the cool thing and it's the same thing I felt when I was doing you know your job is uh is these people are also stunned as stunned as you are by them they're stunned by what they've been able to contribute and or be a part of so\nUm yeah they're they're super super fun conversations interesting\nHave you had any moments of geeky named me one particular moment of like wow I just can't I Can't believe I'm here right now I mean the\nOne I'd have to say stands out the most is Couric whose kinda recognizes the you know the father of hip hop and ah we have the opportunity to interview him or in front of his building in the Bronx where he grew up in where he kinda famously started throwing his party's in this particular style that\nYou know became hip hop so that was very surreal he's not a guy that is very public he doesn't do a lot of interviews you know so\nTo be with the guy that basically started hip hop at the place where he started hip hop you you know and look at the building and speak to him and hear his story and then kind of gave out at New York in the world and it all moved to the beat of this music that he has a Thirteen fourteen year old pine here and\nSo I I'd rather I got to think that some of his mhm like getting to talk to each other like either on this show or or or inhibit pollution of getting to talk to some of these great mind ... must have impacted this new record somehow [noise] um no\nThing is only indirectly but I'm\nNot in the sense of like cleaning anything from there like musical genius oddly enough you know if there's anything that impacted this record I think it's kind of the experience of meeting so many people\nAnd meeting them in these particular situations like you and I are in but I mean we know each other so you know when you sit across from a stranger for example and just that dynamic of\nYou know you're coming with whatever you're coming with however you're feeling that day or whatever nerves you might have to you know they also are nervous 'cause they're about to be interviewed on the radio you know in front of the country or whatever and that energy and what we bring in our posture that we bring to social situations to\nEconomics too political conversations that is basically what this album is about so very indirectly well not necessarily indirectly but not in the way that people might think that these experiences and impacted the music but they haven't\nOf the record sounds like ram it exactly like that exactly there's all these things yet but it does like it's a very unique kind of experience to meet so many strangers into yeah 'cause I always think that the other person is super cool and and confident and or strangely aggressive\nYou know what I mean this is what the albums about that what's in your imagination about another human being so\nYou so when someone comes in and you know when you when you'd be in the studio or you don't have a religion someone comes in and you haven't been before and they're kind of a big deal to say to someone you know totally and you don't really know them that well in order to you know there aren't that well yeah and you are scared a little bit yes and they're they seem a little I don't know if the question was the right word\nWell I mean you met before they walk in I met your worms racing yourself for the worst and a lot of the album is about\nWhy and why why do you have you have an answer [noise] um well fear you know like I'm but I'm\nLike this question of is it all illusory because it is because how many people come in to the studio to talk to you that strangers and your brain so he was the worst how many of them actually attack you or like zero percent yet like very yet I'm almost nobody who yeah virtually zero percent\nSo then why do we ah approach each other with that posture and not just each other but you know the album is is also political sense why do we approach you know our politics and you know our our financial\nUm um\nSituations also like with with that kind of posture of either defensiveness or or aggression yeah\nWhy why why a concept album at all then why not a song about [noise] um because actually the first thing they grabbed me was this concept was basically a story that appeared in my imagination and I'm right away\nI started to see all the parallels to our world so that\nIs really it's it's the thing that inspired the whole album so that's why it's a concept album otherwise uh yeah I mean I liked I actually liked to be a little bit more plain spoken in and to the point but um\nBut it's it's been a while to her for me at all I mean the the the ... record but before that it's been awhile since last how long it's been since ...\nAh first first last shot up last rap album was like five years ago\nSo does it feel like a bit of a risk to come back with that kind of a grand concept ... I'm not really I mean in the sense that like it\nFelt the ... it felt like the most inspiring sorry inspired thing that I had when they meet to make um I started recording a whole bunch of different songs and a lot of them were very very different in tone like I I wanted to make\nBill weather's type music you know music that just makes you feel so good um and I made some sounds like that but I'm at the end of the day this was the project that was coming together the most clearly the most quickly just about the most inspired so I'm\nGlad you told me about when I ran into you on this side of the road you come back for basketball and I was even thought mentioned yes you told me about this record okay in a way that was a little bit of can you believe this town", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "23"}
