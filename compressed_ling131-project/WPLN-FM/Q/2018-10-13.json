other week\n... does it to the White House comes just days after another big name and music Taylor Swift spoke about politics and that was for the first time ever Taylor hopped on Instagram last week and posted an endorsement for to Tennessee Democrats running in the U.S midterm\nNow it's probably a coincidence that these ...\nOnce again these two totally different artists are finding themselves linked together connection if you will goes back to the moment that kind of jumped on stage to interrupt Taylor's acceptance speech at the MTV Video Music awards not that's already almost a decade ago\nAnd it's weird to tie that binds them becomes has become a little strange or since then\nThe cue music panel is here to help us make a little sense of it all\nAt least the Christians and is the

down walls were every ... every celebrity to kind of become a part of this process and now people talked about like Oprah and the rock running for the Democrats with a straight face\nAt least I just had a minute left and I'd be interested what you think is the takeaway from what we saw the ... and Taylor Swift this week well\nI feel like I'm at that moment at the end of Sixth Sense when you find out that he's dead and suddenly you go back and you're looking at wait a second\nHave you been dead all along like I just feel like I'm reassessing all the different moves everybody has made over the past few years and just looking at them and going what am I being watching all of this time maybe I was wrong the whole time so I if I'm doing that I think a lot of people are doing that\nAnd other probably doing it a lot with the political process as well because as we mentioned who knows who's going to run I I don't know anymore and uh I'm afraid to to check every day I'm going to be

I didn't really these days but when I graduated from music college I'd go to um jam sessions\nAnd um I feel very insecure will because I mean they were speaking in general terms but my experience most of the guys who got up very uh very much for played them very much away and wanted to do one of those like you know he could play the solstice who played the loudest highest\nAnd um to me and I've noticed a lot of other female player was not really interested enough to where more interested in and making music can being a part of something greater than the individual\nUm and so that's kind that did not my confidence a lot and it's taken me a very long time to sort of I'm just you know do you mind staying and forget about that competitiveness early written about\nThat at length I was reading an article from you what you said women in jazz prefer to work collectively and I'm Wondering are they is there an artist or someone who has has mentored you were held to cultivate who you're going to be in in in the jazz world\nUm yeah I mean I've had to do to support from tomorrow\nUm other people but you know has been what looked like um\nWhat does it look like um ice\nAnd how do they how do they interact with you what is it that they give you that helps you and it helps you in ... is there a moment with somebody's actually sat down and talked with you or you're playing together\n[noise] yeah yes I have had that um people talking to me and saying you know let's let's go for coffee let's let's talk about how we continue to the next level and I'm On people giving me opportunities enough for people from um you know or minority background need is like giving\nThat opportunity for them to\nYou know to flourish and I'm a little to that time a lot of the time that's not allowed because it's such a noisy seen\n'em and you know any such and voices or a or I'm guessing hug you know there's a majority\nUm yeah but like I said things are changing\nWays you speak about that noisy see in the u._k. scene is getting huge amount of attention right now why do you think that is\nI think that the bits of um you know that's a there's a change in A People's perceptions and um I think people are becoming more connected with that their roots um that\nHistorical um backgrounds and that cultural backgrounds and um I think lots of um musicians are trying to relate to a musical today um was it that club music cool electronic music\nUm and also I think some people are out there trying to reflect the political situations that are happening particularly in the u._k. you know we're we're at the time that it's very um\nYou know social negativity going on and I think that's also um you know that as an inspiration to sort of protest all of that negativity three music and I think is becoming quite exciting and people can relate to that I'm rather than you know your standard kind of\nYou know what people think jobs is happening in your music um yeah I suppose so I mean I like to reflect a my mixed um heritage I'm an old the I I like to learn from all the different um musicians I've worked with you know like Radiohead and decent parents and I\nWant to jump into that in in just a moment if you're just tuning in my guest is jazz trumpeter ...
