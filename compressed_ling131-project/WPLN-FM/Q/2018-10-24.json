you might think about runway shows and bread carpets and very in models and\nMost definitely clothing that doesn't seem to be made for your body or necessarily your life will hanging Taylor has been challenging that ever since she started designing women's where can you make closing that's really expressive sunny it's optimistic bold prints geometric shapes bright colors\nAnd just like real life optimism it catches on her clients currently include Taylor Swift beyond saying\nFor us a first lady Michelle Obama but these are not the type of clothes that are just made it for the red carpet and models among us time to design clothes for all ages all shapes and I think it's something that a lot of her peers just don't do I'm excited to talk a little bit more about it and I'm excited to have perhaps Canada's most prestigious designer right now China Taylor in\nOur studio Hi Hi thank you for having me it's such a joy to heavy here as you grow up in Toronto\nGrew up in Toronto I went to high school here and then ... then Parsons in New York\nSo when you were growing up in Toronto to the world a fashion seem acceptable to you\nDon't even think I knew there was a rather fashion when I was growing up in Toronto I think my world the fashion consisted of my mom and my grandma and how much they loved getting dressed up\nPlaying with close playing with color but I didn't realize that it's an industry and I think it was an intel I moved to New York and released\nMars can kind of co exist and how beautiful it is to have kind of both of them in a job in in a world together\nWith the ... side of you like you grew up painting as yeah\nSo my mom um she we had a rec room in the basement and it probably because I was an only child and I needed some activities to keep me busy she gave me free rein to paint anything I wanted on the walls\nFull only child stuff to write a great stuff from a family of six [laughter]\nPaint your imaginary friend [laughter] so\nI did I recreate it into this retro landscape of like old cars an old um Hollywood actresses and very artistic lotta paper mash a a lot of arts and crafts and my house and I think that that was kind of starting point of expressing myself through painting and through creating\nThing and forgive me for this because I mean as you I wore my best bomber ... guy I wore the best stuff I have [laughter]\nI Wish you guys could see it I wore the best stuff I have for today I feel flattered so forgive me if I'm gonna I'm gonna try this out I feel like when I see your work I see elements of paintings times your work feels like a campus with paint on us\nThank you well we paint all of our presence in our studio in New York and\nI never intentionally started the company thinking that would be how we express the story or tell customer what we're feeling but it's kind of the easiest most personal way to do it and I'm so we spent weeks just painting and then we create them we create all of our fabrics based on our paintings\nSo I'm going to ask you to do something a little challenging for me okay can you describe the aesthetic of Kenya Taylor on the radio\n... there's a lot of movement it's optimistic our girl is going somewhere in it it's very colorful it's very happy and you want to talk to her if you saw someone walking into the room wearing our brand you want to ask her question and she's magnetic\nWe would put it on a Seventeen year old model and have to ... and everything would not be able to move like adjusts there was a whole different context of how to appreciate clothing and we were really excited with how it was received\nBeauty Patricia runway shows getting kinda boring\nI think ... should do it because they have the budget and it's like the fantasy but I think that runway should be about fantasy and when your brand is based on reality it's probably not the right format\nOr you've read like a Starbucks or in like due to Starbucks all the time or you're sitting at a Starbucks having a cup of coffee and civil walks in wearing your clothes yes because I feel\nThe coolest that's that's when you feel like you've got a gold star that day [noise]\nWhat do you mean like whenever I Would do something good at home when I was a kid I got a gold star on a little piece of paper in my bedroom and it just feels like an achievement it feels like it's quiet you don't need to celebrate it in a public way but it feels like you've done something where you'd made that person's day better\nIt must be feel so rewarding it's rewarding definitely it's been so great talking to you I think there's a lot of people listening to this is who like myself sometimes find the world of fashion I'm a little bit scary sometimes I'm definitely getting better at it but it's a lot of people who can't afford expensive clothing\nMaybe people when they read vogue when to pick up ... don't see themselves reflected in if you're someone who I was a cares a lot about inclusiveness ... what what are you say to them\nI think fashion as approachable I think that magazines aren't necessarily where I Need to look to be inspired for fashion and I think that just being out in Toronto or being out in a city and watching how women feel confident expressing themselves individually it's probably where to get inspired\nWhat do you think of as the motivates\nMaking women happy I Love doing that right now through clothing but I think that we have found ways to partner even recently with you\nKnow hospitals and different organizations to start spreading a message of color and joy and that makes me really happy but it was a closer but you're doing yeah it's we did one yesterday upset kids hospital and\nBecause we paint all the time we've decided that we want to take painting to pediatric hospitals and we started MS canned New York\nAnd we host at painting class in their community center and kids can come and join with their siblings 'cause there's a lot of activities that are\nNot geared for both of them to be able to kind of bond and be kids together and yesterday we did that tickets and it's awesome it's the kid says the technology to actually film you in a studio painting and then they broadcast and each of the patients' rooms so it's it's pretty ... it's cool\nIt's it's really cool talking to you well thank you very much for me to be here it's so nice to meet you too there was a Canadian fashion design to tend to Taylor she's based in New York or you can head over to our website to check out some photos from her her recent collections and I think

I don't know where the guys that I was like yeah yeah that's me that's I like that\nSo anyway I sat and played until I learned alley cat and the same with deep purple and their weight of the stars and uh and that was yet and then we had fake bucks hanging around the house and I learned how to\nAnd that it has somehow like when we were talking about with music reaches people and they getting some spree pleasure out of it and uh and it's sweet when they come up to me and they put that statue of me in London you know to commemorate the twenty fifth anniversary did you see about that\nThe shirtless a Ian Malcolm shirtless Jeff Goldblum after a dinosaur attack a statue made of you how do you feel about that whole fantastic it's wonderful [laughter] if you really embrace interacting with your friends online like you embrace the means about yourself to some things so nice about that you know\nWell it's changed me by surprise I you know I only got involved with social media a little bit ago and I am and I are posted on Instagram but then I at the gay I take pictures with people and uh and then I see what they've ah if they've posted it the next day but I like to see people's tattoos of me and drawings of me and uh\nI just got to kind of a a kick out of it you know\nFor one reason or another it's uh people are very very sweet actually\nUm before we go I I Want to close off with the uh [noise] something that occurred to me a lot of listening to it and it may be making too much of a leap here but uh I feel like jazz or from the music that I've made jazz is is best made in close collaboration\nWith those you trust like you create the right environment and you're able to be spontaneous and creative and and trust the people you're you're being spontaneous with\nOr the parallels with good acting there as well\nYes and of course of course you have to trust those people\nBut you know I think the\nHealthier you are or where she can be the issue more quickly you're able to trust and people if you sort of extend your trust then their trustworthiness comes in to play\nLittle better sometimes I find them I like a room full of people I've never met before and somehow I don't know why at this point\nI kind of fall into an immediate kind of\nIntimacy [laughter] I don't know why I mean if you're playing music\nOr boy all sorts of barriers and paranoia is under the securities and self conscious Mrs drop away don't they and in the acting um field to if you're ... you're playing a story and and and acting out something\nPoetic and meaningful a while then yeah you know you you know oftentimes I find like in the circus\nUm give a kind of you find yourself with the people you've never met before and sometimes you have to act out a love scene with them or some sort of you know it's interesting human\nChallenging problem solving requiring intimacy and and and ... fold free wheeling interaction somehow but you don't even know the people but but because you're working on this story that you watched actually both care about\nEverything gets opened up and with music too that's a good answer isn't it it's a solid answer Jeff Goldblum it's been so nice talking to you as nice talking to you Mr power\nIt's lovely I'll see you in person sometime I Hope\nIt comes to Toronto I should come up and hang out\nI Will I loved her eye to eye made the fly there and my wife is from Toronto I go and visit the air and her mom all the time and I love ...\nTalk to you you're so sweet thanks to\n\n\nYou going to a game called caravan ...\nOriginally perform or do you get like in Nineteen thirty six\nAnd then one of my favorites was first recorded by a group called Bernie the guard and his jak debaters [laughter] but they're it's performed by a Jeff Goldblum and his group [noise]\nIt's a bit of caravans debut album Jeff Goldblum comes out on November ninth it's called the Capitol Studios [noise]\n\nHey it's Alexis Marshall\nYou may have heard a few of my stories this semester at the full reporting in turn but the first time I was on the air was actually last October during the ... I've been listening to W. P. L. A. and for years one of the best parts of getting my own car in high school was getting to pick the radio station it was always such a Ninety point three\nSo last year when Natasha pitched a mini golf or the end of an afternoon our I thought it was finally time to contribute to the reporting I Love\nIt didn't have a job I'm Still a college student but I became a sustaining member because this reporting matters\n[noise] while I was on the phone with a volunteer in ... brought me on ear to thank me it was the first time I got to hear my own voice on my favorite station I felt really cool because my small contribution mattered and yours does too\nIf you want to support the word you hear on Ninety points three make a donation at W. P. L. N. dot org or call at six one five seven six zero ... maybe you'll hear your voice on the air to you\n[noise]\nYou're listening to you on BBC Radio one serious actually I'm One sixty nine and from ... public radio international\nWhen you think about successful fashion brands you might think about runway shows and red carpets and very thin models and\nMost definitely clothing that doesn't seem to be made for your body or necessarily your life well dang Taylor has been challenging that ever since she started designing women's where Kenyan makes clothing that's really express it's sunny it's optimistic bold prints geometric shapes bright colors\nAnd just like real like optimism it catches on her clients currently include Taylor Swift beyond see\nFor us a first lady Michelle Obama but these are not the type of clothes that are just made it for the red carpet and models among us time to design clothes for all ages all shapes and I think it's something that a lot of her peers just don't\nPerhaps Canada's most prestigious designer right now China Taylor in our studio heart I thank you for having me get such a joy to hurt or hear or you grew up in Toronto\nGrew up in Toronto I went to high school here and then ... university then Parsons in New York\nSo when you were growing up in terms of the world of fashion seemed accessible to you\nI don't even think I knew there was a world of fashion when I was growing up in Toronto I think my world fashion consisted of my mom and my grandma and how much they loved getting dressed up\nPlaying with close playing with color but I didn't realize it was an industry and I think it wasn't until I moved to New York and really saw how creative\nAnd commerce can kind of co exist and how beautiful it is to have kind of both of them in a job in in a world together\nBut the ... side of you like you grew up painting is\nYeah so my mom um she we had a rec room in the basement and it probably because I was an only child and I needed some activities to keep me busy she gave me free rein to paint anything I Want it on the walls\nDoubtful only child stuff too right yeah that's right that's not family of six [laughter]\nPaint your imaginary friend [laughter] so\nI did I recreate it into this retro landscape of like old cars and old um Hollywood actresses and very artistic lotta paper mash a a lot of arts and crafts and my house and I think that that was kind of starting point of expressing myself through painting and through creating things\nForgive me for this because I mean as you I wore my best bomber jacket luxury guy I wore the best stuff I have [laughter] I Wish you guys could see it I wore the best stuff I have for today I feel flattered so forgive me if I'm gonna I'm gonna try this out I feel like\nWhen I see your work I see elements of paintings times your work feels like a campus with paint on it\nThank you well we paint all of our presence in our studio in New York and\nI never intentionally started the company thinking that would be how we express the story or tell customer what we're feeling but it's kind of the easiest most personal way to do it and I'm so we spent weeks just painting and then we create them we create all of our fabrics based on our paintings\nSo I'm going to ask you to do something a little challenging for me okay can you describe the aesthetic of tend to tailor on the radio\nBlue there's a lot of movement it's optimistic our girl is going somewhere in it it's very colorful it's a very happy and you want to talk to her if you saw someone walking into the room wearing our brand you want to ask her question and she's magnetic\nWe would put it on a Seventeen year old model and have to ... and everything would not be able to move like adjusts there was a whole different context of how to appreciate clothing and we were really excited with how it was received\nYou Patricia runway shows getting kinda boring\nI think she should do it because they have the budget and it's like this fantasy but I think that runway should be about fantasy and when your brand is based on reality it's probably not the right format\nOr you read like a Starbucks or in like Starbucks all the time are you ever said no started with having a cup of coffee and civil walks in wearing your clothes yes it was a few\nThe coolest that's that's when you feel like you've got a gold star that day [noise]\nWhat do you mean like whenever I Would do something good at home when I was a kid I got a gold star on a little piece of paper in my bedroom and it just feels like an achievement it feels like it's quiet you don't need to celebrate it in a public way but it feels like you've done something where you'd made that person's day better\nIt must be feel so rewarding it's rewarding definitely it's been so great talking to you I think there's a lot of people listening to this is who like myself sometimes find the world of fashion I'm a little bit scary sometimes I I'm I'm definitely getting better at it\nBut it's just a lot of people who can't afford expensive clothing maybe people when they read vote when to pick a robot don't see themselves reflected in its you're someone who's always cared a lot about inclusive of the what what do you say to them\nI think fashion as approachable I think that magazines aren't necessarily where you need to look to be inspired for fashion and I think that just being out in Toronto or being out in a city and watching how women feel confident expressing themselves individually it's probably where to get inspired\nWhat do you think of as the motivates\nMaking women happy I Love doing that right now through clothing but I think that we have found ways to partner even recently with\nYou know hospitals and different organizations to start spreading a message of color and joy and that makes me really happy because you're doing yeah it's we did one yesterday as sick as hospital and\nBecause we paint all the time we've decided that we want to take painting to pediatric hospitals and we started MS can New York\nAnd we host at painting class in their community center and kids can come and join with their siblings 'cause there's a lot of activities that are\nNot geared for both of them to be able to kind of bond and be kids together and yesterday we did that tickets and it's awesome it's sick kids has the technology to actually film you in a studio painting and then they broadcast and each of the patients' rooms so it's it's pretty ... it's cool\nIt's it's really cool talking to you well thank you very much like your ... your ... to meet you too there was a Canadian fashion design to tend to Taylor she's based in New York or you can head over to our website to check out some photos
