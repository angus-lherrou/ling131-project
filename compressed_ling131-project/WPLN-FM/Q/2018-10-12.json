Matty Madison man what guy coming up out you you're going to hear from Maggie Joan hall I might have seen her in films like Dark Knight or secretary or maybe in the show that do since you got to tell you about her new film the kindergarten teacher Maggie Gyllenhaal coming up right after this [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nYou're listening to our CBC Radio one serious acts and one sixty nine and for the R I or public radio international\nMy name is Tom power and\nCouple of weeks ago on the show you might've heard Maggie Gyllenhaal telling you a bit about her latest film if you missed it she stopped by the cues studio during the Toronto international film festival where her new movie the kindergarten teacher\nWas having its premiere so when he was sitting here in the studio as you might have guessed from black bloc of the show we ended up talking for a very very long time\nWe couldn't actually fit the whole conversation into the show the weeks ago so I'm excited for you to hear the second chapter of our interview now the maggots film was about to hit Netflix don't worry you can pick it up here 'cause we're gonna talk about a new film the kindergarten teacher which takes you into the classroom of happy five year old\nAbbott has pretty dark side to it as well Meghan Joan ... character is this teacher who ends up taking things too far with one of her young students not not like that what that means issue becomes quite obsessed with unlocking the secret of a little boys poetry\nThe film ends up being a psychological thriller but also side are sort of a black comedy as well you'll hear Maggie Gyllenhaal dig into more of this unbelievable story in just a minute including how she helped hold this film together on a set full of five year olds\nCan do it all like to have you here thanks for having me so I'm a poem is at the heart of this film you kindergarten teacher aspiring poet and one of your students says these words out of the blue and that kind of the moment that sets the whole story into play and it is beautiful beautiful enough for me\nThe sun hits hey yellow house it's almost like a gift from God like a sign like a time and that\nJust something about watching a child say a poem or even just actually hearing a stay at home [noise] reminds me of how strange it can be and how little we hear poetry and our daily\nLives I think that's true but I think children you know ... and that kind of poetic world I mean that's part of an interesting about the movie as he asked this child\nAnd they said to have to look at at either that this child had some kind of gas stand out as hand calms things fully formed pounds or they just kind of more in the way I look at that\nThat you know it's about a woman who's ...\nWho's poetry isn't heard and certainly not appreciated\nWho interpret sled she's seeing coming out of the child has\nBecause she needs them to be poems because she needs because she's starving right\nAnd I also think you know in a way I think well okay so how do you tell that story I I just keep thinking about this interview I did with them with Trevor Noah from the Daily Show yeah it was about the juice but he'd seen the trailer for the kindergarten teacher\nAnd and so um he was asked me about it and he was like so is it a horror movie yeah is it a thriller you is it an intimate movie about a woman's mind yeah you know and I think um\nI loved that that he said that because the truth is it's it's none of those things and all of those things even like kinda funny sometimes it's a new form and I think it's partially partially new\nBecause it's feminine it's coming from the feminine place\nWhat do you think the film says about the value we put on art as a society\n[noise] well I think one of the things is compelling to me it's like well who decides who decides what's valuable who decides that Lisa poetry is less valuable than the poetry of this little boy and I think that's really interesting right\nBut I think also it's interesting to think about the value the sheep places\nOn earth herself ... to do is there there are people like with like the young boy's father I Know I'm getting into the weeds and the phone here but you know you\nAre you sure you can you can say whatever you want I Want to be a normal life I wanted to be able to make money I wanted to be able to live you know her her children I Want them to be kind of you know the ones with the marine going to be a normal person shot yet she doesn't seem to feel understood she seems to be ... to feel almost\nLeft out of everything because they don't understand the value of of her or to her or the value of art at all\nRight right yeah and then she sort of thinks alive display understands yeah and so but like that's\nOf course of course of course but like while are we doing it you know and when I sat in the audience in Sundance and I felt\nKind of wild effect that it has I mean you can imagine that gets people gas and they laugh at strange things right and\nI think it's saying something real about the state of the world for women at the moment I'm\nThis is a woman who is not fundamentally\nIll should not crazy but I think you're looking at someone who is driven crazy by the culture that she finds herself in [noise]\nAnd I think for many women at the moment if we're honest I don't I don't know that I could imagine doing the things that Lisa does I mean it's an allegory she goes real far real\nExtreme I really don't want to do more now that is that the doctors that are very not related\nWill know well All right it's it's beyond a normal behavior of north but up until the point the ways in which she's out of control confused has no hell no one understands her\nUm and I think is hungry for some kind of\nReal interaction in the world\nUm is something I really relate to and I know because of what's the cultural conversation at the moment that half of you know the people in the world of women relate to it I mean basically we made the movie last summer Trump was elected\nIn New York anyway there was this kind of feeling of\nLike deep\nRadicalism mixed with Malaysia\nSo there were protests people re spray painting things on Trump's buildings there were it was there were there was a ruptured we put us in the streets and then there was also a certain amount of [noise] well that's a that's what happens we'll\nKnow there was a certain amount of oh my God look where we actually are yeah this is not where we wish we were ... and\nYeah I think when you I think what started off all of this and the time's up and everything I Believe was Trump saying\nYou can grab women's if you want to and you have enough power and they let you mhm and then there being no consequences for it and I think for for me I was like whoa\nThings are bad and I looked at in my life and I looked at the ways in which I'd accept it all sorts of things I couldn't believe I accepted\nUm and I think that's sort of what it's about I mean I Do think it's about the real consequences of what happens if you starve a vibrant woman's mind and I think so many women right now are waking up to\nThe feeling that we've been starving that we've been accepting so many things bending over backwards twisting ourselves into pretzels to get the things that we need to survive and that it's not okay right and so I think\nThis is a movie about that made by a group of women filmmakers\nMovie is like well what happens when you start the violent woman's minded dire [laughter] you know\nI think Joe has been so nice just takes\nYou could see Maggie Gyllenhaal into kindergarten teacher this week it starts dreaming on Netflix tomorrow perfect for friday night binge\nLeon Bridges coming up right after this don't hand over that are stable\n\nMm [laughter] Mm\n[laughter]\nMm [laughter] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nYou're listening to cue on CBC Radio on Syria affects

your fried butter cup is affecting me because I Love ... a lot of cops yeah but it's quickly turning into the bologna cop\nAs quickly turning into the cheeseburger for main already [laughter] it's like I said like a bunch of ...\nAnd everyone's talking about the bologna cop and I made this beautiful book or a microwave baloney cop I'm not going to dominate liberal but it's it's fine yeah because as soon as somebody gets a book they open it up and it's happening like as soon as somebody opens up that book like\nThis isn't what I expected this is a beautiful cookbook and that's what all I wanted to do I wanted to make a cookbook that are like really like books that really truly inspired me so if you're a kid right yeah so if you're a kid was to write\nLike the next ... version of this of the recipes that were passed down to him what would be in it [noise] I don't know a mattress\nThese like ... chicken fingers every day I don't know like I like as if I can apply planning on having yeah now he loves pickles he'll eat a whole lemon if we give it to them uh he loves soup like the other day we kinda made this a I made like I'm\nJust a really basic like Japanese ... some some some or chicken some rice some some uh boiled route a bag or in some die on any like just jams and a bunch of like really nice rice and like if you give him a bra off\nHe loves soup and it's amazing because I think if I could eat FAA Rahman and more you know ... every day I Would if I could eat soup everyday and not be bored of it and I certainly could he fought every morning like\nSeven AM as soon as I wake up like if I could just have fog off and just mashable fog I every day that would be the greatest thing in my life but I think Mac as like\nStill you know he's two and a half of what I have a feeling that food is something you guys passed down to one another I Hope so like I I Want like I'm In Raleigh that stupid cliched thing about like now I'm setting the table I like that yeah like where I'm like I get to\nWeb streaming is made possible by the Nashville repertory theater presenting the regional debut of adult South Park to October eleventh through November third this clever

and I and I love the book thank you the books the best goodbye go by by the ... are going to the mountains of new cookbook is called ... than a cookbook which is an easy title to remember Maggie Madison man what a guy\nComing out about you you're going to hear from Maggie Joan hall I might have seen her in films like Dark Knight or secretary or maybe in the show the do since you can't tell you about her new film to kindergarten teacher Maggie Gyllenhaal coming up right after that [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nYou're listening to our CBC Radio one serious XM one sixty nine an hour I our public radio international\nMy name is Tom power\nCouple of weeks ago on the show you might have heard Maggie Gyllenhaal telling you a bit about her latest film if you missed it she stopped by the cues studio during the Toronto international film festival where her new movie the kindergarten teacher\nWas having its premiere so when he was sitting here in the studio as you might have guessed from last block of the show we ended up talking for a very very long time\nWe couldn't actually fit the whole conversation into the show the weeks ago so I'm excited for you to hear the second chapter of our interview now the maggots film was about to hit Netflix don't worry you can pick it up here 'cause we're gonna talk about a new film to kindergarten teacher which takes you ended his classroom of happy five year olds\nAre pretty dark side to it as well Meghan Joan ... character is this teacher will end up taking things too far with one of her young students not not like that what that means issue becomes quite obsessed\nWith unlocking the secret of a little boys poetry\nThe film ends up being a psychological thriller but also side are sort of a black comedy as well you'll hear Maggie Gyllenhaal dig into more of this unbelievable story and just admitted including how she helped pull this film together on a set full of five year olds\nMaggie Gyllenhaal next to have you here thanks for having me so I'm a poem is at the heart of this film you kindergarten teacher aspiring poet and one of your students says these words out of the blue and that kind of the moment that sets the whole story into play and it is beautiful beautiful enough for me\nTo send hits hey yeah that's how it's almost like a gift from God like assigned like a sign of and that just something about watching a child say a poem or even just actually hearing a stay at home [noise]\nReminds me of how strange it can be and how little we hear poetry in our daily lives I think that's true but I think ... you know ... and that kind of a poetic while I and that's part of an interesting about the movie is yes\nLook at it either that this child has some kind of gift and out of him comes these fully formed poems or which is kind of more of the way I look at it that you know it's about a woman who is a poet who is poetry isn't heard and certainly not appreciated\nWho interprets what she's seeing coming out of the child as poems\nBecause she needs them to be poems because she needs because she's starving right and I also think you know in a way they think well okay so how do you tell that story and I just keep thinking about this interview I did with um with Trevor Noah\nFrom the Daily Show yeah it was about the Deuce but he'd seen the trailer for the kindergarten teacher and and so um\nHe was asked me about it and he was like so is it a horror movie\nYeah is it a thriller you is it an intimate movie about a woman's mind yeah you know and I think um\nI Love to that that he said that because the truth is it's it's none of those things and all of those things it's even like kind of funny sometimes it's a new form and I think it's partially partially new because it's feminine it's coming from a feminine place\nWhat do you think the film says about the value we put on art as a society [noise]\nWell I think one of the things that's compelling to me it's like well who decides who decides what's valuable who decides that Lisa poetry is less valuable than the poetry of this little boy and I think that's really interesting right\nBut I think also it's interesting to think about the value the sheep places\nOn earth herself ... to do is there there are people like like the young boy's father I Know I'm getting into the weeds in the film here but you know you\nYou sure you can you can say whatever you want I Want to be a normal life I wanted to be able to make money I wanted to be able to live you know her her children I Want them to be kind of you know who wants to be marine going to be a normal person shot yet she doesn't seem to feel understood she seems to be seems to feel almost\nLeft out of everything because they don't understand the value of of her or to her or the value of art at all\nRight right yeah and then she sort of thinks ... display understands yeah and so but like that's\nI mean of course of course of course but like why are we doing it you know and when I sat in the audience and Sundance and I felt\nThis kind of well while the fact that it has I mean you can imagine that gets people gas and they laugh at strange things right and I think\nIt's saying something real about the state of the world for women at the moment I'm\nThis is a woman who is not fundamentally mentally ill she's not crazy but I think you're looking at someone who is driven crazy by the culture that she finds herself in [noise]\nAnd I think for many women at the moment if we're honest I don't I don't know that I could imagine doing the things that Lisa does I mean it's an allegory she goes real far\nReally extreme I really don't want to do now that is one of the documents that are very not related\nWill know well right it's it's beyond a normal behavior of north but up until that point the ways in which she's out of control confused has no hell no one understands\nHer um and I think is hungry for some kind of\nReal interaction in the world um is something I really relate to and I know because of what's the cultural conversation at the moment that half of you know the\nPeople in the world the women relate to it I mean basically we made the movie last summer\nTrump was elected in New York anyway there was this kind of feeling of like the radicalism mixed with Malaysia\nSo there were protests people re spray bringing things on Trump's buildings there were it was the ... there was a ruptured to put us in the streets and then there was also the certain amount of or is it is what happens we'll\nKnow there was a certain amount of oh my God look where we actually are yeah this is not where we wish we were ... and\nYeah I think when you I think what started off all of this and the time's up and everything I Believe was Trump saying\nYou can grab women's if you want to and you have enough power and they let you ... and then there being no consequences for it and I think for for me I was like well how\nThings are bad and I looked at in my life and I looked at the ways in which I'd accept it all sorts of things I couldn't believe I accepted and um and I think that's sort of what it's about I mean I Do think it's about\nThe real consequences of what happens if you starve a vibrant\nMany women right now are waking up to\nThe feeling that we've been starving that we've been accepting so many things bending over backwards twisting ourselves into pretzels to get the things that we need to survive and that it's not okay right and so I think\nThis is a movie about that made by a group of women filmmakers and so I think our our conclusion and the movie is like well what happens when you start vibrant woman's minded dire [laughter] you know\nI think Joe has been so nice takes\nYou could see Maggie Gyllenhaal into kindergarten teacher this week it started streaming on Netflix tomorrow perfect for friday night binge\nLeon Bridges coming up right after this don't hand over that ox cable\n\n[laughter]\n[laughter]\nMm [laughter] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\nYou're listening to cue on CBC Radio on Syria sex same one sixty nine ... public radio

incredible rise to fame went from washing dishes\nTo performing in Washington in front of President Obama and like just\nA matter of months [noise]\nPeople were\nBuying his album he was touring all

weighing on him so one of his new record Leon was determined to show that he was him self which is a little jazz alarm be\nFull pop little hip hop that Leon being himself so he stopped by the cute Judea when it's torture them through Canada before you open up about the wild ride he's been on these past couple of years Leon Bridges let some of the music to talking which as you like to hear this
