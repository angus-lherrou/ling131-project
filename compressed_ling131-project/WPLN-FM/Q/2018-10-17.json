understood the text but uh because my came from a a a rigidity conservative family of they ruin the tree or in the navy and uh we wanted to kind of people who who expressed feelings for a much ... and so to read the story about love and suffering and the price of love\nA was a complete eye to eye I'm I looked at my family with new eyes I thought they must be does most of his life than just this\nI think uh you know I'm gay I just need to be able to play straight pilots I don't understand why all the straits actors can go and play gay pots and everyone just to see you they know how to do it but somehow the mindset of the powers that be this doesn't work or in the other direction a day\nAccept it but um I think this is not true is to do with the mindset in in what remains of the\nBoys club of um the people in power in the executive branch and uh that has to that is the thing that still I feel needs to launch the change I'm sure this is something you've experienced yourself absolutely\nIt does it make you reflect on that I mean when I tell people I was interviewing you today I was like as a kind of talked about Oscar Wilde and people still ... referred to my best friend's wedding the wisdom to a lot of the roles and you had in the in the nineties ... had to reflect in that time now do you like thinking back to that time\nBut it was a very exciting time uh and I'm a number ... time for me it was like it was one of those kind of dream come true type of times in one sense that I could ... myself into such a\nA successful place for my best friend's wedding and uh that film went so I'm incredibly well for me but in one sense or a\nOr the you can only go so far I'm playing the gay best friend I mean you have to kind of be able to come up with something else along the line otherwise uh the audiences will get bored\nAnd I think from to graduate to any other kind of roe was a seemed to me to be impossible and then as soon as my gay best friend a road seemed to fail\nThat was when the lights kind of snapped out\nMy I I I don't think that's something we talk about enough we had a ... on the show a few weeks ago testing Bateman played played Mallory and the and I think it was family ties I Believe which is a show I didn't see right ah and she wrote this book most recently about be becoming less famous\nUm and I had never really heard anyone talk about that before becoming less fame yeah she was she wrote she wrote a book about why one at one point people walk down the street and yet at our character's name and then one day they didn't and and how unsafe sometimes you feel when you're when you're less famous and all the things you get used to that you that you don't want to admit that he got used to\nWhat it's like being dead and that is the greatest hum I'm opportunity of it too because in one sense you become like a ghost or ... guys you'll still screeching around the ... power but everyone's looking straight through you\nAnd the oldest of the ideas everyone thought it was fabulous when you were famous uh their boats to buy a new a new um persona\nAnd I think it feels exactly what it feels like being a ghost you kind of trapped in the world and you really have to die\nAnd I think that gives you an enormous opportunity because dying to yourself is a really one of the great uh possibilities and stuff over and uh it happened to me several times and\nEach time I found it is being I miss the fertilized it actually\nIs I keep on coming back to Christ revert to forward their dying and the resurrection [laughter] right [laughter] I can only imagine also that it was nice to work with your friend calling for again in this film it was wonderful and also call in and Emily into I'm ready with the people\nAre by giving their names are made the financing of the film come together finally because a particular the call and actually because uh he had become so\nSuccessful in the last five years or if he hadn't\nShown up the film would've collapsed and uh so I Will always be very indebted\nTo him ... rubber you've been very generous talking today Thanks so much for your time thank you very much Roberta ever directs and stars in the happy friends he can catch the film in select theaters in the U.S right now it'll hit more theaters later this month\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nYou're going to be the cue on CBC Radio one serious XM one sixty nine and for P R I or public radio international\nMy name is Tom power\nI don't know if you've got the chance to head out to the pictures this weekend and maybe you finally caught a star is born which is sitting strongest number two at the box office right now right behind that his first man which is winning over a lot of critics as well\nBut there's another film that's getting even better reviews than those two they hate you gave is already showing up in theaters but it will open everywhere this weekend it's already got a Ninety seven percent score on rotten tomatoes I cite that aggregates all the reviews that are out there right now and it makes sense when you realize the book was based on this huge bestseller\nWritten by Angie Thomas the hate you give follows stark Carter a sixteen year old black girl it takes a closer look at everything she grapples with after her best friend shot by a police officer and star happens to be the only witness\nObviously it's a very timely story it's one that spoke to Easter re who's an actor who's on the show insecure HBO show she created that show she plays April and the heat you give and she's an activist to star looks up to eastern race stopped by the cues studio right after the movie premiered at the Toronto international film festival\nAnd as we're about to hear this is the story is it feels is important\nAnd reliable I heard of the\nBook but I haven't read it until um the conversations about the film came out and when I read the book I was\nJust absolutely in Lebanon read the back story about you know Angie writing like as a singer these days than just the journey that she's taken is absolutely inspirational what was it about the book the what\nI mean the perspective of the young black female dealing with you know the aftermath of her friends that the ... of her role in in growing up in the hood of going to a white school is just so incredibly reliable and\nJust the young black tea must\nPerspective specifically you know you don't get to hear about you know there is Trayvon Martin friend who is you know the the key witness and what she was going there and I think about Philando Castile ski I say like those are perspective and and the grief that they have to endure for such a long period of time it's just you know think about that\nWell like I said there's like so many complex issues in in the heat that you're giving me racial profiling police brutality code switching and as you point out we're talking about a movie but talking about a book here but these are real life conversations that people are living in having all the time\nThat's the unfortunate part is that this will always be timely until it's not\nYeah it it is the conversation's happening in the book how closely does that parallel the conversation that are happening in your own life just with you and your friend\nI mean there's definitely an exhaustion is discussing it you know we we all have our own group chat like there's so many groups had said I mean we're will bring them up I'm just as\nOne and it's just like there's a feeling of hopelessness and I think this film in particular\nUm is about\nFinding your voice and that's also let's inspirational about like trying to figure out what you can do\nIt just the stars of sixteen years old in the heat that you do ... um she's seen a peace brutality death is as you said what is it about her the mixture so reliable as it makes so many people glom onto her\nShe's a teenager and I think we all remember during that time when you're just trying to fit in your try not to stand out you're just trying to also find out who you are you and start happens to be doing all those things and happens to lose her best friend to police violence imagine trying to figure out who you are and to find your voice\nWhen you you need it the most and um for me it would make\nStar labels that yeah I went to high school in the ... but also had an experience you know going to a private school and having to balance those personalities who agreed to press on it was like she has to be a certain way\nOr so she thinks of white people and gets to feel most comfortable and her skin with black people but also have to ... to a degree and um I think so many people of color have been there\nYeah because the code switching the code which are having to change what they say around different books with them yeah how you act yeah I I'm ... who is your character here that you're a\nHigh play April who um is a social justice lawyer and to help start to find her voice you know she's an activist she's an activist and she's tired and she needs and when\nThink about the heat you gave us ...\nHer and her friends she made it herself first and then she shopped around she made it herself and then waited for people to come to it and ... and I bet you can see a parallel there\nHundred percent I I feel like that's the model I think that's a model for so many black people for so many\nPeople to kind of creators like I've seen that that's kind of been the trend for getting people to notice you is like for salon Hollywood has been like this isn't this isn't going to be marketable difference is going to have an audience and\nBecause of the Internet because it's a media because the sort of this stuff fishing way we've been able to prove them wrong time and time again and so now\nThey're like clamoring for content from us\nAnd you're there to give it to him even though you may not use your real name next time I mean\nHe's not really nice to meet you nice to meet you too thank you for having me\nHe's raised a co creator and star of insecure where she stars as an essential which just wrapped up its third season on HBO you can catcher in the hate you gave which thing in some theaters now is going to open everywhere else on friday and I should say if\nYou wanna see the video of that conversation you can see it on her YouTube

to sleep is just shortly after the election and twenty sixteen and you could say things were a little bit turbulence in the political atmosphere maybe haven't gotten so less turbulence and um and\nAlmost tell myself that it's going to be okay but you know for all my just too big for boating writing the ... the antidote to that in a way well let's hear at this is from his new album more or less than making performing Justin here on key\n\nEvery arrow is track of a ...\n\nA go oh\nNo never [noise]\n... well there's just fear messing around a\n\nSo is this the one\nDo you go down to

were famous or their boats to buy a new a new um persona\nAnd I think it feels exactly what it feels like being a goes do kind of trapped in the world and you really have to die\nAnd I think that gives you a ... because dying to yourself\nIs just thought incredibly reliable and\nJust the young black you must perspective specifically you know you don't get to hear about you know there is Trayvon Martin's friend who is you know the the key witness and what she was going through and I think about Philando Castile fiance like\nThose are perspectives and and the grief that they have to endure for such a long period of time it's just you don't think about that size\nWell like I said there's so many complex issues in in the heat that you're giving the racial profiling police brutality code switching and as you point out we're talking about a movie but talking about a book here but these are real life conversations that people are living in having all the time\nThat's the unfortunate part is that this will always be timely until it's not\nYeah it it is the conversation happening in the book how closely does that parallel with conversation that are happening in your own life just with you and your friends\nI mean there's definitely an exhaustion of discussing it you know we we all have our own group chat like there's so many\nGroups has some men were will bring them up I'm just as like what do we do or what can we do or here's another one and it's just like there's a feeling of hopelessness and I think this film in particular\nUm is about\nFinding your voice and that's also let's inspirational about like trying to figure out what you can do\nIt just the stars is sixteen years old in the heat that you do ... um she's seen a ... brutality death is as you said what is it about her that makes her so reliable to make somebody people glom onto her\nShe's a teenager and I think we all remember during that time when you're just trying to\nFit in and try not to stand out you're just trying to also find out who you are here and start happens to be doing all those things and happens to lose her best friend to police violence for marriage and\nTrying to figure out who you are and to find your voice when you you need it the most and um\nFor me it won't make star labels that yeah I went to high school in the ... but also had an experience you know going to a private school and having to balance those personalities could agree the person is like she has to be a certain way\nOr so she thinks of white people and gets to feel most comfortable and her skin with black people but also have to ... to a degree and um I think so many people of color have been there\nYeah because the code switching the code for having to change what they say around different folks with them yeah and how you act yeah I Am ... well who's your character here that you're a\nHigh play April who um is a social justice lawyer and to help start to find her voice you know she's an activist she's an activist and she's tired and she needs and when\nTo think about the heat you gave it to end you Thomas who said she wasn't seeing stories being told that reflected her and her friends she made it herself first and then she shopped around she made it herself and then waited for people to come to it and I and I bet you can see a parallel there\nHundred percent I feel like that's the model I think that's a model for so many black people for so many people have cut the creators like I've seen that that's kind of been the trend for getting people to notice you is like for so long Hollywood has been like this isn't this was gonna be marketable this isn't going to have an audience and\nBecause of the Internet because of social media because the sort of the stuff's fishing way we've been able to prove them wrong time and time again\nAnd so now they're like clamoring for content from us\nAnd you're there to give it to him even though you may not use your real name next time I may not he's not really nice to meet you nice to meet you too thank you for having me\nHe's raised a co creator and star of insecure where she stars as an east which just wrapped up its third season on HBO catcher in the hate you gave which thing in some theaters now is going to open everywhere else on friday\nAnd I should say if you wanna see the video of that conversation you

looking out\nHouse to go to work becomes incredibly difficult but I think the guy in the studio with me right now could probably tell you it's it's an understatement that everything changes and when you're a musician who goes toward like say damn ... who's here with me work in leaving at nine and coming home at five\nIt's leaving at nine in October and coming home at five in November how well that can be a tough sacrifice for Dana having kids has also provided him with two new uses for his work\nHigh dam high low it's nice to have you here is so great to be back you're going to hear a bit of a preview of its brand new music some of his brand new perspective and you're going to do a another song what's it going to be\nYeah I'm going to do a psychologist fear what can you tell us about well it was written shortly after my second son Hayden was born and um\n[noise] you know in the ... hours rock and the baby to sleep there is just shortly after the election and twenty sixteen and\nYou could say things were a little bit turbulence in the political atmosphere maybe haven't gotten so less turbulence and um and I it was sort of a song I had to write for myself I must tell myself that it's going to be okay but uh you know for all my district foreboding writing is with the antidote to that in a way\nWell let's hear at this is from his new album more or less than making performing Justin here on [noise]\n\nEvery arrow is a uh [noise] we ...\nA go oh\nNo never [noise]\nReally really well there's just fear mess and read a\n\nSo is this food and\nDo you go down to

on a journey you know and I you know weird way of\nKind of come back to where I started a and a yet the album feels very ... of right now I'm ...\nIt's very different than your last record is for people who don't know your your your last record didn't\nNecessarily sound like they submitted the last record it was a larger band record is a little bit more experimental\nYeah was that a conscious moved to move away from that I think it was a sort of\nNatural moved to move I I the last record it was so important to me it was a labor of love it was like six months of my life just a day and they are working on it um and when I listen to it now um it's cold it doesn't feel like an embrace you know it feels almost academic feels a little bit um\nJarring and at the time that was that was very intentional life in in that moment to recorded and twenty fourteen [noise] um I think a lot of sort of the things that are now arisen were on the horizon and I and I wasn't the only person writing about it but um [noise]\nYou know I think at the time those those songs were for boating and so that are in a way this is the antidote at the antidote is is that this record is much more warm because I think that's what I Want to see more of in the world\nWe we don't have to spend too much time in his but I Know you also told our producer that you found the reaction to the last record kind of hard\nYeah it was interesting because I felt like I had a taken a risk you know and gone and done what I felt like was the most artistically challenging or the most sort of experimental record\nAnd it was interesting how you know we had some great reviews and stuff but I I think it was also where I was at in my head and I was I was lost in kid land and you know buried in a sex jumping head first into a swimming pool when you have kids and it's like nothing feels the same and I", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "Nashville", "day": "17"}
