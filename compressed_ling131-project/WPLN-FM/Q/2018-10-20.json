I don't know how that happened really so um we\nHad we we found ourselves basically the first conversation which we both thought was going to be very awkward about okay so how do we how do we know about this how do we first start discussing this without stepping on somebody else's tell us and blah blah blah but\nWe both stayed at each other at the end of the first conversation was like wow we completely agree where where this is\nGoing to go and how this is going to play out and how we want to shape these characters so I wouldn't say it was hard at all it's it it just it just happened so effortlessly and smoothly\nI'm unlike micro said before if there was anything it was just okay let's see how we can make this better but it was thinking as one and not as two separate people anywhere that's that's I think how we both felt about it\nThis game a Sesame Street out to see whether I kind of wanted to be a jerk or whether I wanted to be a hero like\nMichael would have liked to essentially have to develop a character sort of two characters at once you have to develop a character with Merce multiple personalities who knew it was neat 'cause I think there was a grounding I had to find for elections myself like okay who would he be for me and what kind of choice path\nI sort of hanging on hand um for me is ... ... ... I was ... probably a bit more of the nicer guy uh who who you don't mess with the ... when his wife or the people he cares about is that he will destroy\nBut [laughter] but ... overall that's to me it was a nicer approaches but it then I'm like okay but that's not what some people will choose so you had to really step out of that idea whenever there was those choice wheels and and go for some really hard\nDecisions that you wouldn't necessarily want to make we have to so yeah those days were hard there were some really challenging scenes that we had to do face um you know with certain family members with certain people in our lives have cared about how we approach them and what we did\nAnd that is a bit of a a mind trip to have to be like okay I went from this happy choice to this super aggressive I'm going to kill your choice and those are really different ... um and sometimes you have to do it on a dime 'cause you're in a voice bruised and you have so many lines you have to get through the day and\nYou're like but I Want it to feel authentic so you've you've just got to try and take the time to get there\nI'd be remiss if I didn't mentioned this there's no doubt that the the video game roast is traditionally so male dominated ... characters or even in a assassins creed you know Cassandra is one of only a couple of female leads and eleven major releases from the series marathon day do you feel like you're breaking some ground here\nOh man absolutely I mean the fact that the response that I've been getting and the fact that they've been so many young girls that have reached out\nSaying you know um we look up to you and you know we feel that we have a voice now in this world are that way it's been it's amazing to be given the option to play as a woman\nIt's just I think the biggest gift especially for me but I don't I don't I don't know if I Would say I was doing something particularly groundbreaking but I think the company definitely is and it's given the opportunity for for ... gamers out there to have a voice\nLike if you play the game [noise] ah I've only played a little bit of it so far minds in the mail that's on its way is it freaky to play a game that you're in it's\nIt is funny it is really you know it's the owner knows which are like the sounds we make like the federal and all that kind of I I really laugh at all those\nGestures and and hearing yourself I'm doing certain\nThings in these fights and yeah it is a fascinating thing I'm looking at you right now and I liken this to forgive him for his saga because I'd be head of the guy with you last\nNight and be a guy last have on my couch [laughter]\n...

assume people were fighting but it turns out it was it was the opposite of that yeah no you know and that's a cool thing about these these ... do you put them out of the world and you don't know exactly where they'll end up and you know we have some songs that have ended up in sports montage is\nIn other songs that are part of part of a political rallies and then there's some songs that end up on people's weddings so they got that ring in your pocket this might be the time yeah maybe what was it was the authorities are killed are forming shall we don't tell me on cue\n[noise]\n\nA buck and like I was like how do I do this and not do it like you know I'll be back in the bucket and just saying just simple lines that are just so\nKnown in the world and finding different ways I'm not going there um and we'd have to do weird funny lines like where you're out in a boat going out into the middle of the the sea and you'll be going too far in this incident she'd be like oh maybe on going too far off the ship my\nSize and you're like yourself talking as as you're going out there so the audience knew what was happening but it's funny to try and be honest and self talk about what's happening over there is a storm coming I should totally bucket of this kind of stuff so that was\nThere was really funny things had to do that you'd never really have to do it any other situation\nIf you're just tuning in speaking with Michael at the ... and a matter of fact the ... the two stars of the new massive videogame assassins creed odyssey that\nI just it's kind of everywhere right now and and Michael matter of fact the creative to separate characters but each character goes through in the almost the exact same stories we were saying it's it's pretty much the same thing here's an audio example of you speaking the same dialogue to a character named Marcos\nI was what do you think this site blob since he's come to find you I think they need you hot I Wish he would have told me that before they hit me\nThat's beside the point you want the vineyard Michael ...\nI Wish you would have told me that before they hit me\nBut that's beside the point you wanted your Marcos\nSo that's the to be reading essentially the same lines as an actor how do you create a character alongside another actor who is essentially mirroring this same performance\nWell basically because I think what works so well I'm In a very serendipitous sort of way or maybe not was the fact that\nUm the they\nYou'd be soft did such a great job with um casting Michael and I and I and I mean that in in the best possible way and I [noise]\nThey found to people that also seem to have a very similar approach to what they hadn't visions as Cassandra like seals I don't know how that happened really so\nUm we had we we found ourselves basically the first conversation which we both thought was going to be very awkward about okay so how do we had was about this how do we first start discussing this without stepping on somebody else's tell us and blah blah blah but\nWe both stayed at each other at the end of the first conversation was like wow we completely agree where it where this is going to go and\nCharacters so I wouldn't say it was hard at all it's it it just it just happened so effortlessly and smoothly I'm unlike micro said before if there was anything it was just okay let's see how we can make this better but it was thinking as one and not as two separate people anyway that's that's I think how we both felt about it\nWhat what about the idea that I that you can choose within your character in this game a Sesame Street out to see\nWhether I kind of wanted to be a jerk or whether I wanted to be a hero like\nMichael would have liked to essentially have to develop a character sort of two characters at once you have to develop a character with Merce multiple personalities who it was neat 'cause I think there was a grounding I had to find for lectures myself like okay who would he be for me and what kind of choice password I sort of hanging on hand\nUm for me is a ... which is probably a bit more of the nicer guy who who you don't mess with the ... when his wife or the people he cares about 'cause then he will destroy a\nWider but ... overall that's to me it was the nicer approaches but it then I'm like okay but that's not what some people will choose so you have to really step out of that idea whenever there was those choice wheels and and go for some really hard decisions that\nYou wouldn't necessarily want to make but you have to so\nYeah those days were hard there were some really challenging scenes that we had to do face um you know with certain family members with certain people in our lives have cared about how we approach them and what we did\nAnd that is a bit of a a mind trip to have to be like okay I went from this happy choice to this super aggressive I'm going to kill your choice and those are really different ... um and sometimes you have to do it on a dime because you're in a voice bruised and you have so many lines have to get through the day and\nYou're like but I Want it to feel authentic so you've you've just got to try and take the time to get there\nI'd be remiss if I didn't mentioned this there's no doubt that the the video game roast is traditionally so male dominated ... characters or even a assassins creed you know Cassandra is one of only a couple of female leads and eleven major releases from the series mess on the do you feel like you're breaking some ground here\nOh man absolutely I mean the fact that the the response that I've been getting and the fact that they've been so many young girls that have reached out saying you know um we look up to you and you know we feel that we have a voice now in this world are that way it's been it's amazing to be given the option\nTo play as a woman\nIt's just I think that the biggest gift especially for me but I don't I don't I don't know if I Would say I was doing something particularly groundbreaking but I think the company definitely is and it's given the opportunity for for girls gamers out there to have a voice\nMichael have you played the game [noise] ah I've only played a little bit of it so far minds in the mail that's on its way is it freaky to play a game that you're in\nIt's it is funny it is really you know it's ... the owner knows which are like the sounds we make like the federal and all that kind of I I really laugh it at all those gestures and\nAnd hearing yourself I'm doing\nCertain things in these fights and yeah it is a fascinating thing I'm looking at you right now and I'm and I'm like if you forgive him for so long and they give\nI'd be head of the guy with you left lane be added a guy last have on my couch [laughter]\n[laughter] but you know what if it is an odd must be an outfielder\nIt is it's it is fascinating and when I was playing and I actually fell out of it and I just kinda got into it and then you keep looking back you know like oh that's\nMe [laughter] [laughter] yeah but you have you had a chance to play as yourself you\nKnow but I watched a lot of the same lines in the mail a I have watched a lot of game play and it man is very strange I ... I find it very bizarre and I especially again I say like all the ...\nMy personal worst was um pretend to be on fire which I think a completely failed at doing [noise] um you can make you made it a little sample it pertains to be on fire [laughter]\nFired [laughter] some of its stomach [laughter] yelling fire extinguisher [laughter]\nWell I I got to tell you I think so much for coming in and I just loved playing the game and it's such a trip I don't think I've ever met anyone in the video game I played before\nOh cool well You're welcome else could congratulations to you thank you thank you ma'am I don't mind [noise]\nOn the ... and Michael add to knock those are the lead actors and assassins creed odyssey one of the biggest video games in the world right now you can play the game right now it's available through it'll be soft on\nX. box PlayStation and PC I'm Tom power time for one last song as you're looking ahead to the weekend you know and this weekend you know maybe sometimes it's three am you're on vacation or you don't have to work the next day\nAnd you're having a little bit of a party four or five of your friends are over and you turn up the music a little too loudly\nFor the hour that it is right you forget that it's later than you think it is and yeah and you mess up and people complain they might filing noise complaint on you they might threaten to kick you out of the air being be that you're saying\nBut at least you hope that the music that people complain about the music that gets called on you in the least bad as music you know but for me and the host of radio two mornings random Doris or CBC Music mornings rented or is\nIt was playing bare naked ladies too loud that almost got kicked out of an era being be in Los Angeles three years ago\nThat's not the only anniversary that's on my mind today also Twenty years ago this week that same song that almost got us kicked out of the United states topped the billboard charts and it would end up being ... ladies only number one single in the U.S\nEat spam it's\nBad enough [noise] [noise] [noise]\nLet me ask you\nMight remember the last time ... ladies performed one week with Stephen pages just earlier this year at the Juno's you can still go back and watch that you'll find it at CBC Music for you to page had to YouTube dot com slash CBC Music and search for bare naked ladies that song one week top the billboard hot one hundred exactly Twenty years ago\nThis week I'm Tom power more keep coming up right after this\nOur name maybe Nashville public radio but\nTo be a dependable news department these days it means Republican end up stories and breaking news on our website and on social media and we take photos sometimes videos and we share stats maps and public records\nIt all lives on our website W peel N. dot org and that's where you should visit this week to see all that we've got to give what you can to our fault pledge drive your support makes it possible", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "20"}
