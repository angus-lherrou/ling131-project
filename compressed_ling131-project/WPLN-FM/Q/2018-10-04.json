for more than six decades David Attenborough has been one of the voices guiding you do the natural world his story telling us help bring that wide wide world right into your home\nThis year marks the ... anniversary of his groundbreaking series life on earth and to celebrate the book that accompanied that program is being re published and updated\nSir David Attenborough joins me now live from the BBC in London to tell you more about it so David welcome to Q. thank you very much ... I read that when you joined the b._b._c. is a trainee in the early fifties you had very little experience of it you'd you'd barely watched it is that right\nWell nobody really I mean not just fifty two uh the number of people you couldn't see TV and in London you couldn't see anywhere else in the country are\nOn the number of people who have sets are numbered in in a few thousand\nIf that uh so uh how'd the end it but he had seen television and the cameras using and the students are using were the ones which provided the first television public service in the ... so and we were still using them and they started in Nineteen thirty age I think that it's shakes lead to shake\nSo what was the potential you solve for nature and television programming\nUm well I'm the\nAnybody done any programs about anything really I mean except um but with the cooking and knitting and politics I'm I'm quiz shows and gardening but ... is\nBut they actually going out into the wild uh wasn't what TV did um television I hadn't in these job speaking out of the BBC in London\nOr we didn't have the money to the fast or go to Africa let alone the cost of making films television or was it an offspring of radio on the people around radio said most of the money is ours I Will just give you a little bit don't spend too much of it is the same time I knew something you don't spend it on after I was\nSo it wasn't until I I've been in in the business for a couple of years and I managed to persuade people to let me take a film camera to Africa\nOne of the first show that he did was zoo quest you travel around the world filming London Zoo staff getting animals for the zoo we have a clip from that show from Nineteen fifty six when you were in Indonesia\nOne man says that's when he had been in the last few days ago he had seen a very large snake in one of the tree maybe he said it's still\nSure enough we found it [noise]\n\nIt looked a little ... I was ... or does it cause I'm tied to Nestle non poisonous which was something of a relief\nOh look at it enjoy it and then you can say a ... and we are causing huge problems to this\nBut you're defeated the other way around you you can't do a whole program which is spending all your time saying this is ... at least you can't do it very often\nAnd if you got a week to show a which uh some of our programs are them for seven weeks on Sunday summonses is Thirteen you can't say every every week it's a disaster catastrophe you have to\nTime he'll punches are you hopeful for the future of the planet\nI'm actually I'm more hopeful than I was\nAbout ten years ago really um I well I I I couldn't see the disasters were overwhelming or an increasing number and I I couldn't see any way out of it and I couldn't see any beams hope\nBut actually the the whole issue has become global in the last ten years now I mean China for example which used to be I'm pulling up pulling fumes into the atmosphere\nChina has realized that they can't go on this way China's done something about getting it smokers fuel projects going\nSo that I'm ... and and all around the world I'm a people I Begin to realize that they have a responsibility not only about the atmosphere but of all the oceans are so things are moving and we have after all stopped a fellow hunting wells which was\nOf fifty years ago it was a major major problem that's just in case but that's not to minimize the disasters as a looming I mean what what's happening to the seizes is catastrophe\nAnd how are we going to fix that international it because it has to be not internationally I don't know but at least more people are aware of what the problem is the ... and eventually I just hoping that as it were people power is going to make the politicians take take notice of what has to be\nSo David you know when you when you look back at at everything you've done so far is there one is there one moment something you've seen that really sticks with you\nOn that there are lots I mean the the gorillas as I'm but I'm never allowed to forget the ... and I'm very mundane pumped about them because that was the most wonderful moment\nBut also one of the most moments subjectively a memorable as long as I'm concerned was the first time I put her on scuba gear and dived a on a coral reef a and that was in Nineteen fifty five um and then you are surrounded by\nA hundred or two hundred three hundred organisms you've never seen a lot of calls and your life\nThey are incredible beauty extraordinary things you never knew existed there's no idea what kind of things now that's on the reef and and most of them all the animals are not frightened of you and they swim all around you that is a breathtaking my ... never forget\nAnd it's one of the great trash is is a coral reefs are on the way out unless something really extraordinary happens and the nations of the world really do manage to get together to do something about marine pollution and about a I'm a study pollution and temperature rise things\nAnd they are crucial to the life of the oceans because there are the ... is a vast numbers of species of oceanic fish let's learn coastal fish\nAnd the salt that we might the my grandchildren and all my great grandchildren ... might not see them is is a deeply ... tragic one\nSo David Attenborough thanks

called ... my uh and my and it does not hold back as it tries to reveal what drives her as a person and as an artist so much so\nThat even MIA the subject of the documentary\nWas shocked by what she saw on screen\nWhat I thought it was going to be like to live you know back and kind of the book duck concert and\nYeah yeah because because I I just connected so much footage and so much happening around the album way you know we were constantly getting in trouble and I was just getting like you know getting into trouble because it was covering subjects that when people were ready to talk about and then it was you know it was like\nA imitating life in life in a tank uh and then everybody was like this to me and I find setting and and I really wanted to explain\nSomething you know because that that was such a you know that's when like the media really went for me you know and paint ... today one head off me and I never really got to say my side of it ... and and really that's that's what I Want it to clear up his that\nEra is music\nAnd the work that went into it\nHow did you actually feel when you were in the theater and\nYou saw the first time the first time it was really like

the first time in ... cigarette and it sounds like the taste is terrible it was like discussing why you making watch this so\nI think that that was quite funny but I was sort of in shock the second time I saw it then I found it way more than I should know\nMan it's so it's so\nI Know this is an overuse were especially by people who have either so personal like that so yes and it's it has to be hard because you did in film this stuff with the national people's you know\nThat's that's what's which you know me and my friends still a damning free that right now because sometimes I wake up and go oh my God that's so personal but at the same time like if you even look at my immigration\nIssue right here today and I'm a pop star and I still have to go through that you know and you kind of like you\nHave to think about how many people go free these kind of things that don't have money and you don't ... I can ... I have enough money to fill it out and I still can't too you know but if you think about all these sort of ... kind of confusing things that\nPeople are upset about me that all adds up to how people perceive you and then if it goes you know adds up to\nYour you know what you are you a CD and how much you can move and you know\nThen it was kind of talking about it I think there was there was there was stuff I hadn't seen before I'm going to play a clip from the doctors to take a listen to this\nWhich does so who's who I Know her she says is the way\nYou know all of\nTo do not have been yeah sounds then you have food and they said that when you're when when you when you\nSay that I can I can get back [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] Mm\n[noise]\nMm [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nMy cue on CBC Radio one serious ex him one sixty nine ... or public radio international my name is Tom power so more than a few\nPeople have found themselves at the mercy of Marc Rich if you've seen Canada's longest running TV comedy this hour has twenty two minutes they know what I mean for more than a decade mark has amused confused angered celebrities and politicians here he is just last week with Maxine burned you\nKnow you tweeted more diversity will destroy what makes Canada great and you said too much diversity will divide us into little tribes now I Know you're a nickname is Mad Max\nBut max you're starting to sound as racist that Mel Gibson no wonder they call you Mad Max you want less diversity to your health care while you're just bad hockey and make it a party that nobody in the country will go for it [laughter]\nSo ... Michael Douglas ever levine Hillary Clinton former prime minister Paul Martin even me\nYes you I'm Sorry my friend my old friend I have to give you credit that you always send me a picture of you dressed up as me I Want to give you a warning does coming [laughter] and\nUh you know your your our generation ... you know like I have to make fun but it's interesting to think that when the show started Rick Mercer the biggest the first big get they got who was a celebrity actually did a show with Peter's asking right who gave them a lot of support\nOr and so I felt it was important to keep the ties between CBC Radio and uh our show by mocking yeah of course I've really you know what the country that order a Canada market\nThe new book is called son of a Crichton childish new memoir it's hilarious it's it's also like heartbreaking it's beautiful mark joins me in Studio now to tell you about a\nHigh buddy how's it going very good it's interesting to have this book out because in my eye when writing it you're just alone you know and you're typing typing away and you're all in your own head and then last night we had this first kind of an event where\nThese lovely folks in the book club came and they sort of asked me questions about the book and my initial reaction was well how'd you do that and I realized oh wait I published\nActing to it in the world well let's see I was when I tell you were putting out a book you would have been forgiven for putting out a book about your exploits about you know by by you know everything you've done twenty to everything you did before that but you told them really personal stories here well why does the impetus of that when he started going down through\nThe the the story of of your childhood I guess I guess is pretty reflective and I think there is like a it's a it's a natural thing is to censor yourself and going on I could put that into our shouldn't say that I as a certain point I just decided okay I'm not going to do that I'm gonna I'm gonna write watch what I Want to write what I feel like I should write well I'm drawn to write\nAnd some of that was funny and some of that was sad and and uh and all came together or hopefully in a way that's enjoyable\nOne of my favorite characters in the book is your mom or this is one of my favorite quotes you write she drove a car or the way someone might fire a starter pistol for the first time eyes closed and facing away\nYeah my mom would go in there kind of like back in the seventies it's evil Knievel being strapped in\nAnd it's like a shot across the grand K but she would often accelerate and close our eyes and get into I remember once we're in driving down came I wrote which is the major highway in St john's and moms say oh that was in the wrong lane I was like no we're not wearing the bank and then we'll come back ...\nMount these car and he was happy driving like that and just coming to and looking back at that I don't think that was weird well I think was that they just at the end those stages as advocates knocked out we'll put them in the backseat until he wakes up like there was no different kind of new Finland childcare or he'll be alright shake it up\nAnd you didn't you talk about going to school thinks races up Monday pond which I really should not be so colloquial about you were in St traces which is a school in the east and the St John yeah a Catholic school and area we we know is Monday pond yeah a beautiful part of town a bit of a hard part of\nTown it was harder than and it was you know kind of a I guess you'd call it tough school like you know like one of those places that don't go up around ... they'll get you kind of a thing but that's kinda more\nGenerational going back to has a reputation everybody was there was lovely but I mean kids who went to school there many of them had been in fights and stuff like that and I had never been around children really because we lived\nFar away from the center city next to a radio station where my where my dad worked and he was sort of the emergency go to guy uh so we had to live next to the station in case a DJ fell asleep during the night or a translator with that\nSo there were no other kids around so I went to school it was my first kind of interaction with other kids so I'd be sitting there ... and then they could smell the fear in me you know so that was overwhelming\nYou were bullied and the most new Finland nerd kind of way which they stole your Pepsi oh yeah not Koch now you're happy yeah ships yeah and your cello\nYes the nuns maybe played cello because I was the huskies child and they're like we think you could live to ... which is you know as all great maestro are chosen by the instruments and you know whether the people with avian bone syndrome a hollow bones they they play whistles and blue and then the husky our children are given cello\nAnd uh yeah so these guys there was a family of them like everybody was like as long as places where like all the school and my brothers are coming before cell phones but somehow at three o'clock\nSeven brothers of varying ages who look just like the guy the weight like a hard you'll shoved my broader at race that's grown mad about what we're going to fight that we don't have children and so these guys stole my cello which is like\nI've never even got to be ... like what are you going to do with the cello was like there's a big guitars and you don't even know what it is you're stealing and yeah that I had to get my cello back so that was a a that was a [noise]\nIt's it's hard to feel tough after cellist inject but it led to a really\nBeautiful moment it led to a moment of great empathy so you go to the bullies house yeah\nGo to his house and the cello had been hidden his backyard\nAnd we had to get there and his father was kind of passed out\nAsleep watching wrestling shirtless or without some cans of beer around and you know that great new freelance version of a thinker and we went down to the back yard and and I find my cello and I'm looking at my job back to the house and I was like I had to call my parents and he's like you can't you can't you can't do that you wake him up and I'm like ...

the other way around you you can't do a whole program which is spending all your time saying this is ... at least you can't do it very often\nAnd if you go to ... to show a which uh some of our programs on them for seven weeks on Sunday summonses is Thirteen you come say every every week it's a disaster such catastrophe you have to time meal punches\nAre you hopeful for the future of the planet\nI'm actually I'm more hopeful than I was\nAbout ten years ago really um I well I I I couldn't see the the disasters are overwhelming or an increasing number and I I couldn't see any way out of it and I couldn't see any beams hope\nBut actually the the whole issue has become global in the last ten years now I mean China for example which used to be I'm pulling up pulling fumes into the atmosphere\nChina has realized that they can't go on this way China's um something about getting it smoked as fuel projects going\nSo that I'm ... and and all around the world I'm a people are beginning to realize that they have a responsibility not only about the atmosphere but of all the oceans\nAre some things are moving and we have after all stopped a sort of hunting wells which was\nOf fifty years ago was a major major problem that doesn't get but that's not to minimize the disasters as a looming I mean what what's happening to the seizes is catastrophe and how are we going to fix that international because it has to be not internationally\nI don't know but at least more people are aware of what the problem is the ... and eventually I just hoping that as it were people power is going to make the politicians take take notice of what has to be\nSo David you know when you when you look back at at everything you've done so far is there one is there one moment something you've seen that really sticks with you\nOn that there are lots I mean the the gorillas as I'm but I'm never allowed to forget it doesn't but I'm but if you don't mind being pumped about them because that was the most wonderful moment\nBut also one of the most moments subjectively of that as memorable as long as I'm concerned was the first time I put her on scuba gear and dived a on a coral reef a and that was in Nineteen fifty five um and then you are surrounded by\nA hundred or two hundred three hundred organisms you've never seen a lot of your life\nThey are incredible beauty extraordinary things you never knew existed there's no idea what kind of things out that's on the reef and I'm not smart animals are not frightened of you and they swim all around you that is a breathtaking moment\nGreat tragedies is a coral reefs are on the way out unless something really extraordinary happens and the nation's world really do manage to get together to do something about marine pollution and about a study pollution and don't temperature Raj things\nAnd they are crucial to the lives of the oceans because now the ... is a bus numbers of species of oceanic fish let's learn coach to fish\nAnd the salt to remind my grandchildren know my great grandchildren lose any rate might not see them as is a deeply tragic one\nSo David Attenborough thanks so much for talking to us today thank you David Attenborough groundbreaking matrix series life on earth celebrates its fortieth anniversary this year to market that an updated version of the book that accompany the series is being released October sixteenth David Attenborough joined us live from the BBC in London\n\nKnow [laughter] Mm [laughter]\n[noise]\nMhm [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\nWhat a thing to have you on CBC Radio one theory is going to be nine and for our eyes that a public radio international I Tom power\nThan my\nMy\nThat is paper planes from I don't know if you remember when that sun came out back in two thousand seven but it was everywhere it launched in my age into worldwide started asking my age will tell you that she was seeking out that famous for a long time first as an aspiring filmmaker then use issue\nWhich will always be the first one to admit that once she arrived under the ... that not everything went as expected you can see a lot of that journey in the new documentary about her that's out this week\nIt's called ... and my and it does not call back as it tries to reveal what drives her as a person\nAnd as an artist so much so that even at my age the subject of the documentary\nWas shocked by what she saw on the screen\nI thought it was going to be like to live you know and\nKind of the box duck concert in energy a advocates\nBecause I I just connected so much for his age and so much happening right now than when I you know we were constantly getting in trouble and I was just getting like you know getting into trouble because it was covering subjects that when people were ready to talk about and then it was you know it was like\nA in a tank knife and hang up\nAnd ... and and I really wanted to explain\nSomething you know because that that was such a you know that's when like the media really went for me you know and paint ... today one head off me and I never really got to say my side of it ... and and really that's that's what I Want it to clear up his\nThat era of music and\nThe work that went into it how did you actually feel when you were in the theater and you saw for the first time\nThe first time it was really like uh\n\nMy kid was there and he he he fell asleep\nSo then it was kinda like very confusing thing you know to like what chip for his eyes and and\nWere you were happy that he fell asleep I was kind of happy because as soon as he had me sweat the first time in ... cigarette and it sounds like it was like discussing why am I going to watch this so\nI think that that was quite funny but I was sort of in shock the second time I saw it then I found it way more national\nMan if if it was old or so\nI Know there was an overuse were especially by people who have either so personal like so yes and it's it has to be hard because you didn't film this stuff with the passionate people seeing that\nThat's that's what's which you know me and my friends still going free that right now because sometimes I wake up and go oh my God that's so personal but at the same time like if you even look at my immigration issue\nRight here today\nAnd I'm a pop star and I still\nHave to go through that you know and you kind of like you have to think about how many\nPeople go free these kind of things that don't have money and you don't ... I can ... I have enough money to fill it out and I still con too you know but if you think about all of these sort of ... kind of confusing things that\nPeople have said about me that all adds up to how people perceive you and then if it goes you know adds up to\nYour you know what you are you a CD and how much you can move and you know then it was kind of talking about it I think\nThere was there was stuff I hadn't seen before I was going to play a clip from the doctors to take a listen to ...\nWhich is which does who's who I Know her she says is the way\nYou know all of whom do they\nGet to be honest I may not have been sounding the painful and they said they didn't have that kind of when you're when\nWhen you went\nBack and I I don't think you\n\nKnow [laughter] Mm Mm\n[laughter]\nMm [laughter] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nBut it wasn't like a cue on CBC Radio one serious ... sixty nine asked some PR I or public radio international my name is Tom power so more than a few people have found themselves at\nThe mercy of Marc Rich if you've seen Canada's longest running TV comedy this hour has twenty two minutes they know what I mean for more than a decade mark has amused confused angered celebrities and politicians here is just last week with Mexican burned you\nKnow you tweeted more diversity will destroy what makes Canada great and you said too much diversity will divide us into little tried now I Know you're a nickname\nIs Mad Max but max you're starting to sound as racist that Mel Gibson no wonder they call you Mad Max you want less diversity to your health care while you're just bad hockey and make it a party that nobody in the country will do for [laughter]\nSo I'm actually burn the Michael Douglas ... Hillary Clinton former prime minister Paul Martin even me yes you I'm Sorry my friend my old friend I have to give you credit that you always send me a picture of you dressed up as me I Want to give you a warning those comics [laughter]\nUh you know your your our generation ... you know like I have to make fun but it's interesting 'cause they go in the show started Rick Mercer the biggest the first big get they got was a celebrity actually did a show with Peter's asking right\nAnd so I felt it was important to keep the ties between CBC Radio and uh our show by mocking\nYou yeah of course I've really you know one of the country that order Canada\nMarket the new book is called son of a ... a child his new memoir it's hilarious it's it's also like heartbreaking it's beautiful mark joins me in Studio ... tell you about it high high buddy how's it going very good it's interesting to have this\nBook out because in my eye when writing it you're just alone you know and you're typing typing away and you're all in your own head and then last night we had this first kind of an event where\nThese lovely folks in the book club came and they sort of asked me questions about the book and my initial reaction was well how'd you do that and I realized oh wait I published I so yeah so it's interesting to see how people are reacting to it in the world\nWell let's say I was when I tell you were putting out a book you would have been forgiven for putting out a book about your exploits about you know about you know everything you've done a twenty to everything you did before that but you told them really personal stories here well why was the impetus to that\nWhen he started going down through the the the story of of your childhood I guess I guess is pretty reflective and I think there was like a it's a it's a natural thing it's a censor yourself\nAnd going on I could put that into shouldn't say that I as a certain point I just decided okay I'm not going to do that I'm gonna I'm gonna write watch what I wanted to write what I feel like I should write why I'm drawn to write\nAnd some of that was funny and some of that was sad and and uh it all came together or hopefully in a way that's enjoyable\nOne of my favorite characters in the book is your mom or this is one of my favorite quotes you write she drove a car or the way someone might fire a starter pistol for the first time I closed and facing away\nYeah my mom would go in there kind of like back in the seventies it's evil Knievel being strapped in I was like a shot across the ... but she would often accelerate and close your eyes and get into I remember once we're in driving out came I wrote to the big major highway in St john's\nAnd moms say oh that was in the wrong lane I was like no we're not wearing the bank and then we'll come into the back passed out of a of a mountain these car and he was happy driving back and\nJust coming to and looking back at that I don't think that was weird well I think it was just at the end those days as as advocates knocked out we'll put them in the backseat till he wakes up like there was no different kind of knew for land childcare or he'll be All right shake it off\nAnd you didn't you talking about go go into school thinks races up Monday pond which I really should not be so colloquial about you were in St traces which is a school in the east and the St John yeah Affleck school an area we we know is Monday pond yeah a beautiful part of town a bit of a hard part of town\nIt was harder than it was you know kind of a I guess you'd call a tough school like you know like one of those places that don't go up around their dollar the clouds Monday bond they'll get you kind of a thing but that's kinda more generational going back to have a reputation everybody whether there was a lovely but\nI mean kids who went to school there many of them had been in fights and stuff like that and I had never been around children really because we lived\nFar away from the center city next to a radio station where my where my dad worked and he was sort of the emergency go to guy uh so we had to live next to the station in case a DJ fell asleep during the night or a translator with that so there were no other kids around so I went to school\nIt was my first kind of interaction with other kids so I'd be sitting there ... and then they could smell the fear in me you know so that was overwhelming\nYou were bullied and the most new Finland nerd kind of way in which they stole your Pepsi oh yeah not coke no your identity yeah ships yeah and your cello\nYes the nuns maybe played cello because I was the huskies child and they're like we think you'll could lift the ... which is you know as all great maestro are chosen by the instruments and you know the the the people with avian bones syndrome hollow bones they they play whistles and blue and then the husky our children are given cello and uh yeah so these guys there was a family of them like everybody\nAnd my brothers are coming before cell phones but somehow at three o'clock\nSeven brothers of varying ages who look just like to be weightless Hercules shoved my broader at race that's grown now we're going to fight that we don't have children and so these guys stole my cello which is like\nI was going to be ... for a ... what are you going to do with the ... there's a big guitars and you don't even know what it is you're stealing and yeah that I had to get my cello back so that was a a that was a [noise]\nIt's it's hard to feel tough after cellist inject\nBut it led to a really beautiful moment it led to a moment of at least great empathy so you'd go to the bullies house yeah go to his house\nAnd the cello had been hidden his backyard\nAnd um so we're going through the house and and we had to get there and his father was kind of passed out asleep watching wrestling shirtless or without some cans of beer around and you know that great new freelance version of the thinker and we went down to the back yard and and I find my cello\nAnd I'm looking at my cello back to the house and I was like I had to call my parents and it's like you can't you can't you can't do that you wake him up and I'm like ... I'll be quiet and then it's like uh I I call home and I'm like Oh hi and as he wakes up and things like you are what are your own and our stealing our phone and kind of like\nIf there was no desktop me money it's a local God I don't know how the system works and it got\nReally and and then he he ah hit my friend and and we made a break for it and then you kind of realize like oh I see while you're like yeah I I see while you're ... you're ... you're paying for it and then after that you know we became you know kind of close friends and uh and he's kind of protected me a bit yeah\nThis is a great story of new land is going to get things stolen from there but some of my favorites my brother told me about his buddy who got his dog stolen from his backyard one time and he went down to his house knocked on the door and said excuse me I think it's still my dog and the buddies father when no no I didn't steal your dog and he saw the dog in the back in the kitchen\nTable and really yeah I I got I was going out with a lady and a malamute was stolen and and and then they almost our dog was stolen and the guy called said he wants money for it and this is the name I gave his name and phone number yeah and I was like [noise]\nI Know him and then I had to go to his house and I knocked and everybody was walking to was a guy who got docked stolen ... down there and I was like okay yeah so I go in there and the opens the door like\nHigh there and he's like Ohio and we went to school together and eat a dog and the dog's name was ... notice no dog hair and I said\nHere Scott Scott Scott Scott and the\nDog came running will just keep this between ourselves and her parents thought I was connected to the underbelly of dog thievery and I we had to break up\nI just assumed you were if you're just tuning in with a ... that's why you're here last week we mark Critz you probably have a seen him on December twenty two minutes he just released a new book all about his own life as son of a crutch a childish new Finland memoir\nUm I thought you open the book by explaining that new Finland is can lay claim to almost anyone as a fellow new Finland are gene Simmons\nIs from New Finland that make the James girlfriends from Newfoundland is neutral enemies cases a new plan banned exactly I mean this is all the time people new lenders right into this show and saying languages that you were talking David Attenborough one time he showed a a puffing Athens or new plan so he's kind of a new lender", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "04"}
