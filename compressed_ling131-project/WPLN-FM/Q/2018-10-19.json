about that kind of genius Charlie Gonzalez aspires to be\nChico marks was probably the first non stuck up a pianist I ever saw [laughter] you know my grandfather was all about respect for the visitor yeah he was introducing me to classical music\nAnd then when I thought she marks play the piano and I think it's a night of the opera even forms on the ship and I thought here's a musician who respects the audience I asked the composer\nSo what specifically can we listen for that you incorporated you go into this piece\nWould just say it's the the playful nature of the shifting temp pose a that is\nOut the entertainment value of of musical storytelling I think that's one thing that I I can remember when I was watching that sequence\nThere's a lot of sort of false virtual city when I say false ... means that he's he's playing quickly in a way that seems\nQuite technically accomplished but it's all in service of of the the playfulness when you're a composer performer you write music

that's the way of sort of getting around the IDF and Maya good pianists or not I'm a good pianists when I'm writing for myself and I think that's what\nTranslates to uh what ... did when he was being

any other instrument do that I mean perhaps the guitar in some way and it's portable that's a nice advantage but truly it's perhaps the piano that has that atomic level of music and Dana plays alone and you're covering all the bases of what music is supposed to be melody harmony rhythm and sounds\nSo but when you when you're composing is that's satisfying I only ask because I didn't know in your in your composition whether it be and can do everything you wanted to do\nI don't think in terms of being a pianist I'm a musician who happens to play the piano the piano is this atomic level of instrument that means that if I Want to conceive\nOf complete music the piano is just the easiest way to do it my best teachers when I was growing up were guitarists drummers they taught me about music how to tell a story through court progression how to leave space what is it to tickle the ear of the listener these are all skills\nThat if you are stuck too much and you're instrumental identity\nYou'll never learned and I think it's dangerous I think for musicians to get to cut up and their instrumental identity\nAnd yes there is different you know parts of the body that are engaged for different instruments and every instruments list has his or her own map of music viewed through the prism of that instrument\nBut these twelve notes here in all of western music from classical through to today's pop music needs twelve notes have still reigned Supreme you know you walk into a studio where they make rap music you're going to see some some drum machines but you will definitely see a synthesizer which has these twelve notes of the piano\nJust rendered on you know the keys are made of plastic and and there isn't an acoustic mechanism to hear the notes right away but that prism is still through which musicians the music at least in the western world\nI Want to talk more about the conservatory or set up sort of a musical boot camp in in Paris tells a little bit\nMore about it and that was a performance boot camp I feel like\nMusic was performance for hundreds of years than there was an aberration called recording and we suddenly thought oh there's a permanent record which is why it's called the record of a song against which all other subsequent performances will be measured and it's kind of terrifying for a musician\nSo I thought how can I can get younger musicians who have come up in this SoundCloud era who in a really wonderful way can make music on their own on their computer posted and feel like they're starting to communicate with their audience\nHow do you make sure that in doing so they don't lose touch with what music really was a spiritual way music was someone in a cave hitting a drum and someone listening and maybe laughing or dancing\nSo how do you get young musicians to understand that that is not only the spiritual\nWay to feel connected with musicians that came before us but pragmatically that's also where you can make a living as a young musician so I went out of my way to sort of developed techniques that would force them to trust their instincts just to create a kind of control to discomfort\nWithin which they can compose and perform music\nI've done it once now they wrote music during that week under pressure literally with egg timers going for ten minutes or Fifteen minutes with constraints\nThey had to bridge the gap between coming from different cultures and different musical styles that was a rapper from Texas that jazz saxophonist from Ukraine classical guitarist from Guyana\nYou had a singer songwriter\nFrom Argentina that we make thing nicknamed Mexican ... at one point or so you had all these people that were forced to make music together look for that common ground and not have so much comfort that they feel that they have even the chance at perfectionism\nWe had cameras filming almost every month\nIn their personal moments but when we're working the cameras were on them and that was part of it they need to feel that pressure that discomfort they need to confront the fear of humiliation you know when you go on stage you get an adrenalin rush which is replicating probably early man\nYou know fight or flight was politically ... exactly and the stakes were very high he's my protest on stage the stakes are quite as high it's fear of humiliation president fear of death\nIf you can make friends with that fear is humiliation and even sort of acknowledge it you can sort of let the audience by taking risks looked like a magic trick a little bit like Houdini saying I'm going to go into this box of water and you know but yeah ... ... get my way out\nI it is kind of an escape routine every time that you got on stage you have to escape from the box that you\nPut yourself in a

that you either ... yeah I I you know I\nI Choose to share with my audience because they know that if you don't share anything you're missing out on the chance to create a bond and maybe for the music to to have more resonance October third has been out titled because they wanted people to know that emotionally this piece has different pieces even dedicated to myself I Want people to know\nThis is the emotional core of the album but of course I don't want to say why\nDid it get yourself yes decent back you're you're ... the real neat\nI dedicated to myself because this is that a piece that I

I'm\nBasically said hey you should do something fun next you know maybe throw out of an erotic buck you know fifty shades is doing so well I mean if it's halfway decent will publish it and I I took her seriously seriously I Would I Would definitely try that I Would try my hand at that and\nUh and I did I wrote three back to back in Eighteen months that you needed to under a pseudonym yes my pseudonym is actually my nanna his name\nUm she was Elle Marie ... Murray Adeline she was born in the turn of the century um quite a sexual prude so it was a little bit of an inside joke between my sister and me and uh uh yeah that was where I got that name so why the food and\nUh everybody was writing them under a pseudonym and it was also I wasn't sure of myself I felt a little insecure and I I thought you know if I fail I'd rather fail undermine Anna's name\nThan my own name and it's very it's a very different genre as it comes from a very different part of my brain\nUm [noise] um and ah it was very plot driven and I'm not as sort of literary um it didn't come from the part of my brain that wanted to be surprised so much has wants to nail to sort of plot and the point of making\nWhen it started doing incredibly well was there a point that you were like on a kind of wish I use my own and\nNo no no no I'm not I'm I'm I'm happy that it has its own life somewhere else the romance an erotic genre and leadership um is a very particular animal they like things a certain way um and I don't know if they'd be a fan of the stuff that I tend to write for myself you know like the winters for instance\nSo let's talk about the winters as we can really see Gabriel her new book or the winter's came out this week so I mentioned this off the beginning it's based on Daphne ... Rebecca which was a best seller when it came out in Nineteen thirty eight at the book it's never been out of print Alfred Hitchcock made a movie out of it that won best picture of the Oscars in Nineteen forty what's your personal connection to the original\nRebecca a fraud and lengthy I I'm Rebecca the book was one of three bucks that we owned growing up we didn't have books in the house we didn't have money we were library people um the other one was one of the other ones was um a collection of poems by Alfred lord tennis and\nAnd the chariots of the gods still kind of explains a lot um I didn't read the book until I was in high school so my first introduction of the story was um with Bill Kennedy at the movies out of Detroit I grew up in Windsor and watch that black and white movie with my mother probably on a loop\nThe same sort of jumped on pain movies over and over again so I I grew up knowing about story watching the story then I read the book in high school and it was kind of blown away because in the book maxim winter murders his wife admits it gleefully gets away with it and the narrator loves them more so for it\nI never thought that way growing up the movie the Alfred Hitchcock ... murder for obvious reasons and so it's a love story and they get away with it and live happily ever after\nSo let me understand as you're watching the White House you're watching news about the Trump White house you see Hope Hicks a Donald Trump's former adviser and it inspires you to revisit Rebecca am I right\nI Would go further back it was really the fall of two thousand sixteen um the actual election itself I was I'm\nNot working I was at home trying to sort of taught my next career move 'em my cat had died oh the election was obviously fraught for a lot of women and so I and I and I I'm ... I'm a news junkie and I had enough\nSo shut off you know the news and started to watch my favorite movies to see if I could sort of get myself out of this funk and through an Rebecca on both criterion collections of the movie [noise] and uh [noise]\nIt just was overwhelmed with the sense of you know max into winter gets away with murder and had the sense that men are getting away with a lot and ah you know came to me suddenly that it would be a fun exercise to write a book\nInspired by Rebecca wherein the men haven't changed max and to enter in my book becomes max winter Republican state senator\nUh but the women have so my narrator is very different than the original narrator she has more agency she's been older she's much smarter\nAnd I want it to experiment with the notion that ah I wondered if she was still is susceptible to that fairy tales you opened with off the top and sadly she is and to her detriment so then it turns into a thriller once she gets back to his mansion and the plot takes on a very different turn after that\nWill you said I was inspired her reimagining the world where the women have changed but the men have not so how have women in this book changed from the original announcement state to say\nWell I'm Talking about very specifically wealthy man you know with a lot of power or the election and everything that's happened since it it it really brings into stark relief just how little things have changed Donald Trump could exist in Nineteen fifty five\nThis is Ninety point three WPN land Nashville public radio Ninety One point five WTO mountains of Houma and Ninety One point seven W.

really wonderful way can make music on their own on their computer posted and feel like they're starting to communicate with their audience\nHow do you make sure that in doing so they don't lose touch with what music really was spiritual way music was someone in a cave hitting a drum and someone listening and maybe laughing or dancing\nSo how do you get young musicians to understand that that is not only the spiritual way to feel connected with musicians that came before us but pragmatically that's also where you can make a living as a on music\nLook techniques that would force them to trust their instincts just to create a kind of control the discomfort within which they can compose perform music\nI've done it once now they wrote music during that week under pressure literally with egg timers going for ten minutes or Fifteen minutes with constraints\nThey had to bridge the gap between coming from different cultures and different musical style so it was a rapper from Texas a jazz saxophone distribute crane classical guitarist from Donna\nYou had a singer songwriter\nFrom Argentina that we'd nickname nicknamed Mexican faced at one point or so you had all these people that were forced to make music together look for that common ground and not have so much comfort that they feel that they have even the chance at perfectionism\nWe had cameras filming almost every moment of the actual work was reality t._v. they weren't filmed in their personal moments but when we're working the cameras were on them and that was part of it they needed to feel that pressure that discomfort they need to confront the fear of humiliation you know when you go on stage you get an adrenalin rush\nWhich is replicating probably early man you know\nFight or flight response was when they ... exactly under the stakes were very high in life or death on stage the stakes are quite as high it's fear of humiliation resin fear of death\nIf you can make friends with that fear of humiliation and even sort of acknowledge it even sort of let the audience know by taking risks it's a little bit like a magic trick it's a little bit like Houdini saying I'm going to go into this box of water and you know ... yeah ... ... get my way out\nI it is kind of an escape routine every time that you go up on stage you have to escape from the box that you\nPut yourself in um you're going to do October third yes what significance of the data to research\nThat is a dates for I I Can't really explain the details because it's just too private and and so there are things that you either there's things need to keep ... yeah I I you know I I Choose what to share with my audience because I Know that if you don't share anything you're missing out on the chance to create a bond and maybe for the music to to have more resonance\nOctober third has been out titled because I wanted people to know that emotionally this piece is different\nThe pieces even dedicated to myself I Want people to know this is the emotional core of the album\nBut of course I don't want to say why dedicate yourself yes state and back you're you're getting the real\nName I dedicated to myself because this is a piece that I wrote on that day where something Barry life changing and this one's different let's say I want people to know this was October ...

I'm\nBasically said hey you should do something fun next you know maybe throw out of an erotic buck fifty shades is doing so well I mean if it's halfway decent will publish it and I I took her seriously seriously I Would I Would definitely try that I Would try my hand at that and\nUh and I did I wrote three back to back in Eighteen months that you did you did it under a pseudonym yes my pseudonym is actually my nanna his name\nUm L. Marie ... Murray Adeline she was born in the turn of the century um quite a sexual prude so it was a little bit of an inside joke between my sister and me and uh uh yeah that was where I got that name so why the student\nAh everybody was writing them interested in them and it was also I wasn't sure of myself I felt a little insecure and I I thought you know if I fail I'd rather fail undermine and his name\nThan my own name and it's very it's a very different genre it comes from a very different part of my brain\nUm [noise] um and ah it was very plot driven and I'm not as sort of literary um it didn't come from the part of my brain that wanted to be surprised so much has wants to nail to sort of plot and the point of making\nWhen it started doing incredibly well was there a point that you were like on a kind of wish I use my own and\nNo no no no and I I'm I'm I'm happy that it has its own life somewhere else the romance and erotic genre and leadership um it's a very particular animal they like things a certain way um and I don't know if the\nYou know like the winters for instance so let's talk about the winters as we can really see Gabriel her new book the winter's came out this week so I mentioned this off the beginning it's based on Daphne ... Rebecca which was a best seller when it came at Nineteen thirty eight at the book it's never been out of print Alfred Hitchcock made a movie out of it that won best picture of the Oscars in Nineteen forty\nWhat your personal connection to the original Rebecca\nAh it's fraught and lengthy I I'm Rebecca the book was one of three books that we owned growing up we didn't have books in the house we didn't have money we were library people um the other one was one of the other ones was um a collection of poems by Alfred our tennis and\nAnd the chariots of the gods so it kind of explains a lot um I didn't read the book until I was in high school so my first introduction of the story was um with Bill Kennedy at the movies out of Detroit I grew up in Windsor and watched that black and white movie with my mother probably on a loop he didn't have very many movies in his collection but he would play the same sort of jumped on pain movies over and over again\nSo I I grew up knowing about the story watching the story then I read the book in high school and was kind of blown\nAway because in the book maximum do winter murders his wife admits it gleefully mhm gets away with it and the narrator loves them more so for it and I never thought that way growing up the movie the Alfred Hitchcock catcher vase murder for obvious reasons and so it's a love story\nAnd they get away with it and live happily ever after\nSo let me understand as you're watching the White House you're watching news about the Trump White house do you see Hope Hicks a Donald Trump's former adviser and it inspires you to revisit Rebecca am I right\nI Would go further back it was really the fall of two thousand sixteen um the actual election itself I was I'm\nNot working I was at home trying to sort of taught my next career move 'em my cat had died oh the election was obviously fought for a lot of women and so I and I and I I'm ... I'm a news junkie and I had enough\nSo shut off you know the news and started to watch my favorite movies to see if I could sort of get myself out of this funk and threw in Rebecca on both criterion collections of the movie [noise] and ah [noise]\nIt just was overwhelmed with the sense of you know max into winter gets away with murder and had the sense that men are getting away with a lot and ah you know came to me suddenly that it would be a fun exercise to write a book\nInspired by Rebecca wherein the men haven't changed maxim to enter in my book becomes max winter Republican state senator uh but the women have so my narrator is very different than the original narrator she has more agency she's been older she's much smarter\nAnd I want it to experiment with the notion that ah I wondered if she was still susceptible to that fairy tales you opened with off the top and sadly she is and to her detriment so then it turns into a thriller when she gets back to his mansion and the plot takes on a very different turn after that\nWill you said I was inspired to re imagining a world where the women have changed but the men have not so how have the women in this book changed from the original announcement stayed\nSame well I'm Talking about very specifically wealthy man you know with a lot of power or the election and everything that's happened since it it it really brings into stark relief just how little things have changed Donald Trump could exist in Nineteen fifty five", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "19"}
