completely broke but um you know just seeing the light of day again and and and uh you know life is comfortable again for me 'cause I'm working really hard and\nAnd um but yeah\nYou know it was something I did you know if I could take it back I Would but yeah you wouldn't you know what I mean but you know whatever brought me to this point I'm happy with where I Am my life right now and I'm doing well\nOne of the things in the documentary about you as you say you don't think anyone could have survived but you went through\nThe yeah I mean I went for people are very forgiving in the music

you know it's great you know you have to deal with it but I'm I'm I'm thick skinned a strong stomach and\nYou know I put my I got through that and you know I guess I was blocking it out medicating when I was getting high but yeah when I quit\nAnd I got sober and realized OK I'm trying to get back in the music business again and you have people take me seriously and you know fix the relationships that are destroyed when I was high and you know I was\nYou know on manageable [laughter] it's so to speak for for a you know ours are for even my management or whatever yeah you know I just I had to I had to deal with that that was the hard\nPart so how do you how do you get back into music that how do you make the priority be music and\nUm well with sobriety comes clarity and you

hoping we can talk a little bit about your life and career through music so I Want to play us a music and get some stories about you as to where they fit into your life and career sour it sounds good to me just take a listen to the first one\nThe drama for me to make\nI'll get that hey it's amazing that was my first song I taught myself how to play on the piano fats what does it tell me what I say Ray Charles and Charles so so tell me a little bit about about the wider songs so important to who who showed you that some\nOf my dad my dad was always claimed it was like the one the one thing he knew how to play the piano and you know it just I loved it so much in a you know I eventually asked him like who is that and I got the his collection you know greatest hits collection Ray Charles and I said that uh\nThat cassette tapes in a cassette player on my a piano bench and learn to do that like note by note why the piano for you\nWe had one you had an upright like old piano in the house and it was like a piece of furniture and you know it was just something that I just was gravitated to\nMore so than any sports or you know hanging out I just wanted to play piano I wanted to be in a band and I was trying to you know learn theory and and I took a couple of piano lessons and the piano teacher told me I'm On teachable and then on to something and then I should just\nGo your high now I was playing sophisticated jazz cords or blues chords whatever it was on my own I didn't know what the courts were but I was playing them\nSee what his hair and flat nine ... heaving satellite or something as crazy as so was there a specific moment where you said I think I Want to do this for my life I Want to do this for my career to\nLike I was just do that was locked up in a cage with the studio and I never went out like my boys would come over before the recession and be like\nOh we're going to the club all I Can't go on working and then they would come back afterwards and tell me how it was so now all of a sudden I'm back in ... in Miami and I'm I'm getting curious about everything and I you know I leave and I I'm engulfed in thrown into this whole\nMiami nightlife thing and\nIt got the best of me yeah and when when you once you go down that road\nYou're not thinking clearly you're you're you know you read that thinking about how to get it and then oh well if I have\nA you know a yacht and a big bowl of cocaine I don't think I might have a problem getting any girls I was like you know you just start you're going down the road just thinking about the wrong stuff\nAnd then you're buying again like you're buying the luxury vehicles ten at a time lot while being high you know ... the daddy you find talking about it now\nI mean it doesn't bother me you know what I mean it did it hurt a little more when I was completely broke but um you know seeing the light of day again and and and uh you know life is comfortable again for me because I'm working really hard and and um\nBut yeah you know it was something I did you know if I could take it back I Would but yeah you wouldn't you know what I mean but you know whatever brought me to this point I'm happy with where I Am in my life right now and I'm doing well\nOne of the things in the documentary about you as you say you don't think anyone could have survived but you went through\nThe yeah I mean I went for people are very forgiving in the music business or just in general you know and um you know I went through a time where you know hey I was you know\nI was a junkie and you would have to hear and read about all this stuff about yourself and you know it's crazy you know you have to deal with it but I'm I'm I'm thick skinned a strong stomach and\nYou know I put my I got through that and you know I guess I was blocking it out and medicating when I was getting high but you know when I quit\nAnd I got sober and I realized OK I'm trying to get back in the music business again and you have people take me seriously and you know fix the relationships that are destroyed when I was high and you know I was\nYou know on manageable [laughter] it's so to speak for for a an ours are for even my management or whatever yeah you know I just I had to had to deal with that that was the hard part\nSo how do you how do you get back into music that how do you make the priority be music and\nUm well with some variety comes clarity and you realize you know dislike God given talent\nHave to get serious about this you know I have to have a family to support and not have you know a life that I have to live and and um I had already gotten a taste of the good life\nYou know in the rest of my laurels I I I don't care about this huge body of music that I did a ready I'm more concerned about making the new one we're going to talk about the new one to listen to this\n\n\nGuy I mean you know in a in\nA\nBetter chip you read and taking a walk you said he's the future\nHe's part of the my future collects yeah he's amazing though he's do he's got his own style he's he's definitely like a rock star to me I could\nProduction has changed a lot since you started making music though like how do you find production twenty Eighteen\nUm I mean it's constantly evolving yeah I think that music is a great place for producing like myself 'cause it's a lot of key wardrobe and stuff and melody driven stuff and\nUm I think people are thirsty for something new that's where you know those type of records come from and it's not like you're a traditional track record than you would think that you would get something like super\nInto a trap or whatever from from a young artist trip you read but he's he's part of the New Britain he's like a rock star in\nThat store just so nice to meet you back with

Ellen we're working on it [noise] you are listening\nTo you on CBC Radio one theory is actually I'm On the line from public radio international\nWhich goes by NPR I\nDon't know how into um literary gossip you are but earlier this year there was a bit of an upset in the book world had to do with the man Booker Prize which is sort of the Oscar sort of the enemies of literature so that upset was for the inclusion for the first time ever the graphic novel in the list of finalists\nThe book is called Sabrina by nectar now so it didn't end up winning the prize but it did get people thinking about the boundaries we set up between one art form and another and why why we feel the need to differentiate between art forms at all and that's something that Catherine of are mad has given some thought to\nYou see she wanted a governor generals award as a poet and came close to winning a second as a novelist for a book you might be familiar with called the break she writes children's stories and most recently she writes graphic novels\nHer first one came out last year it's called him making more than she is following it up with a sequel at the end of November and if you asked Katherine ever Matt how she manages to move between these worlds that institutions like the man Booker or the governor general see is entirely separate while her answer makes a lot of sense\nMe I'm I'm all in there somewhere as as we all are an artist and they they seem to coincide like it's a chronology you know they seem to go one after the other like after the documentary the graphic novel feels very close to that because I was working with collaborators and I was ... ... people who are much more talented than I was\nAnd really kind of directing how things look and I got to do that visual stuff and the graphic novel which you do very very differently and poetry and in prose\nSo does feel more connected and maybe then um say the other earlier stuff\nI find through all the all your work a lot of a lot of it focuses on you or like teenager years adolescence what what do you find so fascinating about that time\nWell I I really started the book of poetry came out when my eldest daughter was I think twelve [noise] so I was really kind of coming explained my own adolescence as I was approaching these these two teenage girls who are about to uh take me through the ringer so a lot of that would be from my girls and from their friends and my nieces and nephews [noise]\n'cause they're really of that era but\nYou really remember the things that happened to you as you're you came of age you really they're very impactful or you as you go forward um I Know in in studying different like you know education things about the brain and how when we're teenagers we actually hardwired all of those habits\nAre so that we actually do remember things when we're Seventeen a lot better than we remember things that happened say when we're twenty five [noise]\nUm and the way we deal with things in the way we look at life is really made in the course of those those times when our brains are actually forming around our hopefully good habits mostly bad habits when my case anyway you directed a documentary\nCalled this river you want a Canadian screening word for it and a documentary tells the story of your brother Wayne and went missing in guide and maybe the reason I'm asking so many questions about those teenage years because I was really struck that you were to fourteen when he disappeared and like why would why was that the right time to tell the story\n[noise] my part in the documentary came about 'em really reluctantly I really wanted to talk about a drag the red and the efforts that are going on right now with people who have a loved ones who are murdered or are are missing\nAnd then I guess through that I realized how close I was to that story and how much I really felt\nUm a kinship to these efforts in in bringing awareness and in some cases in the case of drag the red literally looking physically looking for these lost loved ones I'm part of it was the idea that\nIt's so unfortunately so common in some neighborhoods in some communities that uh no one's untouched you know and during the course of that documentary no one that we worked with didn't know of or was close to someone who had been murdered or missing and it was being searched for\nSo it was it was part of that my story is one part of many many stories in the documentary you\nSay that everything you've done comes from that experience of losing your brother ... what what would it would tell me about them", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "Nashville", "day": "26"}
