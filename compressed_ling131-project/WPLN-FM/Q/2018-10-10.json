about anybody in my whole life so\nWill tell me a little bit more about how she ended up inspiring to music\n[noise] well one night as many nights we go to bed after we moved to turn the lights off we

talking about I was reading from singing machine she'd heard some of my sketches but I was still reluctant to get back in the music business 'cause it's just not a friendly place you know the music is beautiful the business is not it's in so [noise]\nAnd then it comes with other stuff so I don't know I think I had already emotionally been a little bit too burnt out with it before and I didn't want to open up the demons about that so but I did see a promise and then after I lost her for two years of grieving\nMy passion for music came back and a\nMan these songs started to show up and I'm so

sense of humor I Know they think he's just putting them on\nYes laid the gentleman here the period and I was like no one clapped they're like yeah right right and then you watch\nSomebody is coming out of your well he's been he he left because he just wasn't feeling it any more they kind of laugh like what is he talking about\nAnd then you walk out and the place goes to their feet and they're yelling and screaming and he'd be back to that what was it like stepping out in front of an audience for the first time in two decades\nI honestly didn't know what to think so I I stayed out of any expectations backstage because there was a different time years have gone by I'm an older guy I've not been on stage and twenty five years and it's it's an eagles crowd you know which is an indie crowd which every every every generation has their own stamp\nAnd so that was an indie crowd and I thought gee you know I'm an ... fan but you know they're not going to know much about me and so I walked out there and they knew and I was a bit overwhelmed to be honest with you and I was amazed to\nSee if it's been so great talking to you I mean I have I have so many other things like I could ask you I was going to ask me a couple of more you got some ... no I was going to ask you stuff about the journey I was gonna ask you whether you were ever ever find yourself going back with them or anything like that\nWell you know the thing that people have asked that question you know I'm I don't know if anybody can never go back to anything I I start to really believe in life that you can't go back you got to move forward and for me right now or the passion is in my life\nIs this new music that's the sort of life sustaining for me um uncle Steven no spring chicken that's for sure and\nAnd I am I'm loving the discovery of the passion that I lost for so many years for music I rediscovered it in fact if anything I'm a kind of off the wall with nuts about it again everybody I'm listening to now it\nIncluding some new music I'm writing so I'm more into exactly this new record and the passion for new music\nSteve Perry former from man of journey has just released its first album twenty four years in college [noise]\nI'm Tom power cute back right after that [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] Mm\n[noise]\nMm [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nYou're listening to chew on CBC Radio one serious acts and one sixty nine and ... public radio international\nMy name is Tom how are\nYou ever find yourself mixing up an actor but the characters that they play like when a character is really good it can be kind of hard not to\n... friday yet again down on friday\nSinging that wrong and the job will be key\nAnd I\nShare all you are\nSo do you watch unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt on Netflix you might recognize that voice Eli camper who plays the unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt her thing or the thing that's really worked really really well for her is playing characters Lake County where in Deering forthright but also sometimes naive and a little bit off kilter\nBecause in real life Eli camper is enduring forthright it's tempting to assume she's also naive and kind of off kilter but you know what they say about making assumptions we make a\nYou know what I mean my point is beneath the comic exterior there is a very sharp very thoughtful totally on kilter person if that's a word and if that person that's on display in LA campers first book\nA memoir called my squirrels days ... about to tell you she really doesn't mind people having these preconceived notions about her in fact she finds it kind of therapeutic and you're going to hear us talk about her role as Aaron\nI'm the office the receptionist he replaces Pam you're going to hear us talk a little bit about her role and bridesmaids\nBut first off seeing as how Eli camper just wrote a book I wanted to know what writing gives her an acting doesn't\nI like writing because I feel like I'm In more control of of the material actually I feel like I'm In total control the material until the editor stepson which which is necessary editors are fantastic but\nI Do like that ability to control exactly what is being put down on a page when you're performing you are I'm ... I I think it's more of a collaboration where you um are directed and and ultimately you don't necessarily have a say in what the final and it looks like and so\nIt's less your ear sort of I'm\nLeaving a lot up to other people and when I was writing I did feel like I had a ... more control over the whole experience\nThought guides even those moments I mean I Know for me coming from so I I I'm a musician and I play music professionally before I didn't job\nRank so going from that to them being the lead on his show 'em so scary because I wasn't sure I was completely prepared or qualified to do such a thing and one thing I was very worried about was um [noise] ... me in a similar way to uh Aaron because they certainly share some characteristics but they're but they're\nBack stories are widely different and also I think they're um\nThey're they're global outlooks might be a little bit different and so um I I ... the first thing I was very concerned about that and I think I mentioned it Tina wants and she said oh I'm not I'm not worried about it [laughter]\nShe's really been speaking with a camera on us was that can ship or a\nAbout her new book my school days and I'm definitely it's a it's a lovely fun book to read but there's a quote here in your book you write that your quote an obedient person in real life so it's therapeutic to play women who were slightly unhinged onstage\nYes um [noise] and you know I was thinking about that a lot and that particular line I'm over the past couple of weeks because I'm\nNot going to political women are so angry right now and I've been thinking about you know and people have been encouraging women to demonstrate that anger rather than keep it and and I think that in playing characters who are on hand to do a let their anger\nOut that there's something ... in that and I play a lot of characters who are maybe more buttoned up or or just keep those emotions a little bit um\nDown low and and then when they do rise to the service I think that's very um I think it's cathartic for me but it's also fun to see those characters let it out\nOr do do do you ever worry about being considered two adorable nicer or cheerful are fun I mean these are actual adjective that had when we found and very provocative without mine right adorable nice cheerful funding during warm to ...\n... yeah I well I mean I I did my mom write a letter gee [laughter] you know there's about Eliot uh certainly I think there's some um [noise]\nI think that if that's a a those qualities are exaggerated you can become you stand the risk of being um maybe walked on or being manipulated and so\nUm I think that you have to keep all of those in check up but I don't think there's anything wrong with having good manners and being obedient when it when when obedience has called for in the right circumstances and um [noise] uh\nI think there's something to being a good worker but you also have to know when to speak up\nSort of an unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt has come to an end the second part of the last season is going to be coming up soon on Netflix um it does feel in some ways that you're at the point of your career we're really in the driver's seat like to go from being number eight in the cause you to number one you know you're you're you're at that number one part right now at a given a consideration to where you want to go next\nTo this is the first time in my life where I'm I'm making a job decision based on family\nUm before I hated my family before I had a baby and I have a two year old James he just turned two in July ... yeah\nUm it's it's it's playing a part in a way that I haven't experienced before and when I signed up for me that was I guess four years ago and um you know that was a I guess ... job transition I'd are starting a new job I guess and so this will be the first time\nTrying to figure out how to um without sounding cliched balance that you know work family dynamic and it's tricky for everyone\nThank you so much for talking to me and for your kind words I really really appreciate your taking time to talk to me and to read the book and\nHow sweet alley campers my squirrel days is out today unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is coming back for one more final season on Netflix next year after an alley cat but my favorite office ... declined that I my Instagram at Tom Joe powered\nLive music from nursing coming up Montreal based rapper and to trombone fascinating guy who's a professor ... teaches a course on hip hop it has a lot to say about what he thinks hip hop is going these days plus some dandy music coming up after [noise]\n\nMm Mm Mm\n\n[laughter]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nYou are listening to chew on CBC Radio one serious eggs in one sixty nine and\nFor P.

great talking to you I mean I have I have so many other things I could ask you I was going to ask me a couple of more you got some time no I was going to ask is talking about the journey I was gonna ask you whether you're ever ever found yourself going back with them or anything like that\nWell you know the thing that people have asked me that question you know I'm I don't know if anybody can
