R. I. radio international I'm Alone in for\nWell here's a question I'm sure every directorate Hollywood has grappled with at one point or another how do you take a story that has been told many many many times\nAnd turn it into something new something gripping maybe wondered about that with so many ... boots and revival hitting TV including just the other week when the latest version of star is born opened in theaters and that story has already been told three times before and it with a Damien ... the Oscar winning director of la la land\nSet to uh make a film about Neil Armstrong's a journey about a trip to the moon that we all know about and obviously that was going to be a really big challenge the first man landing stories one you've probably heard about in school in history books even on TV\nSo when he took a bit of a different approach the story with his new film first men there was some mixed results in the process he left out a few details about the moon landing and that is stirred up quite a controversy here to unpack some of that and fill you are in on some of the challenges of making a film like this\nWe have gathered the cute screen panel hello to both of you I Am joined by Tina ... and John suddenly who both write about arts and entertainment high there while John I'm going to turn to you first\nYou have been to the theater you watched first men and we know that this is the story of Neil Armstrong the first man on the moon but give us a little bit more contacts what's the story telling us\nWell I think it was a couple of things uh\nThat make it distinctive the first of which is what makes these sort of early space travel expeditions seem very tense very gripping a sweat will start forming on your browse you watch or Neil Armstrong spacecraft bounce off the atmosphere [noise]\nAh so I think that stuff for me was kind of the main event uh undeniably throwing in large scale on an IMAX screen or the other thing that tries to do with sort of delve into a psychology a bit more by exploring his relationship with his family\nHas kind of is I think sort of a stock deadbeat dad who was too obsessed with this mission to really care about the people around him who cared about him a so those are the things that I Try to distinguish the film and if I haven't talked to my hand I think the former stuff works a lot better than a lot [laughter]\nI Want to say a little bit of a cliff for first men [noise]\nNeal is this light is to go down in history\nLooking at those you handled on winning or in the way things [noise]\nLast\n... years we don't bail 'em they're\nNot going to war [laughter]\nWe return\nIt has all the elements obviously the big prize the tension the drama you can hear that we at something grand is about to happen that there is a clip from first men in theaters now in this story is one that's been told so many times Tina\nStory [noise] I don't know about that I mean like I feel like it is trying to in dear you extremely so to Neil Armstrong's personal psychology and I actually had the reverse reaction I'm with John like I\nThought that the emotional stuff was very not very effective it was more like I knew what the film was doing and I kind of let it wash over me and I'll say they're you know I was starting to tear up near the end but I cannot deny that it's kind of ... and\nYou know I mean I've seen this story being applied in a million other kinds of stories I guess now Neil Armstrong as getting the treatment I thought that all of the suspense will stuff where they are going up in the air\nWas another factor for me you know like ... um he recorded all or if he filmed all of this on like old film stock um all of the equipment that they're using\nIs I guess supposed to be accurate so looks really ugly and it's a very dark film and I just ... I don't know it was really dry and boring and I didn't care that much every single time that they went up\nTo ... be Armstrong [laughter]\nI don't know if I were star Ryan\nGosling had there's tons of close ups on him and every single twitch of his face has been captured for us to enjoy forever even if we maybe don't want to remember Neil Armstrong\nAnd he's like habit of eating maybe knowledge you've got the surround sound like it's so ugly I guess I guess what the film is trying to say like oh yeah the sixties\nThis is what it actually look like they also I think that you get a real sense of how terrifying it must have been to take this rattling box up into space and and take people with\nIt it was a great moment of finally say to you and I saw the phone together in theaters last week and a fellow behind us is our phone kept going off\nA from a very amusing because you hear all the time about how uh we have more technology in our pockets been was used to go to the moon [laughter] so when you're actually watching the sort of rickety old spaceships a mental image or a bar and he's gotten a call from his mom or something I don't know how to kind of amusing but did you find\nThat the director managed to keep it interesting\nFor the most part yeah I mean there I Will say this when they get to the moon spoiler alert a and the sort of camera opens up on this broad lunar panorama I mean obviously it's not really go to the actual moon for this movie but there was like an an odd hush and the audience which is something you hear very rarely and I thought it was quite a beautiful wood affecting from is\nTo silence as well in order to deliver that and and again it ties back to Armstrong's personal story like um the the the beginning of the movie um deals with like the fact that he lost his daughter to cancer of like the daughter is extremely young so there are lots of flashbacks to that um and that carries all the way to the end of the movie\nIncluding them in landing and want to go to a bit of a controversy that opened up over the course of the weekend first men um doesn't show Neal Armstrong planting the American flag on the moon a huge moment in history that we've all lived and we lived many tires parodies of may even made of it it's been repeated\nIt's kind of this a steady backdrop for history and and that's caused quite a bit of controversy online involving Florida Senator Marco Rubio and many other people have chimed in John can you unpack it for us little\nAfter ... I have to be mindful of a public radio standards when I was going to find it so frustrating I mean this movie has American flags all over there is a huge shot of the camera going up the side of the ship but says United States these people were clearly American and everybody knows it you see the flag on the moon you just don't see it being planted\nSo the claim that this movie somehow not patriotic enough\nLarge by people who I presume haven't seen it a is ludicrous and I mean it just says a lot about where we are today that everybody wants to sort of make these things political\nLike there's just no there isn't as much fanfare like there might have been in earlier movies about American space travel and and and I do think that really had not seen the film when he tweeted that\nThe only commentary thought I really do a lot of it you can have commentary that go out and then it kind of the fires up it to the point where it may have compromised Oscar possibilities for this film\nI'm so we have this claim that it's unpatriotic I'm I'm Wondering what you think about the the need of a story like this to be so called patriotic especially that planting of the\nOf the flag what was the idea between for for cutting that out literally deciding making it a clear decision they must have sat at the creative naval and decided we're not going to have the ethic moment everybody knows all about\nBut it's not a story about that moment it's a story about Neil Armstrong's interior life\nRight it's not it's not a story about America\nGetting to the moon it's a story about a scientist who underwent extreme psychological pain and and all this stuff in his own life and his pursuit of this impossible dream and actually achieving it well what about the performance there does Ryan Gosling bring us that in her life I think so\nYeah and I mean the thing the thing is that like\nThe the film shows aren't start to be this extremely guarded person who was not aware of his own emotions and that's where I'm I Believe the wife character plays a very I'm supporting role and forcing him to deal with his emotions at one point actually saying you have to sit down with our children and tell them that you might not come back right which I think the trailer and said\nI Am sort of ... and for Tom power if you're just tuning in you're listening to\nQ. I Am with Tina ... and John family who am I guess they are the cute screen panel we've been talking about the new film first manned within switch gears now for a little bit just has to listen to this [noise]\n\nWould you see one of my friends some wise [noise] now [laughter] [laughter]\nAnd the band unveiled their new album do your dreams and along with topics like social media and its impact on our culture record also brings is a really different than for the hard core band and they love switching things out for their fans here here in this wind it's an ... sixties pot\nBut like a lot of their previous albums you'll still find pretty hardcore punk songs in the next they haven't completely deserted people they are they're just trying a little bit of a new territory\nDamon Abraham Mike ... and joins taco they piled into the studio with Tom power and the story and they just make you think about all that social media that you're plugged into\nAlmost the moment but they need ... sat down in the studio with Tom he\nAdmitted this record oh never saw the light of day once that finished their last album he thought they might actually be done\nGlass was was really kind of the like and ... and a lot in the end of the ban a lot of thought it was like you know certainly the under my\nNeed to be created in the day and like I think last words is ultimately a compromise you know Mike came to me and he's like I Want to do is crazy elaborate thing and I'm like mom I don't have any interest in doing that I Want to do a strip down straight a park record and with with after it's impossible to get a straight up\nStraightforward hardcore record and we got ... which I I Do like that record I Do stand by that being like if I never write another album more the lyrics again in my life\nI said everything I wanted to say on that record you know I think by between all the records on him but like all the things that I felt I haven't said this yet I think I said the ... so you had to be had a period at the end of that sentence and I think so yeah oh you felt like a fellow at the end of a chapter in a in a big way like and I think\nYou know it felt like the end of the book for me but I you know definitely another chapter\nAnd joined us tell me about the first sort of a impulses to go into the studio after class boys the first impulse to go to do to make those dreams and\nI Would say that there was very little impulse to go into the studio to echo some of the things that Damien saying in a way\nAnd an end to bring in what Mike was talking about glass boys being a challenge it was kind of exhausting to get that done and get that on paper and the idea of having to go back into the studio in turn something out creatively I feel that there was a big void for us it was lucky that we always have these and\nOther projects that we can work on this zodiac series where you can sort of get ideas out of the way kind of them as though you need to overcook a few things before you get what you do get the recipe right\nAnd and going back into does your dreams we had absolutely nothing a prepares and nothing plan so the prospect of going into the studio was kind of the same as sitting at home where he wouldn't go into the studio at all like I Would just judging by what did what Damien just said ah\nI actually I didn't have that worried I'm not to try and take the drug out of what what do you think of as creativity in what he needed to say I just always assumed that there's going to be some project that up is going to endeavor to be a part of this in the studio\nReally became a tool for us real conduit for and songwriting became an instrument almost and some somewhere between glass boys and and does your dream so I just assumed it would be there to tell you the truth I have no idea in what way but they never ...\nI I Can't get over the range of of genres on his record I don't even really even like to talk about genres that much but I I Do hear like look I mean we heard a bit of like sort of disco and under your dreams it's pop it it's hard core it's just like do up tendencies on this\nMike was was the intention to try out a bunch of different genres or was it just things were coming to you and you wanted to put them out in the way they were they were coming in your head [noise]\nLike we were really writing an album we just had it was sort of like we had studio time we were just writing music and it wasn't until like a year later that\nTo a fully realized thing so I think me and Jonah just spent so much time together and every one of the band isn't just so many different kinds of music and sort of like scholars of music that we just had a lot in there we want it to ... and just see what kind of stuff we could make\nAnd it wasn't until a lot later that those songs started becoming a after ups on\nA ... year that's we kind of pointed out from talking to Mike and Jonah safari you weren't there for all this with what was your reaction when there's some ...\nUh well they are like kind of three stages I'm Jonah was there for the first stages um I got brought the song we're we download a couple yeah we definitely other versions of some of some of the song um and it was one of those things where you know like I forget which one it was\nAnd I I remember being in there and being like I'm not how can I write to us I was also limits the kind of producing and in in hosting this wrestling TV show uh so I was travelling like all the time really focused on that and it was just so\nDifferent you know and it was just so different ... different ... I think it was different from what I wanted the band to be right you know and I think with\nTrying to write the way I write to those songs I was having a lot of problems like it was not a productive session I think we've got a couple we've gotta beside out of it may have like the four or five days\nAnd the lyrics are writing really lazy you know and I was just like what am I going to write about you know I wasn't writing to somebody who is before the concept was kind of introduced and we were just kind of like writing\nAnd trying different things out and uh I I just couldn't really find it and I remember going to Mike and being like I don't I don't I don't know like it wasn't really working\nAnd ah then my came back as I wrote everything and that at first was like you know my natural reaction was like Wal Mart saying everything you wrote like I'll eventually run my own songs and then\nYou know he just kind of had it all figured out you know he had this whole kind of plan in place and so for the first time instead of being like well how do I fit into your plan I was like which is something that I think Jonah has done a long time in the band been like how do I eat this plan\nIn it coming to fruition and joined did that for me [noise] when I was writing songs with the band certainly doesn't for Mike and so that's what I decided I was going to try and do this record you know yes and it's that hard especially hard like I think I think it's hard to put your ego in check\nFor for anything you know and especially in a band especially being a lead singer in a band I remember Gore told me one time like Anchorage counties are those like the worst name dropping ever would go down he said to said to me one time there's like a elites here's where it differently\nYou know like the lead singer you have to take in\nAll this energy and that's positive and negative and I think you do that night in a night out you do that every time you write a record and that's that's training and you know as a lead singer\nYou have to have this ego defense that's up in place I have an ending empathy for you know people milling music that do silly things none criminal horrible things I should but stuff's five but like people that do and say\nDum dum Saddam Hussein damn yeah because I think it's just like it does pickle your mind eventually being in in a band\nBut I Want I Want to talk more about the record or you're just tuning in that I was speaking with ... Damien making Jonah from Aftab about does your dreams keep a little bit from the record them [noise]\n\n\n\nI Know that an elusive Welsh singer called Nigel bonk they're not good enough [laughter] no you're not going to the view that lives that got him I tell you what that's easy that part's easy I Want to take a page from the Sloan book at that point and I want to do like a switch\nKnow what am I only had it and I used to do that we used to cover and all the New York it's sort of our punk song and Damien got drowned and I got and guitar I Would say a few success let's see it again\nI think the thing about drums that I really unique approach to it like most people think that it should be the rhythm of the band I think it should be able to leave free for oh Mike I'm this is this is a a an album\nThat has a a narrative arc um I I Know this is radio show and we don't have a all the time in the middle and you can use to simply summarized the narrative arc for me\nIt's just about a guy who has problems in his life and he um finds the help of a homeless shelter ... elderly woman to to help them and then he finds release at the end of the record what\nDo you find useful about telling the stories of a character as opposed to say first person\nNarratives [noise] well I realize later that the record is about me and my journey of being in a band and really humming okay with being a weird person in a weird band it's so weird life and it's your you know living up in opposition to\nMost of the people you see on the street every day to realize later on this record was about me becoming okay with my own life you know\nSo you are using a carry you are in trouble you you were this kind of guide said making ... takes office talk of his life a little bit yeah\nAnd using a character let's I mean I realize later what the what I was even writing about something using a character lets you think of sort of your own life in a more objective way to write about it truthfully maybe one\nOf the things I thought about when I listen to this record Mike and I'm you know I'm usually lows to try and put any intention anyone's record uh\nBut I I ... I saw the ad read the PDF like I got sent a PDF sort of about the record and what the story of the record us um and there's a lot about the destructive power of capitalism of greed and one thing that came up twice of social media social media effect on us I sought to come up place in the same description\nThe power I have I think over an oil conglomeration as like a super real thing but it's sort of abstract to me but I I interact with my phone twenty four hours a week I I've been tracking it and I find that really disquieting so I'm Wondering in the process of thinking about all these things going through your journey now that we understand that it's the first person narrative\nHow are you with social media these days if you have to check the phone out where where are you with him\nThis is Ninety point three WPN land Nashville public radio Ninety One point five WTO mountains of Houma and Ninety One point seven W.

what was going on he did not seem to be human he was his deep gray color and had no blood coursing through him later on I became a student of the theater and as a student at the theater you realize this Shakespeare is a God and as someone of African descent ah\nAlways looking for my reflection in art and a fellow is the most well known theater a character of African descent\nI Wonder ... just a little clip from the debt Nineteen sixty five film\nHow did you ever made with afflictions hasn't rained\nAll kinds of soldiers I'm sure it was on my way stayed in public did go to Kevin productive it then me on my\nPost hopes I sure did for him in some of my soul to drop stations\nNow that we have Laurence Olivier as Othello playing the role as you just explained Janet in blackface and you were speaking about how you saw that first thing you were eleven years old and then went looking for yourself in art and looking for reflection of yourself even in theater so here you are faced with a\nA a black character who is in play by many different people and what happened to you over time where did you start deciding to try and take up more room with characters that you created\nThank you very much for being here today and telling me a little bit about your story such a pleasure thank you very much I've been speaking with Janet ... she's the creator of the award winning play Harlan do at its onstage now at Toronto's tag on theater the main space and it's going to be on until October twenty eight coming up next the huge screen\nPanel they're stopping and to tell you in on the latest film and to create a little bit of buzz you're gonna find out which movie on talking about right after that\n\nMhm [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nYou're listening to you on CBC Radio one serious acts every one sixty nine and from the R I had like radio international I'm way lower end for\nWhat's your question I'm sure every directorate Hollywood has grappled with at one point or another how do you take a story that has been told many many many times\nAnd turn it into something new something gripping maybe wondered about this with so many re boots and revival hitting TV including just the other week when the latest version of star is born open in theaters now that story has already been told three times before and it with a Damien ... the Oscar winning director of la la land\nSet to uh make a film about Neil Armstrong's journey about a trip to the moon that we all know about um\nObviously that was going to be a really big challenge the first moon landing stories one you've probably heard about in school history books even on TV\nSo when he took a bit of a different approach to the story with his new film first men there were some mixed results in the process he left out a few details about the moon landing and that has stirred up quite a controversy here no impact some of that and fill you are in on some of the challenges of making a film like this\nWe have gathered the cue screen panel hello to both of you I Am joined by Tina ... and John ... who both write about arts and entertainment high there hadn't done while John I'm going to turn to you first\nYou have been to the theater you watched first men and we know that this is the story of Neil Armstrong the first man on the moon but give us a little bit more contacts what's the story telling us\nWell I think there's a couple of things uh that make it distinctive the first of which is what makes these sort of early space travel expeditions seem very tense very gripping a sweat will start forming on your browser watcher Neil Armstrong spacecraft bounce off the atmosphere\nA sort of that stuff for me was kind of the main event uh undeniably thrilling\nWe sort of delve into a psychology a bit more by exploring his relationship with his family that's kind of is I think sort of a stock deadbeat dad who was too obsessed with this mission to really care about the people around him who care do him\nA so those are the things that I Try to distinguish the film and if I haven't talked to my hand I think the former stuff works a lot better than ... [laughter]\nI Wonder if they a little bit of a cliff for first men [noise]\nNeal is just like them to go down and just\nLooking at those do you have or don't winning ... [noise]\nThe last\n... years we'll be all of this [laughter] going the woman [noise]\nWas that we read into it because\nIt has all the elements obviously the big rise the tension the ... here that we tempting grand is about to happen that they're a clip from first men in theaters Marlon this story is one that's been told so many times peanut this first men add anything to the Neil Armstrong loom ending story [noise]\nI don't know about that I mean like I feel like it is trying to in dear you extremely so to Neil Armstrong's personal psychology and I actually had the reverse reaction I'm with John like\nI thought that the emotional stuff with very not very effective it was more like I knew what the film was doing and I kind of let it wash over me and I'll say they're starting to tear up near the end but I cannot deny that it's kind of ... and\nYou know I mean I've seen this story being applied in a million other kinds of stories I guess now Neil Armstrong as getting the treatment I thought that all of the suspense will stuff where they are going up in the air\nWas another factor for me you know like ... um he recorded all or if he filmed all of this on like old films stock on all the equipment that they're using\nIs I guess supposed to be accurate so looks really ugly and it's a very dark film and I just ... I don't know it was really dry and boring and I didn't care that much every single time that they went up\nEarlier honky or to be Armstrong [laughter]\nNothing star Ryan Gosling had\nThere's a ton of close ups on him and every single twitch of his faith has been captured for us to enjoy forever even if we maybe don't want to remember Neil Armstrong\nCabinet of aiding maybe knowledge that surround sound like it's so ugly I guess I guess with the film is trying to say like oh yeah the sixties this is what it\nActually look like they also I think you get a real sense of how terrifying it must have been to take this rattling box up into space and and take people with\nIt it was a great moment if I may say to you and I saw the phone together in theaters last week and a fellow behind us is our phone kept going off\nFrom a very amusing because you hear all the time about how uh we'd have more technology in our pockets but it was used to go to the moon so when you actually washer usually sort of rickety old spaceships or metal knee jerk behind just gotten a call from his mom or something I don't know trying to kind of amusing but did you find that the director managed to keep it interesting\nFor the most part yeah I mean there I Will say this when they get to the moon spoiler alert a and the sort of camera opens up on this broad lunar panorama I mean obviously it's not really go to the actual moon for this movie but there was like an an odd caution the audience which is something you hear very rarely and I thought it was quite a beautiful it affecting farmers\nTo silence as well in order to deliver that and and again it ties back to Armstrong's personal story like um the the the beginning of the movie um deals with like the fact that he lost his daughter to cancer at ... like the daughter is extremely young so there are lots of flashbacks to that\nUm and that carries all the way to the end of the movie including\nThem in landing and want to go to a bit of a controversy that opened up over the course of the weekends\nWeb streaming is made possible by electronic express with a comprehensive selection of smart appliances for K. TVs computers and accessories for the smart home available in stores or online at electronic express dot com code W. P. L. and\nSenator Marco Rubio and many other people have chimed in John can you unpack it for us little\nAfter ... after be mindful of a public radio standards are sort of going to fight it's so frustrating I mean this movie has American flags all over there was a huge shot of the camera going up the side of the ship it says United States these people are clearly American and everybody knows it you see the flag on the moon you just don't see it being planted\nSo the claim that this movie somehow not patriotic enough\nA lot of people who are presumed haven't seen it a is ludicrous and I mean it just says a lot about where we are today that everybody wants to sort of make the springs political\nYeah like there's just no there isn't as much fanfare like there might have been in earlier movies about American space travel and and and I do think that would be a had not seen the film when he tweeted that so it's coming from a place of ignorance\nIt isn't the only commentary to God I really do a lot of it you can have commentary that go out and then it kind of the fires up to the point where it may have compromised Oscar possibilities for this film\nI'm so we have this claim that it's unpatriotic I'm I'm Wondering what you think about the the need of a story like this to be so called patriotic especially that planting of the\nOf the flag what was the idea between for for cutting that out literally deciding baking it sets a clear decision they must have sat at the creative naval and decided we're not going to have the ethic moment everybody knows what's that about\nBut it's not a story about that moment it's a story about Neil Armstrong's interior life\nRight it's not it's not a story about America\nGetting to the moon it's a story about a scientist who underwent\nExtreme psychological pain and and all this stuff in his own life and his pursuit of this impossible dream and actually achieving it well what about the performance there does Ryan Gosling bring us that in her life I think so yeah and I mean the thing the thing is that like\nThe the film shows aren't start to be this extremely guarded person who was not aware of his own emotions and that's where I'm I Believe the wife character plays a very I'm supporting role and forcing him to deal with his emotions at one point actually saying you have to sit down with our children and tell them that you might not come back right which I think the trailer and said\nI Am ... and for Tom power if you're just tuning in you're listening to\nQ. I Am with Tina his ... and John family who am I guess they are the cute screen panel we've been talking about the new film first manned within switch gears now for a little bit just have to listen to this [noise]\nHow is that when they're from asked out that was their last record glass boys released\nFour years ago and the band unveiled their new album does your dreams and along with topics like social media and its impact on our culture the record also brings us of really different sound for the hard core band and they love switching things out for their fans you'll hear in this one\nTo just go there some sixties pop but like a lot of their previous albums you'll still find pretty hardcore punk songs in the next they haven't completely deserted who they are they're just trying a little bit of new territory\nDamon Abraham Mike how the check and judges taco they piled into the studio with Tom power and the story I might just make you think about all that social media that you're plugged into almost the moment that they mean Abraham sat down in the studio with Tom he\nAdmitted this record almost never saw the light of day once ... finished their last album he thought they might actually be done\nGlass was was really kind of the like and ... and we have a bad a lot of thought it was like you know certainly the end of my [noise]\nNeed to be created in the bay and like I think last words is ultimately a compromise you know Mike came to me and he's like I Want to do is crazy elaborate thing and I'm like mom I don't have any interest in doing that I Want to do a strip down straight a park record and with with after it's impossible to get a straight up\nStraightforward hardcore record and we got ... which I I Do like that record I Do stand by that being like if I never write another album where the lyrics again in my life\nI said everything I wanted to say on that record you know I think by between all the records but like all the things that I felt I haven't said this yet I think I said the ... she had to be at a period at the end of that sentence I think so yeah oh you felt like a fellow at the end of a chapter in a in a big way like and I think\nYou know it felt like the end of the book for me but I you know definitely another chapter\nJoined us tell me about the first sort of a impulse is to go into the studio after class boys the first people to do is to do to make those you drink um I Would say that there was very little impulse to go into the studio to echo some of the things that Damien saying in a way\nI'm at and to bring in Mike was talking about ... being a challenge it was kind of exhausting to get that done and get it on paper and the idea of having to go back into the studio in turn something out creatively I feel that there was a big void for us it was lucky that we always have these and\nOther projects that we can work on this zodiac series where you can sort of get ideas out of the way kind of them as though you need to overcook a few things before you get what you do get the recipe right and and going back into does your dreams we had absolutely nothing a prepares and nothing plants\nHome three words you wouldn't go into the studio at all but just judging by what did what Damien just said ah I actually I didn't have that worried and\nNot to try and take the rug out of what what do you think of as the creativity and what he needed to say I just always assumed that there's going to be some project that stuff is going to endeavor to be a part of ... just in the studio\nReally became a tool for us real conduit for and songwriting a became an instrument almost and some somewhere between glass boys and and does your dream so I just assumed it would be there to tell you the truth I have no idea in what way but they never ...\nI Can't get over the range of of genres on his record I don't even really even like to talk about genres that much but I I Do hear like like I mean we heard a bit of extra disco and under your dreams it's pop it it's hard core it's just like do up tendencies on this\nMike was was the intention to try out a bunch of different genres or was it just things were coming to you and you wanted to put them out in the way they were they were coming in your hand\nYeah like we were really writing an album we just had it was sort of like we had studio time we were just writing music and it wasn't until like a year later that\nThe songs we had started to coalesce into a fully realized things\nSo I think me and Jonah just spent so much time together and every one of the band isn't just so many different kinds of music and sort of like scholars of music that we just had a lot in there we want it to sort of slacks and just see what kind of stuff we could make and it wasn't until a lot later that those songs started becoming a ...\nYear as we kind of pointed out from talking to Mike and joined us the fire you weren't there for all this with what was your reaction when the ...\nUh well there are like kind of three stages I'm Jonah was there for the first stage of 'em I got brought the song we're and yet we download a couple yeah we definitely other versions of some of some of the song um and it was one of those things where\nYou know like I forget which one it was and I I remember being in there and being like I'm not how can I write to them so I was also in the ... some kind of producing in in in hosting this wrestling TV show [noise] ah so I was travelling like all the time really focused on that and the and it was just so\nDifferent you know and it was just so different ... different ... I think it was different from what I wanted the band to be right you know and I think with trying to write the way I write\nTo those songs I was having a lot of problems like it was not a productive session I think we got a couple we've gotta beside out of it like the four or five\nDays and the lyrics are writing were really lazy you know and I was just like what am I going to write about you know I wasn't writing to some it was before the concept was kind of introduced and we were just kind of like writing and trying different things out\nAnd uh I I just couldn't really find it and I remember going to Mike in being like I don't I don't I don't know like it wasn't really working and ah then my came back and said I wrote everything and that at first was like you know my natural reaction was like why am I going to sing everything you wrote like I'll eventually run my own songs and then\nYou know he just kind of had it all figured out you know he had this whole kind of plan in place and so for the first time instead of being like well how do I fit into your plan I was like which is something that I think Jonah has done a long time in the band been like how do I eat this plan\nIn it coming to fruition and joined did that for me [noise] when I was writing songs with the band certainly doesn't for Mike and so that's what I decided I was going to try and do this record you know yes and it's that hard especially hard like I think I think it's hard to put your ego in check\nFor for anything you know and especially in a band especially being a lead singer in a band I remember Gore told me one time like Anchorage counties are those like the worst name dropping ever vote Gore Downie said to send me one time there's like a elites here's where it differently\nYou know like the lead singer you have to take in all this energy and that's positive\nThey do you do that every time you write a record and that's that's training and you know as a lead singer you have to have this ego defense that's up in place I on ending empathy for you know people milling music but do silly things non criminal horrible things I should but that's fine but like people that do and say\nDum dum Saddam Hussein damn yeah because I think it's just like it does pickle your mind eventually being in in a band\nBut I Want I Want to talk more about the record or you're just tuning in that I'm speaking with ... Damien making Jonah from messed up about does your dreams you pay a little bit from the record them [noise]\n\n\nYou\nAn elusive Welsh singer called Nigel bonk good to know [laughter] like you know we do the view that live by that got him I tell you what that's easy that part\nI Want to take a page from the Sloan book at that point and I want to do like a switch ruined were you play drums or something like that oh God if I did that there'll be no matter\nWhat you said that we used to cover and all the New York ... sort of art punk song and Damien got drums and I got and guitar I Would say excuse success let's see it again\nI think the thing about drums that I have a really unique approach to it like most people think that it should be the rhythm of the band I think it should be able to leave free for\nMike I'm this is this is a a an album that has a a narrative arc um I I Know this is radio show and we don't have a all the time and and can you can use to simply summarized the narrative arc for me\nIt's just about a guy who has problems in his life and he um finds the help of a homeless shelter ... elderly woman to to help him and then he finds release at the end of the record\n... what do you find useful about telling the stories of a\nCharacter as opposed to say first person narratives [noise] well I realize later the record is about me and my journey of being in a band and really humming okay with\nBeing a weird person in a weird band it's so weird life and it's your you know living up in opposition to most of the people you see on the street every day to realize later on this record was about me becoming okay with my own life you know\nSo you are using a care you are in trouble you you were just\nKind of guide said making to try to ... ... talk of his life a little bit yeah\nAnd using a character let's I mean I realize later what the what I was even writing about something using a character lets you think of sort of your own life in a more objective way to write about it truthfully maybe\nOne of the things I thought about when I was listening to this record Mike and I'm you know I'm usually lows to try and put any intention anyone's record uh\nBut I I ... I saw the ad read the PDF like I had a PDF sort of about the record and what the story the record he was um and there's a lot about the destructive power of capitalism of greed and one thing that came up twice as social media social media effect on us I sought to come up twice in the same description\nThe power I have I think over an oil conglomeration is like a super real thing but it's sort of abstract to me but I I interact with my phone twenty four hours a week I I've been tracking it and I find that really disquieting so I'm Wondering the process of thinking about all these things going through your journey now that we understand that it's the first person narrative", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "16"}
