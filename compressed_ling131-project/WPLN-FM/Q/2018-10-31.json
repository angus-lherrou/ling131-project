record he's worked on but\nJust so much music there's so much history with now Rogers we had to go through some of it we had a living legend in our midst so we decided to start\nA new day\nA\nMan in a way that is the Beatles in a day in the life I think it's only sitting in front of you that I realized how cool Paul McCartney baseline\nOf time I I Swear to God I Swear to God I just sat there and was saying\nNice voice leading [laughter] like I never thought about that was I think there's something about being with you I mean I go to the this kind of funky that'd be that's the voice leaving yeah for sure if that's the first one you learned guitar is that right Harry first thing I ever learn to put on guitar how did that happen\nUm well I was a clarinet is and I grew up during the hippie movement\nAnd um that was the sexy rock and roll thing to play\nA and and I was a sharing an apartment with this girl who had a band that she needed a guitar player will because I could already read music well I've thought how hard could this be like everybody in the work and play guitar\nAnd I picked up the guitar I tuned it improperly and she fired me right on the spot\nAnd then I learned to tune the guitar properly and I had a Beatles song book and that was the first song I work my way through but I remember reading about you you were somehow involving the black panther party or another big time I was a subsection leader\nOf a ... of a a section called the lower Manhattan Black Panthers and we were part of what they call the Harlem branch um people have a very um they they don't really\nHave a party was working at all it's all like yeah wacky hearsay and stuff\nBut the truth is that it was actually quite organized and it was organized on what they called the ten ten ten system so the way it was supposed to work was each state would have ten branches each branch would have ten sections each section would have to end subsection\nSo I was a subsection leader of the lower Manhattan branch I mean a lower Manhattan a section of the Harlem brat\nSo we grew up in a time where it was the beginning of you know the civil rights movement had really started to ... was really developed um\nSo it was the ... the time of the black power movement but what was really important is that we were at the beginning of\nOther movements like the gay pride movement and women's movement all of that stuff happening online so right exactly so so the Panthers were seen as the vanguard of the revolution so to speak em I Want to hear some more music take a listen to that\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nA lot of love from David Bowie office album let's dance and album he produced with my guest rock and Roll Hall of fame producer and guitarist musician now Rogers admitted that

[laughter]\n[noise]\nHonestly is near town and\nPretty good for that [noise] how did\nYou run a big fan of ... but the title let them know what happened was a David and I\nKnow we met one morning at an after hours club um I walked in with Billy Idol who is one of my best friends at the time we'd like party almost every night together and we were both a little bit or or how do I say a\nLikely than landing\n\nOn men would think again you know if this\nCame around and only tell me as much as you want to tell me but this came around that sort of a scary personal time for you to read yeah yeah I uh was recovering\nFrom I'm from extremely aggressive prostate cancer and um the doctors were not certain of my outcome um\nAnd I was just doing what I was supposed to do what they told me there you know walking five miles a day in a ... you know after I had my prostate surgically removed\nAnd um and of course they monitor you to see if they got all the cancer because that's the problem with cancer is that you know they could still be microscopic part that haven't shown themselves and you know and they think you're fine and next thing you know they go oh my God it's come back\nAnd in fact it really hadn't left they just hadn't gotten it or sometimes it does come back\nSo in my case I was in the initial recovery periods\nWhen I got the phone call which is how we sort of wound up hooking up together because we had been trying to hook up together for years and every time I Would go to France who will be some kind of strike and I could never get to where they were they get rid of the ... and I and I used to think that was cool because I said you know when I was a kid we had strikes all the\nTime and now in America nobody's strikes over anything and I you know ... whatever do you feel different since that since that scares since that Mm I'm no I'm not really um the the 'cause I've I've I had a second bout of cancers since the first big one um\nAnd um [noise] you know I'm ... and I've lost so many really close friends\nUm you know like you you know you think about the people and the Sheikh organization the original she'd organization when I look at that original picture of us would Luther Vandross Bernard Edwards Tony Thompson Raymond Jones I'm ray Maldonado five people in that photo\nEvery male except for myself and Rob um have passed away every guy um\nAnd it just it's so weird because I was the most reckless because I grew up\nWith the sort of most bohemian ... type ... parents you know\nThat I you know I tell people that I've never been given a curfew in my entire life my parents never ever said to me now come home when the lights come on or anything like that because they knew that instinctively I knew to come home when there was nothing else to do we've got we've got one more song for you to listen to this\n[noise] [noise]\n\nThat's just a little taste of the new single from now Rogers and she said the world falls right yeah featuring a ... they're going to come and grab you at some point I'm sure you've been talking for so long but that's cool man the longer the is better for\nMe as a last question is a bit of an abstract one okay I assume that one of these days I'm going to get to watch them out Rogers' story on film you know what I mean I'm an agency that may be that walk the line that you're really extraordinary life you've led so let me put this to you you were watching the movie the credits are rolling what song is playing\nWow that's a cool question I've never heard it put to me like that before I Would imagine it would be good times um and I think\nTimes or maybe we are family\nUm just because those two songs for us I'm\nReally were life changing and maybe I'm\nSo we're family was really important because we knew that we created\nYou know we created a phenomenon which is just such a Sledge yeah I mean there was like you know like we really proved to ourselves that we could do what we did for ourselves for someone else and maybe even better um\nAnd and and good times because of what happened after good times with hip hop I mean it's just you know um I I remember watching um an interview with L.

Rogers whether you know it or not he's the music mastermind behind a lot of\nThose songs and samples you just heard he spent the last five decades winning Grammys and producing them playing some of the biggest puppy the kids ever\nAnd I'll have to own bank Sheikh become a huge in the seventies\nThen he helped David Bowie and Diana Ross make the biggest records of their careers you help Madonna create some of her earliest hits he helped pave the way for hip hop to become as big as it is today I don't know if you remember that big record from ... punk a few years back you remember get lucky yeah that's Nile Rogers to playing guitar and that and co writing it\nRecently now Rogers is put out a bunch of new music under his old band name sheik and he stopped by the cues studio to talk about the latest record he's worked on but\nJust so much music there's so much history with now Rogers we had to go through some of it we had a living legend in our midst so we decided to start\nAnd then and then you know\nMm\nMan in a way that is the Beatles and a day in the life I think it's only sitting in front of you that I realized how cool Paul McCartney they fly a\nLot of time I I Swear to God I asked her to God I just sat there and we're seeing\nNice voice leading man [laughter] it was like I never thought about that was why do I think there's something about being with you I mean I go to the that's kind of funky that's that's the voice leaves yeah for sure if that's the first one you learned guitar is that right Harry first thing I've learned to play guitar how did that happen\nUm well I was a clarinet is and I grew up during this should be movement and um that was the sexy rock and roll thing to play a and and I was\nHad a band that she needed a guitar player will because I could already read music well I've thought how hard could this be like everybody in the work and play guitar and I picked up the guitar I tuned it improperly and she fired me right on the spot\nAnd then I learned to tune the guitar properly and I had a Beatles song book and that was the first song I work my way through but I remember reading about you you were somehow involving the black panther party or another big time I I was a subsection leader\nOf ah the ... of a a section called the lower Manhattan Black Panthers and we were part of what they call the Harlem branch um people have a very um\nThey they don't really have a very accurate picture of the way the black panther party was organize at all it's all like yeah\nLackey hearsay and stuff but the truth is that it was actually quite organized and it was organized on what they called the ten ten ten system so the way it was supposed to work was each state\nWould have ten branches each branch would have ten sections each section would have to end subsection so I was a subsection\nLeader of the lower Manhattan and branch I mean a lower Manhattan a section of the Harlem brat so we grew up in a time where it was the beginning of you know the civil rights movement had really started to ... was really developed um\nSo it was the ... the time of the black power movement but what was really important is that we were at the beginning of\nOther movements like the gay pride movement and women's movement all of that stuff happening DOMA and so right exactly so so the Panthers were seen as the vanguard of the revolution so to speak em I Want to hear somebody you could take a listen to the\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nA lot of love from David ... dance and album he produced with my guests rock and Roll Hall of fame producer and guitarist musician now Rogers admitted that they see what's cool about this now it's like listening with you I'm I'm listening to the other stuff so I'm listening to like my really cools are in charge there [laughter]\n[noise]\nHonesty is near town\nPretty good for them [noise] how'd\nYou weren't a big fan of ... like the title and less fans now what happened was a David and I\nUh we met one morning at an after hours club um I'd walked in with Billy Idol who was one of my best friends at the time we like party almost every night together and we were both a little bit or or how do I say a\nElected allegedly\n\nOn men would think again you know if this\nCame around and only tell me as much as you want to tell me but this came around that sort of a scary personal time for you to right yeah yeah I uh was recovering\nFrom I'm from extremely aggressive prostate cancer\nAnd um the doctors were not certain of my outcome\nUm and I was just doing what I was supposed to do what they told me to doing you know walking five miles a day in a ... you know after I had my prostate surgically removed\nAnd um and of course they monitor you to see if they got all the cancer because that's the problem with cancer is that you know they could still be microscopic part that haven't shown themselves and you know and they think you're fine and next thing you know they go oh my God it's come back\nAnd in fact it really had left they just hadn't gotten it or sometimes it does come back\nSo in my case I was in the initial recovery periods\nWhen I got the phone call which is how we sort of\nWound up hooking up together because we had been trying to hook up together for years and every time I Would go to France who will be some kind of strike and I could never get to where they were they could have made it through Iowa\nAnd I and I used to think that was cool because I said you know when I was a kid we had strikes all the time and now in America nobody's strikes over anything and you know ... whatever do you feel different since that since that scares since that Mm\nI'm no I'm not really um\nThe the ... 'cause I've had I had a second bout of cancer since the first big one um\nAnd um [noise] you know ... and and I've lost so many really close friends\nUm you know like you you know you think about the people and the Sheikh organization the original she organization when I look at that original picture of us would Luther Vandross Bernard Edwards Tony Thompson Raymond Jones I'm ray Maldonado five people in that photo\nEvery male except for myself and Rob um have passed away every guy um [noise] and uh it just\nSo weird because I was the most reckless because I grew up\nWith the sort of most ... type ... parents you know um\nThat I you know I tell people that I've never been given a curfew in my entire life my parents never ever said to me now come home when the lights come on or anything like that because they knew that instinctively I knew to come home when there was nothing else to do we've got we've got one more song for you to listen to this\n[noise] [noise]\n\nJust a little taste of the new single from ...\nThe world fall said yeah featuring a ... a big mess and coach that they're going to come and grab you at some point I'm sure if you've been talking for so long but that's cool man the longer the is better for me as\nA last question the bit of an abstract one okay I assume that one of these days I'm going to get to watch the now Rogers' story on film you know what I mean I Want to get to see that you're a walk the line there's that you're really extraordinary life you've fled so let me put this to you you were watching the movie the credits are rolling [laughter] what song is playing\nWow that's a cool question I've never heard it put to me like that before I Would imagine it would be good times um and I think the reason why would be either good times or maybe we are family\nUm [noise] just because those two songs for us I'm\nReally were life changing and maybe I'm\nSo we're family was really important because we knew that we created\nYou know we created a phenomenon which is just such a Sledge yeah I mean it was like you know like we really proved to ourselves that we could do what we did for ourselves for someone else and maybe even better um\nAnd ... and and good times because of what happened after good times with hip hop I mean it's just you know um I I remember watching um uh an interview with El Al Quds Jay and they asked him they said uh uh what do you think is the single most important\nThing that ever happened in hip hop and he didn't even waste a minute he's uh [laughter]\nThe release of good times he says without good times and media that every mc ... what do you go home and write well why why it was a good time so important because good times had to break had the long break down at every time you went to a hip hop has which you know a lot of people who aren't of a certain age\nThey don't remember that at the beginning they would call those events hip hop's right going to a hip hop\nAnd I I remember when I first asked somebody about it what does that mean they said well you take something hip hop on it\nAnd I was like oh really they said yes so good times was really hip and we thought we'd come up we come up with our own lyrics for the breakdown in good times had this incredibly long break down which eventually wound up becoming\nYou know rappers delight and and a lot of other people were inspired matter of fact people most people don't realize that when I wrote good times\nI'm John Deacon from queen was actually in the studio with us and he came a one year to the day uh with another one bites the best with clean doo doo doo\nDoo doo doo doo doo doo [laughter] but they took it to your ... she took me to the first one yeah and it was out in Queens and that's when she says they now I Want to take you to a hip hop yeah wasn't hip hop show he was doing hip I'll take ... to ... how did you feel and you got there\nI couldn't believe it because the only song that was played was good times it was just over and over and over and over again for about maybe four hours and hours like aren't they sick of this song by now um and they were not sick\nOf it and every MC was just lined up and they had their rind ready for good times when they would come in and it was it was incredible thanks for coming in you got it now Rogers is a multi Grammy Award winning rock and Roll Hall of fame producer six new album ... it's about time that's out everywhere [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nAt a sheet and good times now Rogers produced wrote and plays guitar on that track if you missed my interview with ... or you
