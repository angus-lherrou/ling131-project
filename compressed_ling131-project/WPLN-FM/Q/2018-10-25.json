baseball I was reading it last night while watching the world series I was like well we're going to start out maybe by talking about that the red Sox and the Dodgers but you sit down and right before the end if you start to say I don't really know anything about baseball\nYou know I don't I I Know a little bit I've been to a couple of national games right I used to go to Yankees games as a kid when I Lived in New York\nUm and I I've written a book about basketball and football about soccer and this is it like my truly American novel I feel and so what is the American sport and it's baseball I mean at least from Americans prospective\nMaybe hockey next year I'm for us up here yeah there you go from Alexander is going to kick things off of the palm of\n... what are you going to be for us for I'm going to read the first put them in the book good I feel that good about it All right All right let's do this is the climactic under reading from swing\nWe we're halfway through junior year round in the base is about to score walk was still pretending like he wasn't weird and frightened cool Sam was busy being cool and find well her boyfriend Cruz was busy hitting home runs and being president of the I'm Still cool even my temper is lukewarm club\nAnd I was in the dugout mostly happy just watching trying to get up the nerve to get in the game things were pretty much normal baseball is still king\nBut people were also talking about the American flags randomly popping up around town on car windows malls in graveyards her feet on the freeway exit science anywhere everywhere we were best friends rounding the base is\nAbout to score everything was cool everything was called pathetic my best friend ... like to say\nUntil it wasn't\nComing Alexander reading prologue from his book swing you're the first author to come in and read and not look down at the page [laughter]\nWell you got to think about it like this I'm I've read that poem hundreds of times in

read to you I'm trying to sort of read with you if you may recall in school\nIn my mind I was I wrote love poems like the router and I played tennis so in my mind I was cool but nobody thought I was cool until senior year when I was the number one player in the district and\nAnd the most beautiful brilliant girl in high school we had a four point five GPA went to a problem with me because I had written her love for them so it took like a long time but finally senior year the poetry and the tennis so it kicked him but I always knew I was cool even if everyone else didn't think so\nWhen you went to schools to research this book um did you learn anything new about perhaps challenges that young people have to face now that we didn't have to face when we were in school\nWow I mean I think it's the same challenges it's it's a it's\nOn required to love it's a it's homework it's a family dramas sibling rivalry it's you know it's it's it's it's elevating escalated probably because of social media and you get every sort of you know out of\nOf information about what's happening in our lives but I think it's the same things and you know what I wrote this book I tried to write a book that I Would have wanted to read when I was twelve did ... did anything strike you as being\nDifferent and how you approached writing\nThe voices of these students than you would have written in your own voice in high school\nNo no not at all I mean here's the thing ah my dad always said call me if you if you are yourself\nIf you are constantly just in your own authentic self you will never go

she tells me when she thinks I'm not cool which is about Ninety percent of the time and but again I think and this is one of the points of the book\nCool is defined by you like you can't allow other people to defy you're cool for you and I think that's what ... are trying to figure out oh maybe ... sorry figure it out no is trying to get there\nYou're going to be another pollen from the book

Alexander has a new book out called swing and a father two teenage boys were knee deep and all of the drama of high school\nAnd navigating first love the freaking out about making the baseball teams are throwing house parties in short swaying is full of those kinds of moments that mean everything with a kid and Kwame Alexander sees the poetry and all that I mean literally swing and not necessarily a novel it's a story told your four hundred pages\nOf verse I'm I'm only sort of getting into the plot of the collection or the book or the novel\nBecause um it it takes in terms of my talk a little bit about that too but I'm happy to say the Kwame Alexander joins me live\nIn the keys duty to tell you more about it how's it going it's great how are you I'm very well I was going to have a six seeing as how the book is so centered around baseball I was reading it last night while watching the world series I was like well we're going to start out maybe by talking about the the Red Sox and the Dodgers but as you sit down and write for the interview start to say I don't really know anything about baseball\nYou know I don't I I Know a little bit I've been to a couple of national games right I used to go to Yankees games with the kid when I Lived in New York um and I I've written a book about basketball and football about soccer\nAnd this is it like my truly American novel I feel and so what is the American sport and it's baseball I mean at least from Americans\nProspective maybe hockey next year I'm for us up here yeah there you go calm Alexander's gonna kick things off of the palm of ... what are you going to read for us for I'm going to read the first time in the book good I feel that good about it All right All right let's do this is the climactic under reading from swing\nWe we're halfway through junior year rounding the bases about to score walk was still pretending like he wasn't weird and frightened cool Sam was busy being cool and find her boyfriend Cruz was busy hitting home runs and being president of the I'm so cool even my temper his lukewarm club\nAnd I was in the dugout mostly happy just watching trying to get up the nerve to get in the game things were pretty much normal baseball was still king\nBut people were also talking about the American flags randomly popping up around town car windows malls in graveyards her feet on the freeway exit science anywhere everywhere we were best friends rounding the base is\nAbout to score everything's cool everything was ... my best friend ... like to say until it wasn't\nComing Alexander reading prologue from his book swing you're the first author\nTo come in and read and not look down at the page [laughter]\nWell you got to think about it like this I'm I've read that poem hundreds of times in the past week\nUm stared it'd be right in the idol you did it I like to make connections with my audience I appreciate the I mean it's a it's an interactive experience you know I'm not just trying to read to you I'm trying to sort of read with you if you may recall in school\nI wrote love poems like the router and I played tennis so in my mind I was cool but nobody thought I was cool until senior year when I was the number one player in the district and\nAnd the most beautiful brilliant girl in high school we had a four point five GPA went to a problem with me because I had written her love poem so it took like a long time but finally senior year the poetry and the tennis so they kick them but I always knew I was cool even if everyone else didn't think so\nWhen you went to school to research this book um did you learn anything new about perhaps challenges that young people have to face now that we didn't have to face when we were in school\nWow I mean I think it's the same challenges it's it's a it's first crush is it's a on required that love it's a it's homework it's a family drama sibling rivalry it's\nYou know it's it's it's it's elevating escalated probably because of social media and you get every sort of you know\nOut of of information about what's happening in our lives but I think it's the same things and you know what I wrote this book I tried to write a book that I Would have wanted to read when I was twelve\nDid ... did anything strike you as being different and how you approached writing the voices of these students than you would have written your own voice in high school\nNo no not at all I mean here's the thing uh my dad always said climbing if you if you are yourself if you are constantly just in your own authentic self\nYou will never go wrong I don't try to write to kids and I try to write about young people for all of us so I'm not trying to find the latest slang or you know trying to be hip and cool as it is deemed hip and cool and two thousand Eighteen I just want to write a good book that tells a good story and I find that if I enjoy\nThe likelihood that you will probably you know amps up a bit yeah youngsters to Iran I got a ten year old and a twenty seven year old\nA different perspective to be so I've been through those teenage years with the twenty seven year old and and I guess I'm about to approach them and and apply everything I learned or didn't learn\nWith the rent or buy them to say how does that sound as if that's something you want to read\nMy ten year old read all of my stuff and she's you know she tells me when she thinks I'm not cool which is about Ninety percent of the time and but again I think and this is one of the points to the book\nCool is defined by you like you can't allow other people to define your cool for you and I think that's what ... are trying to figure out oh maybe ... sorry figured out no is trying to get there\nYou're going to be another power from the book right now or what what's it going to be\nI'm going to read a poem called let's see [noise] yeah I should have had this poem sort of\nEarmark I got to hear my earmark here if you want to
