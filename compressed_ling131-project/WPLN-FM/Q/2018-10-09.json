nine and for ... or public radio international\nMy name is Tom power have you ever felt\nLike it was too late to pick up something new like maybe you wish you could play the piano or you've always wanted to learn to play the shallow but come on your in your sixties can't learn how to play the cello right out according to listen to Williams who's pretty much the most important figure in American music or Americana music she be quick to tell you that it is never too late\nShe was forty five years old when she released her breakthrough record car wheels on a gravel road is one of the first big albums to blend traditional country music with Grady rock and roll and making a sound that's now defined as Americana\nTurn you know\nCome on you're going to\n\nThat is a cattle track from Cindy Williams Nineteen Ninety eight record car wheels on a gravel road which was adored by critics ended up winning a Grammy cartwheels in a gravel road turned twenty this past June and just before that big anniversary it's a new Williams joined me from a studio in LA and look back at that breakthrough moment\nAnd all she's accomplished since banned and much like listen as long rollercoaster career our conversation took some twists and turns you're going to hear her talk about what it's like to start out in the music industry so lays especially in an industry that values used\nShe also opened up about the recent deaths of some important people in our lives her father the poet Miller Williams for best buddy Tom Petty it's an emotional conversation and like all good ones one that took some time to warm up\nHere listening to Williams though taking you back to the record that changed everything for her car wheels on a gravel road\nI Know this is something you're probably either don't think about or you think about about our ten into that overnight bus ride\nHad such a big impact on so many people well I mean I think\nAbout it when I'm doing interviews like this yeah the mayor and the answer is I'm not really sure I mean I was completely shocked when this hour Warner Grammy religion and all that stuff happened yes I mean I never\nI mean it wasn't you know certainly a commercial elite a commercial sounding album for that time or anything marketing laws and all that there was a lot of confusion I remember you know and\nWhen this album came out I have to go to these you know conventions and that sort of thing and I was wearing a cowboy hat back then\nYou know I'm [laughter] God Forbid you know they said it shouldn't work cowboy hat because then they're going to take her country and\nYou know we're not marketing as marketing at at it as a country and so you don't want to confuse them by were a cowboy out you know yeah but you know for the some of the heavy metal God's or a cowboy hat I mean you know you do do you feel like they record but\nI'm just now when I was listening to it all his thinking while my local town so thin and\nLittle [laughter] you know but you know that's a good thing you want to retain as you move forward you want everything to sound better yeah you know\nI guess I'm an anomaly in that regard I don't know that I feel like I'm definitely singing better than I was then\nBut I Know this album nice to watch a lot of people I think it's mainly because of the song writing you know I think it was the the lawn narrative songwriting you know it sounds like\nAnd only say that you'll be my any no other arms entwined I always thought that was such a beautiful learnt yes it's beautiful yeah no I wasn't what I what I got ya I wanted to get your perspective on this because I I Know we're we're we're talking about death a fair bit here but I wanted to get some perspective on\nOr someone else who I Know my ... year which was Tom Petty who we lost so suddenly last year yeah what a town mean to you\nOh\nYou know we were starting to become really you know friends you know and it started with just a mutual admiration for each other's music and art you know and\nThat started with back in the nineties um he asked me to go out and open up for him which was a huge honor\nI went out and open I guess about ten dates forum or something like that or a couple of weeks or something and you know this was people still doesn't know most of the people there didn't know who I was still yeah you know who are coming to his shows and\nUm you know

was going on at a key\nCame out on stage before he went on one night yeah had said to his audience he said okay listen you guys listen up you need to listen to this artists genes important\nYou know and pay attention and I mean\nWhat other artists do you know who would do you know who would do that so open those shows for Tom and then he asked me he won I'm\nAsked cap musician or the year award

international\nMy name is Tom power have you ever felt\nLike it was too late to pick up something new like maybe you wish you could play the piano or you've always wanted to learn to play the cello but come on your in your sixties camp or how to play the cello right out according to listen to Williams who's pretty much the most important figure in American music or Americana music she ... to tell you that it is never too late\nShe was forty five years old when she released her breakthrough record car wheels on a gravel road there was one of the first big albums to blend traditional country music with gritty rock and roll and making a sound that now defined as Americana\nTurn have known would\nCome on you're going to\n\nThat is the title track similar similar Williams Nineteen Ninety eight record car wheels on a gravel road which was adored by critics ended up winning a Grammy cartwheels in a gravel road turn twenty this past June and just before that big anniversary but it's a new Williams joined me from a studio in LA and look back at that break\nThe band and much like listening to his long rollercoaster career our conversation took some twists and turns you're

our lives her father the poet Miller Williams for best buddy Tom Petty it's an emotional conversation and like all good ones one that took some time to warm up\nHere listen to Williams though taking you back to the record that changed everything for her car wheels on a gravel road\nListen I Know this is something you're probably either don't think about or you think about about our ten into that overnight bus ride but do you ever think about why that one had such a big impact on so many people\nWell I mean I think about it when I'm doing interviews like this yeah or I think the answer is I'm not really sure I mean I was completely shocked when this out one or Grammy and all that stuff happened yes I mean I never\nI mean it was a you know certainly a commercial elite a commercial sounding album for that time or anything marketing laws and all that there was a lot of confusion I remember you know and\nWhen this album came out I have to go to these you know conventions and it's sort of thing and I was wearing a cowboy hat back then\nYou know I'm [laughter] God Forbid you know they said he shouldn't work cowboy hat because then they're going to take her country and\nYou know we're not marketing as marketing at at it as a country and so you don't want to confuse them by our a cowboy out you know yeah I heard it on a good advice for that some of the heavy metal God's or a cowboy hats I mean you know you do do you feel like they record but\nI'm just now when I was listening to it all is thinking while my local town so thin and\nLittle [laughter] you know\nBut you know that's a good thing you want everything as you move forward you want everything to sound better yeah you know I guess I'm an anomaly in that regard I don't know that I feel like I'm definitely singing better than I was then\nBut I Know there's some nice to watch a lot of people I think it's mainly because of the song regarding you know I think it was the the lawn narrative songwriting you know it sounds like\nMind yeah it's beautiful yeah no I\nWasn't what I what I got ya I wanted to get your perspective on this because I I Know we're we're we're talking about death a fair bit here but I wanted to get some perspective on someone else who I Know a lot to you which was Tom Petty who we lost so suddenly last year yeah tell me do you\nOh\nYou know we were starting to become really you know friends\nYou know and\nIt started with just a mutual admiration for each other's music and art you know and that started with back in the nineties um he asked me to go out and open up for him which was a huge honor\nI went out and open I guess about ten days forum or something like that or a couple of weeks or something and you know this was people still doesn't know\nMost of the people there
