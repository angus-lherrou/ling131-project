Riley in the sisters brothers they play to guns for hire in the Old West\nThese two characters that is the worst southern accent in the world by the way the two characters come to you directly from the imagination of a guy named Patrick deWitt actually do it is a Canadian author who wrote a novel the sisters brothers back in twenty eleven it was one of those big instant hits\nIt when the governor generals award and the writers trust award and made the short list for the man Booker and the ... bank killer prize which is kind of like the Grammys and Juno's\nOf literature and that's about as good as it gets for a novelist in this country and this was only Patrick to its second book\nAll that attention was pretty new to him than I mean this is a guy who before he was a riot\nHe was a house painter well fast forward a few years and he should be starting to get used to the spotlight not only does the sisters brothers hit theaters tomorrow ... new novel French Exit just got short listed for this year's Geller prize so when we talked I had to start out with some congratulations\nPatrick welcome to Q. congrats on the nomination\nOh thanks very much it feels like a good week to BU man [laughter] um and\nYeah I I I have no complaints things are going well with a new book well\nAnd also the sisters brothers movie opens this weekend is it true that the whole idea for this story began with two words you wrote in your notebook sensitive cowboys\nThat was the very start yeah and that just um resulted in a in some dialogue between two men on horseback it occurred to me I mean growing up with my father I watched any number of westerns with them but I was watching I Believe it was one of the spaghetti westerns and I think it was ... just stylish villain in some of these films\nAnd I begin to wonder you know where does he shot or does it where does this man by his Cape and and and ah it occurred to me that the interior lives of the characters of westerns it's often obscured so I think that was sort of a where the sensitive part came in you know what what makes these men tick was the question\nThere's something really beautiful about that that this started with you watching an old western was leaving cleave and now the sisters brothers is a western movie itself so when you were writing it was it unfolding like a movie in your mind repatriating the scenes more cinematic terms\nIsn't that and then when ... again this is something they can\nAround that you get to like you don't touch in an experience that place that you came up with in your mind [noise] well I did\nYeah and that was just so so strange and wonderful that I could do this on the set was really expensive and there was all these sort of dead areas where there were no actors are cameras but they\nThey dressed it just in case they used it so I was sort of walking to these empty bar rooms and I'm saloons and and and um\nYou know stores where people were selling horses or whatever it was ... it was a very elaborate and labyrinth thing and thorough and just a you know what what a treat this was for me and how and how strange to get through experiences\nI had to trap it really it really would not not not to use non CBC language here but what a trip that must have been it really was yeah uh so you've written already written a screenplay for your new novel for French Exit what did you learn from this adaptation of this down to sisters brothers that you can take with you as you make more stories into films\n[noise] right I don't know that it'll necessarily influenced the way our rights I think\nThat my we're generally lends itself to screen play because of the amount of dialogue and so much of the story and the character um progression zone revealed through the things that they say or or don't say [noise]\nBut um I learned through this how difficult it is to make a sizable picture I mean John had this property in his possession before the book was\nPublished I think maybe before it was\nProperly accepted even so this is eight years ago and he's been working tirelessly he announced and to to to realize this film and it's taken them this long um it's just the um [noise]\nAs far simpler to write books you know I mean writing books has its own set of problems but you just sit down and do it you know but they're collaborative nature of film is something that I was just really impressed by how much\nA discussion and and um how many people are involved in the making of a film so I was humbled by it in a way it also made me appreciate my own focus um for its relatives simplicity\nBut it also you know I mean seeing I'm seeing sisters brothers film and enjoying it as much as I did it made me keen to do it again you know right so I think um\nIt was a best case scenario and then I think I could have come out of this experience thinking well I don't want to do that again but in fact I feel just the opposite so\nSo we mentioned that French acted is up for discussion painkiller congratulations again by the way Oh thanks very much how do you find out your shortlist did you get to the phone calls it an email\n[noise] well it was a there was an email but I don't have email at home so I didn't get the email till that afternoon and my friend ... who um will direct French acts that she actually called me and he assumed I knew but he was the one to tell me\nSo that was nice but then ... a moment after my father called and he was at the airport I'm heading actually to Paris himself\nAnd he said in his typically aggressive style he said well you made the short list you kiss ass [laughter]\n... you've been winter big awards before and and you've been asked about\nWinning awards before um I I I Hope I Hope you take this in in the way it's made but the sisters brothers was short listed for the ... it it didn't when I Do want to ask you because we never hear this perspective what is it like to be up for a huge prize and and not take it home\nYeah well I think the experience with the dealer and then with the book or as well um my feeling with with these two prizes as if you've made it to the shortlist and there is a sense that you one already and and I don't really have that hyper competitive spirit\nTo this point and then if it don't when they're disappointed or angry or or there's some you know negative response and we're supposed to learn the book read and feel that at all [noise] um\nIt's a it's a natural feeling to want to take it to the very end but it doesn't override the you know the sort of wonder and and and the brilliance of just being there in the first place so I have a feeling of being pleased that it's on the shortlist and I'm not really worrying about what comes next\n... would've been nice talking to you know use well thank you I'll see you at the at the dealer I'll be I'll be at the table excellent you can see the sisters brothers in theaters from tomorrow and you can pick up a copy of

is the guy is known as a bit of a troublemaker what they call them ... in the world fashion shaking things up as his kind thing\nHe was on cue a few weeks ago when I hear about that we were talking about him he made the controversial decision to remove the accent from the e in saline but now the fashion world scene the clothes he's designed for the brand and some are saying it represents a step backwards not just for Celine\nBut for women in general so cute fashion contributor Moshe lunchroom Halbert is back for another round on this story which is intersecting intersecting I should say not just fashion but also politics high motion how're you doing\nHi Tom my gosh we've got so much to discuss about this today I'm so excited to get into this\nAnd replace so Phoebe far low was once the in charge of saline is that right\n[noise] yes so the coals notes on the ... are that in uh Nineteen Ninety seven she succeeded Stella McCartney Chloe and was the creative director there um she took a bit of a break from fashion and to have children in two thousand and eight she became the creative director and board member of\nSaline and um this was a house that really had a lot of just classic bourgeoisie codes in French society and she really\nRevolutionized debt on and she came at a time when you think of the other designers that we're really making a splash with names like John ... Alexander McQueen mark Jacobs they are masters of artistry and\nBold creativity but not necessarily where ability and here comes ... she really represented for a lot of woman women the working woman who isn't perfect twos Harris and always done just right who doesn't look like\nSome kind of other worldly creature but really a real life woman that just wants to get down to work and on with her business\nSo I was looking at a lot of big sweaters are comfortable parents like it's it's stuff you can kind of where round stuff that that seems pretty comfortable\nYeah part of her magic in a war with the fact that these were all closed that you could picture yourself jumping into and having in your closet even if the prices were\nOftentimes astronomical the idea of that perfect slouches sweater or tailored trouser that was also a bit on the side to side an oversized jacket on these close felt very comforting a an effort less\nBecause she's out she's replaced by heavy ... who is this heavy slum in character again\n[noise] so how to use them and as a German designer\nAh he started at sound the wrong anti very famously kind of revolutionized the male wardrobe during his time at ...

the most polarizing social issues in the western worth it takes place I'm\nAt a center may represent a Planned Parenthood center that undergoing a mass shooting\nSo how do you write about that and somehow also writing a best seller majority Pico have an answer to that and she also\nEveryone who's going to have questions about her new book and you're going to hear her answer them right after right after that\n[noise]\n\n\nYeah [laughter] Mm [laughter]\n[laughter] Mm [laughter] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nYou're leaving Cuba was CBC Radio\nOn the radio international\n...\nWhen you pick up a novel why does it that you hope to find and willing to bet that even if you like escaping into another galaxy or some mama way back in time your favorite work of fiction still probably has something to say about the real world\nTake a book like uncle Tom's cabin or The Handmaid's tale these are novels that force readers to look at the world around them I really consider how far we've come in history and where we could be headed\nRight now in the U.S the investigation of judge Brett Kavanaugh is unfolding with all the plot twist of a political thriller and people are so invested in the story because the stakes are so high\nA lotta people say that if Kavanaugh becomes a Supreme Court judge the highest court in the land could overturn roe v wave women could lose legal access to abortion\nTo some that will be an incredible victory to others and unimaginable laws it's\nWithout raging in the background a new novel hit bookstores this week it's about a shooting at a reproductive health clinic the last place in Mississippi where a woman can get an abortion\nIt's called a spark of light\nAnd it's the new novel from Jodi Pico one of the best selling author is around right now\nJody joins me from New York City to tell me more about it I Jody high your author's note at the end of the book which is really as a as a resting as any other part of the book you write laws are black and white the lives of women or a thousand shades of gray tell me more about that\n[noise] that's actually why I wrote the book when I was in college I had a really good friend who was seven weeks pregnant or unwanted pregnancy\nVery upset and she and her boyfriend had many tearful nights and finally decided to get an abortion and I supported her a hundred percent\nYears later I was pregnant with my third child I was seven weeks pregnant and there was a complication and when I went to the doctor they said to me well you know either it's going to stick or it's not and I was devastated because to me that was already a baby and I couldn't figure out how I could hold both of those things in my mind\nThat two seven ... pregnancies you know one would be okay to go and have an abortion the other one to me it was already a baby that I wanted and that to me\nMade me think really hard I think how we define ourselves is not just a matter of whether we think we fall into a pro life or pro choice camp I think that for the same woman over the course of one lifetime you may sway little\nWhere do you find yourself right now\nI Am very strongly pro choice\nYou mean you talk to people all sides of this debate in your book what do you think people on the pro choice side might get wrong about people on the pro life side\nExactly what I did frankly you know I went into my interviews with people who are pro life making assumptions that were dead wrong\nI thought that these people were crazy religious zealots\nAnd what I found was that the people I spoke with were really nice people and they were people I Would have been friends with I Would have gone out to dinner with them we had tons of things in common we just didn't happen to agree on this one issue and people who are pro life the vast majority come from a place of deep compassion and deep convictions\nAnd what about the other side did you find there were things that are pro lifers or people in the pro life side you know about people in the pro choice either perhaps they should\nYes people assume that women who have abortions are using it as birth control that is a flat out lie no woman and I talked to a hundred and fifty one of them\nGoes to get an abortion just because it's easy it's not easy it is emotionally draining it takes a lot of time and a lot of money\nI should say for people who haven't haven't read the book that when you ...\nGroup of people who were added abortion commit to didn't abortion you did was no no no you get the respect of the of of of the doctors working to get the perspective of anti abortion protesters Jodie is it hard to write with empathy about a character with whom you strongly disagree\n[noise] I think it's my job to do that I Do not believe that as a writer it's my job to tell a reader what to think\nBut I Do think it's my job to present very fairly all sides of a situation lay out all the arguments so that as you're reading you can go through them and figure out why you believe what you believe you may change your mind but you may not\nAnd yet I bet it may be the first time you've ever really listen to what someone and opposition has to say yes you know we we tend when we know someone doesn't believe what we believe we tend to immediately judge them particularly in my country right now which is really broken and where people are on great divides\nWe've got to figure out how to have conversations and just listen\nJody go in your new book spark of like the story unfolds during a mass shooting a hostage taking either women's health clinic in Mississippi one called just the center I'm you spend a lot of time in clinics like the one in the story in this book\nWhat are the people who worked in these places tells you about their experiences and their fears about the kind of violence that you describe ...\nBook [noise] so if it's really fascinating and and frightening even in a city like Boston where a abortions are readily available and there are lots of clinics um when you go in there are guards and security and metal detectors and uh it feels like you're walking into a prison\nIn the deep south it's very different because although they also have security measures there is a gauntlet of protesters that you have to walk through just to get into the doors of the clinic\nI mean that's a lot emotionally that's a lot and if you are there to get an abortion that's also a lot 'cause you've you've really struggled believe me to come to that decision nobody makes it lightly\nBut also the doctors who we're bulletproof vests to the summit yes I mean I'm sure this is really you saw\nYes and it's interesting I I did a lot of work with a man named Dr Willie Parker who is the basis for a doctor ward in the book willy is a remarkable man I Love him he\nIs a devout Christian who says he provides these services not in spite of his religion but because of it he had a revelation while listening to a sermon about the good Samaritan and thought if I don't provide services for people who need it the most too well\nThis is Ninety point three WPN Len Nashville public

also\nEveryone who's going to have questions about her new book when you're going to hear her answer them right after right after that\n[noise]\n\n\nMm [laughter] [laughter]\n[laughter] Mm [laughter]\n\n\n\n[noise] you're CBC Radio one serious them on\nOn the radio international\nBack\nWhen you pick up a novel why does it affect you hope to find and willing to bet that even if you're like escaping into another galaxy or some moment way back in time your favorite work of fiction still probably has something to say about the real world\nTake a book like uncle Tom's cabin or The Handmaid's tale these are novels that forced readers to look at the world around them I really consider how far we've come and history and where we could be headed\nRight now in the U.S the investigation of judge Brett Kavanaugh is unfolding with all the plot twist of a political thriller and people are so invested in the story because the stakes are so high\nA lot of people say that if Kavanaugh becomes the Supreme Court judge the highest court in the lame could overturn roe v Wade women could lose legal access to abortion\nTo some that will be an incredible victory to others and unimaginable laws\nThat raging in the background of new novel hit bookstores this week it's about a shooting at a reproductive health clinic the last place in Mississippi where a woman can get an abortion\nIt's called a spark of light\nAnd it's the new novel from Jodi Pico one of the best selling author is around right now Jody joins me from New York City to tell me more about it Hi Jodie high your author's note at the end of the book which is\nReally as a as a resting as any other part of the book you write laws are black and white the lives of women or a thousand shades of gray tell me more about that\n[noise] that's actually why I wrote the book when I was in college I had a really good friend who was seven weeks pregnant or unwanted pregnancy\nVery upset and she and her boyfriend had many tearful nights and finally decided to get an abortion and I supported her a hundred percent\nYears later I was pregnant with my third child I was seven weeks pregnant and there was a complication and when I went to the doctor they said to me well you know either it's going to stick or it's not and I was devastated because to me that was already a baby and I couldn't figure out how I could hold both of those things in my mind\nThat two seven ... pregnancies you know one would be okay to go and have an abortion the other one\nTo me it was already a baby that I wanted\nAnd that to me made me think really hard I think how we define ourselves is not just a matter of whether we think we fall into a pro life or pro choice camp I think that for the same woman over the course of one lifetime you may sway little\nWhere do you find yourself right now\nI Am very strongly pro choice\nYou need you talked to people all sides of this debate in your book what do you think people on the pro choice side might get wrong about people on the pro life side\nExactly what I did frankly you know I went into my interviews with people who are pro life making assumptions that were dead wrong I thought that these people were crazy religious zealots and what I found was that the people I spoke with were ...\nHave gone out to dinner with them we had tons of things in common we just didn't happen to agree on this one issue and people who are pro life the vast majority come from a place of deep compassion and deep conviction\nWhat about the other side did you find there were things that are pro lifers or people in the pro life side and you know about people in the pro choice either perhaps they showed\nYes people assume that women who have abortions are using it as birth control that is a flat out lie no woman and I talked to a hundred and fifty one of them goes to get an abortion just because it's easy it's not easy it is emotionally draining it takes a lot of time and a lot of money\nI I should say for people who haven't haven't read the book that when you read this book you you you don't just get the perspective of people who are at an abortion coming to get an abortion you could receive no no no you get the prospect of the of of of the doctors working to get the perspective of anti abortion protesters Jodie is it hard\nTo write with empathy about a character with whom you strongly disagree\n[noise] I think it's my job to do that I Do not believe that as a writer it's my job to tell a reader what to think\nBut I Do think it's my job to present very fairly all sides of the situation lay out all the arguments so that as you're reading you can go through them and figure out why you believe what you believe you may change your mind you may not\nAnd yet I bet it may be the first time you've ever really listen to what someone and opposition has to say yes you know we we tend when we know someone doesn't believe what we believe we tend to immediately judge them particularly in my country right now which is really broken and where people are on great divides\nWe've got to figure out how to have conversations and just listen\nJody go in your new book spark of like the story unfolds during a mass shooting a hostage taking by the women's health clinic in Mississippi one called just the center um and you spend a lot of time in clinics like the one in the story in this book\nWhat are the people who work in these places tells you about their experiences and their fears about the kind of violence that you describe ...\nBook [noise] so if it's really fascinating and and frightening ... even in a city like Boston where a abortions are readily available and there are lots of clinics on when you go in there are guards and security and metal detectors\nAnd uh it feels like you're walking into a prison in\nThe deep south it's very different because although they also have security measures there is a gauntlet of protesters that you have to walk through just to get into the doors of the clinic\nI mean that's a lot emotionally that's a lot and if you are there to get an abortion that's also a lot 'cause you've you've really struggled believe me to come to that decision nobody makes it lightly\nBut also the doctors who we're bulletproof vests to the summit yes I mean I'm sure there's really saw\nAnd it's interesting I I did a lot of work with a man named Dr Willie Parker\nWho is the basis for a doctor ward in the book willy is a remarkable man I Love him if he is a devout Christian who says he provides the services not in spite of his religion but because of it he had a revelation while listening to a sermon about the good Samaritan and thought if I don't provide services for people who need it the most too well",
