I'm from Detroit Michigan\nBrandi drew has a story\nAt the end it's the kind of story that may lead people to quit conclusion so pay attention to euro right there is now in her late thirties a few years ago her life unraveled at a time\nYou around the dining services department at a senior living facility should being with a company that ran it for more than a decade one day\nShe made a mistake I was just in a rush to get home that was our because daycare close as I say I get off at five\nIt was like maybe a ten mile drive busy traffic area and I knew I had to pick up diapers and easiest thing for me I thought would be to pick 'em up a fire pit the baby up\nAround these stopped at a store run in and grab the diapers she swipe took credit card at the self checkout station and reached out\nIt turns out she used the wrong card not her own by the company credit card\nBetter what's crazy is I didn't realize at that moment I didn't realize it sound my supervisor calm in and said hey let's just purchased had she not said anything I don't think I Would have realized that\nRun to carry the card and kiss you needed to buy dining supplies for work should never had a problem before never be reprimanded she thought an apology and an explanation would do and her response was well you\nKnow we have to terminate you know I'm like no I didn't know that like can I just pay you back it was only like twelve month and she said now in cases like that you automatically have to terminate them play\nI just cried and cried like a day because I couldn't\nBelieve it I didn't want to go home and tell my kids what had happened and I didn't want to tell my husband what had happened I just didn't know what to do at that point I felt like a ... I felt like a failure as a parent because I didn't provide a a good example even though\nIt was a mistake brandy on more than her husband so the last of the job hit hard she found out that the loser she tried to bring in money doing odd jobs like cooking takeoff meals but the stress grew brandy and her husband began fighting\nShe had supported him when he's being laid off a few years earlier and she'd expected he'd do the same for her but she felt his situation was different he'd been laid off brandy was fired he was mad that she'd made a stupid\nMistake the final argument was that um I left the house that morning Alice gone to job interviews I had two interviews that day and I didn't purchase toilet paper son when he got home from work that day there was no toilet\nPeople in the poverty ... are actually very good at figuring out how to stretch the money they have to make it to tomorrow or the next week studies show that the poor tend to be better than the rich at knowing where you can find the best deals the cheap tube of toothpaste\nSomeone who is poor is often consumed with finding solutions to immediate problems how do I get food on the table today I'm not thinking about problems that are a few weeks away like the utility bill or gas money or credit card payment\nAs your as your checking the price was in a number and the prices and figure out if you took care of all you have enough money for breakfast you are forgetting things are paying less attention to your rent your kid's homework do other things that make you know live complete\nThe thing is as a result of doing this the underlying problem can become worse if you don't pay our bills you'll be even deeper and the whole next month\nScarcity in other words\nIs a trap the scarcity trap for us is\nAll those ways in which scarcity today begets behaviors which leads to even further scarcity tomorrow and we think it's something that poor people do people do is another example with the lonely do this so people who are lonely\nWill often engage in social interactions in a particular way which actually makes it harder for them to make friends\nJust as the poor focus on the money they do not have the lonely tend to focus on the\nFriends they do not have the result\nIs they try too hard to be like in a conversation lonely person might be so preoccupied with making a good impression that he can't pay attention to what's actually being set the conversation falters\nInstead of appearing likeable he's seen as awkward flat footed what happens as a result people avoid the composition of lists\nAnd the only person becomes even lonely [noise] this lens offers a new way of\nThinking about white people who find themselves in scarcity seem to do things that to an outsider look stupid when you're in a whole why would you take yourself even deep center says we're asking the wrong question\nWhat if it's not the poor people are somehow deficient but the poverty\nMake everyone less capable that it's the it's it's you\nAnd I tomorrow will be to become poor or with all of a sudden have the same effect the poverty is in some sense changing our mine's\nHow do we now this isn't some leading Haass theory to excuse irresponsible behavior and learning center wanted to test that hypothesis\nOf all this is true one thing that ought to be true is the same person when they're poor should have very different cognitive capacity than when they're rich\nDon't have the kind of money to go around making poor people rich but a sugar cane farmers actually create a natural experiment for us\nYes sugarcane farmers specifically those in India who are paid only once a year right after the harvest\nThe month after they get that income they're pretty rich\nBut like anybody who gets a huge windfall all at once the money gets spent a little too fast and so by the end of the harvest cycle they're relatively poor so now we have the same person a month before harvest poor in a month after harvest well off\nAgain you have the same group of people who are poor one moment and rich the next ... tested the farmers on their long term thinking when they had no money and when they had plenty of money the results were stunning\nWe found a huge difference so we found that post harvest when they're well off and they have much more impulse control\nFarmers who are rich tended to think about things that would help them over the long term mismatched other research that shows for example the farmers who are well off tend to read their feels more regularly then farmers who are poor\nFarmers who are poor mostly focused on how to make it to next week short too I'm thinking\nTo be clear it's not that poor people focus on immediate needs because that's all they want to think about it's all they can think about scarcity captures the mind like it did with those charming men in Minnesota in fact scarcity can actually knew or how you perform on an IQ test\nPut simply being poor is like having just pulled an all nighter\nNow if you've been very lucky maybe you've never experienced what it's like to be poor or hungry or lonely but they might be another former scarcity you have experienced\nOn Sundays we get to leave at four pm some days we don't leave until one AM [laughter] and then you usually start the next day at five thirty or six in the morning usually work eighty hours a week\nWhen

Need to make the most of them and it was like okay I Need to make sure I'm exercising keeping my body healthy and they need to read and stay on top of things so\nI'd come home after pretty long day and I might go walking for half an hour and then I had read and then I go to sleep um but then as time went on I decided to try to get in more exercise\nThan like I never know and I'll get enough exercise and so I started spending all my free daylight hours walking or running outside are going to the gym [noise] up to three hours a day plus like working Fifteen hours and then trying to read and then go to sleep\nAnd uh she focused intensely on to things she believed was key to her professional success [noise] Judy lost sight of things on the periphery [noise] she didn't know it but she was entering the tunnel of scarcity [noise] in her case it was ... he brought on by a lack of time\n[noise] so I wasn't going to the grocery store and my house wasn't impact yet and it was stressing me how [laughter] it was just a mess [noise] and um [noise] I've my clothes piled up I had a lot of dirty clothes and coming home just so overwhelming\nI didn't want to be there and that's part of I think why I was walking so much just to get out of the house and get away from all the things that haven't done an ounce of forgotten to pay a bill in the mix of all of that [laughter]\nSticks

you've ever being at least a little curious about the lives of the over well see this next segment is for you\nBroke Harrington is a sociologist at the Copenhagen business school in Denmark several years ago she decided to explore the secret lives of billionaires\nStrategy become a wealth manager [noise] Brooke discovered that in order to manage money for the super rich wealth managers none a lot about the private lives of their clients\nAnd they're very different set of rules that govern their world [noise]\nReal Cancun welcome to hidden brain thank you for having me on the show\nFor wealth managers to do their job broke I understand that they need to find out everything about it clients life not just appliance\nFinancial life but everything about their life give me some examples of the kind of compositions people have with wealth managers and the kind of issues they bring up about that personal circumstances that might affect how their wealth has managed\nWell usually starts with what's called know your client activity so if you were to come to me I was me acting as the wealth manager\nI Would first asked to see some proof of identity like your passport and then when he would talk about um what goals you had for your wealth\nAnd that begins the series of increasingly delicate an increasingly intrusive questions\nThen usually we get into whatever real reason is bringing you to me um maybe you want to avoid your taxes maybe you really don't like your family that's surprisingly common among wealthy people\nFor example if you have a um a relative or if you yourself are engaging in some activity that might get you started it may not be illegal but it might be socially shameful that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about\nIf you have a son or daughter with a drug problem that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about there can also be issues like I think I'm headed for a divorce but I don't want my spouse to get half my assets how do I hide those assets\nPreferably offshore so that whatever is is legally provable as mine is such a small amount that it's not worth fighting about\nSo it's really interesting because these professionals in some ways to get to know their clients better than the clients own family or friends or even their own spots\nYes it's it's apparently something of a cliche and the offshore world that\nThe average client is a a man in his fifties with a secret family somewhere might be a gay lover might be a common law wife and some children\nBut they're usually all sorts of secrets that these wealthy folks wish to keep hidden and that they have the additional privilege of being able to hire people to take care of in secret\nSo I understand you conducted about sixty five interviews in Eighteen countries for this book I'm trying to be a little bit about the people you're meant to be a wealth manager you have to understand financial the law but this kind of wrote also calls for a certain psychological makeup but what kind of person becomes was manager\nWill several of the people I spoke to describe themselves and only somewhat\nWeb streaming is made

institutions and retirement plans learn more at diversified trust dot com out of it you're lucky\nYou're writing your book about the extreme lengths such some managers go to please their clients or to provide services to their clients or you write about a manager named Eleanor in Geneva who said that one of her clients once called her from outside a restaurant in London tell me that story so this is one of the first\nStories that I heard that really made my eyebrows raise it was\nA while I was training to be a wealth manager\nEleanor told the story over lunch of receiving a phone call\nFrom my clients who lives in another country saying I've just lost my bracelet outside of a restaurant helped me find it\nAnd the client didn't identify the restaurants by name [laughter] so imagine having someone call you from another country I mean obviously the country was identified but not anything remotely approaching a location\nSo you have to sort of marvel at the maturity of the client expecting someone else to help her fix the problem like this but Eleanor somehow did it she she determined where the client was\nAnd what exactly had been lost and got the local authorities on the case found the bracelet and build the client for all the time and apparently the client was happy to pay\n... there are sometimes a client's do make request like this not because the are acting childish but because they actually have an ulterior motive they actually want to test the loyalties or ability off the wealth manager you tell the story of a wealth management Hong Kong named David\nYes he he got a call early on in his relationship with the client and went to the clients said that he was in Japan and he was meeting with a Japanese gentleman who had expressed a desire for smoked salmon and that this client had promised him I think a thousand sides of smoked salmon straight from the factory in Scotland\nAnd was now calling David saying get me the salmon\nAnd David said on on your wealth manager not your fish monger and the clients I'd well today you're the fish longer and so David happens to know someone who knew the head of the smoked salmon factory in Scotland and he he fulfilled the clients wish\nAnd the client later told him I basically made up that story I wasn't sitting across from a Japanese fellow who\nWanted a thousand side to smoked salmon I just needed to see that you had the connections and the will to do what I wanted one I wanted and not ask any\nQuestions one thing that I got from your book is that there are important ways in which the very rich are very much like the rest of us and ways in which they are not up so wealthy people unsurprisingly turn out to have troubles marriages and we were children just like you know everybody else\n... but wells you argue Ken compound those challenges\nWell apparently it's it's not uncommon for the wealth manager to be asked to find a recommend rehab facilities for kids or parents will ask of wealth manager to break some bad news\nTo the next generation to to his or her own children sometimes to the wealth manager has to broker a truce between feuding family members say one family member feels that they've been done done by unfairly\nIn the inheritance plan\nAnd has to be somehow brought back in so that they don't sue the family the big risk here is if you have a disgruntled family member

that are a few weeks away like the utility bill or gas money or credit card payment\nAs your as your checking the prices and remembering the prices and figure out if he took care of all you have enough money for breakfast you are forgetting things are paying less attention to your rent your kid's homework do other things that make you know live complete\nThe thing is as a result of doing this the underlying problem can become worse if you don't pay our bills you'll be even deeper and the whole next month\nScarcity in other words\nIs attract the scarcity trap for us is all those ways in which scarcity today begets behaviors which leads to even further scarcity tomorrow and we think it's something that poor people do people do is another example we think the lowly do this\nSo people who are lonely will often engage in social interactions in a particular way which actually makes it harder for them to make friends\nJust as the poor focus on the money they do not have the lowly tend to focus on the friends\nThey do not have the result is they try too hard to be locked in a conversation the lonely pushing might be so preoccupied with making a good impression that he can't pay attention to watch actually being set the conversation falters instead of appearing likeable he's seen as awkward are flat footed\nPeople avoid the composition of lists and the only person becomes even lonely this lens offers a new way of thinking about white people who find themselves in scarcity seem to do things that\nTo an outsider look stupid when you're in a whole why would you take yourself even deeper Sanders says we're asking the wrong question what if it's not the poor people are somehow deficient but the poverty\nMake everyone less capable that it's the it's it's you\nAnd I tomorrow will be to become poor or with all of a sudden have the same effect the poverty is and Simpsons changing our minds\nHow do we know this isn't some leading house theory to excuse irresponsible behavior and out in ... wanted to test that hypothesis\nDoes all this is true one thing that ought to be true is the same person when they're poor should have very different cognitive capacity than when they're rich\nSo how would we test that well unfortunately we don't have the money to go around making poor people rich but a sugar cane farmers actually create a natural experiment for us\nYes sugarcane farmers specifically those in India who are paid only once a year right after the harvest\nThe month after they get that income they're pretty rich\nBut like anybody who gets a huge windfall all at once the money gets spent a little too fast and so by the end of the harvest cycle they're relatively poor so now we have the same person a month before harvest poor in a month after harvest well off\nAgain you have the same group of people who are poor one moment and rich the next ... tested the ... on the long term thinking when they had no money and when they had plenty of money the results were stunning\nWe found a huge difference so we found that post harvest when they're well off and they have much more impulse control\nFarmers who are rich tended to think about things that would help them over the long term this matched\nOther research that shows for example the farmers who are well off tend to read their feels more regularly and farmers who are poor\nFarmers who are poor mostly focused on how to make it to next week short term thinking\nTo be clear it's not that poor people focus on immediate needs because that's all they want to think about it's all they can think about scarcity captures the mind like it did with those charming men in Minnesota in fact scarcity can actually knew or how you perform on an IQ test\nPut simply being poor is like having just pulled an all nighter\nNow if you've been very lucky maybe you've never experienced what it's like to be poor or hungry or lonely but they might be another former sketch city you have experienced\nOn

order to manage money for the super rich wealth managers learn a lot about the private lives of that clients and they're very different set of rules that govern their world [noise]\n\nRecounting welcome to hidden brain thank you for having me on the show\nFor wealth managers to do their job broke I understand that they need to find out everything about it clients life not just appliance\nFinancial life but everything about their life gives me some examples are the kind of compositions people have with wealth managers and the kind of issues they bring up about that personal circumstances that might affect how their wealth is managed\nWell usually starts with what's called know your client activity so if you were to come to me I was me acting as the wealth manager\nI Would first asked to see some proof of identity like your passport and then we would talk about um what goals you had for your wealth\nAnd that begins a series of increasingly delicate an increasingly intrusive questions\nThen usually we get into whatever real reason is bringing you to me\nUm maybe you want to avoid your taxes maybe you really don't like your family that's surprisingly common among wealthy people\nFor example if you have a um a relative or if you yourself are engaging in some activity that might get you started it may not be illegal but it might be socially shameful that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about\nIf you have a son or daughter with a drug problem that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about there can also be issues like I think I'm headed for a divorce but I don't want my spouse to get half my assets how do I hide those assets preferably offshore so that whatever is\nSuch a small amount that it's not worth fighting about\nSuicide already interesting because these professionals in some ways get to know their clients better than the clients own family or friends or even their own spots\nYes it's it's apparently something of a cliche and the offshore world that\nThe average client is a a man in his fifties with a secret family somewhere might be a gay lover might be a common law wife and some children\nBut they're usually all sorts of secrets that these wealthy folks wish to keep hidden and that they have the additional privilege of being able to hire people to take care of in secret\nSo I understand you conducted about sixty five interviews in Eighteen countries for this book I'm trying to be a little bit about the people you're meant to be a wealth manager you have to understand financing the law but this kind of wrote also calls for a certain psychological makeup but what kind of pushing it becomes a wealth manager\nWill several to people I spoke to describe themselves and only somewhat joke in terms of social workers for the rich [laughter] you have to have a\nEmpathy and a desire to help people but also a very high tolerance for people who would otherwise seem to be so extremely privileged that you might be otherwise inclined to smack him around and say snap out of it you're lucky\nYou're writing your book about the extreme lengths that some managers go to ... or to provide services to their clients or you write about a manager named Eleanor in Geneva\nWho said that one of her clients once called her from outside a restaurant in London told me that story so this is one of the first stories\nThat I heard that really made my eyebrows raise it was\nA while I was training to be a wealth manager Eleanor told the story over lunch of receiving a phone call\nFrom my clients who was in another country saying I've just lost my bracelet outside of a restaurant helped me find it\nAnd the client didn't identify the restaurants by name [laughter] so imagine having someone call you from another country I mean obviously the country was identified but not anything remotely approaching a location\nSo you have to sort of marvel at the maturity of the client expecting someone else to help her fix the problem like this but Eleanor somehow did it she she determine where the client was\nAnd what exactly had been lost and got the local authorities on the case found the bracelet and build the client for all the time and apparently the client was happy to pay\n... there are sometimes a client's do make request like this not because they're acting childish but because they actually have an ulterior motive they actually want to test loyalties or ability off the wealth manager you tell the story of wealth management Hong Kong named David\nYes he he got a call early on in his relationship with a client in which the clients said that he was in Japan and he was meeting with a Japanese gentleman who had expressed a desire for smoked salmon and that this client had promised him I think a thousand sides of smoked salmon straight from the factory in Scotland\nAnd was now calling David saying get me the salmon and David said no I'm I'm your wealth manager not your fish monger and the clients I'd well today you're the fish longer and so David happens to know someone who knew the head of the smoked salmon factory in Scotland and he he fulfilled the clients wish\nAnd the client later told him I basically made up that story it I wasn't sitting across from a Japanese fellow who\nWanted a thousand side to smoked salmon I just needed to see that you had the connections and the will to do what I wanted one I wanted and not ask any\nQuestions one thing that I got from your book is uh\nVery rich are very much like the rest of us and ways in which they are not up so wealthy people unsurprisingly turn out to have troubled marriages and where what children just like you know everybody else ... but well you argue ... compound those challenges\nWell apparently it's it's not uncommon for the wealth manager to be asked to find a recommend rehab facilities for kids or parents will ask the wealth manager to break some bad news\nTo the next generation to to his or her own children sometimes to the wealth manager has to broker a truce between feuding family members say one family member feels that they've been done done by unfairly\nIn the inheritance plan\nAnd has to be somehow brought back in so that they don't sue the family the big risk here is if you have a disgruntled family member who sues\nThe lawsuit process and many countries makes public many many private documents that would reveal the extent in nature of the family's wealth all of which has had been carefully guarded secrets", "year": "2018",
