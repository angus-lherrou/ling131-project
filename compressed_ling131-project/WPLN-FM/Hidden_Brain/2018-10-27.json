election I'm Wondering if you could paint a picture for me Joan of who you include in this group and how you distinguish them from the very wealthy and the poor\n[noise] um in order to understand American politics really for the past forty years you need to find three different groups\nOne is the poor I'm within meeting annual income of around I'm Nineteen thousand dollars that's the bottom thirty percent of Americans buy household income and then that topped the professional manager of the elite is the top twenty percent by household income\nUm and I find that as top twenty percent in my household income with one college grad\nThe group that's being called the working class is the group in the middle it's the middle fifty three percent with the median household income in the in the seventies that's the group that's called the working class although they actually are the middle class\nYou have some startling statistics about wages in this middle group over the last half century uh what's happened to them economically uh starting let's say Nineteen Seventy [noise]\n\nJones says blue collar family sphere resentment not only to the people above them on the social ladder but sometimes to those beneath her she told me a personal story about her sister in law who comes from a blue collar background she walked at a daycare that serve low income families as she found herself getting frustrated with some of the mothers\nOne of them had showed up with a shopping bag from Macy's um and she was furious because she felt you know she's on\nPublic assistance and she can shop at Macy's and hike I Can't even afford to shop at Macy's so that was part of it\nI'm also ... she was very angry when the ... she was in head start she was teaching in ... as a head start teacher some of these um ladies were late and she was furious because she had to pay a dollar a minute\nTo her daycare which she paid for when she was late picking up her kid and they were making her late and they weren't paying white Americans white blue collar Americans tend to have quite a judgmental attitude towards the poor\nAnd they're judgmental attitude stems from their own self image of themselves as\nKeeping their nose clean keeping on the straight and narrow hard work everyday forty or straight whereas the poor are seen as kind of hard living\nDrugs sex rock and roll um didn't have the self discipline and now I have to pay for them [noise] Mm\nJones says working class people have come to issue but government benefits and government programs are not for them when her own working class father in law started to suffer from dementia Jones suggested to her mother in law that you apply for some help her reaction was striking [noise]\nMade her reaction was oh I'm not even gonna bother to ask the government doesn't care about hardworking people like us it just cares about the poor\nUm and in fact you know we urged her and she did get um government help when my father in law had dementia and they\nDeliver it to help and they deliver it quite efficiently but it was that was not her assumption you know it doesn't hurt job to know that it's the job of the people were designing the ...\nMake sure that Americans know that and they have seriously dropped the ball\nOne of the things that people have often noticed is that there is a political gap between urban areas in rural areas but one of the things I took away from your book\nIs that the gap is really between people who are cosmopolitan in their outlook and people who are not going to be people who are very much at home working in Washington or New York or working tomorrow in London or Shanghai but there are also people in the u._k. and in the U.S while routed to that community in a way that's very different\nAnd in some ways they resent the people who are cost a politician because they can pick up and leave and they don't have sort of the same\nTies are the same obligations to local communities that they feel that they do\n[noise] um that's very very true I mean there's there it does map on to class but breaks it and Trump's election we're both a revolt of the areas that have been left behind\nFor example if you look at the ... the counties that voted for Clinton roughly five hundred counties did\nI'm twenty six hundred counties voted for Trump but the five hundred counties that voted for Clinton represent two thirds of our GDP\nThat twenty six hundred counties that voted for Trump represent only one third\nThe people who voted both for brags that and for Trump where those people who are left behind economically\nAnd left behind culturally as you point out because these are people who have these small very localized very deep rooted um clique networks of family and friends they've known forever\nThey actually social science studies show that this group is more focused on um community and solidarity in contrast to the professional managerial lead toward more focused on individual achievement and self development\nWhen you think about the ways a blue collar America and the elites relate to their work uh I I Want to go back in some ways to the the exchange said your husband had with his former classmate\nIn some ways by asking what do you do a elites are asking what another yes it's a it's a form of social display\nBut it's also a former saying work is really how you define who you are it's an important part of your identity whereas as you point out in the book for blue collar America work is really a means to an end\n[noise] work is what you do to support your family um so it's complicated hard work is valued among both groups and that's one of the key ways we should begin to forge a bridge between these two groups\nBut the hard work is a matter of of of persevering and staying in that job despite the fact that you make kind of hate it in order to support your family and provide them with a settled family life\nOn elites are completely defined by\nTheir jobs you know what am I I and a lawyer I and a techie\nI'm just total self definition in terms of your job is one of the emblematic elements of the elite many people maybe blue collar folks think um the elite is just a bunch of\nSort of pathetic power hungry pencil pushers who spend their whole lives sucking up to each other and confused their jobs with their lives [noise]\nRight right right\nRight\nAlso a huge class divide when it comes to the value of education many residue people believe that education\nYou need to get a good education but as you point out on the book Joan this idea is a much more controversial idea among the white working class white\nGoing to college is really really risky for these groups um first of all of course coach debt is what could tripled I'm In recent years so it's very risky to start to go to college and many of them ultimately dropped out there's very much higher dropout rate among class migrants people from\nNon elite um backgrounds I'm so often they end up\nPaying back large college debts on the wage of a high school graduate and they see that they see it as a very very risky in addition that they they typically don't get in to the same colleges and social science studies show that\nUh if you give people an identical school will record and one from an elite family in one from a ... a white working class family that white working class family\nHas a kid has to actually be about three times as good as the delete family kid in order to get to be seen as equally strong\nIt doesn't end there in one study Jones says researcher sent out to satchel resumes to employers the resumes what identical except for one difference\nOne set off a blue collar signals like pick up soccer like country music the other set off elite signals water polo classical music or Mr water polo not sixteen times the number of call backs as Mr country music\nSo you may go through all of this process encourage all of this debt and then because you know so to speak you don't know what four to use\nYou may not get I'm a ... a professional job anyway\nJoan Williams argues that these class differences rooted not just an economic hardship but in psychological shame and cultural humiliation play out in politics when we come back we'll explore different theories about why the white working class tip the twenty sixteen

California taxes we already are majority minority states meaning that the majority of the population are made up of\nOf people of color and most of whom are an immigrant descendents so the U.S and says predicts that by twenty fifty one out of every four Americans are going to be of Latino or Hispanic origin I mean that's that's quite astonishing\nSo while there are these large numbers of immigrant families in the United states do these families as you point out account for a relatively small share of the voting population and in some ways this is the source of the friction intention that's the heart of your book\nThat's right and you know I think part of it is that is an issue that is easily understood by the public or\nThe fact that undocumented immigration is a very easy issue in the sense that it for the average American voter or you can understand somebody who breaks the law and enters the country without proper documentation and that is a violation of our laws in orders that that can easily animate people\n... and it seems to me that's closely connected would walk polls show more is a half of white Americans seem to believe that immigrants are burden to us society and it's like majority saying that Latinos out to the\nCrime problem that's right and again if you actually look at the data itself right those those perceptions are not the reality particularly when it comes to crime so\nJust like many things that's happening right now in politics what people perceive what the truth is and what the facts are are very different from what the actual evidence is\n[noise]\nRapid demographic shift ... and high not argue have created feelings of threat among white voters especially the white working class [noise] these threats come in different forms [noise]\nCultural and economic threat as far as I'm concerned\nLook at it on the hill understand if the threat advanced policy as opposed to the country and to them\nSo you have multiple trends happening at the same time on the one hand you have these rapid demographic shift you also have fees increasing feelings of threat among many white voters\nAnd simultaneously you also have a situation where one political party is seen as being more responsive\nTo the anxieties of white voters than the other one\nThat's right I think the Republicans have really\nTaken all of these multiple factors into consideration and used it to capitalize on a central message and theme that can really again mobilize their voters and the fact that their base is overwhelmingly white means that they can have\nA central message such as immigration that can activate and mobilize their voters into not only supporting their candidates but also supporting the kinds of issues that they want to advocate for\nThere's been some criticism that while this was a short term strategy and if they're gonna they're going to suffer in the future and that may be the case but for the president it's an extremely successful strategy as we've seen\nYou won't you looked at what happens in states as the demographics of states start to change so as the Latino populations in states starts to increase for example what do you find in terms of the behavior of white voters\nWell what you typically see is that as the population of a\nLatino voters have increased you start to see the shift in\nThe political behavior of white voters to support the Republican candidate and uh [noise] that would be consistent with the theory that immigration is explaining the voting preferences of white voters you know we wrote this book before the twenty sixteen elections so\nFor better or worse some would say that it was ... into the ... of the outcome but it was just remarkable to us that when we were putting together this this book and our analysis is that\nFrom all these different angles not just of you know I'm cool white voters supported but also the kinds of policies that they favor that it was really just\nThat immigration was such a strong and important predictor and all of these different a political outcomes that we were exploring and so\nI think that's where this idea that it was really this white backlash towards immigration that currently the political climate we live in today [noise]\nUm [noise]\nWhen we come back what ... hunters thesis about a white backlash means what politics and

to that community in a way that's very different and in some ways they resent the people who are costs will politician because they can pick up and leave and they don't have sort of the same\nTies with the same obligations to local communities that they feel that they do\n[noise] um that's very very true I mean there's there it does map on to class but breaks it end Trump's election we're both a revolt of the areas that had been left behind\nFor example if you look at the ... the counties that voted for Clinton roughly five hundred counties did\nI'm twenty six hundred counties voted for Trump but the five hundred counties that voted for Clinton represent two thirds of GDP\nThat twenty six hundred counties that voted for Trump represent only one third\nThat people who voted both for bragged that and for Trump where those people who were left behind economically\nAnd left behind culturally as you point out because these are people who have these small very localized very deep rooted um clique networks of family and friends they've known forever\nThey actually social science studies show that this group is more focused on um community and solidarity in contrast to the professional managerial lead or more focused on individual achievement and self development\nWhen you think about the ways a blue collar America and the elites relate to their work uh I I Want to go back in some ways to the the extremes that your husband had with his former classmate\nIn some ways by asking what do you do a elites are asking what another yes the it's a it's a form of social display but it's also a form of saying work is really how you define who you are it's an important part of your identity whereas as you point out in the book for blue collar America work is really a means to an end\n[noise] work is what you do to support your family um so it's complicated hard work is valued among both groups and that's one of the key ways we should begin to forge a bridge between these two groups\nBut the hard work is a matter of of of persevering and staying in that job despite\nIn order to support your family and provide them with a settled family life um elites are completely defined by their jobs\nYou know what am I I Am a lawyer I and a techie I'm just total self definition in terms of your job is one of the emblematic elements of the elite many people maybe blue collar folks think um the elite is just a bunch of\nSort of pathetic power hungry pencil pushers who spend their whole life sucking up to each other and confused their job with their lives\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nThere's also a huge class divide when it comes to the value of education many residue people believed that education is the key to a better life that if you want to get ahead you need to get a good education but as you point out of the book Joan this idea is much more controversial idea among the white working class white\nGoing to college is really really risky for these groups um first of all of course coach debt is what could tripled I'm In recent years so it's very risky\nTo start to go to college and many of them ultimately dropped out there's very much higher dropout rate among class migrants people from non elite um backgrounds I'm so often they end up\nPaying back large college debts on the wage of a high school graduate and they see that they see it as very very risky in addition that they they typically don't get in to the same colleges and social science studies show that\nUh if you give people an identical will record and one\nFrom an elite family and one from a ... a white working class family that white working class family has a kid has to actually be about three times as good as the delete family kid in order to get to be seen as equally strong\nIt doesn't end there in one study Jong says researchers sent out to such a resume to employers the resumes what identical except for one difference\nOne set off a blue collar signals like pick up soccer like country music the other set off elite signals water polo classical music or Mr water polo cuts sixteen times the number of call backs as Mr country music\nSo you may go through all of this process encourage all of this debt and then because you know so to speak you don't know what four to use\nYou may not get I'm a ... a professional job anyway\nJoan Williams argues

states like California Texas we already are majority minority states meaning that the majority of the population are made up of\nOf people of color and most of whom are immigrant descendents so the U.S census predicts that by twenty fifty one out of every four Americans are going to be of Latino or Hispanic origin I mean that's that's quite astonishing\nSo while there are these large numbers of immigrant families in the United states do these families as you point out a calling for a relatively small share of the voting population and in some ways this is the source of friction intention that's at the heart of your book\nThat's right and you know I think part of it is that is an issue that is easily understood by the public or\nThe fact that undocumented immigration is a very easy issue in the sense that it for the average American voter you can understand somebody who breaks the law and enters the country without proper documentation and that is a violation of our laws in orders that that can easily\nMe that's closely connected with walk polls show more as a half of white Americans seem to believe that immigrants are burden to us society and it's like majority things are Latinos out to the crime problem\nThat's right and again if you actually look at the data itself\nRight those those perceptions are not the reality particularly when it comes to crime so just like many things that's happening right now in politics what people perceive what the truth is and what the facts are are very different from what the actual evidence is\n[noise]\nRapid demographic shift ... and high not argue have created feelings of threat among white voters especially the white working class [noise] these threats come in different forms [noise]\nCultural economic\nThreat as far as I'm concerned they're stealing draws political tract\nWhy Republicans on the hill understand the threat of Venus policy as opposed to the country and to them\nSo you have multiple trends happening at the same time on the one hand you have\nThese rapid demographic shift you also have these increasing feelings of threat among many white voters and simultaneously you also have a situation where one political party is seen as being more responsive\nTo the anxiety of white voters than the other one\nThat's right I think the Republicans have really\nTaken all of these multiple factors into consideration and used it to capitalize on a central message and theme that can really again mobilize their voters and the fact that their base is overwhelmingly white means that they can have\nA central message such as immigration that can activate and mobilize their voters into not only supporting their candidates but also supporting the kinds of issues\nThat they want to advocate for there's been some criticism that while this was a short term strategy and if they're gonna they're going to suffer in the future and that may be the case but for the president it's an extremely successful strategy as we've seen\nYou've also looked at what happens in states as the demographics of states start to change so as the Latino populations in states starts to increase for example what do you find in terms of the behavior of white voters\n[noise] well what you typically see is that as the population of a\nLatino voters have increased you start to see the shift in the political behavior of white voters to support the Republican candidate and uh that would be consistent with the theory that immigration is explaining\nThe voting preferences of white voters you know we wrote

pundits that Trump was running a campaign that was out of touch with a diverse America but but in many ways your book shows he was actually running a campaign that was perfectly in touch with the anxieties of white voters\nThat's right I think what ... Smith says that Trump is in trying to attract all voters across the United states he knew exactly what demographic and what base he was speaking to and so again with these kinds of emotional appeals\nThat are tied to a specific group of individuals\nThat pitch that message resonated as we all know now extremely well with his supporters and I think it was compounded also by the fact that we had eight years and Obama presidency and so it's immigration also tied in with the issue of race and this is why\nThe subtitle of our book as immigration race and politics because the two things ... if they've at least in the context of the United states they go hand in hand with one another and so you have eight years\nOf the presidency of the first African American president of the country coupled with\nAt the specific campaign message of immigration [noise] ah altogether tie and a lot of that racial resentment that happened in the past eight years I think it just is what galvanized his campaign and its presidency\nSo one one disturbing implication from your thesis Morris as we head into a situation where we have different political parties who people of color and people who are white and an increasingly what this means is that our political devised become racial divide indeed\nAnd that I one of the uh again more\nThat really you know race as we all know it's such a fundamental cleavage in our society but I think also Republican willingly took on that strategy and are using it to their advantage clearly [noise] there's an interesting tension\nHere it seems to me for both the Democratic party and the Republican Party you know we we alluded to there's some time earlier but what might be the interest of each party in the short term might not be an interest in the long term\nCan can you talk about that from the point of view of both the Democratic party and the Republican Party\nShore I mean for the Republican Party\nRight now they're an overwhelmingly white party and as we know with the way demographics are shifting in the United states we're going to become increasingly\nA majority minority country that at some point that strategy is going to be short lived right so but again for the time being for the next five to ten years it works so I I I think their senses well let's just go with it right they're not looking further beyond twenty Thirty years from now", "show_name": "Hidden Brain", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "27"}
