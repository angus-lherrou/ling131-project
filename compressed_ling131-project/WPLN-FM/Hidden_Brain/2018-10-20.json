biology\nOn a regular basis right before an election someone was sharing article with me about how science\nProves that the brains of liberals are stunted or post on Twitter let's say Republicans are less intelligent than Democrats\nThese claims obscure something far more interesting and far more accurate there are genuine psychological differences between liberals and conservatives understanding these differences can give us fresh insight into our political conflicts\nJohn hitting as a political scientist at the University of Nebraska Lincoln he\nHas spent many years studying the psychological and newer logical differences between liberals and conservatives he is co author of the book predisposed liberals conservatives and the biology of political differences John welcome to hidden brain thank you Shankar pleasure to be with you when\nMost of us think about how we came to our political views John we have a relatively straightforward explanation that has to do with our upbringing and background how does that theory go well\n[noise] whenever asked my students were their political views come from the first thing I say their parents\nAnd I think we have the sense that those views that our parents have passed along or supplemented by those you know from a clergy member I trust the relative\nNow it's important to stipulate you know John that it's entirely possible these politicians they might indeed be saying things that are just politically strategic but how my differences in threat perception shaped the way liberals and conservatives in general think about the subject of immigration\nYeah I really think or you know immigration defense or police law and order but I think that's what's really at the core of of who we are not the quarter political differences\nSo you know if I Am a person like Wayne LaPierre who uh who feels these threats and thinks they're all around us then it seems to me I Would want a set of policies put forward by our government that helps to reduce those threats and how am I going to do this\nI'm going to do it by allowing people to be well armed I'm going to do it by spending a lot on defense I'm going to empower police\nOr I'm going to have the death penalty I'm going to not allow immigrants to come here or if they do they're going to be extremely vetted as the president wants to\nSo you know those I think to a threat sensitive mindset are steps that you know the ... they only make sense does it they can't really understand why anybody would be opposed to those kinds of things because this would help us to be a safer place\nWill\nNow there are all kinds of confounding factors when it comes to studying how politicians speak in the two of a political considerations that are difficult to disentangle\nFrom psychological and biological traits but John another study these differences in experimental settings John one showed liberals and conservatives positive and negative pictures and he found they reacted very differently\nA positive picture it'd be something like a beautiful sunset or somebody enjoying themselves on a ski slope I'm happy child a negative picture would be things like I'm a house or just been leveled by hurricane um or a guy eating worms or children who are malnourished\nWe have people hooked up to some physiological devices I'm the most obvious one is a lot for ... activity or skin productions which is a common way of seeing if somebody is just having a reaction having a physiological arousal to that a stimulus\nAnd what we found is that uh people do have arousal when they see these kinds of him and just because they're they have some emotional content but we tend to find that liberals were more reactive to the positive images and conservatives are more reactive to the negative images\nI understand that in one brain imaging study that you've conducted volunteers was shown disgusting images and brain activation from even a single image was actually pretty good at being able to tell who was liberal and who was conservative\nThat is true that have been a a three or four studies that attempt to see if the brain activation patterns of liberals and conservatives\nWeb streaming is made possible by diversify trust and independent wealth management firm offering an integrated approach to the investment trusts estates and philanthropic needs of individuals' multigenerational families institutions and retirement plans learn more at diversified trust dot com and results\nAnd we could be incredibly accurate knowing whether they're liberal or conservative just on the basis of that\nLiberals brains when they looked at\nA mutilation images were much more active in a part of the brain called the U.S to matter of sensory too\nAnd that's the part of the brain that will will be activated if you suffer pain so if if I kick you in the ... century would be active\nBut it's also active if you see pain and others and so if you would see a movie of somebody's stepping on a rusty now goes right through their fucked you're some at a center to it'd be active and what we saw in these in these brain scans was that liberals were more likely to have activation matter of sensory too conservative\nDoesn't mean that conservatives are hard hard and uh just means that that things are happening differently when they see these different images\nNow you could argue that a lot of this research is ... you could also argue that a lot of the patterns that John and others fine are consistent with the power of upbringing in shaping political preferences\nHere's how let's see I'm raised in a conservative home I learned to be politically conservative from my parents but my family also influences all kinds of other things about me that have nothing to do with politics the shape the kind of food I like to eat the kind of movies I like to watch the kind of sports I enjoy\nBy this line of reasoning the fact that liberals and conservatives are different on all manner of things is it about biology it just shows you how your family environment can affect lots of things about you\nKnow\nDoes it really interesting way to separate the effects of biology from the environment and think about fraternal an identical twins identical twins have identical genes fraternal twins has\nSimilar but not identical jeans if you follow a group of fraternal an identical twins each twin perished raised in the same household each ... each the same food listens to the same conversations watches the same movies\nNow if you find differences between identical twins as a group and fraternal twins as a group that suggest that biology not environment is a driver I asked\nJohn what's such studies revealed about political preferences\nWe were fortunate to have access to a data set a very large loads of thousands and thousands of of twin Paris collected by a guy named Linda Neves\nHow long ago it's fairly dated data set\nA but it was a valuable one for us because it included lots of information about their political views\nAnd when we subject these data to the standard twin design approach we did and did a fine that they're the political views were quite heritable [noise] um although people oftentimes must read this our results suggested that maybe thirty or forty percent\nOf our political views or come from a genetics but known that bothered a lot of people and this was quite a controversial study and political science so many people didn't like that at all\nUh and they tended to over interpret those results and make it sound like we were saying that everything was less genetic but you know if it's thirty four percent genetic that obviously is you know fifty sixty Seventy percent that comes from the environment so all we're saying is that that genetic component\nIs not in zero but apparently that was enough that that some people were upset about that\n[noise] and so you you basically you're able to town in some ways that there is a closer link in the political orientation of identical twins then in the political orientation of fraternal twins and that tells you that there is some element of the biology some element of genetics\nExactly no that's well put an end again it's nice to compare political views with other kinds of things height for example turns out to be about eighty percent\nOr heritable when you see these you know when you subject to the same kind of design personality traits are about fifty six percent political views thirty to forty percent I Would say [noise]\nOne of the big implications of all this this work besides just being interesting in itself is that it helps us I think think about the political conflicts we have\nWhich fresh inside a ... and you've made the case that in many ways the more we were able to see the differences between groups of people as inherent or biological in some ways it changes the way we think about those differences talk to me about that idea Jon\nYes when other traits have been understood to be biological I'm thinking of something like ... you know we used to think that uh if you were left handed that was just because you got into a lazy habits\nMy father was left handed and the teacher you know this long ago would beat him on a on the hand with a ruler whenever he wrote with his left hand train them to to write with his right hand so we do that as as a ... something that need to be driven out\nUh of course now we understand that being left handed is very biological this is something much deeper than just a a lazy habits\nOr or course you know the big one today would be sexual orientation when people realized that sexual orientation is a indeed biologically driven and not something that they just have decided to do\nA then people are much more tolerant of that so we were wondering if perhaps the same thing might happen with regard to politics if we realize that our political opponents were not simply being a lazy but rather were oriented to the world and a different fashion that maybe we would be a little bit more tolerant of them\nThat this was the only way we're going to get anywhere for at least understand where they're coming from even if we still might deeply disagree with their conclusions\nWhat would you say to critics who would say you know the the argument that psychological traits in biological differences are beneath our deep political conflicts doesn't make sense because\nWe didn't always have this deep divide in our country between liberals and conservatives there was a time when we had many many more people in the center of the most liberal Republican was off into the leftist more\nMost conservative Democrat and you know there really has been a sorting of the political parties in recent years what explains this change especially over the last twenty Thirty years [noise]\nWhat I Would say to that argument is that I Believe we have always had\nThis very same division this very basic difference between people who are fairly sensitive to threats\nAnd think we need to be vigilant and those people who are more into experimentation and try new things [noise] I'm Ralph Waldo Emerson has a great quote I'm Sorry I Can't give it to your verbatim but it's basically that a division between those people who are supporters of tradition and those people were supportive of innovation is very old and a structure the world since time began\n[noise]\nJohn hitting is a political scientist at the University of Nebraska Lincoln here spent years studying the psychological and newer logical differences between liberals and conservatives along with Kevin Smith and John ... he's the co author of the book predispose liberals\nConservatives and the biology of political differences John thanks for joining me today on hidden brain [noise] thank you Shankar it was a pleasure to be with you [noise]\nAnd that was a very controversial issue and many southerners who believe that the only way to maintain slavery was for it to continue to expand to maintain political balance between free states and slave states\nThey couldn't really tolerate the idea that the president the United states would oppose the expansion of slavery and so although he was elected and I think they recognize that he was elected in the science fair and square\nThey just couldn't accept him as president and so what you see is they're putting a policy issue in this case an entire world view and way of life revolving around the evils of slavery they put that\nOf the democracy so now the conflict just defense into rancor and violence and so I think it's an important lesson of how our differences can be a source of strength but they can also be in a credible source of weakness\nAnd the question is do we have something in common that's holding us together most in most of American history the answers been yeah and that moment in history the answer was unfortunately absolutely no [noise]\n\nI'm Wondering is one of the things you are implying when you talk about the difference between productive and destructive conflict is that when people have productive conflict there actually willing to say I believe very strongly that I'm right\nBut I Want to at least concede the possibility\nThat maybe there are others who have something of value all ... it may be that history will show in the future Twenty years from now there is something that I don't know and I'm Wondering if if this is potentially one of the implications of what you're talking about which is the difference between productive and destructive conflict\nIs that in productive conflict people say there's a chance that I could be wrong sometime in the future I think that's correct I think that's true but even if they don't think they could be wrong there's a sense that if you believe in democracy so much\nThere's only so far you're willing to go and so you know if you think another analogy would be in a family he writes a family we have every family people fight they quarrel they disagree about all sorts of things but if there's loving the family the conflict only goes so far the love breaks down than actually the conflict can rent the family part\n[noise]\nIt again when we come back the political up people's or the Nineteen sixties

think to a threat sensitive mindset are steps that you know the ... they only makes sense is if they can't really understand why anybody would be opposed to those kinds of things because this would help us to be a safer place\nWill\nNow there are all kinds of ...\nHow politicians speak in the actual political considerations that are difficult to disentangle from psychological and biological traits but John another study these differences in experimental settings John one showed liberals and conservatives positive and negative pictures\nAnd he found they reacted very differently a\nPositive picture it'd be something like a beautiful sunset or somebody enjoying themselves on a ski slope I'm happy child a negative picture would be things like I'm a house that are just been leveled by hurricane um or a guy eating worms or children who are malnourished\nWe have people hooked up to some physiological devices I'm the most obvious one is a electro journal activity or skin conduct ... which is a common way of saying if somebody is just having a reaction having a physiological arousal to that a stimulus\nWhat we found is that uh people do have arousal when they see these kinds of him and just because they're they have some emotional content but we tend to find that liberals were more reactive to the positive images and conservatives are more reactive to the negative images\nI understand that in one brain imaging study that you've conducted volunteers was shown disgusting images and brain activation from even a single image was actually pretty good at being able to tell who was liberal and who is conservative\nThat is true I never been a a three or four studies that attempt to see if the brain activation patterns of liberals and conservatives is different\nAnd the one that we did it goes back to kind of our favorite thing was to show them these these different kinds of pictures actually we have the most luck with a pictures of mutilation uh and and you're right when we did that it was very easy to categorize people\nYou know without knowing anything about them all in all week would look at was the brain scan results and we could be incredibly\nAccurate knowing whether they're liberal or conservative just on the base about\nLiberals brains when they looked at\nA mutilation images were much more active in a part of the brain called the U.S to matter of sensory too\nAnd that's the part of the brain that will will be activated if you suffer pain so if if I take him in the ... century true with the active\nBut it's also active if you see pain and others and so if you would see a movie of some of these stepping on a rafting now goes right through there but you're still matter of sensory too it'd be active and what we saw in these in these brain scans was that liberals were more likely to have activation medicines for two and conservative\nDoesn't mean that conservatives are hard hearted uh just means that that things are happening differently when they see these different images\nNow you could argue that a lot of this research is Carl ... you could also argue that a lot of the patterns that John and others find are consistent with the power of upbringing in shaping political preferences\nHere's how let's see I'm raised in a conservative home\nI learned to be politically conservative from my parents like my family also influences all kinds of other things about me that have nothing to do with politics\nThe shape the kind of food I like to eat the kind of movies I like to watch the kind of sports I enjoy by this line of reasoning the fact that liberals and conservatives are different on all manner of things isn't about biology it just shows you how your family environment can affect lots of things about you [noise]\n\nA really interesting way to separate the effects of biology from the environment and think about fraternal an identical twins identical twins have identical genes fraternal twins has\nSimilar but not identical jeans if you follow a group of fraternal an identical twins each twin parents raised in the same household each ... each the same food listens to the same conversations watches the same movies now if you find differences between identical twins as a group\nThat suggests that biology non environment is a driver I asked John what some studies revealed about political preferences we\nWere fortunate to have access to a data set a very large loads of thousands and thousands of of twin Paris collected by a guy named Linda Neves how long ago it's fairly dated data set a but it was a valuable one\nFor us because it included lots of information about their political views\nAnd when we subject these data to the standard twin design approach we did and did a find that there the political views were quite heritable ... um although people oftentimes must read this our results suggested that maybe thirty or forty percent\nOf our political views or come from a genetic but known that bothered a lot of people and this was quite a controversial study and political science so many people didn't like that at all\nUh and they tended to over interpret those results and make it sound like we were saying that everything was was genetic but you know if it's thirty four percent genetic that obviously is you know fifty sixty Seventy percent comes from the environment so all we're saying is that that genetic component is not zero\nBut apparently that was enough that that some people were upset about that [noise]\nAnd so you you basically you're able to town in some ways that there is a closer link in the political orientation of identical twins then in the political orientation of fraternal twins and that tells you that there is some element of the biology some element of genetics that is driving political preferences\nExactly no that's well put an end again it's nice to compare political views with other kinds of things height for example turns out to be about eighty percent\nA heritable when you see these you know when you subject to the same kind of design personality traits are about fifty six percent political views thirty to forty percent I Would say [noise]\nOne of the big implications of all this this work besides just being interesting in itself is that it helps us I think think about the political conflicts we have\nWhich fresh inside a and and you've made the case that in many ways the more we are able to see the differences between groups of people as inherent or biological in some ways it changes the way we think about those differences talked about that idea Jon\nYes when other traits have been understood to be biological I'm thinking of something like handedness you know we used to think that uh if you're a left handed that was just because you got into a lazy habits\nMy father was left handed and the teacher or you know this long ago would beat him on the on the hand with a ruler whenever he wrote with his left hand train them to to write with his right hand so we do that as as a ... something that need to be driven out\nUh of course now we understand that being left hand it is very biological this is something much deeper than just a a lazy habits\nOr or course you know the big one today would be sexual orientation when people uh realize that sexual orientation is a indeed biologically driven and not something that they just have decided to do a then people are much more tolerant of that\nSo we were wondering if perhaps the same thing might happen with regard to politics if we realize that our political opponents were not simply being a lazy but rather were oriented to the world in a different fashion that maybe we would be a little bit more tolerant of them\nThat this is the only way we're going to get anywhere for at least understand where they're coming from even if we still might deeply disagreed with their conclusions\nWhat would you say to critics who would say you know the the argument that psychological traits in biological differences are beneath a deep political conflicts doesn't make sense because we didn't always have\nThis deep divide in our country between liberals and conservatives there was a time when we had many many more people in the center of the most liberal Republican was off into the leftist more most conservative Democrat and you know there really has been a sorting of the political parties in recent years what explains this change especially over the last\nWhat I Would say to that argument is that I Believe we have always had\nThis very same division this very basic difference between people who are fairly sensitive to threats\nI think we need to be vigilant and those people who are more into experimentation and try new things I'm Ralph Waldo Emerson has a great quote I'm Sorry I Can't give it to your verbatim but it's basically the ah the division between those people who are supporters of tradition and those people who are supportive of the innovation is very old and a structured the world since time began\nIn a sense the southerners those who are are going to favor secession\nThey're more committed to the institution of slavery than to the national democracy\nAnd so when Lincoln is elected and he poses the expansion of slavery interestingly he didn't oppose slavery per se wasn't calling for abolition at that point but he didn't want to see slavery expand\nAnd that was a very controversial issue and many southerners who believe that the only way to maintain slavery was for it to continue to expand maintain political balance between free states and slave states\nThey couldn't really tolerate the idea that the president the United states would oppose the expansion of slavery and so although he was elected and I think they recognize that he was elected in science fair and square\nThey just couldn't accept him as president and so what you see is they're putting a policy issue in this case an entire world view and way of life revolving around the evils of slavery they put that head\nOf the democracy so now the conflict just to sense into rancor and violence and so I think it's\nWeb streaming is made

conflict is that when people have productive conflict there actually willing to say I believe very strongly that I'm right\nBut I Want to at least concede the possibility\nThat maybe there are others who have something of that the ... it may be that history will show in the future Twenty years from now there is something that I don't know and I'm Wondering if if this is potentially one of the implications of what you're talking about which is the difference between productive and destructive conflict\nIs that an productive conflict people say there's a chance that I could be wrong sometime in the future\nI think that's correct I think that's true but even if they don't think they could be wrong there's a sense that if you believe in democracy so much there's only so\nFar you're willing to go and so you know if you think another analogy would be in a family right so a family we you know ... every family people fight the coral they disagree about all sorts of things but if there's
