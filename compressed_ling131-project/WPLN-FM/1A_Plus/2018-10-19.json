H. M. U. dot org Dominican I Wonder if we could pick up with that last question I asked\nCasey Kendra tweeted ...\nRepublicans voted out of Congress they are so polarized we need to start over\nHow much do you get a sense that the pure polarization of today's politics is just changing the way voters approached this year's midterms I mean you know Nancy Pelosi's named still comes up quite a bit on the campaign trail she's a of an obvious kind of a hot button for many Republican voters but\nIt is that working in terms of making people show up or is it just turning people off\nYou know a lot of people might be an are frustrated with politics in the country but we're seeing the opposite effect of not keeping people home or or voting for some third party coalition in fact it's people strapping on the T shirts and going as hard as they can\nI Do in their political corners I mean the fact is midterms are usually about activist they're usually about the hardest core a people within the party but in fact we're seeing the potential for a surge this year in turnout I spoke to Michael McDonald who's a professor at the University of Florida who's really\nOne of the preeminent turnout experts in the country maintains that turnout database he expects there to be a turnout of about forty five fifty percent of eligible voters this year that doesn't sound like a lot but it would be the highest level for mid term since the mid Nineteen sixties\nAnd that is really spurred on by all of this high interest we're seeing high turnout in primaries in in special elections\nAnd you know frankly you've seen Democrats really fired up to vote against this president and we've seen that according to a few sixty percent of people say the president is a factor in their vote and that's higher than it's ever been\nA wonder wanna summers what your take is on that in terms of the potential playbook for Democrats first of all let's just said a little context is focused on the house for example how many seats with the Democrats need to flip the house\nShirts that Democrats would need twenty three seats in order to take control of the house of representatives and right now most public pull in when we look across the landscape suggests that\nThey're doing they're making good efforts and things are looking good for them right now one thing that I've noticed as I've been talking to folks you work on the Democratic side of the aisle who are professional political folks is they're spending a lot of money to make sure that their voter turnout and particularly looking at the types of voters infrequent voters who say\nMay show up in a presidential election year but are more likely to stay home\nAnd I'm an off year or mid term here and there is a reason for that typically when we look at the electorate that shows up for mid term elections it's typically older whiter and more Republican tell things that you see Democrats spending a lot of money and a lot of time on the ground trying to turn out younger voters those millennials voters of color Latinos African Americans and Asians\nWho are more likely to vote for Democrats are also more likely to stay home and ...\nIs there a certain benchmark wanna for what Democrats would consider for lack of a better word a blowout slide you use the goal just to get a fifty percent plus one or is there a larger like a stretch goal but the Democratic party is aiming for what\nI'm hearing from most people including Ben ray Lujan congressmen who chairs the Democratic democratic congressional campaign committee is\nThey don't think this is going to be a blowout year they feel confident and their chances of taking back the house of turning the house blew but I don't think most people most members of Congress were involved in this would say that there's going to be a huge blue waves crashing over a pack up of some ... or something like that\nThey're focused on delivering that twenty three as turning the house bill and the message I keep hearing from them as they want to do that as a balance of power right now Republicans\nControl every branch of government and they want to restore balance of power to this administration\nYou know this idea of a blue wave was the focus of an email from Marty who wrote I'm all about the blue wave but I'm afraid that between voter disenfranchisement lingering gerrymandering and possible foreign interference we're about to ...\nLet me ask you about some of the polling water some of the main trends in national polls right now in terms of how the Democrats and Republicans might do\nWell when we look at our NPR PBS NewsHour Marist pulling Democrats have had an advantage on what's known as the congressional ballot who would you prefer to be a to run Congress ... the Democrat in your district or the Republican the ... in your district\nYou know we've had an advantage for Democrats anywhere from seven to twelve points over from the summer until now or other polling other public polling showing it to be double digits that's about the range that Democrats feel like they would be able to take at least that was twenty three seats in the house\nAnd I look at some other factors to just look at the landscape and the playing field and when we gamed out or how many seats would be up for grabs this year\nI found that there are ... seats that were a competitive to potentially competitive\nDespite all the talk of Kavanaugh you know that confirmation battle in ... Republicans and it certainly did\nOnly six of those seats are democratic held seats Seventy four seats are of the potentially competitive to competitive landscape are held by Republicans no matter what you look at that and you know if the Democrats wouldn't half of those that the house\n[noise] glad to hear from some of you with regards to your concerns about the midterms including about the nature of polling in general are doing the guard love you to respond to this comment from a listener who left a note in our inbox\nI'm Alan from Ashville North Carolina and I'm frustrated with the elections with not having enough holes in down ballot races even even U.S House but state house and stuff because if it's a close election I Want to vote Democrat\nAt least at the federal and state level but if it's a good weekend that I Want to vote a third party greener libertarian\nOr write my own and then there are and you know with a razor close or not if it's a it's an issue where if my vote might be the deciding vote and I need all I Need some polls you are to divide and it it actually changes my vote the poll change my vote\nEllen thanks for your comment Dominican\nThat cracks me up or if he wants to run for office he should run for office if he wants to a vote third party because that's his conscience then he should do so\nI get a pragmatic approach though and I think a lot of you know establishment Democrats would argue that they wish there were a lot more voters like him who voted in Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania for the Democrat instead of voting for the third party candidate now when it comes to polls look\nThere is a huge problem in this country when it comes to a polling generally and then when you go and drill down into the state level or district level or state house level my goodness\nThe response rate that people are getting from polling is lower and lower and lower every year in other words you make a phone call does somebody wish to participate in that that just continues to decrease\nIt takes a lot of money to conduct a good pole and to get a sizable enough sample that the results are representative and it's really tough and I would just say go based on the issues and vote your conscience\nYeah quite a lot of you express real concern with the very nature of polling Peter wrote on our Facebook page please discuss the obsession the media NPR included has with the horse race method of election coverage is an irresponsible journalism to report on polls one such reporting could affect turnout or elections are not sporting events\nAnd Michael wrote on our Facebook page unit which still trust polls remember how that turned out in twenty sixteen\n[noise] yeah I mean I you know look I mean this is a this is a tried and true a criticism\nAnd what not and I would disagree that were obsessed quote unquote with polling we do use it to pepper our coverage and to give us a sense of what the snap shots are within districts in fact\nI'm far more interested in trends in polls rather than poll to pull horse race I think that's a not a good way to look at the polling ah I think that uh again overall trends and you know issues and questions\n\n\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the financial services firm of Raymond James offering personalized wealth management advice and banking and capital markets expertise along with the legacy of putting clients financial wellbeing first learn more at Raymond James dot com\nAnd from the science Sims foundation since Nineteen eighty five supporting advances in science education and the arts towards a better more just society more information is available at size Sims foundation dot org\nBack now to our conversation with one of summers up the Associated Press Katie Sanders of politifact and NPR's the medical ... still time to get in some of your questions and thoughts about the mid term elections email us one\nTweet us at one eighty or comments on our Facebook page where you can also watch or video stream of our lovely environments here at New Hampshire public radio also you can go check out some more of their excellent coverage at an H.

P. R. dot org let's get to some of your comments about the midterms Laurie emailed I Am a lifelong Democrat and I can tell you what frustrates me and has for years\nThe complete inability of the Dems to get a message and stick to it I've gone to my local Democratic Party website and the front page does not see what they are for does not told me what they care about one summers you've been following the Democrats in the run up to the midterms how common is Laurie complain and\nHow well are Democrats doing an answering it\nWell I think the largest pointing to is actually really comment and I think Democrats are trying to figure out how it affects that number of the conversations I had I have recently wrote an article that looks at how Democrats are trying to\nMake sure they have record mid term turnout and they said that when they're talking about her as are sending out mailers are going and knocking people's doors in these battleground states and districts are trying to make sure\nThat they're telling their voters that they have a message that they are running on rather than just having these conversations that are about just running against President Trump\nBase it on I was talking to some groups that dead centerfield testing recently among Latino voters and they send them and when they get this field testing\nAnd they were saying people were turned out they said if they got a ... a mailer from their local democratic candidate had President Trump space on it they be super turned off right they started out a way they wouldn't even engage or see who the candidate was so I think they're really trying to tweak that matching you're talking about what they can do for them what's at stake that that's\nThat's why you hear are Democrats nationally talking about how this is the most important election of our lifetimes why you hear that healthcare message I think has Dominican noted being such a huge share of the advertising that you're seeing from pro democratic groups it's because they do realize that they need a message for their voters to coalesce around otherwise they're not going to turn out\nTo him in the car I Wonder if we can follow up on that theme was one more voice mail from a listener on the east coast here's what John left in our inbox\nShould try and raise share to New York so often on the shows people ... the Republicans and Democrats or Republicans the Democrats or Republicans would\nInstead of doing that they should be focusing on specific policies namely the Democrats that stand for such a threat to\nThe Republicans to stand for such and such it helps educate listeners because you don't gain anything by just growing Democrats Republicans Democrats Republicans\nJohn thanks very much for calling and sharing your thoughts with us no medical for me I don't know how you hear this but for me as a journalist I feel uncomfortable saying the Democrats who stands for ... I feel more comfortable saying the Democrats who say they stand for ... or the Democrats who have done\n... to me journalistically that's more reliable but I Do take John's\nPoint that it just feels a little bit too broad\nBrush yeah I mean we have to always be aware of trying to get into some of the issues and where are the party stand on these things and what they've been pushing I think that that's been part of\nThe pushback and why you've seen so much interest from Democrats obviously in this election because they've seen so much of what\nPresident Obama did and regulations that were put in place that have been rolled back for example or by the environmental protection agency a and a whole host of other things including an immigration policy that Democrats are firmly against\nAnd it's also what you saw a as a ...\nA lot of their government officials including a lot of Republicans and how they essentially took over the Republican Party with that message of uh taxed enough already and being really in opposition to\nA President Obama's health care act so the parties sand for a very very different things and we're seeing that play out and going to come to a head and in this in this mid term\nKatie I Wonder if you can respond to a listener who left a note on our website the one eight dot org listener writes with the upcoming midterm elections and Michelle Obama's advice to go high when opponents go low what is the effectiveness of negative campaigns are the negative campaign ads coming from a particular party or group Katie\nI think everyone's guilty and I don't think any party has a\nHas Israeli going going high all the time right and I think that's because it's effective and that really sticks with people as much as people like to say that they dislike negative advertising and I think actually do it is a memorable\nAnd it's certainly a bill that impression that people are going to remember and that's why we see so much of it and that's why we have jobs here ...

U. dot org before we keep going and introduce our next guests I just want to kind of add a yes any men to what then deal you just said\nThere is no shame and getting a career that doesn't require a college degree not and we did a show last year called how to earn six figures without a four year degree about how to get into some of these skilled trades\nThat requires some training or an apprenticeship but that don't require a four year bachelor's degree one of our guests are Nicholas when Louis Wyman who was the c._e._o. of the Institute\nFor workplace skills and innovation wrote a book called the job you\nAnd he put a question to answer on our website about what an apprenticeship is how does an apprenticeship work when should you consider taking one where do you go to find what you'll find all this information on our site a program called how to earn six figures with out of four year degree\nOn line at the one at a dot for that's the word ... the number one the letter a dot org\nBefore we bring in our next two guests Russ one more thing about the job market here you mentioned\nThat New Hampshire has an aging population affordable housing as a challenge New Hampshire is one of many states has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic how does all of this show up in in the job market is it just an aging job market or or does it manifest in other ways than that well I think the main thing that is\nThat what she right now is sort of the lagging wage growth in the state than it is kind of a deterrent to bringing more people into the labor force attracting more people to the state our wage growth has been around two two and a half percent a year it's sort of lagging this prosperous economy that we hear so much about\nI think one of the quips that I recall a woman said yeah we have a great job market in New Hampshire I should know I have three jobs and I need three jobs Joe yet by\nSo I think that that's a that's sort of the main stumbling block right now we're beginning to see a little bit of labor force growth as I said we've added sixty five thousand jobs in this state since the down turn kind of reverse course and started becoming an improvement but we've only got a Seventeen thousand workers\nSo that their lives to crunch\nTo get to some more of your comments about what you're experiencing where you live with work especially in skilled trades\nSean emailed I work in the steel mill and union and management have been complaining about the lack of quality candidates were even taking mc Donald's employees if they will come in a big issue is drug testing half our potential potential candidates don't come in for an interview after hearing that we randomly drug test\nJulian tweeted like is really in jobs are no consequences if they don't\n... my education and pay a third of what is manageable\nBut try to zoom out a little bit more and talk about what's happening not only here in New Hampshire but also nationwide joining us from our home base in Washington is Ryan none policy director of the Hamilton Project and a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution Ryan welcome to want to thank you for having me on\nAlso see what this is Christine car the executive director for the New Hampshire career and technical educators association Christine welcome thank you Brian can you give us the big national snapshot of what's happening\nAcross the country right now in terms of the labor market we know what the national picture is we've talked about New Hampshire are most states doing OK really struggling what does it look like on a more granular level\nSure what I think that it's important to start from a long term perspective to understand where we are now ah and I think it can be summarized with the idea that the labor market is not always linking workers with economic opportunity a start by saying that productivity growth overall has been unusually low since the mid to thousands\nWage growth has also been quite weak\nOr and then there's also tremendous variation in wage levels across the country it's not always easy for workers to access jobs in those high wage places are at the Hamilton Project we've released a paper recently that describes\nHow over the last forty years geographic mobility has plummeted in those geographic imbalances those wage differences I just mentioned have tended to persist over time and the struggling areas in this country are not generally catching up with the prosperous places\nWe asked members of our one a tax club for their input one person wrote it wrote us at age Seventy one I was shocked to be hired I Am a retired attorney working as a state employee Ryan do we officially qualify now as being in a a labor shortage capital L capital as labor shortage\nI actually have a different perspective on this or that and there's an example I like the kind of illustrates my thinking about labor shortages or if you go into a store and you offered to pay less than the posted price for something and the store refuses to do that or we don't say there's a shortage\nI think the same logic applies to the labor market fit in recent years we just aren't seeing broad signs of extreme labor scarcity and the national data or that scarcity should produce rapidly rising wages as employers compete for workers\nAnd we just haven't observe that you know overall ... wage growth after we adjust for inflation remains very weak\nAnd there's little evidence of earnings and brought industry groups out pacing other industries by big margins\nAre for example a wage growth in construction and manufacturing is not so different than for the overall economy and I'd also say that wages are growing at roughly similar rates across regions throwing a bit faster in New England and the Pacific states but ah but not tremendous gaps and\nAnd then I'll just end by saying that that's all to say that they were not seeing this at the broad national level but there could certainly be particular occupations in particular places that are characterized by labor scarcity and that have seen some pretty rapid wage growth I just don't think that's probably true of us labor market\nWe heard from quite a lot of you about just the nature of wages as an impediment to filling these jobs Ronald posted on our Facebook page as someone who worked for many years in construction mostly trim carpentry I can say wages in the field or it's enough to attract and keep people willing to do the work\nMichelle emailed it's wages not supply\nAnd Christine car I Wonder if you might respond to this tweet from Fran who wrote New Hampshire eliminated the state minimum wage a few years ago so even though all surrounding states have raised fares we're at the national minimum wage thousands traveled to Massachusetts daily where the pay is much better\nChristine in terms of what you were dealing with trying to get jobs matched up with workers how much does the state's minimum wage factor in just\nWell I I don't have any empirical data on why so many uh employees are working in natural traveling there that I Know and I lived there that they play it over at a caters everyday into the city and out and many of those they coming from New Hampshire\nSo you know wages is one aspect of it but there for sure is an actual shortage of people and my feeling is we've got to really just focus on how they can get the people that we as into the jobs that are out there\nWhat do you see is the Roosevelt shortage Christine was there a point at which you begin to notice more viscerally that the job market and the labor pool were significantly mismatched\nThat you know I feel like you know my point of view is getting set of a wider industry perspective in in a sense that it worked in technology for the last ten years and\nComing to New Hampshire and looking at each of these high demand um occupation such as automotive construction manufacturing there just seems to be shortages across every single single sector whether it's an ... or in high tech\nLet's get to a few more of your comments particularly about the nature of what we've described as an aging workforce Christian in Wisconsin emailed\nTo all the companies out there whining that they can't hire enough people stop discriminating against older workers and older is in quotes we're not old and we have so much experience plus we don't always want a huge salary\nJan in Manchester New Hampshire emailed I Know several educated and qualified older women who lost their jobs here in Manchester they've been out of work for at least six months I've overheard conversations in my local local supermarket from older employees losing hours to sixteen year olds ages them is a big problem\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from capital one committed to reimagining banking offering savings and checking accounts that can be open from anywhere capital one what's in your wallet capital one an a\nFrom the three I O T powering enterprise digital transformation with artificial intelligence predictive analytics Sendai O T solutions learned more it see three I O T dot AI\nAnd from the William T grant foundation at WTC grant foundation dot org\n\nBack now to our conversation with Russ T. Bo and Ryan ... let me get to a few more of your comments before we bring in our next guest particularly with regards to training skilled workers\nChris writes as a current plant manager of a manufacturing facility and for manufacturing HR director slash production manager for over Fifteen Years in both metal and plastics I Am calling BS\nManufacturing in the U. S. has completely abdicated any responsibility for training new employees since the eighties\nThey want experienced people at relatively low wages right off the street if you want lower wages to remain competitive you must develop an inhouse training program that brings lower wage entry level employees up to speed over time\nWe also heard from some of you in some pockets where employers are increasing wages here's one listener who left a voicemail in our inbox\nThis is bill I live in North Carolina and I work in the logistics and warehouse and supply chain industry and we've had a a pretty good expansion of our business over the last six months\nAnd we're really struggling with two items one is employed turnover wherever they're chasing higher wages and and new facilities and new employers and secondly trying to hire the right people are as a result of that we've had to probably increase our incoming salaries the hourly salary is probably anywhere between ten and Fifteen or twenty percent\nFrom what we did last year so we're struggling with both turnover and securing the right employees so having unemployment down as low as two to two and a half percent is definitely impacting\nLogistics and warehousing\nSo easy to see how Bill thanks very much for sharing your story with us\nAnother one of our listeners tweeted I hold a four year degree strangely enough in journalism but transitioned into a trade jobs shortly following college because the pay was three times what a starting job in my field would be I Know makes six figures yearly and work in the rural community I grew up in\nI Will withhold my thoughts on your ... your journalism degree good for you glad you found something that works for you but\nThis listener has an interesting point because to stem their brain drain some cities and counties and states are offering to pay workers to move there there's a city in Nebraska that'll match signing bonuses for newcomers\nTo the tune of five thousand dollars Vermont passed a law to pay people ten thousand dollars to move to Vermont and work remotely\nAnd accounting northeast of Detroit is offering to take a chunk out of your student debt that plan was the idea of Randy Myers the presidents and see\nClair county and he joins us now to discuss it Randy welcome to winning thanks Joshua\nSo this is called the come home award tell us what the come home award is how does that work\nYeah they come home award program that we launched in ... and early twenties sixteen is really turning traditional scholarship business miles on their head um there are too many flaws and traditional scholarships of talk about and doing that but at its core what we're doing is changing the scholarship business model\nAnd instead of investing heavily in a Seventeen or Eighteen year old who may or may not complete college or maybe not be right for college we've flip it around and we said we will pay you significantly upon completion of some kind of degree but only if you return to our region to live and work and it's really a home home reward paying off of that\nSo this is for people who are who are from saint Clair counting to come back home to St Clair county\nYeah we have a very strong preference for those with family ties I mean to to help protect our investments we want people to know what it's like to live in a small town America or we want to keep them here and so we feel that if they have some family connection here there's probably a better bet they'll stay\nTell me about St Clair county paint me a picture of what's it like\nSo small town America or its waterfront community along the shores of Lake Huron in the St Clair river um our largest town of port Huron has a population about thirty thousand people we do not have a four year University in our region we did I have a fortune five hundred company in our region\nA thirty percent of our workforce leaves are counting heads down in metro Detroit to to be employed but they love the small town life or the family friendly environment amenities a small town America Josh\nI was just going to ask you about Detroit you're about an hour outside Detroit is that right\nYeah and you were talking about something earlier Josh I Want to mention you know Detroit has become a talent magnet which is great for Detroit um but the health of America and the health of Michigan I think is better judged\nOn the economic health of regions like park here at er Marquette or Muskegon, Michigan right it gives you a better barometer of what is our our true health\nHow did the recession do to do in St Clair county where people get their pretty hard\nYeah I Would say it hit here earlier than than hit the country and much more severely um the ironic part that we tell people and that's really one of the things that led to this come on program was once we really hit rock bottom our state colder weather was philanthropy government business\nAny other sector we realize that we all had to get together and play a piece in economic growth and prosperity we all had something to bring to the table\nBut more importantly we we reached a point where we stopped waiting for someone from Washington or someone from Lansing to come in and save us with a plan it had to be an organic planned at that drove our prosperity\nWe're speaking to Randy Myers the president and CEO of the community foundation of St Clair accounting in St Clair accounting Michigan\nAlso still speaking to us T. Bo the president of applied economic research and Ryan non policy director of the Hamilton Project and a fellow in economic studies\nAt the Brookings Institution still time to get in some more of your questions and thoughts\nAbout the labor shortage won a at W. A. M. U. dot org tweet us ... when a or comments on our Facebook page where you can watch our video streams so Randy tell me how to come home award works suppose I'm from saint Clair townie and I moved to Chicago\nFor work and now I'm considering coming back and how does that work\nChicago's a great example Chicago Austin's south um as long as you do not have primary residence here so let let's say your parents still live in this region maybe you've completed college six years ago and you're still living in Chicago but you've met someone you met a partly the medicine they've got other you're you're weighing the option of staying\nWant to come back home settled down start a family spend more time doing what you want to do as long as you don't already live back in our region or you're eligible for Fifteen thousand dollar award if you're selected\nWe give the recipients a hundred and twenty days to establish a permanent residency or they have to find a job that they don't already have won several already have jobs lined up and then we stretch those payments out over two or three years as the carrot to keep you here\nAnd that's what really is simple back on scholarship would pay the loans holder directly which in every case for us has been the federal government\nSo I Do so you you pay it out a little bit overtime so by over time by the time the two years or up\nSt Clair county voted this program to come home award will have put in Fifteen thousand dollars towards one's Dan I'm guessing it's like where there'd be three thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars like every six months or so and it adds up to Fifteen thousand over time\nThat's exactly it Joshua and the goal you know I'm is to really give young people actually young they could be in their twenties or thirties or forties I'm the chance to go two or three years without making that in\nA nationally I Know you see data that says the average college student has thirty thousand dollars in debt I don't know where they're getting that data Josh because out of the fifty plus applications we've received our average at an eighty thousand dollars\n[laughter] that that's a crippling amount of debt that's preventing people from living the American dream\nI can relate to that I'd finally paid off my private student loans I had to settle them it was [noise]\nGod it was it was the most awful form of financial slavery I can possibly imagine and definitely like that's a whole other our where I Will I Will rebel you with my tearful story of dealing with Sally Mae before I I Know rusty but wants to jumping but before he does Randy I just want to\nAsk you about some of the perception issues that we discussed with regards to New Hampshire\nThere's this there there is evidence that young people are moving to a bigger cities in in large numbers you've talked a lot about this feels kind of small town America New Hampshire specifically conquered for sure definitely feels like small town America\nDo you think there's this misperception about smaller communities that young people are getting I haven't seen the TV show\nThat kind of glorified young people in a small town since dawson's creek I mean you don't see it much anymore do do you think people are just getting the wrong idea about living and working in smaller parts of the country that we're all just kind of dazzled by the big city\nThis is Ninety point three WPN land Nashville public radio Ninety One point five W T amount of Houma and Ninety One point seven W.

A. M. U. dot org let me get to a few of your comments including some of your commenting about this Elizabeth Warren's story Martin rights do you think Native American voters will vote Republican and support Trump because of this not likely\nAndy writes I relish anything that makes Trump angrier makes you look bad and I was very happy that Warren released his DNA result\nHe showed his immaturity and lack of decorum once again when he simply replied who cares at hearing the story beat him endlessly and bring him out of his whole for all the world to see that's my desire\nAlexander I wonder if you could respond to Andy's comment this idea of beating the president and kind of showing him for what he really is\nI mean that was tried over and over again in the twenty sixteen election and it didn't end up working I think when you engage with Trump in some of the arguments that is what fires up his base and that's what's been his success in the past that's what could help Republicans on sort of succeed in the midterms\nAnd it's a dangerous strategy for Democrats in twenty twenty I think taking the higher ed still seems to be the best static but we'll see how things play out\nWhat area will go ahead for like a it's a very dangerous strategy I mean I just want to you know add to what Alexandra Sanger may look this is what happened to two thousand sixteen every time a day when it during the primaries and the Republicans every time Rubio ... uh\nYou know Jeb Bush all of them tried to take a Trump on in his neck of the woods kind of playing in this dirty dirty water Trump just kind of\nTook 'em out um and I think it's very dangerous or for Democrats or to try to play in those waters and\nThat's that's meant in many ways why Trump continues to be so powerful particularly in the Republican Party because so many of his own a party members leaders are afraid to take them on because he's so good at this stuff Josh will\nView of the way in which um you know a parochial entity like the New Hampshire Democratic Party is trying to stoke enthusiasm for its base coming up to the elections are founded telling that the guest said they brought up\nA typically these would be people you know our presidential runs for big fundraisers and big events to rally behind candidates have been stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael Ozzie and Alec Baldwin and\nThey we haven't yet seen I mean typically the more traditional candidates would start arriving in preparation for twenty twenty after the midterms but\nWeeds the people who have drawn the most attention of the people who have cast themselves as Trump antagonists\nRight at party would tell you the that's been good for them so you know ... up here losers both sort of an all against all on the question of Trump\nAnother politician who at one point was in antagonist of Donald Trump on the campaign trail was Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas He is running for his seat again and this week he democratic he debated his Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke\nPeople are pretty closely watching this race because it could help decide which party controls the Senate because the margin of control is so tight\nTed Cruz's ahead in the polls at the moment but as we said the race is still pretty tight in a work came out swinging in the debate he even used President Trump's nickname for Ted Cruz from the twenty sixteen election calling him lying dead at what point at one point Frank over ... ... what sense do we have of how the candidates came out of that debate\n[noise] um you know I think it's it's this is one of the most fascinating races ... it's been the most fascinating race probably a throughout the terms and it's going to continue to be as it goes down to the wire um I mean\nThis was always going to be a long shot a for Beto O'Rourke he tried to come across early on he you know tried not to say too much about a cruise and Trump and you know he but he's been dropping in the polls and he's\nHe's had to take a new tack using this language of lions had um attacking him about saying that Cruz is only for Cruz pointing out how many communities he's visited in Iowa but not in Texas um it's been a major shift in tone for art\nBut it's also been something that clearly he's been uncomfortable with just yesterday during the town hall he said I'm he perhaps went a little bit too far in the heat of the moment and this is not necessarily something that he wants a you know kind of the tone that he wants to take in his campaign\nWhether it'll work uh we'll see but you know there's a lot of hope for Beto O'Rourke some some hope is like if he can actually take this tackled that maybe he could be a twenty twenty candidate but that seems like a mat seems like another ballgame\nYeah Alexander I was going to ask you whether or not or what you read was on whether this could work I mean ... I Wonder if this debate gives us any more insight into whether\nThey rather progressive Democrat like a war has a chance in a state like Texas who's you know who's governor both senators you'll reliably conservative Republicans does this give us a sense of whether he moved the needle it'll\nMean broadly it we have to be careful not to over emphasized debates in the mid ... typically you know not that many voters watch them sometimes undecided voters do but unless there's a major gas\nThey typically don't move the needle that significantly in right now I think the polling average shows that Ted Cruz's up by about seven points which\nOn election day of Texas that's the way it typically does is enough I also think\nAn undercover aspect of this race is the fact that Texas does straight ticket voting you can go in a box for Republicans\nAnd the strength of the Republican Party over all the strength as Governor Greg Greg Abbott for instance who's running you know against Ed Ed Democrat that has been pulling in the thirties and seems to be enough to carry Ted Cruz over the finish line even if that are over arc\nHad been able to keep them to single digits\nI just wanna make sure we're clear on what you said Alexandra in Texas you can just mark a box of the top of the ... and says Republican and it automatically couched that vote dressed county for all the Republicans on the ticket\nYet you can basically do for every Republican\nAll at once I'm In the last election that they'll be doing straight ticket voting after that it won't be as easy\nWill fundraising reports from the third quarter of the year we're due this week to the federal election commission they were doing Monday and the results look pretty good for Democrats in house races at least just in terms of the dollars and cents of Democrats are dominating fundraising\nCredit challengers out raised Ninety two Republican incumbents more than six the Democratic candidates raised more than a million dollars to court\nIn the Senate Democrats are also out raising Republicans ... raised thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter Ted Cruz raised just over ten million dollars\nAccording to an analysis by five thirty eight the Democrats ability to outspend in Senate races has not correlated with a bump in the polls as it has in house races also glad to hear from some of you about the president on the campaign trail including in Texas\nKaren tweeted Trump is coming to Houston next Monday to rally for Ted Cruz Monday is also the first day for early voting in Texas\nLet's shift gears and had to Florida where the after effects of hurricane Michael continue to be felt and seen\nThe weather channel reports the death toll at at least thirty five people with fatalities spread from Florida all the way up to Virginia now those death toll figures are bad enough but Franco what's our sense of how the recovery effort is going particularly the effort to find people who've been missing\nYeah there are still people missing there's still people who are trying to pick up their lives um you know I think\nThe town in Mexico beach has not reported given any numbers um of how many people are are missing a but there is talk of that it could likely be in the hundreds I mean this was a massive storm I'm Talking about one of the biggest storms\nThe top three or perhaps by some accounts that you know had made landfall that would make it bigger than Katrina\nThis has been a huge effort many people still do not thousands still don't have a phone service um and people are expecting asked film is sewn services restored and more roads are clear it and you're able to get more to people that they are expecting the death toll to continue to rise\nWhen Alexander the other big issue is when people can actually start to rebuild and I mean it's it's fascinating and terrifying horrifying at the same time to look at some of the early drain camera pictures from where hurricane Michael came ashore from where it made landfall\nAnd publics delivery powered by in the cart public's believes that between work and to do this time is valuable public things to help people regain time by delivering groceries to customers doors more at public ... dot com slash delivery\nSustaining members of National Public radio are always automatically had her did any of the ways we have in our upcoming fall membership campaign will be getting away at seven night trip to Costa Rica and a one thousand dollar\nAmazon gift card you can become a sustain a right now at W.

A. M. U. dot war Josh Rogers let's talk New Hampshire for a little while there are two congressional races underway there are two districts in New Hampshire\nThe race in district one\nWill be historic kind of no matter who wins because either the Democrat Chris Pappas would become the state's first openly gay member of Congress\nHis Republican opponent Eddie Edwards would be the first black house member from New Hampshire tell us a bit more about the first congressional district as I understand that it's it's a swing district that Donald Trump carried in twenty sixteen right\nAbsolutely trading him a party to party from two thousand eight or the GOP winning in mid term years Democrats winning in presidential years is now held by Carol Shea Porter fairly liberal Democrat who's retiring I'm In ... where do you have people who are\nRunning really within the mainstream of their parties are pap hosts has been serving in various\nElective offices for a long time he's in his late thirties he says family owns a very popular restaurant in Manchester awesome to stop for presidential candidates\nHe um he comes from Manchester which is a town where the even the Democrats have historically been a little bit more conservative than in other parts of the state particularly on fiscal matters\nUm Eddie Edwards is somebody who has a background in law enforcement he was in the navy he at one time all ... states ah enforcement division of its liquor commission in New Hampshire we have those big highway liquor stores liquor is controlled by the state uh I was a fairly big job he of ram enforcement division and he's been a police chief\nUm you know they were pretty much keeping to well within the norms of their party Eddie Edwards has you know embrace Donald Trump Rudy Giuliani up here campaigning with them [noise]\nUm and he's in some ways trying to cash Kris ... you know part of some sort of resistance movement and saying we've obviously the nationally Chris Pappas is hardly a radical guy or you know family I'm Ron restaurant ah worked I worked for Joe Lieberman when he ran for president um\nAnd uh this race is one where the seat can go either way and uh both parties believe they have a shot\nAlso a gubernatorial race underway here at the Republican government gums\nKelly she's won a Fifteen women running for governor across the country which is an unprecedented number\nThe latest fundraising numbers that came out this week showed that Kelly the Democrat has outraged Sununu the incumbent Republican three to one uh ... brand of New York seem to conquered on yesterday to help a campaign for Kelly\nThey met with employees of the Granite State candy shop and they discussed paid family leave if I'm interested in where this issue sits in terms of all the issues New Hampshire voters are considering but here as part of what happened with your ... listen\nIt's going to help families the happier and how we're going to help people to be more productive at work and sell\nIt can win ran everywhere I go in that state I hear about the need for a family medical leave and how important it is\nFor people to be able to have the choices in their life to be able to work hard where they're working but then to be able to spend time with the people they loved that allows me to get them out\nThat was Molly Kelly you heard at the end senator ... brand was at the beginning tell us a bit more about Mali Kelly is is this paid family leave issue a big one for her based on her political background her personal background will\nIt's been a huge issue for her whether it is for voters is an interesting test me she's been running pretty much exclusively on this issue um it's a challenge to somebody covering their first how many stories one can write about paid family leave my understanding as Democrats\nHave polling that suggests that Governor Sununu is vulnerable on this issue he was on the record supporting a paid family leave bill that didn't make it through the legislature in part because he came out against it\nAt the last minute or for fear that a payroll deduction imagine to an income tax which you know it was a real kind of fighting words here in New Hampshire where there's no income tax\nUm the Democrats believe this is an issue that works for Raleigh Kelly by dint of her background at one point she was a single mother with three kids who work the way through college and that you know ... new new sort of a governor brother of a U.S senator uh\nYou know doesn't understand the the stresses and strains that many working people face and you know it does get at New Hampshire has kind of a bifurcated economy\nUh you know boom times for people the upper income we have budget surpluses and tax collections are up but you know the wage growth for people at the lower end of the scale has not been great and\nThis is an issue that for Democrats they feel that it kind of hits a lot of boxes and may help mobilize women which are you know he constituent anywhere for particularly here in New Hampshire how close is this governor's race well I'm ... you know Sunni should win you know we have to your terms here no governor has been promised after one term\nUh since two thousand four and part about it have been a century so it's pretty rare that a governor doesn't get a second term apps and being a disaster or a really tanking economy we don't have either of those\nUh here polling indicates a new news up by about ten and you know you mentioned the fundraising numbers and Molly has outrageous Christian in three to one in the most recent reporting period he does enter the final stretch of this race with a cash advantage although for an incumbent\nWith a nationally known name he's a pretty bad fundraiser he will freely admit he doesn't like to do it so\nYou know he's only he's got four hundred thousand she's got two hundred thousand no interest groups will will add to that in terms of advertising but this is a race Democrats feel they\nHave a chance to win if if a blue wave a venture weights and they think that ... uh buy dinner background but it'd be a woman is somebody who perhaps his best engineered to kind of ride away speaking\nOf nationally known names Frank or don't is I Wonder what your senses of senator Jill a brand\nIt is their speculation about her future maybe twenty twenty ... there's\nA lot of speculation about her future and twenty twenty um I think how much is it kinda resonate as as the big question I mean obviously\nA there's so many names being kicked around ah right now or that you know it I think time will tell but there there's no question that killed ran as one of the people that that people are talking about and certainly are watching very closely in every move\nOr that she makes 'em is being picked apart um you know analyzed a and looking for it how it could mean and how it could uh what impact that could have on twenty twenty\nLots to discuss with business and the economy this week including the U.S deficit we don't hear much about it these days but it's back in the news because the Treasury Department revealed this week but the deficit has grown\nLast year it was about six hundred sixty six billion dollars not a significant number there at all six hundred sixty six billion this week the Treasury Department revealed that the deficit has grown to seven hundred Seventy nine billion dollars it's six year high end projection say it is on track by the end of this decade\nTo hit a trillion dollars the deficit a trillion dollars\nNow Alexander some experts are pointing to the Trump Administration for being responsible for this particularly the tax bill\nPart of the sales pitch for the tax bill for the tax cuts is it by cutting taxes business what kind of unleash more productivity the economy would boom like never before and the resulting largest would more than make up for whatever we lost in tax revenue how's that working out so far\n... well we haven't seen that yet certainly an ... fan is Republicans are arguing that that's going to take 'em you know about a decade to even out though at this rate although the economy is booming there's there's no way that it can make up for where our deficit is at at this point\nUm it was sort of an open secret in Washington that the real plan that Republicans were kicking around was welfare reform\nUm to to cut down on the deficit and that conversation has started again on Capitol Hill\nI'm that obviously won't move forward until after the midterms but there is conversation about to get you know starting to work on a welfare reform bill that would cut some public benefits um like Medicare that kind of thing\nUm and so going forward you know it's interesting they care to see Republicans silence on this issue when they were previously the party of deficits\nBut it's also an opportunity for them politically to push another priority of the Republican Party which again is welfare reform\nThis is Ninety point three WPN land National Public radio Ninety One point five W T amount of Houma and Ninety One point seven W.

the former military officer and his daughter\nSaudi prince denied any involvement in murder of journalists who criticized him Trump goes along with both anyone else worried about the u._s. abandoning our moral authority\nSonia wrote on our Facebook page here's what I don't understand a Saudi national was grabbing the Saudi embassy in Istanbul it's been determined that ... was murdered based on recordings heard by no one but some Turkish government officials who want to remain anonymous\nTurkey has not released the recordings but there have been leaks of what's in Turkey's government not above repression and this kind of nefarious behavior themselves what exactly are we supposed to do as an uninvolved third party\nBefore I let you respond to that ... tweeted and uninterested third party\nWas a legal permanent us resident with children who are us citizens the usa isn't interested party even if Trump is not interested in the euro would you respond to that [noise]\nYeah absolutely I think it's right that were not an uninvolved third party this man was a resident he was not only that he was a columnist for a prominent American newspaper the Washington Post\nAnd let's be honest that a lot of the reason this has gotten so much attention in this country is because the post has rightly put a huge and hot spotlight on it and not let anyone forget about it and you know other newspapers in the United states in world media have picked up on it too and really kept the attention I I was struck\nBy President Trump saying yesterday when he finally acknowledge that yes it appeared this man was murdered that he said this story has captured the world's imagination unfortunately and I thought unfortunately what's unfortunate about it it is the job of the media to demand accountability to seek truth\nAnd our values as America and as we've always been a global leader we try to put ourselves forward as the leader of the free world\nPart of that is about moral values and when we have a very close ally who by the way our military hardware is used in that Saudi campaign in Yemen that has killed so many thousands of civilians and children and is now leading to a huge famine in Yemen\nHow can we say that weren't uninvolved party um you know this is someone who was a resident of our soil and working for one of our companies\nAnd it's absolutely not true when you have an ally who is alleged to have done something like this we have certain forms of leverage that include arms sales and include potential sanctions and many other things\nI Will say though I I'd James I do\nKind of feel or so years coming from in a way because then we talked about this on this program before the U.S from Saudi Arabia have had a long relationship\nBut we've never tried to exert strong moral ethical pressure on Saudi Arabia I mean it's a very transactional relationship and so just because one is uninvolved doesn't mean that one is on entangled but I kind of take Sonia point like the U.S\nDoesn't really want to have to spank Saudi Arabia over its actions because there is a tremendous military and economic entanglements so I'm not really sure what the us has the power to do or if it has the moral authority to do it\nWell this is the let me ... me amplified that point just because it's absolutely critical as you know someone who's been actually very good on this as Senator Marco Rubio who made the point I'm paraphrasing here\nBut all the money in the world and all of US military contracts in the world would not be enough to buy back our credibility on human rights if we don't stand up against something as fundamental as murdering journalists for their opinions that's an international norm there's a lot of other norms that were broken here but that's a critical one\nI mean the show was called one aid for the first amendment with that is in our DNA to stand up for a free press around the world and if we don't stand up strongly against that it'll be a very very damaging precedent and as a Senator Rubio said will never be able to buy our credibility back on these issues\nSenator Lindsey Graham made a very similar point he was so angry and he said I've been a huge ally of NBS in Saudi Arabia but I'm never going there again as long as he is in power he's outraged by it so this is a bipartisan issue\nIt is worth noting that the Washington Post this week it published\nWhat is believed to be ... final column it's called what the Arab world needs most is free expression it was published in English and in Arabic and he writes about the systemic the systematic dismantling of the free press and much of the Arab world here's one brief quote from that column quote\nThese actions no longer carry the consequences of a backlash from the international community instead these acts\nOh by silence as a result Arab governments have been given free rein to continue silencing the media at an increasing rate unquote Hayes what do you think is he right\nI think he is definitely right so\nUh this has been you know one of the longstanding problems with U.S foreign policy in the region\nIs that oftentimes strategic interests have taken of the friends he compared to human rights issues under the Obama administration you had a lot of great words about how he he actually did stand up to Saudi Arabia in word but\nIf not indeed we never halted arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nOr despite the ongoing campaign in Yemen we never a threatened to sanction them over a there as you over their funding of jihad isn't other extremist in Syria we never have really taken very strong action against Saudi Arabia or any any country\nOr any country in the region for their actions except for Iran\nWho has been fundamentally aligned against the Gulf\n... a Gulf states so I I I completely agree with the sentiment in his column if we haven't been willing to take action\nBefore it it's I Hope that we have the fortitude to actually the people in ... that members of Congress actually have the fortitude to actually pass some sort of legislation that or does something if the Trump Administration does not but it seems unlikely given the history of the issue\nSo basically the people who killed ... may get away with this then you may never really know who killed him there may never be any real prosecution because of just the cold hard fact that that the relationship between the U.S and the Saudis is a business relationship\nAnd you you've totally see that when you look at the president's comments that it might have been wrote killers who took out the show and reporting earlier this week that said that the U.S is actively working with the Saudi Government to try and come up with some sort of feasible solution that admits the death of a show gee but does not blame Mohammed bin Salman\nA coach or Josh what can I comment on that because there's there's a point here that's important to make I think the reason compare went over to to Saudi Arabia was to say that look\nUm you have to get out in front of this this is that you cannot speak to some of the rug I'm absolutely convinced we're going to get to the bottom of this because there's just so much evidence that the Turks now have\nThey have the photograph these Fifteen individuals who flew in twelve but which part of\nThe ... the crown prince of security detail or intelligence services\nI think we're going to get to the bottom of this now I also think there's going to be a fall guy but somewhere just below the crown prince there already are stories that maybe they're going to offer up there and tell his intelligence chief\nGeneral Ahmed Asiri as the scapegoat so I I think we will know who did this and I you know I think probably the crown prince will try to ... you know offer up a a senior scapegoat but I'm I'm pretty convince we're going to figure out what happened to her\nWell we will keep an eye on this story we're glad to get some more of your comments on this for now let's move on to some of the other big stories that make news this week in may have flown under your radar because of all the attention about ... G rightly given of course\nBut there's also an update from Afghanistan where the war continues to rage Seventeen years after it began with no clear end in sight\nYesterday the Taliban killed at leading police chief in Kandahar the commander of us and NATO troops in Afghanistan General Austin Scott Miller escaped unharmed\nMore information including current inventory is online at guitars dot com [noise] in our upcoming fall membership campaign will be giving away to trip a three nights stay at okay but it's fine and resort in the foothills of the Smoky Mountains tend to seven my trip for two to Costa Rica\nYou're automatically entered for both drawings when you make a contribution at W.

A. M. U. dot org\nThis week some Americans were probably green with envy at our neighbors to the north\nRight about now\nAnd I got a job and\nThey were celebrating in Montreal this week because on Wednesday Canada legalized recreational marijuana\nNationwide it's only the second country in the world to do so worldwide was the first in twenty Thirteen Andrew tweeted Canada legalizing we'd was like California legalizing we'd both for like a long relationship\nThe official Hays how big a deal is this and do you think this is the start of a Global Trends something that has just kind of been understood for a long time and just hasn't been made official yet\n[noise] you know that's a great question because I'm not really sure I mean I think that\nWhen you look at the way that the criminalizing drugs has gone in places like Portugal\nThan at you compare that to things like the un office of drugs and crime still is very hard on marijuana and claims that you know marijuana is this evil so it's really tough to tell where the global feeling is on we legalization\nIf I'm your words you bring it up say at a meeting in the European Union's\nOf European Parliament then I'm guessing you still would not have been nearly a majority of people in favor it even in a place like the USO Canada I don't know it really depends on how it goes in terms of the government controlling the access to marijuana which it it is doing now compared to you know being a private business\nOr that private but illegal business among many small dealers\nOr it depends on how it affects the global drug trade it and whether\nUh there's going to be any sort of shift and you know I'm sure that Ken is going to be putting unlike the U.S a lot of funding into studying the effects of this new policy whether caused the surge and traffic accidents where the cost asserted tops realization or medical affects so it can be really interesting ten years down the line to see what has happened in Canada yeah\nThe CBC out of Ottawa has a story about how police there are increasing some of their a surveillance efforts for intoxicated drivers to make sure the more drivers aren't driving stone it is of course worth noting that in this country marijuana is considered\nMost illegal level of illegal drugs they schedule one narcotic it's right up there with heroin LSD ecstasy ... and ... the drugs that are deemed to have new currently accepted medical use and the high potential for abuse\nThere was a conference call this week with Todd Owen who was an official with US Customs and border patrol here's how he answered one question from a reporter\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint had smoked in the past\nYes admission of illegal drug use our arms around you found in the midst of all and the United states so yes that's possible\nThat's taught or one of US Customs and border patrol Indira give us a sense of what this might mean for the relationship between the U.S and Canada along the border\nWell it's one more complication when you know border issues have been one of the primary issues of the Trump presidency they already had a very difficult negotiation and doing this NAFTA to point out which in the end turned out to just take elements from the Trans Pacific partnership which was is updated trade deal\nThat the Obama administration negotiated that the Trump Administration pulled out of and then sort of pulled the TPP things tax them on to NAFTA and set it snapped a to point out but it hasn't been easy there have been so many strains between the United states and Canada\nAnd you know this people are saying that essentially this is a potential marijuana mass right now I'm so I think this could be an issue because we certainly do not have legalized marijuana across the United states it's only on a state by state basis\nI Wonder also dreams what other kind of unintended consequences there might be for this I mean\nJustin Trudeau now has to kind of owned is whether it's seen as a good move\nOr a negative move there remains the question as to what legalization of the national level mind me for Canada on top of that there are early reports that suggested supplies are running low because candidates takes time to cultivate to the point of being syllable and there are long lines around the block and things are running out supplies running out\nI Wonder what kinds of additional unintended consequences we might keep an eye out for well you know the Canadian\nUncontrolled experiment so we're going to we're going to find that a lot of things about this but I must admit that I'm not\nThat surprise when you can walk into the major states the United states like Colorado or California and there's dispensaries for recreational marijuana everywhere I I think this is a trend that's happening\nAll over the United states and it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna keep going because people are going to realize that there's a lot of money to may when your tax marijuana\nA and the use has happened in any way and putting these people in jail is probably not the best use of public funds so I see it as part of a continuum I think it was kind of inevitable that are progressive neighbors to the north for probably going to get a jump on the some of this\nBut um you know I I just been struck by going around the country and see in states where this is already happening and everyone kind of shrugs it's not a big deal\nYou know this doesn't seem James to have the kind of energy I mean it's not like the fight above against prohibition you know where it was considered this major like\nThis issue about liberty and of course it helped spur of the rise of organized crime if you've never seen the Ken burns documentary what are you waiting for go see it this feels very much like something that was just kind of a matter of time like if they legalize it was going to happen sooner or later\nThat's my sense to you out of this is the trend is pretty clear in this country and and Canada Canada's had medical marijuana says two thousand and one it's very popular so too does not out on a whim 'em by endorsing the so I I think it's a it's kind of inevitable\nYeah not one of the loudest most aggressive social movements with regards to the legalization of cannabis a much more impactful movement that has reverberated around the world is the me too movement and we should talk about that before our time is up this week MJ Akbar who's the minister of state for external affairs in India\nLeft that post after more than a dozen women accused him of sexual assault\nAnd harassment also in India this week there were protests and violence meant by that any woman trying to enter the ... temple in ... state in India groups of conservative Hindu men threw stones and attacked women and journalist who tried to get too close let's start\nWith this story involving energy Akbar Hays how have we seen the me too movement play out\nIn India or is this just kind of the beginning of its effect on men in power\nI think so it's it's interesting because the me too movement really kicked off here in the United states a year ago and for a while or I Know that our reporters at least we're watching Indian waiting and wondering when is it going to affect this culture where\nUh we were so sure that it would finally have an impact and now a in recent weeks it has finally like grab the country and shake it had\nA we have is all started with one actress a one Bollywood actress coming forward and just it's been a tidal wave of accusations sense than women taking to Twitter and being unafraid to name their alleged abuse abusers and us altered by name\nAnd just being really willing to step out and do what the Indian courts haven't done before which is\nTry to bring these men into account and um it\nReally interesting that ... one of the first to go considering um he had such a long run in the Indian journalism seen ... and\nUh the most of the women who came forward about him were fellow journalists were fellow reporters so I feel like that is a bit of credence to these allegations and we'll see whether in the future they uh the the women who are I guess lower down on into full status will finally start to be believed as well\nWith regards to that protest of the ... temple and Carol estate the BBC's James Clinton was they're asking people why they were protesting here's what one man said\nNo no I don't know what the media\n... they don't really want to do this don't do drugs they wanted to say oh that's the only thing\nThat some of what the BBC's dreams Clinton was told in carelessly outside the ... temple there in there I Wonder what your sense is of this protest particularly what the gentleman said it made it sound as if there was this external pressure from the media and politician he wants to destroy our culture they want to destroy our religion he says", "show_name":
