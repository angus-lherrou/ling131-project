fulltime\nToday for years later activism is just part of my caissons identity he also hosts the podcast pod saved the people he ran unsuccessfully to be the mayor of Baltimore and his new book is called on the other side of freedom the case for hope\nDuring the cash and welcome to winning it's so good to be here tell us about the book's title on the other side of freedom what's the title about what are you trying to stay there\n[noise] yeah you know I used to travel much more around the country talking to young people talking to to older people and what I realized that we have a deep understanding of beside of freedom so we know on this side of freedom\nA third of all the people killed by strangers killed by police officer we know there'll be arrested more people for marijuana in all violent crimes combined we know so much about this tiny freedom in we have a lot of work to do\nThat I wanted to talk about like how do we get to the other side of freedom what did it look like what does it feel like how do we get there with the strategy and the plane\nBecause I Know that when I think about what freedom is at its core it's not only the absence of oppression but the president of justice enjoy that we can get rid of all the bad things and that doesn't mean that the good things automatically come to bear we have to fight for those\nSo that was where the other side of freedom came from it in the case we're hoping that I think the hope is this your for all of this open the belief that are tomorrow's can be better than that today's that when people say the system is broken and then in response and people say oh no it was designed to be like this my takeaway is that it was designed to because people made it up we can make something better and that is the work of hope\nThere are a lot of questions that our listeners wanted to put to you about the work that you're doing about the black lives matter movement and so on I definitely want to ask you about today's

dream of catching the host of the podcast pod saved to people and the author of the new book on the other side of freedom the case for hope\nOne by graphical thing I did want to ask you briefly you right in the book that teaching was the most important thing you ever did how did teaching help lay the groundwork for activists [noise]\nOh you know it's funny I don't take him myself at very old but I taught a decade ago my my students don't students are like twenty Twenty one now which is so wild\nI you know teaching was incredible not only because he was urging everyday like every single day I ... I talked to scream at every single day had to show up and I went to ... to my students had to be as prepared and I taught sixteen Nineteen a hundred and twenty minute classes which is a whole lot of math or anybody who's ever grown eleven year old I what I learned\nReally complex information and break it down into pieces that are can be consumed and can be repeated back so my skill was like what I learned was not only how to like get kids to understand like when the crazy ones but like I did teach discreet skills like you know what you think's touch it sometimes means multiplication right that like\nJust how to take apart these big things to make them fight side and then have students to be able to play with them in a way that they could put them back and rearrange on their on their own\nOr the second was like really understanding like what it means to\nLike do work that will have an immediate impact for what happened a long term impacts so I remember I'll never forget teaching negative numbers they struggle they like they can get in there like anything lower than zero there like I don't get it by the end they come like fight anybody around like how to solve the most complicated equation and they like deeply understood it\nAnd that was an understanding of the arc of how to build capacity and like I learned that the third thing is I mean they got the best teachers with the best things you just walk in the classrooms and they know the gift existed long before they got there\nAnd that like I work is to help\nStudents understand if they can access the gift long after I'm gone after the teacher's gone with the worst teachers do is walk in the classrooms and make people believe that the gift only exists in their presidents and like that is I think in such a corollary to organizing that when I travel anywhere where I'm In my own community\nThat like what I'm trying to do is help people find the gifts that they have because they already have them they might not know they might not believe they might not know how to use them\nAnd that what I can do is help them find them and then use them long after we're gone\nLet's let's get some questions about the black lives matter movement Morgan writes black lives matter is purposefully without a central leader so how does he you direct\nTV with his role was in the movement what has he done to ensure that people know the names of the three black women who actually started ... I think Morgan's referring to Patrice floors ... and Alicia Garza who helps propagate the black lives matter ... after the Trayvon Martin shooting direct\nYeah certainly they got the movement the movement is an expansive space and I write about this in the book is that\nUh you know for those of us who were industry in for a gift and we are mindful that there was nobody who founded the space there was nobody who started the protest there was no one to three ten people who caught us all to the street who organized everybody was so beautiful about the protests that\nUh it was organic they were set of people who came out every night thousands who made the protests last and you have to remember\nThat we were the she for four hundred days and most people remember as a long weekend what's unfortunate that there's this narrative that if that has come up that is a race so many people that suggested there was like a small group of people who started everything who came in St Louis organized every body the organizations did that work\nAnd that's just simply not true so when I think about like how I use my platform of how I think about my work\nIs that I'm awful that I was one of many people in the book a highly so many people who are industry in St Louis who did incredible work for whom without you wouldn't there would be no protest or so that it's important to me and then the second part is that I Know that the platform doesn't only exist for me that\nUh one of the important things about having a platform and access is that not only do I try to make sure that the truth is president everyone but I also know that I'm not the only person that can bring the truth so you don't know the people who said all the protesters every night or the\nThe people who got people out of jail or the people who helped organize some of the biggest actions that people helps his sprayed across the country like you've never heard those names are in in the book I Try and write about those people too that I Know them because I was there we were in the middle of the street together\nBut this narrative that there's like a small set of people who like started every thing in the movement or that there's a small set of organization to like\nWhat the catalyst for the protest is just not a true narrative\nThere's always this tension with movements that have certain people\nAbout but who profits off to cause I mean there are some who would critique the book and the podcast as a way to profit off of black lives matter how do you respond to that and I also wonder if there is any plan to use any of the proceeds from the book to help to cause\nYes it's interesting I think I'm always shut eye you know I feel like I live a pretty public life and I'm always shocked um by some of the\nThe way the question gets asked to like it's public that or a portion of all the proceeds went to the end of ... a portion of all the pre order sales went to the N. double ACP legal defense when that was\nPublic I did it 'cause it was important and\nIt was my way of saying that like I Want you to buy the book but the book also like I Want the process of buying the book to also do more work than just buying the book right so like that's I think about the book specifically but in general is basic I'm mindful of this ... when we started campaign zero which is like our our biggest project starting twenty Thirteen\nA we actually didn't participate in the nonprofit funding like the nonprofit sort of reach for funding specifically because of the question that you asked\nSo over the past three years we raised about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars per year which is\nA lot of money and the grand scheme of nonprofits and we did it so that we could just raise enough money to do the work that we that was important right so we created the first I was a database of police shooting contracts at first it public database of use of force policies continue to do a lot of data work that hasn't been done before continue to support organizes around the country and really disagree projects\nNo I I Know paid staff I'm not a I'm a salary from the stuff so we try to do it as like\nWith just the bare necessities so that it's not just a question of like profit\nUh and with the cash you know like I could have the packets could have just been my voice but I don't think that makes sense so I invited Brittany Sam and Clinton being part of it they get paid and the pilot broadcast because I think that that makes sense um and it's not like some huge moneymaker but it does allow us to like be able to be in a place where we don't have to\nRely on a nonprofit\nA complex to like fund our work to do this really well\nAnd you know it's a guy at the way that I exist in the world right now it's like not necessarily a sustainable way I'm not by state allows me to like\nOh no no I mean like I don't have you know it's like a [laughter]\nNow late at night and that's what I have a salary but um you know when I quit it was really rough it was like you know I didn't have health insurance like you know I'd defaulted on my student loans like he was a really rough um it was rough\nOnly it's only a couple of months ago and the first time I've actually lived alone since the protests I've ever since you've been staying in the basement of a like my second parents are in the past three years right so\nYou know so that's not us you know who wants to get married in the in the basement of their right second parents that's not the same as I\nSay it but it's like it's the right way that I Want to be in the work right now right that like there are these narratives of like oh I made it gives the dollars and it's like well now you see me on the news you came in a pod cast you like see me out of an event that that means a lot to you and like that automatically means of wealth to some people and that's just not\nThe case that I've had high incomes before you know that that there was any income and wealth is pretty significant though um some people have been like really confused by that\nLet's talk a little more about policing one of the members of the one eight text club writes police hold a significant position of power in the legal system they should be held to a higher standard than those without power but instead they are held to a lower standard and given special treatment and a free pass in our courts and society\nContrast that with another text club or who wrote as time goes on society will bring about necessary reform but to denigrate and disregard\nIs ludicrous\nWhat do you think he I think you know I think for ...\nFor two thousand years we slit people's arresting call their health care we literally drained people's blood down and we were like where it's going to drain out all the impurities and people are like oh they their blood pressure they change it's like no they didn't have any blood right like that actually isn't a solution but we did it for two thousand years it was one of the most popular medical procedures\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from progressive insurance offering a way to buy a home insurance with their

that you describe in the book there's a short section of the book page and a half were you talk frankly about your mom leaving the family when you were a toddler and the facts\nShe left a leader in the chapter you write code I'm mindful that we remember pain and trauma differently than we remembered joy and triumphs\nWhen we remember pain we are trying to protect ourselves and cope with trying to order the memories in ways that will allow us to make it to tomorrow and it's the day after tomorrow unquote talk about how those kinds of\nTraumatic or difficult experiences as a kid kind of helped to shape you as an adult particularly an adult who would gravitate toward activists\nYou know it's interesting ah this is the first time saying this because it just happened is that my mother read the book um and she texted me recently and it was I hate to re read the book we should talk [noise] and I just haven't had I had been with the right back yet so hopefully I write boxing\nIs one of the reasons why I wrote this happened in the ... I can remember and now with that and it's one of the reasons that I wrote the chapter was that I Know that we walk into everywhere I'm bringing much more than we name and one of the things that I bring into every room is what does it mean to be worthy that if she could leave and it feels like anybody could leave\nAnd I like that is something I've had to sort of work within an grow with as an adult to make sure that that doesn't hurt me or other people and like that's important as we think about what it means to organize has like we're all walk into rooms and meeting people where they are part of meeting people where they are that we know where we are and like I think that that has to be like a\nA core part of it that the part that you read about like how we remember pain and I remember a joy is that for so many people you think about like the constraints would a million people who grow up in marginalized communities where there's poverty race\nOr or any other aspect of their identity they they learn the constraints really well I Know I knew how much money we added a family and I knew would pass woman not asked for I knew\nLike when we didn't have toys how to make fun outside and you know there are a lot of people talk about growing up poor but I said one of the hard part is like when we grow up and it sometimes we still only see a world of constraints semi the constraints become so great and the way that we've learned how to survive\nThat we can start to have imagined things beyond and if we're ever going to win like it'll be like a deep imagination that gets us to the other side\nAnd my mother never seen the right in the left is it the right has always re packaging old narratives for a new time the left we're always engaged in the most intense make believe that like we're always trying to tell a story about a world that nobody's ever seen before but we know it's possible you've never seen health care for all but like you believe it you've never seen a world where every woman has a right to choose but like we believe that that's real\nAnd like telling no stories actually really hard and there's no way to to be really good story to tell her about a future that you've never seen if you aren't able to tell stories about the world that you live and how you entered the world\n[noise] you also share fairly late in the book the fact that you are a survivor of sexual assault something that you write happen to you numerous times that are rather young age\nAnd you connect that was what you call the quiet quiet about the assault but also quiet about your own identity and your sexuality you've been out for some time in the book you write in part quote\nI think about the quiet instead of the closet\nBecause I've never eaten any part of myself from my self or others you go on to write quote but I grew up quieter about the parts of myself that I didn't think anyone would love the parts that I had never seen loved in others unquote how does that interact with the person you became\nYeah you know one of the reasons why I was important for me to be out very very\nUm [noise] I mean about for a long time but to be publicly out in a in a very ... way when the protests began with like I didn't want any kid growing up who was also gay today that the only way to do this work publicly with to to be in the closet and\nAh you know that tried to start it from this tweet that Ira long time ago that was like just because you didn't know doesn't mean it wasn't real like I was in a quiet and the closet and uh\nAnd I'm like that is real to me it's important so there was no way for me to write a book about the work that we've done the work to all of us have collected we've done in social justice or the work that we need to do without talking about a mile an identity\nNow I wrote about the the sexual assault because it was real it's one of the things that I haven't really talked much about I mean it's in the book now so it's not just you know it's not something that only I Know\nUm [noise] but it was like sort of\nIt with free in some ways to finally just they and like not have to tiptoe around and not be ashamed to say that this happened and and it was real and it was awful and\nYou know when I told when I when I finally told a couple of years later they realized that he had actually been sexually abusing like a whole set of kids who are even younger than me\nI'm so like you know speaking up actually made a difference in other people's lives and like that was important\nUm but I had to like you know I write about in the book is that like my own relationship to my body I had to learn that I had to learn what it meant to be in relation with other people and like it'd be one where we were ... years and we both have the same amount of power because that wasn't the first experience with my body right uh so I wanted to just give language to that\nHow far do you think that that outlook is actually goes I mean I I'm ... I've been out from most of my all their career if not all of my career\nBut I Know that there's you know there's this aspect of what I Believe is referred to as an implied attribute where it's kind of known but not experience so there's a difference between me saying Oh yes I'm active with the national lesbian and gay journalist association\nAs opposed to me showing up you know a picture of me at a bar with my shirt off making out with a guy in the corner like it's a whole different kind of being out because people\nAre OK knowing it in the abstract but they don't want to know that you're actually like a gay person who does good things and that changes the conception do you find that there was a line in terms of identity versus full identification like okay they know\nLet's not say anything more about this let's not make them think any more about my identity and they have to be\nYeah you know like\n... I think we have to complicate this idea of like what it means to show up and gave them like it is not one way right that there is not to waste to be gay they're like\nThe wider pride parade is really really all that like yeah so like sometimes it is the way rainbow shoes right and sometimes it is just like going on a date and like that and like those are both valid ways to jump in and the identity that I Am right\nUh so so yeah there are definitely people who are frustrated me feel like I'm not gay enough in like\nThat I don't talk about gay issues is publicly as possible and like you know it's one of the things too that it's like well how much of my life dry leaves sort of like other people can feel like it's real re felt like I Know that you know we're working with the research right now trying to think about HIV testing that like one of the things that some new research suggests that\nIt's not that people when people don't get tested it's not they don't care about their health or that they're necessarily afraid of their results but that\nOr did they actually nervous about showing up at a facility and in cities that are that function of small towns in a nervous about seeing somebody they went to high school with seeing like somebody's cousin a friend like that they actually are nervous about like well privacy really be private right and like how do you actually or how do you set up a testing mechanism that gets around that to me it's fascinating\nAnd like so we don't quite work around that but like I have I don't feel like I Need to talk about every two seconds for people to be like they're actually cares about being gay right so the other thing I'll say that there's some people who like a really homophobic but like me and that's now for that I don't want to be like a safe spot for your heat\nYou also talk very frankly in the book about your bid for mayor of Baltimore your willingness to meet with President Obama and with the presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders you write that because of your willingness to engage quote\nThere were calls from within the protest community and from without accusing me of political grandstanding and labeling me a sellout unquote I Wonder how\nForward in these new endeavors whether it's politics hosting a podcast so in a way you are part of a media so to speak and reconciling with tons of the social justice activism worth that you're still ... involved in is that challenging to kind of have a foot in both worlds as it were\nYou know it's like a both and great that like you know it's interesting is that all those people who who come in for for quote participating in this system those are the same people running for office today right those are the same people who like\nI tell them everybody to vote who tell people not to vote in twenty sixteen who said that you're wasting your vote who said that politics to matter and like why would you support I remember I support Hillary in Washington Post and people literally they were like you're wasting your employment I Can't believe you did that like president doesn't have any bearing this is just for show and it's like\nThis is Ninety point three WPN land National Public radio Ninety One point five WPN outcome of Houma and Ninety One point seven W.

Blacksburg he's the show runner of Netflix bow jak horsemen it just released its entire season for streaming and I've watched just about all of that fifth season or roughly a let's talk about season five\nAlright let's get into it [laughter] it's getting dirty a big amount of season five is spent poking fun at the idea of the arch Moore show runner himself there's a ... actually something along the lines of television it's a collaborative medium where one person gets all the credit\nAnd yeah I have to say a when that line came up at the table read it got a much bigger laugh and I was expecting from the crowd of people over there\nI mean is it a little surreal to be a show runner unimpressed to her about a season of your show where one of the characters his show runner who are I'm sure would kill to be on oppressed or talking about a ...\nLittle bit it's it's strange and\nYou know one of the things we wanted to talk about we're putting the season together is this weird moment we're in now of of the ah tourist show runner which is really like a new development in the last ten years or so\nUm and it it strikes me as very odd because I I don't think that I'm a a a brilliant genius who you know a touches a show and turned it into gold and it all just you know flows out of the pencil which is connected to my brain\nUm ... it's a very collaborative process and we have people\nMaking it better every step of the way I have an amazing writing room\nThe cast brings so much the designs by at least they had all the uh director is bring so much to the episodes of the story board animators the editors um ... it really it takes a village um\nSo it's odd that yes I'm doing all these interviews now talking about the show and talking about how I made the show because it's not how TV show gets made at all and I think anyone\nWho presents that as how a TV show gets made is trying to sell something\nBut then what exactly does the white board in the writers' room look like when you've got the word play the slapstick the ponds and the ... falls a overlaid on some of the deep dark themes that runs throughout the season and the show also has a memory yeah on memory his his mistakes\nFor him it's a very I mean in a lot of ways I think we write the show like a drama but we're a room full of comedy writers who we can't help but make it funny\nUm but we really are mostly interested in you know what is the character arc of the season what are the themes we're looking to explore what are the consequences of these actions we take it very seriously um you know but then in the middle of that we we remember like All right and this guy's talking octopus\nA you know we're we're exploring familial trauma here uh but also this woman is dating or a man that is clearly just a three small boys stacked on top of each other under trench coat like little rascals I'm so [laughter] this is quite serious ah but the stories themselves can be quite silly you know one way I think of it\nIs is we're retelling stories about real grounded characters in a crazy cartoon universe\nLots of animated shows have gotten made over the last Twenty years thanks to the success of The Simpsons largely but not shows as deep and as adults\nThank you owe your origins in television ... who do you see is your fourth\n[laughter] um oh you mean by influencing yeah or do you mean literally the people who helped me have a television show and not I mean\nThe shows that you watch or or even if you weren't that into them to shows that made it possible for a show like Bo jak to be such a hit with American ... well I\nI think you know the obviously the the the giants is The Simpsons and I would be disingenuous for me to\nClaim that that show had had no influence on me or my show or the success of my show you know one at one of the best comments I got on the the first season a bow jak if someone said it felt like a season long version of a sad episode of the Simpson um but also when I was pitching the show I I really wanted it to exist\nOutside of the the bubble um\nOr the perceived bubble of animated TV you know I said ah we're going to say when we start season one you're going to watch it and the first is going to feel like a typical animated show like a a Simpsons or South Park but then over the course of the season as you realize what's happening is going to feel more like a girls or even a Mad Men\nUm and and so I I wanted this to feel more like a drama the um and to really take things seriously\nA in a way that people don't expect the animation too even though I think a lot of animated shows actually do take things very seriously\nUm but but but those shows were certainly influences as well\nAt one of the main attractions of your show for me are the amazing voice performances that you have oh yeah well our net as Beau jak Amy today are credible artist Carolyn the sort of aging Hollywood manager producer cat ah and and then a lot of others to even have a Keith Olbermann in there at some\nYeah I'm ... is one of the first people we cast [laughter]\nAnd I was cast her whale as a newscaster well uh we we had in the script to um you know a a Keith Olbermann whale type and are casting director Lynda la montage and said I think we can get Keith Olbermann to play this role [laughter] really and we call them like yeah sounds like fun\nUm and he's fantastic we keep bringing it back season after season\nAnd you know what am I a first memories of making the show and realizing how fun it was going to be was we had Keith on the phone from New York and we had them do all his lines um and then at the end we said we also get you making some we'll\nNoises and you know this is Keith\nOlbermann who I thought of as a very serious man uh goofing around going\nYou know making whale noises I thought this would be a fun show I think [laughter] well one of your other\nMain characters is Diane a Vietnamese American voiced by actress Allison ... who is phenomenal now you gave us late interview recently and also a Twitter thread which is which is the way you have to do with these days and you mentioned\nOne ramification of that choice casting Allison Aubrey is Diane that you tend to avoid referencing her Asian American is in the show now deceased and that's changed Diane does take a trip\nTo the Vietnam of her heritage and and talks a lot about how that affects her um how did her casting come about and how did you begin to have second thoughts about it\nWell um we cast Alison or in the first season and we were about I'm a third of the way into the season when we cast and we'd been working a with a different actress\nUm who had to drop out of the show all of a sudden because another show she was on got picked up and there was a contractual issues so she couldn't be lead on our show any more\nUm and so we really scrambled and Alison came in and we thought she was amazing and she's going to a a great job ever since um but more and more uh as I was looking around at the cast and and thinking about you know how how this\nThe dawn on me that everyone in our cast was white and our main cast and a lot of the recurring people were we were hiring were white as well and this wasn't an intentional thing uh that I was doing as\nA racist man um it was just I was not paying attention and we were casting these characters one at a time\nUh and I realized that oh this is my I Need to start paying better attention to 'em and so you know since then we've tried due to cast a wider net and look particularly for for diverse voices\nOr try to have more people of color on the show\nBut when it comes to Dianne specifically um you know I think there is a a real problem in this industry of casting white people in Asian roles and I was not a as aware of that when we first started the show as I Am now and so that's something that I Would do differently is casting a white person to play a prominent Asian character\nAnd you know as I said in these other interviews\nUm I think it's hurt the show because I think my own self consciousness\nHas prevented us from telling Asian Stories I think because I guess I didn't want people to talk about this it felt like this is a mistake we made\nAnd if I can just you know avoid it or you know glide passed it then you know maybe this won't become an issue where this you know won't become the thing that I ended up talking about in every interview and I I think that was a disservice to the character um because I I think it ended up\nYou know we we ended up treating her as just like a white character or as a race didn't matter and it's it's difficult in our show because in some ways race doesn't matter because there was also talking ... you know anti ... and giraffes walking around so it's hard to say\nHow is an Asian American humans experience that different from a white American humans experience but\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from farmers

one crew member more than any other the cue card holder\nNYC cue cards handles all the cue card work in New York a decidedly low tech job but some productions refused to do without\nJoining us from NPR in New York is the owner of NYC cue cards while the fairest and he's worked three decades behind the scenes on shows including Saturday Night live while the fairest in welcome to one a\nA sex drive me Joshua thanks for it's great to be here how did you get into the cue cards business a while you know I went to uh Syracuse and I wanted to be a writer I majored in writing and moved to New York in a you know my brother was working at CERN elaborate timers receptionist\nAnd they knew that you kind of guy so he recommended me even though my printing was terrible\nAnd uh uh I got the job and I you know I did it just get my foot in the door and to make riding connections and uh you know I did I did make somebody connections that I wrote for some cable shows but it was never enough to support myself so I kept on doing the cue cards and I got really good at doing cue cards very quickly\nAnd ah you know cut to twenty eight twenty nine years later I own my own company I've been doing it for that long and running a lotta shows\nSo clearly this was not the kind of writing that you had in mind but what was it about doing the cue cards that you liked\nYou know I I don't know I think one especially on Saturday Night live the live aspect of it and being out there you know as close to the cameras as you can be without being on camera\nA and helping the actors and helping the guest stars or through the shows and through this hard show that the you know they ... a lot of them have never done live ... before there was something very rewarding about that and\nUm I didn't crack under pressure and with the changes and all that stress that was involved with that and that was something that they the show noticed and uh you know everyone was a pretty quickly in the ranks\nTell us a bit about your company what shows does your company do cue cards for\nUh the are four main shows that are that are that tape all year our Saturday Night live um\nThe Tonight Show Jimmy Fallon late night with Seth Meyers and then we do Conan on the west coast as well those are are four main shows um and then we will do some reality shows we do a master we do all the Project Runway that shoot and then we do to show any show that comes to the town of these cards you know work on that as well\nWhat kinds of people do well at this line of work the first thing we look for is neat printing now my penmanship is fairly often um I think that was why when I was on a med school track years ago people were like yep we've seen your handwriting\nOf printing I as a cue cards I've seen her all written in all\nCaps yes correct It's you know it's it's a this is it's a it's block lettering it's all caps um it's it's really about the spacing between ... between the letters and the word in a space in between the words and the space in between the sentences\nIt's not something like I Can't just bring somebody off the streets okay start doing your guards it's almost like you know you need I Need to train that for like two or three weeks\nI'm just to get them there's so many different little things you have to learn\nUm two or three weeks of training yeah it it 'cause you 'cause it's it's not it's you can't just say you can't just tell them all the rules right you know what I mean I Can't just interview spate of okay these are all the rules you need to learn memorized these new things come up every time there's new like\nEye is capitalized only in certain words it's not capitalized than during whereas where how to end the card a courage that on a period or ... or ... or a comma in if not that you know how to end it so that it slows the next car just so many different rules where you can only learn it by by doing it and practicing\nIt we're speaking to Wally ... and the founder of NYC cue cards the exclusive cue card provider in New York\nOkay so let's say you're working for me for you know the late night with Joshua Johnson right and I come out to do my opening monologue I've just hired your company and I said Wylie I'm really excited to be working for you guys let's start building this relationship\nTell me the kinds of things that you are going to want to know for me to figure out how to be a good cue card vendor for me\nAll right first thing I ask you how's your eyesight like near sighted or glasses okay so you were a glasses were your glasses on the show where you were contacts or you know we're either\nI don't really like contacts hourglasses\nOkay so your your glasses so you can see fight I won't have to if you didn't wear glasses and you want to wear contacts I could ... your letters bigger so that you can see but that would also make less words in the card and it would make it harder for you to ... to flow to the ... like if you're ... especially if you're telling jokes\nSo I Would recommend glasses or contacts for you if you know if you want to so you're gonna wear your glasses you'll be fine reading cards and then I Would just you know we were we were to have her son's ride would practice with you if you've never read two cards before that something you'd want to practice\nWhat's the main thing that I Need to think about if I'm reading cue cards from you\nOr look directly at the cue cards don't look away because that'll that'll look like you're reading the cue cards\nHow do you mean listen to a rally as well if you were doing a sketch they say you were doing a sketch with your bad leader\nAnd I had cue cards near the bad leader and positioned in a way that you would want to play to those two cards now if you were looking at the cue cards and then at the bandleader going back and forth between the car to the bed later the audience would be like oh he's obviously reading something\nBut if you just played to those two cards it would look on camera like you were talking directly to that person I'm ... directly above the camera above the camera above the camera so yeah so I'll I we won't has depending on where you are in position to the camera\nI'll make the cards the right the lettering the right size so that you look directly at that card it looks like you're looking right into the camera\nShow your cue card holders are kind of part of the technical direction to the blocking of a scene in terms of figuring out where the performers need to look to look proper\nThat's exactly right especially with Saturday Night live\nThat's what I that's my main job but I'm there on Thursdays from Fridays that's all we do all day is block sketches and I'll be out there with one set of cards working with the actor's working with the host figuring out where I'm going to put\nThe cars and I work with the director of the stage managers wild well kind of confirmed I think I think I Need the cards here and then I'll ask the actors if they needed extra set somewhere else where I maybe didn't think of just want to make sure that they're covered where they're from comfortable\nSince you mentioned Saturday Night live what does a typical workweek SNL looked like for someone who's doing cue cards for that show\nScribble furiously unfilled eleven thirty five PM\nI Wish it were that a simple [laughter] now we we start on Thursday we start rehearsal is on Thursday or Thursday's a light day\nSo the music the musical group or interest for the first half of the day and then we'll ... we'll be in there about noon and will print well rehearsed maybe like three or four sketches and will only put one one set of each sketch because\nI have to figure out how many sets we need so there's no reason to print more and it it'll change from Thursday the sketches we do on Thursday we'll go through a rewrite session on Thursday night and most most of the time will be completely written from Thursday and friday\nAnd then friday is the same process except we do about eight or nine sketches same process we print but that on friday we have to do we have to make copies we call it ... the cards so it makes sense that at least I mean the redo that we don't have the luxury of waiting until Saturday to dupe the friday sketches because Saturn show day\nSo everything's print that I have about eight people there on friday just yeah basically writing all day I have the fun job I'm Out on the set blocking working with the actors having fun they're sitting underneath the bleachers from eleven o'clock to sometimes you know twelve or one o'clock in the morning just printing cards so long it's a long day for them\nWhat kind of person would want to take that kind of a job it doesn't sound like a very glamorous way to be near the TV business are you lower you mostly employing people who are looking for a foot in the door or do you have like veteran cue card writers working for ... there's a little\nBit of both um mostly um\nPeople are trying to get a footnote I encouraged that I I Try to tell them cue cards is not a career I I did make it a career for myself\nBut there's not much room if you want to do it great for your lives that's awesome but you should be looking to do something else I'm encouraging them I'm helping them I'm introduced them to people that want they\nThan in a career that they want to do mostly most of it's entertainment related but yeah you sit those long days or friday but that leaves the Saturday wherever I heard that they may come out from behind the scenes and never her with me 'cause I Can't\nI Can't hold for sketches at one time you know four sets of cars at one time so I Need other people out there and then that's kind of the fun part of it\nGet the latest stories

Rome or the other guy who won the Nobel Prize in economics this week talking about carbon taxes being the solution to to this crisis at least in part\nOn and you know I think it's important to just recognize that sounds punitive but I think there is a positive message that he's trying to put out there\nAnd that is if you commit to a tax a on carbon not only are you dealing with this issue head on but you're also in his view\nI'm opening up the opportunity for people to make money investors to to make money off of it because when money's at stake you're always going to find alternative people will naturally gravitate\nAn economic argument is often on carbon tax or that it's bad for business\nCalifornia's the fifth largest economy in the world and Jerry Brown just signed an executive order committing the state to carbon neutrality by twenty forty five which I'm sure it sounds crazy to people outside of the state but that's actually very close to one of the policy prescriptions the I.

C. set forth\nIt's kind of crazy until you do it really telephone is very serious about doing it\nAt the very serious about doing it um you know Paul Romer talks about\nThe problem isn't going to be solved until you build consensus and political will is really at the heart of that there's there's really a huge divide in terms of political well not just here but also you know I just moved here from Canada at the same thing there you have prime minister Justin Trudeau trainer and a\nAnd pose a a carbon tax across the country and he's running into real opposition at the provincial level there\nBefore we move on let me get one more comment a few more comments on this not my economy tweeted why are we still talking about the credibility of science when it comes to climate change a good point academy I don't know if you listen to this program but we are not question the credibility that's kind of a done deal on this program but I hear what you're saying\nLeery tweeted it's frustrating to hear criticism of citizens in some of the poorest parts of Florida for not upgrading their homes ability to withstand hurricanes they may live where other people vacation but they're mostly stuck this storm will expose that contrast\nShane Harris I Wonder if you could respond to Larry on one hand\nI disagree with him as a Floridian like the state of Florida has programs to help you hard in your home and if you want to live in Florida but at the base will risk of living within yards of a rising coastline if you want to live there\nYou just have to absorb that on the other hand I totally hear what he's coming from Mexico beach where the hurricane Michael made landfall\nHad to be moved back from the coastline for safety sake the talented and incorporate it\nAnd when we're when we're thinking about climate change in the sort of thirty to forty year are tied and I were just talking about the strength to break\n'em there are existential risks that are opposed not just to a community is close to the coastline to where we are talking about today but large cities you know like Miami in Florida in other places that really in the long term are going to have to make serious profound choices about\nSurviving ability about resilience or whether people want to continue living there and there is an element of risk that you take that also has to give people some agency and what I think is missing from the conversation about climate change is a real honest discussion about long term risk\nAnd what the responsibility is for people living in these places and they're elected leaders both at the local and the national level we're not having that conversation\nAnd Joshua ... one small point just to and if you think that that risk and getting your heads around the risk for lower income or poor people here in America is something we need to think about\nUh Americans also need to think about what some of our international leaders leaders generals like Colin Powell advisors had been saying for years if you think it's a risk in this country imagine what storms increased drought\nAnd conflict means for millions and millions of poor people around the world when they started to migrate when they upset the relationships between countries and that becomes not just their problem in terms of life and death but America's problem in terms of of keeping the world in order\nWill listen for those who are in an had been in the path of hurricane Michael we wish you of course a speedy recovery and we'd love to hear from you\nAs you continue to deal with the recovery give us a sense of how you're doing how the recovery is going\nWhat your thoughts are on how things are going how well FEMA is meeting your needs state officials how well that's going we always love to hear from you feel free to email us\nOne a at W.

A. M. U. dot org touch well look let's talk a bit about Brett Kavanaugh we're seeing\nThe Supreme Court nomination and confirmation heavily politicized going into the midterms President Trump is using the issue to energize Republicans Democrats are doing the same thing on the other side of the aisle I Wonder where we see this going especially since Democrats some of them\nSeem determined not to let the Kavanaugh's confirmation\nGo it seems to have had ... a ... or at least so it seems these numbers are a little sketchy I Want to put to provide so around what I'm about to say\nUh that the polls are fresh and we don't know exactly what this means yet for the upcoming midterms we all know in four weeks however it looks like now is having an opposite effect on Senate races and house races we've seen several Senate races places like\nTennessee or places like North Dakota where races that seemed to be closer where the Democrat who is challenging the Republican in a red state\nActually had a a chance to buy their surviving or in the case of Tennessee uh maybe picking up an open seat to now a search for Republicans that Brett Kavanaugh phenomenon seems to in Senate races\nHave solidified Republican base voters behind Republican candidates in most cases and then curiously in house races where so many Republicans are vulnerable\nUh I Can't say that it's had the opposite effect because I'm not sure that his Supreme Court fight has a cause and effect relationship on house races house members don't really have much to do with Supreme Court fights in at least not not in confirming them up but there doesn't seem to have been the same erosion\nA in a lead or in democratic support in the house however looking forward to and you mentioned that a lot of Democrats are promising their base that the fight isn't over on Brett Kavanaugh not necessarily because of his ideological positions on a rower executive power\nA but what his behavior was in high school and college and more importantly perhaps whether he was truthful under oath in front of the Judiciary Committee and in his statements when he talked about his drinking when he talked about his behavior in high school and college uh I Would look to the house\nMost likely house members who may if the numbers hold true control the house after January the will control the Judiciary Committee they will control the investigations committees they will have chairman ships and like and like Shane said\nWe also have to respond to a base that wants Brett Kavanaugh statements investigated a lot of this Joshua ... comes from dissatisfaction over the extremely limited nature of that FBI background check that week in between when Christine Blasey Ford came forward and we had that high profile\nHighly emotional and remarkable hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee around here the FBI really investigate did they get to the bottom of anything did they ask\nTen twelve fourteen people who may have been witnesses in some form to some of the wedge behavior it appears that they didn't and people might be relying on Democrats to pick up that church ...\nI'll add to this you know senator Kamala Harris is not just on the Senate Judiciary committee but she's also in the homeland security and government Affairs Committee and in that capacity she had the chance to grill\nFBI Director Christopher Wray on that face to face um how much intervention did the White House do in that says supplemental background check\nWill click also and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary committee Dianne Feinstein her six year term in the Senate is up there she's up for reelection you think that that this is going to come up in the debate between her and state senator Kevin daily own who wants to know why she sat on that letter from Dr Christine Blasey Ford for two months\nAnd last thing I'll say if she just last night with trying to take the fight from you know on the SCOTUS thing too\nThat the way that companies trying to remake the courts writ large talking about the Ninth Circuit court here in California ... this is a court that's been a real store in ... by the White House just put forth has three nominees there and she didn't get to sign off on them she's very upset about that and ...\nAt ... really breaking from tradition by not giving the home state senators any say in these packs\nI Do want to see if we can leave time it's all California politics before the round up is up but a few more things out of D.C we wanted to discuss including the president stepping into the middle of the feud between Taylor Swift and Kanye West he publicly just miss swift\nFor endorsing two Democrats in Tennessee but he woke him Kanye West of the White House yesterday Connie wore red make America great again hats for the visit\nAnd we're gonna have lunch with the dog is I Want to say I don't want to put you in that's why I Love this guy he let me give this guy\nI Love this guy right\n\nNow on the west was reportedly at the White House to discuss criminal justice reform he also said yesterday that he doesn't like the liberals and shows like Saturday Night live make the president look bad he said the president needs to be in his words precious to us as Americans\nWe should also be clear of those Shane Harris Kanye seemed rather rambling during the good bit of his visit maybe a little unhinged he admitted\nThat he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder I I'm I'm I'm hesitant to dig deep in on this story I think ... easy to mock easy to make fun of\nEasy to criticize but the fact that he said that he is a bipolar while he's meeting with the president and dropping some obscenity at the other side of the resolute desk I I'm not sure what to do with it\nI I'm not either I mean I was quite surreal we were actually in the newsroom working on other ... arguably more important stories I hesitate to be so deep and it's like you\nAnd looked up at the TV and we all sort of set is this is this really happening it was just so strange it's hard to know what to make of it but it is part of a litany of these kind of bizarre\nCarnival esque spectacles that we've seen both sometimes in the oval office and then from the president that have the flavor more of a reality show I mean their debts\nCame out of a when he ran for president and so in that sense I suppose it's not that surprising but I think for a lot of people there's a sense that it almost diminishes the office of the president to see this sort of rambling bizarre what do we make it a behavior\nFrom a celebrity that has been outspoken about his politics and that's his right but there's also left many people scratching his head about what is he actually doing and is is there something wrong with him or he was just a very strange moment and I know for\nFor for for me and my heart just tried to move fast as quickly as we could\nAnd the interest in moving passes quickly if you could still do that too but I should note that ... old and Mrs Taylor Swift inserted herself into politics this week\nShe endorsed Democrats Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house in her home state of Tennessee on social media\nAnd the Senate race in Tennessee is tight and British ... has strong support Taylor Swift has one hundred twelve million followers on Instagram and voter registrations among young people rose by more than sixty thousand\nAfter for post\nShane Harris let me stick with you for a moment because President Trump is facing another difficult situation regarding the disappearance of a journalist named ... Saudi dissident and a resident of the U.S he disappeared inside the Saudi consulate\nIn Turkey you've been doing a fair bit of reporting on this particularly the concern that the Turks have raised that the Saudis basically said hit men to kill ... to show you because of his reporting\nThe Turkish government hasn't really provided any independent evidence for this they say they have security video and and and logs of people who signed in and so forth\nWhat do we actually know right now if anything about what really happened right well we know right now is largely\nComing from the Turks and Turkish security agencies\nAre what we reported last night my colleagues and I and the Post's late last night was that the Turks have told the Americans that they actually have audio recordings and video from inside the consulate that they say definitively prove such a ... who was an opinion writer for the post Washington Post\nA was a beaten tortured and killed and ultimately dismembered inside\nThat facility the Americans we understand have not seen the footage or hurt it themselves but there is a growing believe within the U.S intelligence community and I think within Congress and the White House or that the Saudis probably did kill Jamal ... and are not at all being forthcoming about that this is a politically\nThis is Ninety point three WPN land National Public radio Ninety One point five WPN mountains of Houma and Ninety One point seven W.

A. M. U. dot org let's get back to that story of the Saudi Arabian journalist ... who has gone missing possibly murdered\n... we've heard a number of accounts particularly from the Turks about what Saudi Arabia allegedly did to Mr to show you that they basically said hitman after him what do we know for sure about the disappearance at this point\nFor shall we know that he walked into the come so uh in Istanbul and he didn't work out\nThat is what we know for sure that all then report that they were to go ... jets that came from Saudi Arabia or with fifty men of the day goes into\nA blackout a vines are drove to the ... so the ... so general's residence which is allegedly ... show he may have been taken and they did what they did to him now there are reports circulating that a Turkish intelligence have proof\nOr that or that they know what happened to him and that he was tortured and to spend but and\nAll decked under the fifty men then flew back to a Saudi Arabia on that Gulf Stream jets a little later in the day now we know that the the planes that were those two plane movements at different times that came into his stumble ... and then went back to ...\nWho was on them ... that designation was within the state capital racist widowed one hundred percent no but you get the distinct sense that uh the ... the Turkish are telling the authorities here\nI'm what you will thirties here in the U.S on the side and you know to a million miles from what I have just sketched out because I think that there has been a willingness to believe and that is why you're seeing\nThe deep expressions of anxiety and on these over what has unfolded and what the implications might be there's some things that you can easily sweep onto the carpet in international affairs are there are some things that are just there are a bit more ... quit I miss definitely falls into the latter category\nWhere we I Wonder if we can talk about the U.S in Saudi Arabia is relationship the real long time allies at a press conference at the oval office yesterday President Trump was asked about to show these disappearance here's part of what the president's at\nFirst I Want to find out what happened and we're located again this took place in Turkey\nAnd to the best of our knowledge\nIs not a United States citizen is that right or for a permanent resident okay we don't like it John would like it and we don't like it even a little bit but as to whether or not we should stop a hundred and ten million dollars from being spent in this country knowing they have four\nOr five alternatives to very good alternatives that would not be acceptable to be okay but we're looking for the answer and I think probably you'll have an answer sooner than people say\nThe president speaking at the oval office yesterday and when we use referring to the human Saudi Arabia and the four or five alternatives would be other countries from whom the Saudis could buy arms to hundred and ten billion dollars is an arms deal a military deal between the U.S\nAnd Saudi Arabia worry I Wonder if you could give us a sense of how this case\nFits into the relationship between the U.S in Saudi Arabia especially in light of the comment that I read it earlier ... sixteen forty three wrote on our website the one eight dot org\nAnd there was no reason to maintain close ties with the country that heads more people than ISIS finally gives women the right to drive but it's only window dressing\nIs killing civilians in Yemen and murdered a journalist who was critical of the quote unquote royal family if I were king for a day all the weapons we've sold them would be rendered useless and Jared Kushner would be banned from any policy making\nLaw the sharp elbows throwing that comment I Wonder if you can help us fact\nChecked that yeah I think um it's it's a really a fascinating point and also that that um clip you played of Donald Trump was really striking because I'm the one hand\nIt seemed so I'm cold lead transactional in the sense that he was saying you know we have billions of dollars pouring in why am I going to stop that just because they have murdered a dissident journalist in other words I Am so you know I don't care about human rights I mean we usually than up for I care about money pouring into the United states economy\nAnd that attitude had activated a lot of\nUm people in Washington who are against our alliance with Saudi Arabia for example senators on both sides of the aisle that Chris Murphy and Rand Paul who have an argument for a long time just as the commentator said\nI'm now we're supporting a war in Yemen that it's unconscionable that is starving civilians and killing civilians killing civilians and you know ... ... attacks and other things that are just horrendous um\nThe hell out of the country short but since you mentioned Rand Paul I'm really sorry to interrupt you but we have a clip of Rand Paul speaking to reporter this week on that very thing he said he would try to force a vote\nYou finish your thought but first let's hear from Senator Paul\nI think that the early reports have shown that this is linked to the Saudi Government and nothing happens in Saudi Arabia without the government's approval\nSo no I think that ah and less and less of a sudden the journalists turns of alive I think that we should we should just continue our arms sales to Saudi Arabia [noise] plus I think we need to be voting in the Senate and debating whether or not we should be involved in the war in Yemen\nThat was Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky where we go ahead so I was gonna say people like Rand Paul are going to push back against arms sales about about our support for the war\nIn Yemen um even saw a at a law makers invoking the global Magnitsky Act which said that the u._s. Trump Administration has to investigate what happened and if they find Saudi officials responsible they need to impose sanctions all that being said I wanted there is a counterpoint to that too which is that\nOur relationship with Saudi Arabia has always been transactional Trump kind of said the quiet part out loud a little bit in the way he in a way he framed it out yesterday because\nWe have never had a relationship and alliance based on value since World War two it had all been about money and oil think about nine eleven Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers were from Saudi Arabia\nThat didn't lead to a permanent rupture in our alliance because we've always seen them as a strategic ally not as the values faith ally as in Europe and I think that's important to keep in mind that Trump Senate and particularly accentuated way and he feels you know is very transactional way past presidents have\nBut this is somewhat reflective of what you at the uh presidents have said quietly for a long\nTime yeah sure sure if I could chip in the Nazis here I mean I think Donald Trump said out loud what other presidents and other prime ministers have said it could moments in relationships you have with regimes that are far from perfect I mean I remember when Tony Blair was prime minister\nAnd there was a huge arms deal that was about to be concluded\nAnd the British serious fruit office launched an investigation into what Saudi Arabia or had been doing and whether they'd be paying kickbacks or whatever to get contracts through\nA ... and you know it was clear that Saudi said to Blair you've got to call this the cooled off the dos otherwise the deal is in jeopardy and highly unusually mercifully\nControversial Leigh Tony Blair intervened with a ... an independent investigation and said right we're canceling this investigation\nAnd he used his power as prime minister because he felt he had to because Saudi Arabia was to the customer too important an ally\nAnd you've seen with Donald Trump you know one of the first place if he went to when he became president was to Saudi Arabia I traveled with him on that trip\nAnd it was they were one hundred percent in with Mohammed bin Salman now whether they're regrets email note is an open question however they they are there are there and Donald Trump is determined that the arms deal will go ahead\nJoshua for we keep oh go ahead and oh I was just going\nTo say if I could just add one thing that struck me as what the president didn't say he didn't mention Iran and he didn't mention the peace down as you recall last month that the UN\nAt the United states has pretty aggressive in calling around the biggest threat to the region and by extension it was seen Saudi Arabia is that stopgap against possible Iranian expansion across the middle east\nOn and of course on Saudi Arabia would be key to any sort of he still so I think it's interesting that I'm a month ago we were talking about\nPolicies and going against Iran and so going forward how much will the U.S focus on Iran and stopping an Iranian expansion on shape it's reaction or lack there of 'em to chew what's happened in Saudi Arabia and if it if an impact is the case that they have\nAt the ... and October nineteenth tickets at Nashville Symphony daughter where um\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from bona with the bonus certified craftsmen program a network of hardwood flooring contractor is committed to expertise in customer service contractor locate her aunt more information or at Boehner dot com\n[noise] from capital one committed to reimagining banking offering savings and checking accounts that can be open from anywhere capital one what's in your wallet capital one in a\n[noise] and from listeners like you who donate to this NPR station\nBack now to the friday news roundup with John ... use if and Henri Friedman still time to get in some of your questions and thoughts about the week's top stories as well one eight at W. A. M. U. dot org\nThe story of the next president of Interpol Ming hung way was reported missing last week by his wife that stories moved Maine was detained by Chinese authorities on corruption charges\nHe resigned in immediate effect this week the arrest as part of a larger official anti corruption campaign by China's president Xi Jinping know grace Meng the ex Interpol president's wife is speaking out she told the Associated Press that she felt threatened\nNephews have do we have a sense that you do of why this is going on and what it is that makes me so important to the Chinese government of what this means that a larger sense well\nHe's been a long time operative of the the Chinese government and there are arguments being made that this is part of an effort to purge non loyalists too\nMedia specifically what's app is playing a very important role and lots of fake news is circulating I really believe that with Wilson out of our democracy is at risk John civil what's projected to happen for the runoff is there any sense of whether ... could win this\nFor the last poll I saw suggested yes that the the latest post suggests that he is it fifty eight percent\nOn the opposition leader is at forty two percent or ... ... and so I kind of thing that you'd have to say that it's it's with that sort of margin of error is going to take some quite something for the left is kind of the kinds of it to come back from that position um I mean you know they talk about violence and the other thing about both ... he was stabbed\nIn September as a rally I'm so there's been a lot of violence round but it has meant that he's been able to say\nI really love to take part in debates really count at the moment because I'm Still you know slightly getting ready for this stopping that I had things that I'm afraid I might be able to come to your studio this evening on so I think that there is kind of a feeling that you know he is he's got his head down he has said what he said people know exactly where he stands and I think he sees the finish line\nOne story that much of the world has been talking about has to do with a new report from the UN's inter governmental panel on climate change the eyepiece Sisi the report says that the world is quickly running out of time to stem catastrophic climate change\nScientists predict we're on course to go beyond a crucial threshold of the world's average temperature rising one point five degrees Celsius or to point seven degrees Fahrenheit in just over about ten years they saved that would leave us dealing with the risks of extreme drought wildfires floods food shortages for hundreds of millions of people\nWe talked about this report on the program this week one comment from a listener stuck along the lines that at least here in America\nThis is just not a big enough issue I mean people will vote for a lot of reasons and\nThe state of our climate is not something that lawmakers talk much about or that voters demand to discuss Nancy use if what is your sense of that of whether or not this report has made an impact around the world enough for people to start demanding action\nI think it's made an impact but the problem is the effects of this already been seeing in various ways around the world so where one country can say it's not\nA big impact another country could see it as an immediate impact and something that needs to be dealt with aggressively and of course the kinds of changes that this report says need to happen are so I'm\nDrastic that in demand sort of a uniform world agreed upon action and we're not there yet and so I'm ... years scene of variance in response and I think it really reflects the variants have impact that nation's already seen\nAnd you know as a as a war correspondent and one of the things I see it come up most often as as a cause of the start of\nWars and conflicts environmental changes changing where people live how they're able to eat sell on E. it's an area that doesn't just hit the environment that really hits other parts of of national security and government writ large but there's because of the complexity in terms of its impact\nI think it's hard to get a uniform agreement particularly in such a polarized time um so it's hard to be optimistic that that will see at least in the short term the kinds of drastic changes at this report says needs to happen to stop literally famine drought wildfires really severe consequences\nYour I was in Europe at the beginning of the week and when the report came out on and on the main national news shows a half an hour long so the same as the nightly news programs here the the first six seven minutes with devoted to decide PCC report\nI Wonder how much was devoted I mean that's one of the things that really strikes me about living here compared in America\nInch than any other kind of country on the planet", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "12"}
