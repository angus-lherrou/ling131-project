the results of its limited investigation into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh the report came in late last night we're told hours after that Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell filed a motion\nFor a friday vote on Brett Kavanaugh's Kavanaugh's nomination on the Senate floor the final vote on whether it confirmed him\nIs expected to happen Saturday joining me to discuss the report and its potential fallout is NPR Justice Department reporter Ryan Lucas Ryan welcome thank you so we have this report or will the Senate has the report now or do we the people had any idea what he's actually contained within the four corners\nWell we don't have any sort of specific snow and this is certainly something that is confidential and not a something that is generally released to the public and there are no plans at this point according to the Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley for any of this to be made public\nA despite clearly a fair amount of interest among Democrats to make this public and certainly I think among the Trump a chunk of the American public to to learn what's in there or what we do know is that publicly at least\nA six people have confirmed that they spoke to the FBI many of them are people who are friends of the judge Kavanaugh's during high school that would be mark judge PJ Smith Tim gone debt and Chris Garrett\nA as well as one friend of a Ford's that's legal in Kaiser who all confirmed that they spoke to the FBI and then there's a second woman who made allegations of sexual misconduct against cabin on that's Deborah Ramirez and we know that she also spoke to the FBI now a NPR has learned um that\nUh nine people according to a to a an official nine people spoke with the the FBI in total\nUm but again a lot of this is one that you know we don't know what all the FBI was told in this uh and likely we're not going to get a full picture but what we do have so far as what a chairman Grassley has said and that is that there is nothing in there that the committee and the public at this one didn't already\nKnow so where is the report right now physically I mean how our senators looking at it because it's extremely sensitive every reporter in Washington wants to get a look at it in in every political operative does too\nWell uh the process for this is governed by a memorandum of understanding that uh dates back\nRound a decade uh but what generally happens is when the White House gets this background in information on a judicial nominees nominee that will send it over to a Senate Judiciary committee has generally held in the Judiciary Committee safe\nToday it's being held in a secure location in the capital and which senators can come down and look at it there are dismayed is basically working in shifts right now we're Democrats were getting our um to take a look at it and then Republicans and there are small handful of the staffers who have clearance to see this as as well but

...\nOr if not the Olympics do you think of the host of the twenty fourteen feet for World Cup [noise]\nNeymar has got to go or maybe your mind wanders back even further to two thousand one when Brazil was predicted to become one of the world's top economies by twenty fifty\nThat Russia India and China wreck for short but there's not\nCan lay down and our second annual summit joining me now to talk about the\nOlympics the world cup one of the most exciting emerging markets in the world to Brazil was once heralded as Latin America's crown jewel\nBut then it was hit with a one two punch of a massive corruption scandal and stunning economic collapse now unemployment in Brazil is at Thirteen percent the country has sixty thousand homicides per year on average and its current president boasts of an approval rating\nOf just three percent all of that is backdrop to Brazil upcoming presidential elections far right populist ... he's facing off against the leftist his rival Fernando had died on Sunday and the lead up to the election has already been packed with drama including boss and arrows near fatal stabbing last month\nAnd we're here to talk about what the election means for Brazil and how what happens in Brazil will reverberate across both America's\nMonica to bowl is he or she is senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics\nShe's also director of Latin American studies at Johns Hopkins university\nAnd she she's here with me in the studio Monica thanks for being here thank you for having me up Bryan winter is editor in chief of America's quarterly and the vice president for policy at the American society and the counsel of the Americas he joined us over Skype from Sao paulo in Brazil Brian thanks for being here\nHello Todd happy to be with you good to talk to you and ... is director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center he's also with us here in Studio Palo thanks to you for being here pleasure to be a well Brian you're the one in Sao paolo so let me give you honors here to start\nA let's start with the nitty gritty who is ... and our most Americans might not be familiar with him\nAnd it's a ... a retired army captain who has been in Congress for nearly three\nDecades now I'm ... despite having sat in Congress ...\nFirst so much time he he shows open loading for uh for the legislative body I mean he has said over the years numerous times that the Congress is dysfunctional and it should be closed um he's also advocated torture of his political or of leftists and\nAnd other political opponents 'em and you know that message for a long time was was regarded as marginalized here I mean he was not a popular figure\nBut in the last couple of years because of this historic economic crisis that you mentioned Todd\nThose messages are resonating a lot more with people when they did in the past and now here we are with this presidential election coming up on Sunday and he has a ten point lead and all over his nearest rival it looks like there will be a runoff vote which would be on October twenty eighth\nAnd that one is that one's a close call right now between him and and the guy who's likely to face with this Fernando had died\nBut it's it's just so strange for me to be here because I Lived in Brazil for five years and if it was not that long ago I was here from twenty to end the twenty fifty and this seemed\nLike just such a strong democracy it seemed like a place that had come so far since the period of last\nMilitary rule from Nineteen sixty four in Nineteen eighty five but being here this week and talking to people I mean I there's a lot of people who are ready to vote for both in our all even if it does mean a return to you know the more authoritarian ways of the past year\nSome people just both wrote a brine we're going to work on your sky blind a little bit uh we'll we'll get that cleaned up and will definitely come back to a Monica what about Fernando had died in in contrast he's not as\nFiery as ... an hour with correspondent has been described by some as Trump being or maybe more akin to you\nAround the the drug dealers should be shot or threatens to summer summarily execute them what about his opponent front for of Fernando ... what do we know about him\nSo what we know about him um is that he's not a an organic member of the Workers Party the P. T. um he's someone who sort of an outsider when you look at the composition of the bt far less though\nHe's not he's a moderate um but the leadership of the Workers Party of the PTA currently is very radicalized so it's very different\nFrom the time when former president Lula was in government for example from twenty three I'm twenty ten when the party really did take this sort of center left stance so the party at south now is very much hard left um the candidate though is that\nUm that being said that the real big problem in Brazil at the moment is that\nThere is a lot a lot of anti P. T. anti worker party sentiment so\nA lot of the vote that has been migrating too far right extremist both so narrow um is this anti PT vote so these elections are very strange because they had become elections about not who\nNecessarily voters actually went to see at president but about who voters do not do not see a friend that\nWe're going to talk about corruption we're going to talk about graft we are going to talk about a failing economy because all of those things play and I think to\nThe idea that voters know who they don't want they don't want the people who were taking billions of dollars in bribes which has been a major problem we're gonna talk all about that Apollo let me turn to you what about turnout in this election Brazil has compulsory voting I don't know if that means that they get to a hundred percent but people do\nCome out to the polls what's the mood like among Brazilians are they excited to to sweep out the corrupt dirty politicians and get both in our in there or are they beaten down in in weary\nI think there are more weary than a decisive in terms of going there and changing things or the electorate is very divided normally the eighty percent of the voters show up\nOr we may have less of a proportion this time\nA one important feature here is how many voters will spoiled their their vote will leave it blank were cancelled oval because that is important\nWhoever gets a fifty percent of the valid votes is elected president there is an outside chance that that could happen this Sunday\nOr we both are allowed to win the more like the according to the late ... is that we go to a runoff\nBut the mood ... and with ... frustrated people feel betrayed by the political class in Brazil a regardless if they are the less from the left from derived from the center people feel absolutely fed up with politics with politicians\nAnd that there is no alternative because there is not going to be admitted very cool in Brazil and we're going to find our way through politics\nNow Brian I think we have your sky blind nice and clean now I'm ... has a history of violent rhetoric he's been photographed waving machine guns around as I mentioned he he likes to fantasize about his opponents or for drug dealers receives\nBeing shot but there's been some actual violence in this campaign last month ... was actually stabbed at a campaign rally or what happened there and what's happened since how has it affected his standing among voters in Brazil in a way\nPolitical violence at that level and I was personally awful for for both in our own he he almost died by his own account and and those are the doctors that treated him\nPolitically I think it's fair to say that it was helpful um because\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and

election what's happening in Brazil might seem familiar to Americans in the wake of the twenty sixteen us presidential elections my guests are Monica to both senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international\nAmerica's quarterly and the vice president for policy at the American society and the council the ... of the Americas\nAnd Paolo ... is director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center and you had been sending us your message is one of the listeners\nDrew emails I was in northwest Brazil last month staying with a gay black friend he is all in for ... and our people are so fed up after the carwash scandal\nThey will go for anything that isn't part of the Workers Party now Monica before the break you were telling us about car wash the actual car wash in the broad offensive corruption scandal\nOr is it over ... have have all of the [noise] I don't want to mix metaphors but have all the wellhead all the cars been overturned it opened up and cleaned out in car wash\nWell it is winding down um so the bulk of it has already has already occurred but let me go back in time just a little bit because it is important to put into context you think's\nThe most important um findings have love has yet to or a car wash worrying twenty Fifteen and twenty sixteen\nAnd at that time I'm president Dilma Rousseff of the Workers Party was Brazil's leader she had been reelected in twenty fourteen into was president at the time\nUm she was impeached in twenty six team\nAnd part of the reason for her impeachment there are many moving parts here but one of the moving parts was the fact that a she had lost control of her of her coalition and her her coalition had\nUm a number of other political parties that war implicated in the car wash\nFindings in the car wash probing the plea bargains 'em and everything else that started to come out publicly in terms of this particular investigation she wasn't she didn't she never did anything to actually stop the investigation which was really a positive thing\nUm but that was one of the things that actually lead to her downfall because\nThe the impeachment that\nShe suffered was really very much politically motivated by the need that some of these political parties in her coalition had\nTo try to at least slow ... if not stop it all together and this is a very important element when we look at the degree of polarization that currently exists in Brazil\nBecause if people who still defend the workers' party instilled defend the P. T.\nThey go back to the impeachment overt sad as one major argument for why you know things that the Workers Party has been let's say\nUnfairly treated and the way that the that that things have gone down\nMatt writes to us or on email I had a Brazilian friend years back who called his home country the greatest country that never was meaning to Brazil\nHas had such riches in terms of natural resources but it is not had the government or the leadership to make it a competitor with the United states Apollo Matt makes a good point Brazil was celebrated\nAs the rising star not only of Latin America of emerging economies around the world compared to India and China we mentioned it at the top but now horrible recession horrible corruption what happened in Brazil where was the Brazil that that hosted the Olympics in was and was on the way up\nRocks and Brazil believe too much in the magic that it's a country predestined to be great and forgot to do the necessary things you do in order to build that country ah one of the major ... is the size of the workers ... was led\nBy a man born in poverty are that are built this\nInitially ethics in politics\nThere is this sense after Brazil\nA ... a a basic ... riding a wonderful wave in international economics meat producer of commodities had the wonderful moment poverty was reduced and that is what led to this impression that Brazil was unstoppable well\nA than reality hits\nA ruler made a very bad choice when his successor\nA and a a lot of a shot to Cain\nAnd the magic would disappear or what we have today is a consequence and this is what I think what they should be positive and all of this\nWe cannot blame others for our problems this crisis was produced in Brazil by Brazilians are and another thing that ... they shouldn't be positive\nIs the fact that the states in Brazil was basically broke\nAnd we have run off the money ah all that green now has to be has ended and the nightmare has to be confronted from eight to ... reality ... basis where the government says run all the money we have to adjust the economy the measures necessary to do this are very\nOff an unpopular and none of the candidates have explain exactly what the how they plan to come from the ...\nNow Bryan winter you're with us from Brazil or I read an article Brian date you recently wrote where you were asked by a friend I think to sum up Brazil in two sentences and I'm going to paraphrase a little bit your answer ultimately your conclusion\nWas too many BS privileges for the elite not enough good leaders what exactly did you mean by that terse conclusion well if\nYou look around right now at the field of candidates there's there's one thing that all Brazilians agree on which is that they find the candidates running for president to be an inspiring um the vast majority of people here as we've said during the program I\nFeel like they're voting against somebody rather than voting for somebody and the consequences of\nThat is is just I mean it's it's stunning for somebody who lived here during that era when things were going really well which you've mentioned touch the degree of cynicism the degree of disbelief that people have in our system of government is just amazing and you know it's part of a global trend I mean we've seen\nThis happen in places like turkey in Hungary and elsewhere around the world\nBut this democratic recession as some people have called it really is especially strong here and that makes sense because Brazil is taking a bigger beating um in terms of its economy and in terms of the reputation of its politicians because of this\nCorruption scandal than virtually any other western democracy in recent years there was a poll by the Pew\nResearch Center and twenty Seventeen that found that just eight percent of Brazilians say representative democracy is a very good form of government that was the lowest of thirty eight countries that that that you surveyed\n... and that just shows you the climate here right now and the reason why many people fear that both in our own if elected would basically have carte blanche to take a you know hard right turn it could involve the curtail moment of civil civil liberties and and and other things\nI in my time and this week um I've had meetings with people from civil society and the press and others who you know these are serious people not prone to panic or anything like that who are talking openly about the possibility of exile and that's just blew me away I mean it it's a Brazil that I've read about in history books\nA rural Nineteen sixty four was the last two I thought it was real results that had been firmly relegated to history books and\nYou know maybe maybe maybe they are maybe it is getting a little\nBit melodramatic in some quarters but but they're real fears and and and people are stared right now\nWell Brian you mentioned a statistic that was disturbing only eight percent of Brazilian say their representative democracy is the best form of government now I'm an right to the point frying Ramirez emails us\nWhy are we so concerned about the right versus the left in Brazil both in our is another ... he's an air to wanna ... all these dictator dictator wannabes who were being resurrected in Europe and Asia and now in Latin America\nAll of them are loads for

number ... ... when I was in England I experimented with wounded ... didn't like that and didn't inhale and they're trying to do\n[laughter] Bill Clinton in the run up to the presidential elections in Nineteen Ninety two a deceased late Christopher Hitchens went to Oxford with Bill Clinton said the idea that Bill Clinton didn't inhale it Oxford was probably true because he knew firsthand their Bill Clinton chose to take his marijuana in edible foreign\nPatch what Hitchens used to say he was no friend of Bill Clinton by the way we should stipulate that\nA Bill Clinton's answer was lampooned at

pleasant with each other suddenly became antagonistic suddenly politics became a team sport that experience is one of the reasons why I today and nonpartisan\nUp Steve you're nodding and I think that type of reaction to sorting\nMight sound familiar to you I Want to go back to the history and just a moment but before we do I want to get to a moment in tribalism in politics where we are right now I Want to talk about Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham back during impeachment was a member of the house he was an impeachment manager\nHe helped impeach Bill Clinton in ... before the Senate to make the case as a prosecutor\nThat Bill Clinton should be removed from office because of the Monica Lewinsky\nExperience I'm now Lindsey Graham is also made himself highly visible these last several weeks during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings he angrily defended cab and he said the other day in the hearings I think everybody thought I'm a single white male people want me to shut up and I won't shut up and he was red faced and he was furious on behalf of\nBrett Kavanaugh and presumably white men everywhere but contrast that with the Lindsey Graham of twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen and even twenty twelve hears Lindsey Graham at a roast dinner in twenty Seventeen poking fun at Paul Ryan speaker of the house but making a point\nForty six years you've been the vice presidential nominee of the Republican Party here the speaker of the house the Republican controlled house you're smart you know the budget that we're in for\nYou have a good temperament and disposition and the judgment of Solomon you are dead men walking\nTwelve Lindsey Graham the same Lindsey Graham used to warn about the future of the Republican Party he would quipped to me at any reporter who would listen we can't make angry white guys fast enough\nTo survive as a Republican Party in the future meaning Republicans\nHad your broaden their appeal to women to minorities to Hispanics flash forward to the Lindsey Graham of this week I'm a white male and I'm not gonna take it anymore stunning what does this transformation Lindsey Graham hulk vacation\nIn the Trump here it said to you about where we were in in in where we are yeah I mean I think it tells me that the\nDivide is deepening any idea tells me that the the lines that were kind of drawn that you saw in the two thousand election and I say that we've lived with his sense\nThey're only going deeper in the moment you talked about there in twenty twelve after twenty twelve election\nThere was as you remember the certainly the the Republican sort of establishment nationally look to the Mitt Romney's last a brac Obama included what Lindsey Graham did demographically the way the country had been divided up for the last Fifteen or Twenty years was not going to work for them long term\nThey came up with that autopsy report they were going to change on immigration all this stuff\nDonald Trump comes along and violates every tenet of this of this autopsy and wins\nAnd I think it it's not just that he won the general election to lead to a huge part of it but the fact that he was able to sweep through the Republican Party's like other primaries like he didn't twenty sixteen\nTold Republicans like Lindsey Graham and of course easy to forget but Lindsey Graham did run for president in twenty sixteen one of the sixteen or Seventeen Republicans who did and failed miserably and I think that's what I think that lesson there of going head to head against Trump\nOf dismissing him completely at the beginning of that race Graham called him a kooky called him a bunch of things\nUm in twenty sixteen and then watching how within the Republican world how Trump resonated with voters it told them boy there's something about our own voters our own party our own tribe\nThat we didn't quite understand maybe we didn't want to understand ... granted more than just name calling in a primary he told Republicans we are finished if we nominate Donald Trump that he is the death knell of his\nParty so what is Lindsey Graham thinking now is he thinking I have to win a Republican primary in twenty twenty in South Carolina where Donald Trump is popular so I'd better get on the Trump train and that's all there is to it the last\nThe last gasp of the Republican Party and I'm going to be a senator for one more term or is he is he converted what's he think he I mean look\nThere's then there's all sorts of theories about this and I don't know but I'll give you a couple of them that that that that jumped out at me one is what you're saying yeah he's got to worry about a Republican primary every Republican one of the lessons\nOf Donald Trump's rise and his enduring popularity with Republican voters one of the lessons\nTo Republican officeholders as you are taking a major major risk\nIf you are seen as separating yourself from this president your neck primary especially if you're Lindsey Graham and you already have a history of sort of being a being antagonistic towards the right here and they're so grim has to worry about that there's also the theory that hey part of this is\nLindsey Graham trying to play the influence game if you're if you're you know friendly to Trump in public if you sing his praises uh if you change your tone on Trump the way he as if you're a golf with him maybe if you're Lindsey Graham and you have some issues particularly on foreign policy and national security this is a way to influence them but I think one of the other lessons is to is it is again\nLindsey Graham looking at Trump than twenty sixteen and saying this is absolute political suicide for the Republican Party could go down this road\nAnd then seeing Donald Trump win the election I Know it was narrow but seeing the one I think ... Lindsey Graham and just brought more broadly tells Republicans\nThat this tribalism is so much deeper than we realized it was and it changes what you're able to do and what you can do politically Kennett last is the question given the demographics of this country Lindsey Graham I'll remind you one last time said himself over and over\nCan't make angry white guys fast enough we can't manufacture them fast enough to be a party the future\nChanged his mind about that or not James sent us an email I frequently have yard signs for political candidates in my front yard and because there are good candidates on both sides of the aisle\nI usually have candidates from both major parties and I am surprised\nAt how often several of my neighbors expressed their genuine irritation with me that I can endorse candidates from both parties very tribal instead of an evaluation on the merits and and Steve you're nodding because that does not sound surprising to you yeah well what he's describing his ticket splitting yeah at the main political science they those voters who go and they\nHave a Democratic president Republican for Congress they split up the ballot\nJust election two election that the number of people out there who do that who split their ticket\nHas been shrinking shrinking and you're looking at single digits right now and that that is just the rise of polarization the tribal isn't All right let's get back in our way way back machine are red and blue way way back machine go back in history with you Steve corner you so much of what your book is about\nUh we talked about the speaker of the house Newt Gingrich who are on led to believe did not talk to you for this book although although he certainly could have\nA when he was a young rabble rousing congressman\nWho was willing to defy the normal rules of congressional decorum in May of Nineteen eighty four he delivered an insult on the floor of the house to then time speaker from Massachusetts the legendary Tip O'Neill\nI find this week or as you pointed out to us again yesterday are in charge of this house\nIf you are saying to me the euro postmaster isn't capable of delivering from one member to another the male and the system you run\nThen I think you may want to appoint a commission to look into the post office\nNow maybe of veiled insult there that might take a little bit of parsing but give it back story and why Newt Gingrich was slinging an insult at a well respected and legendary Tip O'Neill yeah that that in in hindsight now you look back Thirty years and you play you may say well what was the big deal the idea was Democrats had run the Congress at that point for Thirty years\n\n[noise]\n\nSupport for NPR comes from disposition and from Rhodes Scholar a not for profit offering learning adventurous for adults and natural settings across the country learn more at R.

update for you the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary committee says the FBI has turned up nothing to corroborate allegations that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was\nInvolved in sexual assault in high school and another instance of sexual misconduct in college there is nothing in it that we didn't already know said Senator Chuck Grassley adding\nThere's also no contemporaneous evidence this investigation found no hint of misconduct and the same is true of the six prior FBI background investigations conducted during judge Kavanaugh's twenty five years\nOf public service that was Chuck Grassley chairman of the Judiciary Committee I was quoting their ranking member on the Senate Judiciary committee Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California disagrees she says it looks to be the product of an incomplete investigation\nThat was limited perhaps by the White House Dianne Feinstein ranking member expect much more on this throughout the day on your NPR station\nI Want to turn back to Steve ... in just a moment but before we do a quick appeal for some help with the program in the works for next week here on one day we spend a lot of time yesterday to talking with women about how society views angry women and there's a broad range of opinion but most of the women were hearing from our progressive and liberal\nIf you're a conservative woman tell us how your seeing this moment what have you got to say how\nDo you want to be heard in the fight over Brett Kavanaugh and in the fight over me to the discussions over me to in this country do you think your views are being represented or respect it leaves the voicemail eight five five to three six one a one a if you're a female Republican or at least someone who would describe themselves as\nBroadly conservative what do you want the country to hear about you tell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a that's eight five five to three six one two one two will make sure to get your stories on the air part of the national conversation in the days ahead\nYou're on one day while we're talking for the most part about what politician said\nAnd did in the Nineteen Ninety so how do they define their ideologies for the American people it's not just Washington that's polarized we've been asking listeners\nFor memorable moments from politics in the nineties and and here's one\nAnd the president is right in many ways we are a shining city on it\nBut the hard truth is that not everyone is sharing in this city's splendor and or if\nThere is this fair Mr President\nAnd the faces that you don't see in the places that you don't visit\nYour shining city\nAnd believe you're hearing from Mario Cuomo\nBe at the peak of his political career the shining city on the hill well here's what I was going for another moment or the moment that listeners sent us from oh gosh the early nineties I take you back towards any overhaul\n[noise]\n\nHere to be president President Bill Clinton June Nineteen Ninety two on the Arsenio Hall show remember him for five years before that year presidential\nCandidates didn't really appear on night time talk shows at all so that was something new talk about how politicians grappled with media coverage during those years a Steve that was a moment not just because of the president appeared on Arsenio Hall but he seemed to offer an alternative\nTo gosh even Pat Buchanan speech there is a religious war in this country very stark very serious and and a lot of Americans agreed with him here was Bill Clinton in sunglasses just having a whole lot of fun the guy you want at the party\nIt was also the moment that was June Nineteen Ninety two when Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall show Bill Clinton was actually running\nNot in first or second but in third place in the president I raised at that point personally sort of Ross Perot [laughter] begging place was Bush the incoming president in third place buried\nI was about twenty five percent was Bill Clinton instead they were his team he remembered that Bill Clinton who emerged from the Democratic primaries in Ninety two had was thought to be an electable he'd gone through the scandal about Gennifer Flowers he'd gone through the scandal about avoiding the Vietnam draft he'd gone through the I didn't inhale moment that sort of hard in this image of\nSlick willy the guy who's going to you know lawyer early ... scheme is way out of\nA out of everything and so they were trying his campaign was to did change his image and he had this you know obviously winning personality and they wanted to showcase it and they wanted to get around\nInterviews with you know traditional news interviews where every question was going to be about gender flowers in the draft and all that so here was a way you go on a syndicated nighttime talk show like Arsenio Hall which was very hot at that moment you're showcase a different side of your personality\nAnd it was Ninety two it wasn't just starts anew Ninety two was the year\n... media had been expanding in so many ways in that media expansion really met up with politics presidential politics I mentioned Perot who was running in first place at that point the entire Perot phenomenon began\nIn February Ninety two on the CNN show Larry King Larry King and and Larry King would sometimes have politicians on and sometimes aging celebrities and they'd spend an hour and they take calls\nAnd Ross Perot was on in February Ninety two and he said you know if the if there are volunteers out there who will put me on the ballot in all fifty states I'll run for president as an independent\nIn just from that\nA movement sprung up organically across the country to do in Texas about two months later volunteers submitted two hundred and fifty four thousand signatures to get Ross Perot on the ballot and he was running in first place by June and he was doing talk shows\nClinton was doing talk shows there was a Clinton Jerry Brown primary debate on the Phil Donahue show the syndicated daytime talk show 'em in George W. Bush this was a generational aspect to sixty eight year old George W. Bush the president running for reelection his spokesman said after Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall's show that night well\nWe won't be doing anything like that in our city hall went on his show the next night and just tore into Bush that went went after it was beneath the presidency yeah it was beneath the presidency to go on a nighttime talk show where people goof around and make a you know goof adolescent jokes that's not\nThat's not for a president and and Bill Clinton said Oh yes Oh yes it is said and by the end of the campaign that Bush wasn't doing our city oh by the end of the campaign but he was doing you know morning shows on TV in ... he was starting to sort of get the message\nUm politicians now manage immediate\nShow is par for the course because people want you to display your personality Brock Obama had a winning personality an affable nice guy and used it to great political effect everywhere from Jimmy Fallon just even cold there there isn't a show that Iraq Obama didn't go on successfully\nUm Donald Trump in his campaign did the same as well because he's extremely comfortable on live television even if somehow less likeable than\nThan maybe Barack Obama was but but the mores of how you reach the public has changed just radically they changed completely since the moment when George W. Bush said we're not going to lower the presidency by going on or send your home and I think too you can you can draw a line between we were talking about Gingrich earlier\nIn the rise of Gingrich net moment with Oh Neal what that moment came from with Gingrich looking for a way around\nWhat at the time were the dominant sort of media platforms and they were just the broadcast networks and Gingrich\nThird term congressman from Georgia said I'm not going to be able to get my message out across ABC CBS NBC because they don't pay attention to me he CSPAN\nGive CSPAN was five years old in the early Nineteen eighties and he used the late night speeches and CSPAN to seek out find and develop a relationship with a new audience draw a line from that and how Gingrich or legal to build his career his rise in the house around that fast forward to Donald Trump or did Donald Trump to\nTelevision obviously a part of it but really in the campaign social media Twitter Donald Trump identified through Twitter away to go around not just the news media but the entertainment media is well that's that's so engaged in politics now into directly get his message across to voters to get around it\nI see what Gingrich was doing in the eighties with C SPAN in Trump was doing with Twitter and and I think there's a real common thread there\nWell let's go back then in the way way back machine one more time\nTo Nineteen Ninety nine Donald Trump was people forget was involved with politics even at the time he flirted mentally and even in reality with presidential run long before he was ever successful he went on meet the press\nBack in Nineteen Ninety nine and had some thoughts about somebody that we've already talked about Pat Buchanan the insurgent right wing politician in the Republican Party\nFor his ... I guess he's an anti satellite\nHe doesn't like the black sea those are like the gays I I I it's just incredible that anybody can embrace this guy and maybe I'll get four or five percent of the vote and it'll be a really staunch right wacko vote I'm not even sure if it's right it's just a lack of and I just can't imagine that anybody can take them seriously\nNinety point three WPN Nashville public radio Ninety One point five WGM outside the home in Ninety One point seven WHM rascal\nFilms get the latest stories from W ... news throughout the day and connect with National Public radio via Twitter and Facebook WPN land out or you can also find schedules for all of our program channels and listen to a live stream of any of our programming on line\nLearn more about connecting with Nashville public radio at W.

F. them is made possible by listeners support learn how you can support this service at Nashville public radio dot org\nOr who's been accused of such crimes have been found and what what they're saying shifts if one of the central tensions one of the things which really divided the country in the last several days [noise] ... well we'll talk about that a little bit more a mom and apparently Charles Schumer has now gone to the Senate floor let's listen to the Senate minority leader\n... chapters in the long history of the federal judiciary\nThe well was poisoning from the outset\nWhen President Trump's selected judge Kavanaugh from the list of names pre approved by hard right special interest groups for whom the national interest as a trifling concern\nCompared to repealing roe v Wade cutting people's health care and achieving a partisan majority on the Supreme Court\nThe rock worse and when the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee shielded the bulk of judge Kavanaugh's records from the public just guarding decades of bipartisan precedent and warning norms of transparency and fairness\nAnd finally the dam broke under the weight of credible allegations that judge Kavanaugh\nCommitted a sexual assault\nIn high school in twenty Eighteen the Republican majority conducted the hearing that made the Anita Hill hearings and Nineteen Ninety One look fair by comparison\nIn this hearing there were no corroborating witnesses on either side no independent investigation of the facts to inform the questioning they even hired an outside counsel to put a witness Dr Ford on trial [noise]\nOnly at the eleventh hour urging a break away members of their caucus Republicans submitted reluctantly to a one week investigation of the allegations\nAn investigation which was then severely circumstance cry by the White House our Republican friends blame us for this process there always finding a straw man but nothing could be further from the truth first they blame us for delay knowing full well\nThat majority leader McConnell has complete control\nOf wind nominees are brought to the floor leader McConnell could have moved this nominee two weeks ago or one week ago\nDemocrats had nothing no say and don't when it comes to who comes to the floor\nBut in each case leader McConnell couldn't move the nominee forward because he was blocked by fellow Republicans not Democrats from moving forward when it comes to complaining about the leg\nTwo words you never come\nFrom our Republican friends lips Merrick\nGarland Republicans are also saying we engaged in quote a smear campaign or the politics of personal destruction\nWith this nomination in reality again they're using Democrats as a strongman because what they're really talking about is what Dr Ford said\nDemocrats did not end do sort of come forward her conscience did and our Republican friends are are are Republican friends accusing doctor\nMemories of what happened to work\nOf a smear campaign are they choosing Dr Ford of a smear campaign of engaging in the politics of personal destruction because that is who they're actually blaming their decrying her testimony and then trying to blame Democrats\nI don't blame them they have a flawed nominee they don't want to focus on the nominee when future Americans look back at these proceedings let them draw no lessons from the Senate conduct here let them look back on this chapter\nHas the shameful culmination of the scorched earth politics practice by the hard right in America people who will stop at nothing to entrench in advantage on our nation's courts\nLet the confirmation process for judge Kavanaugh be recorded as a sorry epilogue\nOf Justice Scalia's seat the AIG know many us and a bipartisan cooperation and consultation on the confirmation of Supreme Court justices\nAnd for what for whom or Senate Republican leaders willing to discard all semblance of fairness to confirm judge Brett Kavanaugh certainly a product of an elite education\nYou ever cash and the Senate now the stakes are always hard for our Supreme Court nomination but college the extraordinary events of recent weeks\nThis time when we vote later this morning we will not only be deciding whether the elevator stunningly well qualified judge shore highest court\nNot any more not after all this the United States Senate will also be making a say within the states that partisan politics can override the presumption of innocence or will reaffirm that in the United states of America\nEvery one is innocent until proven guilty\nWill either state the facts and evidence can simply be brushed aside when politically inconvenient and signal that media bullying and mob intimidation\nAre valid tactics for shaping the Senate the mob can attack and the Senate cash\nOr will sign up and say that serious thoughtful\nFact based deliberation will still define this body\n\nWill either give notice it totally uncorroborated allegations are now officially officially enough to destroy on Americans live\n\nOr will declare that our society cannot must not will not set the bar so\nLow\nSo modern president today as a pivotal day and the nomination process of this\nExcellent judge but\nIt's a pivotal day for us here in the Senate as well the ideals of justice that have served our nation\nSo well for so long\nFor on full display\nSo let's get back in ... through the choice moments that the Senate and the American people have been traded to during the disgraceful absolutely disgraceful spectacle\nOf the last two weeks they're very nice\nJudge Kavanaugh was so now says the president's choice\nWhere are the junior senator from Oregon to declare that this nominee would pave the way to turn it\nCrowds of far left protestors\nStill filling out in the blanks on they're picking side there weren't quite sure who the nominee was going to be yeah\n\nWe've heard the junior senator from New Jersey to describe judge Kavanaugh's nomination as a great\nMoral struggle\nIn which they are just two camps you're either complicit and evil\nOr you're fighting against a\nWe've heard the junior senator from Hawaii argue that her personal disagreement with judge Kavanaugh judicial philosophy admit\nNow listen to this\nHe deserve less of a presumption of innocence way came to allegations of misconduct\n\nYou disagree with her\nYou're not entitled to the presumption of innocence when it comes to allegations of misconduct that's from a member of the Judiciary Committee that's the definition of due process\n\nApparently you get due process all if you agree with her\nAnd even more recently we saw the junior senator from Rhode Island hold forth with great confidence great confidence offering his expert interpretations of goofy jokes in high school yearbooks from\nNineteen eighties that was incredibly enlightening\nBeer drinking references oh no\nOur colleague was quite positive there must be some other hidden or sinister meetings at play until of course a number of judge Kavanaugh's classmate set in ... earlier this week\nSo stop and consider the snap shots the absurdity the absurdity the indebtedness it this\nIs our approach to confirming\nA Supreme Court justice\nThis is the Senate's contribution to public discourse\n\nBefore the end of dried on justice Kennedy's retirement our democratic colleagues made it perfectly clear what this process\nWould be about delay obstruct\nAnd resist\nAnd before the ANC a drought on judge Kavanaugh's nomination colleagues across the aisle including democratic members of the Judiciary Committee were racing to announce they'd made up their minds are more totally opposes confirmation\nMere hours after judge Kavanaugh was nominated my friend the Democratic leader promise quote I Will oppose him with everything I've got to be set hours after he was nominated it was clear that his number one political goal was to defeat the nomination\nBy any means\nNecessary it would drive from the beginning madam president a clear declaration plain as day nothing nothing good yet most Democrats or consider this nominated with an open mind\nIt would be delaying tactics obstruction and so\nCalled resistance until the final vote was called\nFor a few weeks there are France played out along the lines that sadly have become somewhat ordinary around here there were excuses for delay those fell flat\nThere were ... destruction to judge Kavanaugh's record that were better down by outside factor at first and there were all the usual phony apocalyptic pronouncements that are shouted whenever a Republican president Derek denominator Supreme Court justice\n... hospital but women\nHustled vulnerable people hospital workers same old trucks same old playbook but\nThey all players weren't working the distortions were being liberated drowned out by the facts\nSenators were saved and review more pages of background materials on judge Kavanaugh's nomination for every previous Supreme Court nomination combined\nWe read judge Kavanaugh's twelve year record of judicial rulings from our nation's second highest court three hundred plus opinion which we are sworn testimony written a couch from hundreds of character witnesses from all stages of judge Kavanaugh's life and career\nAnd the picture painted by these facts\nWas nothing like the character nothing like the character so it was fair amount of president they owe tax is weren't working\nOne going to get the job done\nThe resistance demanded more try something new they said well we all know what happened next\nCorroborated allegations of the most sensitive most serious or were quickly sharks\n\nOne such allegations shared by Dr Ford and comment on two of the Democratic side of the Judiciary Committee\nSomehow\nMysteriously found this way and to the press\nWell Germany Grassley admittedly sat out on a sober focus search for the truth the community collected testimony organized a new hearing and most recently I asked for the supplemental FBI background investigation\nJudge Kavanaugh's seventh seventh\nFBI investigation by any first either the facts the actual facts proved to be straightforward\nNo corroborating evidence none none\nWas producers support any of the allegations leveled against judge Kavanaugh no corroborating evidence from the FBI inquiring\nOr from anywhere else nothing\nWell that wasn't enough for our democratic colleagues of course the facts were not exactly the point after always sort of get it by now\nWhen the very FBI investigation for which they'd been clamoring turned up no new evidence\nThe Democrats move the goal posts yeah again\nI Believe the latest story is that the whole investigation is invalid now let's do this because individuals who had only recently been told secondhand or third hand about nearly forty or all allegations weren't treated as a central witnesses\nLet me say that again\nThe latest story is that the whole investigation is invalid because individuals who had only recently been told secondhand or third I Am\nThis bring that up and give a listen Murray and\nMs Murkowski Mr Murphy\nOkay silence on Murkowski because she's not there yet or\nUnclear if he's not there yet most will vote if their names are called in this more normal setting but are these votes can drag out again I go back to that keep voted to repeal Obamacare where there's lots of last minute drama if you know you're in the deciding vote you may let it play out before you cast your deciding\nVote absolutely and reduce the number of senators that there's ... very often this voting period is a time when you see senators looking quite college or there'll be standing in knots of people you'll see a hand on the back you'll see people you had to close conversation or you don't see any of that today which matches in some sense the sobriety of this moment doesn't it\nAbsolutely around even before all of the controversy over the last few weeks voting for a Supreme Court justice is one of the most formal you know historical things Senate do\nNPR's Ron Elving has seen many of these votes in the past and Iran I Want to ask about one of the many characters in this drama we just heard a moment ago from Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader\nHe has made himself central or to one historic debate after another for close to two decades now across the administrations of several presidents and if he manages to get this nomination through to a confirmation it would be another significant move from Mitch McConnell\nYes and to some degree you would make up for the narrow defeat he suffered a year ago when John McCain cast that magic thumbs down vote yeah on the repeal of Obamacare this would be the combination for Mitch McConnell of a a lifetime really\nOf campaigning for changed federal judiciary unless your social listen to a little bit more as they go through the rules are killing\nMr Toomey Mr Udall\nMr Van Hollen Mr Warner\nOkay Mark Warner of Virginia has a no vote their Scott Detrow\nWe're seeing that Lisa Murkowski voted no on cloture okay deal\nOK so Lisa Murkowski is no um and so does that mean it's all up to to Joe mansion\nOr at the moment it appears to be I should point out uh a clarification that we always make during Senate votes were hardly ever broadcasting them live the vote is ... is is fluids until it's final senators can change their mind so how do you see that's right or you can't have a firm stance about the final vote goes until they banged the gap\nAnd there could also be a senator whom we have assumed as a yes or of assumed as a no who just at the last moment does something different and we're\nOn a nice age here where a single vote one way or the other could make a difference well we should all Jeff Flake we're now told was a yes vote voting yes for cloture again that doesn't assure that flake would vote for the confirmation but he appears to have voted for\nClay telegraphed really even when he made the compromise of ...\nAnd ... of Delaware as you guys have Delaware went and checked to have a one week investigation he said I'm a conservative I Want to vote for Brett Kavanaugh but I also don't want to blow this process up over this let's have a one week delay and barring anything really new he said I'm going to vote for this guy\nJeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin\nIt has only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing among themselves and they have been a and it really is it are they in a secure facility that's normally used for intelligence matters for classified information and Joe Manchin has been in that room looking at a report today even as he considers how to vote\nNPR's Scott Horsley is that the White House which he has covered for years Scott what is the view from the White House as this Senate vote continues in the capital down the street\nJust even the White House spokeswoman told you earlier today they are confident that they have the votes to advance this a nomination\nA that would be a huge victory for Mitch McConnell who has been laser focused on putting conservatives on the bench it would be a huge victory for White House counsel Don McGahn who's been sort of the architect of\nPresident Trump's make over of the federal judiciary moving the bench and a conservative direction\nFor President Trump I think he also sees a political advantage here he's been talking\nA at his various campaign rallies in recent days about the energy that this confirmation process has generated\nOn the right or helping to close and enthusiasm gap that uh uh Republicans had been suffering a relative to Democrats at according to our polling this is now more or less closed Republicans are just as focused on the November elections as as Democrats already were\nAnd you know the president has been very critical of this this morning on Twitter of what he ah the people who have been have been protesting this nomination he he tweeted this morning the very rude elevators streamers are paid professionals only looking at only ... senators look bad\nNo evidence that that is correct description but I Want to mention Joe Manchin of West Virginia when we were just talking about has now voted by Scott Detrow again with an asterisk that it's not over till it's over it looks like a three of the four swing votes at least have gone in favor of Kevin that's right\nBrett Kavanaugh is very likely going to advance a advanced this keep procedural vote or there will be a final vote over the weekend but as of right now it looks like this was going to be a fifty one forty nine vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination\nOr you had Jeff Flake and Susan Collins voting to advance a cabinet along with Joe mansion and Lisa Murkowski voting now Joe mansion isn't a really tough spot here he's one of the many Democrats up in a deep red state the cycle he's been a head in the polls really out performing how Democrats are in West Virginia\nHe's under a lot of pressure to vote yes for Kavanaugh given the makeup of the state but also if he is the key to signing vote and it's a Democrat\nAnd he's the only Democrat voting for Brett Kavanaugh you're going to see a lot of liberal blowback I mentioned in the final month\nOf he's raising a difficult situation but he is a gas at this time on ending debate to test vote in a sense and just to remind people who may be joining us\nThis vote is not the final vote there's another one sometimes senators would go the other way on the final vote that would be expected to be\nA coming on Saturday you are listening to special coverage from NPR News and we'd like to bring another voice here as we await the final tally they're not quite the final tally at this moment on Brett Kavanaugh although it appears he's gotten up to fifty one votes which would be sufficient\nAlex comment has been following all of this debate and it's been involved in many of the political battles of recent years he's a former advisor to senator and presidential candidate Marco\nRubio is now a Republican strategist and he's on the line Mr Conan welcome back to the program\nIf they could be with it\nSo what are you thinking about as far as the political significance presuming that Kavanaugh is on his way through and we can't say he's there but it looks like he's on his way\n[noise] well it's like it's going to be a big win for Donald Trump an a big win for Mitch McConnell and\nYou know continue to give\nAnd some energy heading into them in terms of the midterms are barely a month away that's the big ... big deliverable for our base that frankly you know I think we're looking for something\nTo get him to the polls in November we we'd we'd been really lacking in the enthusiasm there'd been an do jazz and gap is a lot of the service have shown and as NPR's surveys show the earlier this week really narrowed in part because of of the whole fight over Brett Kavanaugh to have a when I think it's just really going to be encouraging to Republicans\nHaving been through a political campaigns Alex would you put a lot of credence in that apparent gain and enthusiasm right now we're uh months out from the election and Democrats except in this moment had been far more energized\nAbsolutely look ... mid term elections are all about turning out your voters ... and that was a challenge for us going into the midterms oh it's why the out of power party normally does very well in midterms because when you're when you're out of power when you're in the resistance your voters are going to be more amped up and the people\nThat are kind of fat and happy but now after this fight with Brett Kavanaugh and we've seen in the way that the Democrats for Republicans perspective have basically engaged in in character assassination Republicans feel like they're not just attacking Brett Kavanaugh they're attacking conservativism and Republicans as a whole\nAnd Republicans are United and fired up in a way that we just have not been\nThe Trump era and I think to win to exceed is just sort of the nail on the coughing in terms of locking down for ... years yet\nAlex Conan's I Want to ask about the timing of this vote or Republicans had been perceived as rushing to get the vote done before the election because they were afraid they might lose the Senate it might be far more difficult to get a replacement nominee through because there was probably almost certainly be after the election [noise]\nI'd like to know if you feel that the Republican strategy actually was something different that Republicans were determined to have this vote come to a conclusion before the election because of what you said they wanted a deliverable as your term did for Republican voters they had to have an accomplishment to run on\nWhile I think the process is the process and in a while I understand that Democrats would like to draw this out forever because they don't want to fill\nThe seat with the Trump appointee from a Republican perspective we wanted we wanted a ... a a another twenty on the bench last week so that they could be there for the start of the the new Supreme Court session\nSo I think part of it is driven by the Supreme Court counter part of it is driven by the fact that we don't want to have a nominee just hanging out there and definitely while their character assassination continues\nYou're listening to continuing live coverage of the U.S Senate cloture vote on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh coverage is set to continue for quite some time we're not sure exactly how much we appreciate you tuning in for those you expect of fresh air right now this is what we're listening to pronounce and into the next hour\nYou can find this on line WTO ... dot org ... this was Ninety point three W appeal in Nashville public radio\n\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where a dramatic vote has just taken place\nIn the U.S Senate in the nomination to the Supreme Court of President Trump's choice Brett Kavanaugh it was an extremely close vote and the west Virginia senator who was the presiding officer today Republicans ah ah choose a choose the presiding officer and was Shelley Moore capital of West Virginia let's give a listen\nOn this about the age of fifty one that knows are forty nine the motion is agreed to\nFifty one to forty nine as the gavel goes down almost as close as it could be if it had been a fifty fifty tie we presume that vice president Mike Pence would have come in\nAnd broken that tight fifty one to forty nine almost entirely along partisan lines the one\nDemocrat who voted for Kavanaugh is Joe Manchin of West Virginia the one Republican who voted against Kavanaugh is Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and we should emphasize before we begin our discussion here this is what's called a cloture vote this is not the final vote this was a vote to end the debate a kind of test\nBut not an absolute test because senators could choose to vote differently if they feel moved to do so when the final vote comes tomorrow\nNPR's Nina Totenberg has covered the United States Supreme court about as\nLong as well as anyone and she is in our studios here along with NPR's Ron Elving has covered politics for very long time as well good morning to you both in mourning mourning thanks for joining us throughout the morning here and uh Nina I Want to start with you let's just step back away from the drama the last couple\nOf weeks and talk about the historic consequences of this choice presuming that Kevin gets through as we got through the vote today how is the U.S Supreme Court to different court than it would have been a with a different nominee or than it was before he came\n[noise] well I was going to be a much more conservative court regardless whoever Donald Trump pick\nFrom his famous last it was going to be someone way more conservative than Anthony Kennedy the man that is being replaced\nAnd that will kill the court that was sort of like a balanced sport sometimes mainly going in the conservative direction but about a quarter of the time and some of those very big cases going the other way\nI did the liberal side now in almost every case that is a closely contested one where the voters five to four I think you can expect the conservatives to win and they made\nUh to increase executive power to decrease actually congressional power in some ways to and to um to take on legal questions that have only been sort of on the wish list of hardcore conservatives for fifty to a hundred years\nNow it's interesting you use the word agenda I think that if some conservatives ah we're listening to you they might object to the word agenda and argue that conservative judges or just applying the law as they see it but it is an agenda in the sense that it's a very different way of viewing and reading the law correct this would be don't even this\nTerm which is so far pretty doggy term frankly we're not very compelling big hot sexy cases even this term so far with a half the docket agreed to and the rest yet to come\nThere is three cases asking for reversal of very long standing precedence so you could see a lot of the law changed quite dramatically and some of it would not make headlines you would only\nSee it when you went to do something and found you could no longer do that whether you're on the right or the left you could be blocked or you could be suddenly find as people are now finding for example that the court in recent years has on the question if arbitration\nSaid to people you can't bring a class action challenging a clause in ... and when you were hired that says any dispute over salary or anything else has to go to arbitration you can't bring a class action suit in court challenge that ...\nShip that example because it reminds us that while Kavanaugh's nomination has been viewed through the lens of roe versus Wade abortion rights there is an almost infinite variety cases\nIn which presuming he is confirmed on the final vote tomorrow he would have an opportunity to rule and they would include abortion rights and a lot of things short of overturning roe versus Wade and they would include labor rights and\nAnd and many other things let's also remember that there was a relatively true statement made by Charles Schumer the Democrat from New York when he gave his speech shortly before the vote\nAnd he said Democrats have been accused of delaying the nomination Democrats have not he said and what he means is Republicans have had the majority Republicans reset the Supreme Court rules so that a\nSo that a minority cannot block a action and so if there's been any delay it's been been because of division and the Republican ranks there'd been a number of Republicans who have been uncertain votes one of them Lisa Murkowski who ultimately voted no on this test vote here this morning Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nAnother one being Susan Collins of Maine who issued in a sense a partial decision and let's listen to the words that she spoke to reporters a little bit earlier today we're not going to hear Susan Collins of Maine but what you said out to ... to a scrum of reporters a group of reporters out on the floor is that I'm voting yes\nVoting yes on cloture however uh I Am not going to announce until a little bit later on today what I'm going to do later what I'm going to do in that second vote which is the way it works ride run over\nAnd it is but it let's let's be Frank it it's pretty rare for people to vote for cloture and then turn around and vote and why ... why would she do that\nWell the the justification that people put forward as they say I Believe in fairness to both sides we should have some more floor debate and we should hear all the arguments as though we haven't\nAnd at the end of that we should be fair enough to this candidate to give him a final vote on the floor now our plan to vote no but I think he should have that final vote on the floor\nShe has not said that let's be snow she did not say that and and I think there'd be an awful lot of folks who'd be very surprised if tomorrow she votes no but she has that off\nWeb streaming has made possible by the Nashville repertory theater presenting the regional debut of adult South Park to October eleventh through November third this clever show imagines what happens Fifteen Years after the classic play adults house when Norah returns tickets at Nashville rap dot org\nWe should block this person from getting a final vote and win the majority clearly favors this person I don't favor the person but I also don't favor cutting off their chance to have a final vote with a filibuster\nOkay so we've talked about Republicans who have been doubtful Lisa Murkowski of Alaska who was a no vote at least on cloture\nSusan Collins of Maine who is a yes vote on cloture but it's held out at least for a number of hours today her decision on the final vote and then there is a Republican who is never expressed any doubt about that nomination and let's listen to a little bit of today's speech on the Senate floor from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\nEvery effort was made to ensure that the fact free\nVerdict of the mob and the media would wet out over the actual\nEvidence made sure the mob prevail\nBut the uncorroborated mud and the partisan noise and the physical intimidation of members here in the Senate will not have the final say\nAround here the center of the files or\nThe Senate is not quite had the final say but they got a step closer to date with this fifty one to forty nine vote\nThat we have been covering and then we will continue covering here and special coverage from NPR News let's bring another voice into the conversation now ... is executive director of the Georgetown Institute of politics and public service a veteran democratic strategist did I pronounce your name correctly ...\nYou got an excellent I'm very excited thank you very much so what are you thinking about as you learned this news of the fifty one forty nine votes to advance Kevin\n[noise] well you know it's all going to come down I think the person to watch or as you guys have been talking about that that should actually two people I'm kinda curious to watch the next twenty four hours a and they are the\nUh Susan Collins a while we'll see what she has to say at three o'clock mhm [noise] but uh you know she might be actually trying to\nUh go back to sort of regular order in the Senate and saying you know deserves about I'm going to vote no but he does write about that could be possible I think that's likely about possible and the other person is Joe mansion who\nI think Democrats are probably split and whether or not they're surprised a at his vote today a to a vote for cloture um but he also could come out against so we'll see I think right now [noise]\nAh if if I were a betting man I Would probably bad for narrow confirmation tomorrow but what those two senators do over the next twenty four hours is going to tell us everything we need to know\nI Want to note there are so many layers to this story there is the question of Senate votes there is the broad question of policies that could change laws that could be interpreted or reinterpreted as Nina Totenberg has been discussing and then there's the reality of politics we are deep into an election campaign where it is seen as possible that one\nFrom the center for inquiry route to present the conversation with

advance financial and their employees who are on pace to volunteer more than ten thousand dollars in the communities they call home across the state of Tennessee more information is available online at a asked two four seven dot com\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where we have been listening in the last little while to a historic vote on the floor of the United States Senate\nThe vote was fifty one forty nine the fifty one goes in favor of Brett Kavanaugh President Trump's nominee to serve on the Supreme Court he's not quite there yet this was a vote to end the debate\nAnd then the final vote comes tomorrow we would anticipate a final vote that may go exactly the same way fifty one to forty nine but senators are by no means obligated to vote the same way and sometimes they do\nVote differently on final passage than they would on ending debate as a matter of fact one Senator Susan Collins of Maine\nHas specifically said that she voted yes this morning to advance the nomination but that she would give a different statements sometime later today perhaps around three o'clock as to what her actual vote would be on the floor tomorrow so there is still some degree of doubt but it appears that Brett Kavanaugh is on his way\nA vote that Senator Mitch McConnell the majority leader on the Republican side said was one of the most consequential votes\nThat the Senate has ever had that's the way that he framed this vote Charles Schumer the Democrat of New York said that this was a vote\nFor a justice who has a record of hard right conservative jurisprudence who was a doubtful nominee even before there were allegations of sexual assault\nAnd then Schumer considered those to be credible allegations of sexual assault which caused the damn to break into Schumer's word\nIn terms of doubts about this nominee doubts that were reinforced by his harsh and partisan\nTestimony of some of those same charges Senator Mitch McConnell said they were largely nonsense and there was no corroborating evidence of the claims by Christine blog Ford who described a sexual assault said she was sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh as a friend looked on and perhaps participated while they were all\nIs so fifty one to forty nine years the vote and let's discuss some of the meanings of this NPR's Dominican ... can start us off here in this segment of the of the special coverage He's NPR's political editor is is anything a surprise to you are here to medical\nWell I think Lisa Murkowski coming out and voting no uh certainly shows you know the kind of independence she shown over the years this is somebody who won\nAn election state wide as a write in candidate beat the odds of doing that anywhere are nearly impossible now allow much Alaska well I mean Alaska is a little bit easier obviously because it's she's very well known names and yeah and not as many people as a you know some of the other states\nSo she was able to pull that off my point about that that she doesn't old Republican leadership anything\nSo when a lot of people were looking around thinking who would be the profile in courage she's somebody who a lot of people thought\nCould be that person more so than Susan Collins or Joe mansion\nOr because of the politics of\nEither their caucus a with a Collins or of their state with Joe Manchin when we say profile in courage were just defining that from the Democratic prospect somebody representing the state well it I mean that's one that I'm not a fix which suggests that not as a Democrat ... pro democratic same I mean that as\nSomebody who would do with their voting rights go against their base so when you think about\nUm what we what we have left though given that Murkowski voted no on cloture it's almost certain that she's going to be a no on the floor later when it comes to the actual final vote that leaves us with the pressure really built on Jeff Flake of Arizona Susan Collins of Maine\nAnd Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nThese three two of those three would have to vote with the Democrats in order to block mansion\nThanks for reminding us one could peel away and there wouldn't be an art I'd still be fifty votes it'd be a fifty fifty time Mike Pence the vice president would break the tie there were many people who had something to say around the United states Capitol over the last few days and they include not just senators on the floor\nBut protesters outside the capital occasionally inside the Capitol there were protesters who confronted Jeff Flake in an elevator famously a little more than a week ago there were protesters who confronted Orrin Hatch of Utah\nIn an elevator just yesterday I must listen to some more of the sounds of continuing protests around the United states capital as Kavanaugh's nomination went forward\n[noise]\n\nExplicit statement there about the election to come and Nina Totenberg as we listen to those protests I'm reminded of one of the excruciating\nConflicts here or you have women especially insisting on the rights of women insisting on the reality of the continuous abuse of women in countless cases and we've heard countless stories\nSo we have the broad issue and then the specific question of whether a specific individual can be held to a certain standard of proof of having been guilty of that of that kind of act\nRight and we're not in a trial although I'm sure that judge Kavanaugh feels that it's a trial for his good name but this isn't that a trial for somebody's liberty this is a confirmation hearing for somebody they promoted to the highest court\nAnd there was a moment today of the better is pill I think for the Democrats and what it says about our politics in a way and it was when um minority leader Schumer said when it comes to delay two words never pass\nMitch McConnell's lips Merrick Garland and of course\nRight after Justice Scalia died Merrick Garland right away said we are not going to hold even hearing any Mitch McConnell says ... editor said we're not even going to hold a hearing for anybody to President Obama nominates with just about a year left in his presidency\nAnd he McConnell lean on people whenever they got sort of a ... on that subject and his own caucus and made that happened and never bat an eye led and and and Obama had thought he was doing a\nI'm a a reasonable and generous thing to try to get somebody confirmed that is pick that you pick a lottery he picked a moderate liberal\nUh of ... and the person he picked the person that Republicans have been saying for years is the person he should pick Merrick Garland no longer really young in his mid sixties\nWho had a real reputation of of moderation on the court is the chief judge of the DC circuit everybody loved him democratic and Republican appointees and that nomination was the oh a\nWhole month and that that you feel the reverberations of that still even though there was only one reference to Merrick Garland today\nA Ron Elving NPR's Ron Elving is listening into this and as I listen to Nina I'm thinking of an analogy of sorts run a because we also a gun on NPR News frequently cover the middle east and\nEvery debate about the middle east tends to turn on history and it depends on what you want to pick as your starting point if you say that once I did something terrible day the answer will come back well guess what happened in Nineteen sixty seven guess what happened to Nineteen but one morning Ron\nAnswers that I've just I Wonder if they lose their head and which is that there were people in the Democratic party who said listen President Obama you shouldn't take a moderate you should pick somebody we can really go to war over\nAnd he didn't do that and the ... and and and so now the the question is is is the lesson here you have to go to war every time\nWhich is what Republicans certainly have done but what I'm getting at Ron Elving is it depends on where you start the history to get started and I do sixty Seventy started Nineteen forty eight it seems like Supreme Court nominations are going the same way now depends on what what a beginning point you want to want to set for when the story started to go wrong yes there are some\nSimilarities here and Republicans years Nineteen eighty seven that was when Robert Bork was appointed by Ronald Reagan to the Supreme Court and up as Nina has observed before Robert Bork probably had the votes going into the confirmation hearings to be confirmed\nAnd the Democrats did have a small majority in the Senate at the time that had just one of the year before they had one it's largely by winning back a lot of southern seats they lost in Nineteen eighty and the first Ronald Reagan landslide and that was significant because they were winning in the south\nWith black voters that were winning with African American vote\nAnd Teddy Kennedy made the case and other senators made the case that those southern Democrats really old those black voters a long hard look at whoever was next going on the Supreme Court all along comes Robert Bork who was willing to quite freely admit he had\nAnd Dr David Roche

that green hills dentist dot net [noise]\n\n\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where the United States Senate has voted fifty one to forty nine to advance\nThe nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court a final vote is expected to tomorrow there was a handful of votes that we were closely watching about four senators\nWhose votes run certain heading into the action this morning Lisa Murkowski of Alaska Republican voted no the only Republican devote no against Kavanaugh or at least have to vote now against uh on on on on the debate\nJeff Flake of Arizona voted yes Susan Collins of Maine voted yes Joe Manchin of West Virginia the only Democrat to vote yes\nUh put his vote down things could change in particular we know that there is at least a possibility that Susan Collins could change your vote\nWhen the final vote comes tomorrow because she said she was voting yes but she'd give a final answer on the final vote a little bit later on today NPR's to medical ... still with us and has been covering Susan Collins of what\nWhat evidence do we have to go on that still the way she's leading well\nLook like you lay out here everyone's watching this quartet you know the final four voters and there is a possibility that people vote differently for cloture at than the way they do on the Senate and the final vote now one piece of evidence for why that's a possibility for Susan Collins\nAnd she's already done it this Congress\nEducation secretary in fact she wasn't a cloture vote it was a committee vote so she voted differently and the committee to advance her out of the committee and help the help committee health education labor and uh\nUh the pot and bought pensions [laughter] there's your how good yeah um well done she voted she voted her out of committee but said that she still had concerns about\nHow ... how much you would be strong on public education\nAt the end of the day she and Murkowski in tandem wound up voting against a Collins and for or against 'em\nDo off and wound up forcing a Mike Pence to come and break the tie which was the first time I had been broken in a decade since March two thousand eight when Dick Cheney had to come down and break the tie on a package of tax\nJust a reminder that the vote today as a vote for continuing process the vote tomorrow is the vote on the substance and humid choose to vote differently on the substance than you do on the process let's bring another voice into this conversation as we continue our special coverage from NPR News Christine ... executive vice president for policy of the leadership\nConference and she was once an advisor to Democrat Patrick Leahy was one of the senior Democrats on the Senate Judiciary committee which of course considered Kavanaugh's nomination ...\nCome on and so what are you thinking about this vote\nWell I'm thinking it's interesting that and notable that there's\nBipartisan opposition to even proceeding or ending the debate on Brett Kavanaugh I think that is very revealing about how widespread the concerns are about his conduct and I know one of your earlier guest said that there was not a hint of misconduct but\nThat's just simply not true the American public saw serious allegations of misconduct brought forth when Dr Christine Blasey Ford testified in front of the committee and that was watched by so many American household\nFifth Riyadh since not correct to say there was no evidence because there's the evidence of someone sworn testimony and considerable detail but let me push back on something that you just said there you said there was bipartisan opposition to continuing debate\nThere was one Republican one Republicans out of fifty one who voted no ah this has been a very very partisan vote to move to equally part is among the Democratic side is not\nWell I don't think I think it is bipartisan by by the nature of having Lisa Murkowski vote no on cloture and voting against voting on against cloture voting to end debate is a very a serious thing for a Republican senator to do\nI usually people uh want to at least allow the vote to proceed or the nomination to proceed so for her to say no today as opposed to just saying no tomorrow when it was the confirmation vote it sends a really strong signal\nAbout how troubled she is by this by this nominees fitness to serve on our highest court\nSo I Do think it's remarkable I think that is very unusual and I do think later this afternoon we'll hear more from Susan Collins about how she will ultimately vote on the confirmation vote but I think this nomination is in trouble and so today's\nProcedural vote is just the preview for ah the the consequential vote which is a confirmation vote currently scheduled for tomorrow\nYou don't presume that this was settled I don't need a Totenberg\nSo you know there's been a lot of criticism of the way the Democrats and in particular a ranking member Feinstein handled the Christine Blasey Ford letter in early July [noise]\nUm and you you were a senior staff member for Senator Leahy when he was either the chairman or the ranking member I don't remember which ah Christine shifts both so hot at you and and Dianne Feinstein I said well I was just protecting her company\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A
