A. M. U. dot org let's talk a little bit about your record it hug be Sean Clark wrote on our website the one eight dot org what can one say that ... actually did while at HUD how did he distinguish himself\nNow thanks for the question we had the most groundbreaking progress when it came to fair housing during my tenure at hard you know for years decades um [noise]\nHad different democratic administrations have been trying to get done something called the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule essentially this was part of the Nineteen sixty eight fair housing act\nA vet said the secretary of HUD had the obligation to affirmatively further fair housing the problem was that that had never been put into a rule on so in twenty Fifteen we actually came out with this rule which put ... into the fair housing act by requiring cities that got\nA hug money basically with taxpayer money to get more serious about ensuring they had ... equal housing opportunity\nIn their community and I'm\nVery proud of it ah unfortunately that's one of the things that's been rolled back or through a secretary Carson and the Trump Administration a second thing that we do that I was ... it was just fantastic for the folks who are able to benefit from it was something called connect home um\nThe vast majority of people living in public housing don't have access to the Internet at home\nAnd we know that you're having Internet access at home today is not a luxury anymore it's a necessity folks that are trying to look for a job kids that are trying to do homework and so on and so we actually created a a\nA public private partnership with Internet service providers housing authorities nonprofits to expand to extend broadband access to families living in public housing\nDean tweeted as past secretary of HUD what do you feel is the best way forward for affordable housing and how is hug doing on this now\nWell I Wish I could say have more confidence in the direction of HUD right now um I think what you have over there is a whole bunch of\n'em a career employees that are dedicated to the mission that are trying to do the right thing but a political leadership that it's not that it could do the mission that wants to blame people for being poor secretary been cardio which I completely disagree with I think they've taken him in the wrong direction\nI'm the best thing that can be done is is number one to invest the resources to create more housing is affordable to the middle class and of course to low income individuals\nI'm from the ... the federal level state level and local level to do that and then also the ... work with the private sector in important ways for instance at the local level to figure out\nA zoning codes and planning codes to make affordable housing more develop a bull\nYou spent some time in Iowa you were in Des Moines last week supporting Democrats there who are running for office and we know\nThat President Trump's trade policies toward China are really hitting some farmers in Iowa pretty hard last month I was agriculture secretary Mike nags spoke to CNBC about what impact that that's having at home\nWhile it as we head into the twenty eighth taint harvest season for corn and soybean out here in Iowa this escalation of the trade conflict really couldn't come at a worse time so it is impacting our markets and that's impacting our farmers so ah are farmers to understand that there are issues that need to be resolved particularly what China\nAre but there is no doubt that the retaliatory tariffs are impacting our marketplace and that's impacting our producers negatively\nThat's my next secretary of agriculture in Iowa speaking to CNBC\nI Wonder if you've been hearing what you've been hearing rather from farmers and pork producers and others in agriculture as you're making trips through Iowa and and elsewhere are are some of them okay what's the current state of relations in U.S China they understand what President Trump is trying to do and the green do they tend to be more posed what are you hearing\nWell out here a lot of concern a lot of worry and ah folks are also wondering what's the plan here\nUh you know I think a lot of folks can believe that we can improve our trade relationship with China\nBut they think the president has gone about it are completely the wrong way in this go it alone style very radically starting a trade war that is going to hurt Iowa farmers they're also disappointed in their representatives are folks like Steve King right now that they felt feel have sat idly by\nA while the president has done this or David Young is another good example out there and so I heard a disappointment\nWith the leadership of of uh some of those Republican congressional representatives and also tremendous concern because President Trump is so erratic when it comes to China\nNow my neck has spoken positively about the newly renegotiated NAFTA agreements between Mexico and Canada what about the trade deals that the president has been making in his time thus far particularly if you become president and twenty twenty and have to enter office with these deals as a starting point\nWe should always begin I'm from the premise that we want to ensure that our trade deals are good for American workers\nUh we also want to ensure of course that American companies who are engaged in trade are are treated fairly and uh that\nWe don't get taken advantage of and so I don't I don't think folks disagree with that I think what folks disagree with is how erratic Donald Trump has been and so you know in San Antonio we actually hosted in Nineteen Ninety two or Ninety three the signing of NAFTA\nAnd we know that there are states that have benefited more than others from NAFTA\nOne of the challenges for this president and the next president is to strike trade deals that can benefit as much of the United states is possible we've seen some of the benefits of of trade deals in San Antonio we've had additional investment\nUh from auto manufacturing a to a number of on to other industries certainly along the border of Texas logistics warehousing\nI'm so Texas probably has been the biggest beneficiary of that\nWe always need to look at our trade deals from a perspective the American worker and how they can benefit\nWhat do you say the workers though who understand where President Trump is coming from who say\nTrade but I see what's happened in my town\nHow many factories have closed how many jobs have been lost\nI see immigration increasing in the U.S [noise] it just feels as an American light the rest of the world is siphoning off the best of trade and leaving people like me to kind of scoop up the drags and hopefully\nCobble life together what do you say that those folks in terms of the future of trade here\n[noise] ah what I say is that number one I'm\nYou know we need to make the investments so that folks can be successful in this twenty first century global economy\nUm we have to be smart because I Do think we can improve these trade deals these relationships at the same time ah we're far past the point where the United states is just going to close its doors and not be part of a global trade relationship\nUm so the question becomes how do we ensure that you and your family are well positioned to thrive in this twenty first century global economy\nGive me one example of one of those investments you would start working on day one\nNo I I Would start working on um a essentially understanding in especially in these hard hit Midwestern communities\nUnderstanding of the assets of each of those communities um your water the skills that we can invest in in folks who live in those communities what are the industries that may not be located there now that we can actively along with the private sector work on getting there\nAre and then how does that relate to to each of these trade deals and the thing is that uh what's missing from the Trump Administration is any kind of\nA thoughtful plan on these things in fact even with this latest a rebuke of NAFTA it seemed like they were rushing right through the finish line and just cobbled together whatever they could get at the end or it none of these things seem to have a plan behind\nAnd overturn retreat a gated mountaintop community Ninety minutes from Nashville to private

Trump was Donald Trump he uh he was the loud and and bombastic candidate in a one two races that are\nAre he probably shouldn't have one in the political sending that you know main is a pretty liberal state and\nI came in to shake up the old order and that's what voters elected in foreign uh now he is refusing to follow the will of the voters I'm In the Medicaid expansion will happen in Maine at some point ... pages turn out this year or the Democratic candidate is leading in in most of the surveys that are that they're up there\nUm but uh it it has not happened yet and as a consequence of all the pages actions\nThere are thousands of people in in Maine who not only voted for this thing but voted for this thing and now don't have\nThe health care that they that they need and and this was a ... it's a problem in Maine especially in a community is that have been hard hit by things like climate change the lobster community in the in the northwest part of the stay long the northern coast or is it has been pretty devastated and they work for very low wages in pretty dangerous jobs and\nA ... you would think that they would need that Medicaid expansion\nLet's shift gears and talk about the cost of prescription drugs an issue I think that everybody sooner or later have to grapple with dozens of states pass laws this year the aim to get rid of this kind of gag rule it prohibits your pharmacist from discussing prescription drug prices with you\nWe spoke to one democratic state lawmaker about this and about why he introduced new legislation on prescription drug pricing\nI Am representative Brian Patrick Kennedy I Am from the state of Rhode Island and I'm In my thirtieth year as a state representative\nSo earlier this year representative Kennedy had this sinus infection a mild infection his doctor prescribed an antibiotic Kennedy went to a pharmacist that he'd known for a long time and the pharmacist told him that he paid the retail price of the ... paid the retail price the drug and didn't pay with his insurance he would pay less\nWhen I went to my local pharmacist he told me I I Can't tell you that there might be another option for you that other option would have been not to use my co pay because the cost of the of the pills was so low it would have been cheaper for me to pay those out of pocket\nRepresentative Kennedy learned that the pharmacy had a contract with a company called a pharmacy benefit management company it handled its drug insurance plan that ... that prohibited the pharmacist from discussing this with customers\nKennedy and for their democratic state lawmakers decided to introduce legislation that would ban the so called gag clauses and the bill had not passed\nWe wanted to make sure that Rhode Island does have that opportunity to speak one on one with their with the pharmacist in and learn what their their pricing options are because\nOf that is consistently one of the big complaints we hear from our constituents on a on a regular basis as how expensive drug costs have become\nSo Scott Greenberg or we heard from representative Kennedy about what's going on in Rhode Island how common are laws like the one that he's pushing ... how many states have passed laws like this\nWill be these gag or clauses are are pretty common and uh last year there were a over a dozen states that [noise] excuse me took up legislation or having to do with these gag clauses um and actually just recently President Trump signed a bill outlawing these\nHanging fruit though of a of a drug the drug price issue a I don't think anyone like these gag clauses but uh\nYeah that that will be let federal legislation in the state bills won't change the fact that many many people struggled to pay for the prescriptions they need and um it's a very complicated issue and there are many states are taking other other steps to try to rein in prices\nSince she mentioned the president he signed two bills last week as you noted that were designed to lift these guy clauses on prescription drug prices here is part of what the president said\nIt's the no the lowest price active two thousand Eighteen and the patient right to know drug prices that and uh\nObviously based in the name you can tell that this gives people knowledge as to prices at different locations where to buy the drugs that will have an immediate impact to a school the law of supply and demand pretty simple but we didn't have that they didn't want to have that a lot of people didn't want to have that\nBut now we have it then it's going to really drive prices\nScott ... back up to the bills that various states have signed on this California signed a few bills into law in this a few weeks ago governor Jerry Brown signed them and these are considered among the strongest of these laws in the country what do they do\nWell I think the what a lot of states are doing in California or as is often the case with this kind of progressive legislation is in is in the lead on this on California is trying to reduce drug prices through transparency in other words they are are requiring um uh the drug companies to be public about a\nPrice increases increases beyond a certain point in the idea\nIs that uh if these are made public that they'll sort of be shamed into into reverse in some of these increases it's still too early to say though whether this is going to have the desired effect um nevertheless other states this year California passed its bill\nOr in two thousand Seventeen and last year you had five more states um Connecticut Maine New Hampshire Oregon and Vermont all passed a drug pricing laws that are similar\nTo California so we'll see whether transparency is enough to reduce prices and then in addition to that um some states have tried to go even even further than that Massachusetts passed a bill that would've allowed a its Medicaid program\nTo exclude some drugs from the a formula or the the um [noise]\nUh the group of drugs that are available to Medicaid recipients and the idea was that this would give them some leverage when negotiating with a drug companies over prices if they were able to exclude some FDA approved drugs and and as of right now Medicaid state Medicaid programs have to include all\nFDA approved drugs in their formula Larry the idea was that if they were able to exclude drugs that would give them leverage in negotiating on prices but the federal government shutdown that that effort by Massachusetts\nI Want to make our understand the argument from Massachusetts what they were trying to do anything to the federal government shut that down so Massachusetts does not do this now are now for an hour an hour now but the ... it sounds like you're saying the argument is you know find Massachusetts\nAnd you know Julius the drug company I could say hey Julie this medication that we know is FDA approved is still too expensive and we're not going to just pay blanket leave for a medication we think it's too expensive so you have to keep negotiating or we're not going to we're not going to honor that\nPart of the ... exactly that's right I mean interestingly enough in this uh uh the federal government do it rejected a mass at the Massachusetts effort\nAnd the bell Cort theater now playing Collette with cure a nightly opening friday free solo

next Monday's installment of our special series the state we're in we'll focus on state trends in labor unions and collective bargaining public employee unions had been in the spotlight this year with teachers' strikes this spring and the Supreme Court decision this summer that affects collective bargaining\nHow was the labor movement doing in your state perhaps there are laws where you live that

there are thousands of hotel workers on strike across the country\nHave you benefited from union membership or perhaps do you think that unions have too much power in your state tell us your story eight five five to three six one a one\nFiles through our app won a vox pop or series the state we're in continues next Monday on one day\nBack now to our conversation with read Wilson Julie Rovner and Scott Greenberg are still time to get in a few more of your questions and thoughts about state health care policy where you live one a at W. A. M. U. dot org Julie let's get to that question from Muncie law who tweeted isn't part of the reason Medicaid expansion didn't get as good support\nIs that it wasn't available as quote unquote GAP insurance for those whose employer plan has a high deductible well of course the people who have an\nEmployer plans with hijacked or our big problem and the lower income people of those have a particular\nLarge problem if you have many thousands of dollars in deductibles that you have to pay before your insurance kicks and\nThere are a couple of small demonstration programs where Medicaid has been able to ah basically filling with employer insurance but generally Medicaid as sort of an all or nothing proposition you're either on Medicaid or you're off the way they Affordable Care act was created with those people up two hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty we're supposed to get\n'em Medicaid people between a hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty and two hundred and fifty percent of poverty get special discounts they don't have those big deductibles so it it and then over two hundred and fifty percent of poverty then you're sort of on your own\nI'm In Arkansas I might point out though another we've been talking about a lot of different program that they instituted was to help people who often who were right at that margin and we're constantly shifting back and forth between Medicaid and private plant and basically what they would do is the state was allowed to basically buy them into the private plants and they wouldn't have to keep changing\nWhere two weeks sidebar for just a second let me to the point of the series is to talk about what states we're doing on big issues healthcare is a very big one it's one of the very first things that Donald Trump said he was going to act on when he became president repealing and replacing the Affordable CARE Act AK Obamacare\nThere are some people who feel like health care should be a national matter that every human being in the United states of America should have equally good planned ... what's simple set of healthcare costs and there are other Americans who believe it should be left up to the states that every state has different kinds of needs and different issues and the needs to be for ...\nAre we any closer to one side of this argument winning or is the state federal split just kind of baked into the nature of this country like where is this where is this going Julie\nActually it where it's going it's back to where it was before the Affordable CARE Act what we're finding from all these sort of small incremental changes that the Trump Administration has done is that the the Affordable Care act was intended\nTo create more of a national floor if you will for health insurance states\nStill do an enormous amount of regulation of health care they always have the federal government has always been sort of the the junior partner to the states um but it had gotten so stretched a patchwork that it made huge differences which state you lived in what kind of healthcare you were able to get to the Affordable CARE Act with trying to say\nThere's a floor beneath which people won't fall that is slowly being chipped away and we're going sort of every month looking more and more like we did in two thousand nine before the Affordable CARE Act passed\nScott do you get the sense that this means that the effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act is kind of succeeding but it is taking us back to where we were before as well\nAs Julie said it is in some states but in states that want to go in a different direction again California Massachusetts states like that\nThey're re instituting some of the uh parts of the Affordable CARE Act that the Trump Administration has and the Republican Congress have tried to undercut so for example ah on the individual mandate the requirement that you have insurance um\nSo called association health plans which are these cheaper plans that do not a ... offer all of the benefits that were mandated under the AC a some states are saying well whatever they are joined the federal level um insurance is regulated or at the state level and if you're going to sell ensure\nThese rules I'll tell you one issue read that states and many people have been hoping the federal government will act on and it states kind of moved on anyway and that's dealing with medical marijuana it's on the ballot in some states again this year about twenty two states have already legalized pot for medical use some of legalized for recreational use\nVoters in Utah will choose whether to join the states or not and the political battleground seems to have shifted and I want to read if you see it this way for more traditionally liberal states into more conservative areas overtime\nOr yeah and it's not just the medical that has gone that way but also legalization of recreational marijuana the two states where a legalization is going to be on the ballot this year is in Michigan in North Dakota\nA minute you know for ... for recreational low you know if her in in on the medical side there are three different amendments in Missouri which is nice and confusing for the voters out there to try to figure out\nWhich is which are and then that Utah is as you say on the ballot Oklahoma already approved it this year so yeah we're we're not talking about the liberal coastal elites that are legalizing marijuana ah we're talking about a red America that is now dealing with this debate or it came up and you know in Florida last year and\nLast year two years ago but this is this is now a debate that I think it shows the shift in the political conversation around marijuana those sorts of people who approve of a marijuana legalization tend to be a older white males funny enough\nAnd then the millennial generation that the younger the basically the younger you are the more in favor of\nA legalization you happen to be um the older white males the theory is that's the that's the sort of libertarian streak or they don't want the government regulating something that they don't think the government has a hand in regulating and the real swing voters or perhaps not surprisingly come down to suburban women\nAre in talking to the people who run campaigns for and against marijuana legalization or basically the battleground is mothers who are worried that their kids are going to be exposed to marijuana\nSo you hit the proponents are talking about the law enforcement to ability and and the the fact that it's not that this will not expand the market into younger people who will have to have access to recreational marijuana and then he's got the opponents who say exactly the opposite that legalization will in fact\nUh begin to rope and a bunch of kids why are there three items in Missouri\nSo they're all on the ballot from different ah proponents different sides of it with two of them are from a actual the citizen groups that that put them on the ... amendment to an amendment three and then there's a proposition which I if I'm wrong I think the proposition goes on the ballot from the state legislatures that's going to be some kind of\nCompromise a piece that proposition see 'em and they are all sort of competing with each other and this underscores another piece of\nThe evolution of of marijuana politics\nPots big business or in a lot of these states that have legalized Colorado Washington Oregon a California Nevada Alaska or Massachusetts and Maine\nAre the people who are setting up a ... who get to write these laws\nAlso essentially get to determine who's in the market um and who owns a very lucrative space one of the biggest opponents of recreational legalization in a bunch of early states where the people who ran medical marijuana shops because they already have the monopoly right why dilute the monopoly with other people\nI should know by the way we did a program this year about state laws on marijuana and the business of pie you can find that on line at the one a dot org\nCouple of things to add to what I read said on this very interesting issue um at one is that it's sort of intersects with what we talked about earlier the opioid crisis because there are many people\nAre supporters of medical marijuana who argue that this is a viable alternative to uh to opioids for people who have chronic pain and then also I think we've written about this um it's interesting that social justice\nMarijuana bills or this idea that a a minority communities are have been the most impacted by the war on drugs and therefore uh as we move towards legalization that makes sense to include in these bills provisions that are", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018",
