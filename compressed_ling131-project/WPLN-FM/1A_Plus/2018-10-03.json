P. L. and\nIt's a challenge to have sex with the man I Love without seeing terrible scenes in my head\nAnother listener emailed I couldn't listen to Dr Ford's testimony I was raped when I was Fifteen and never shared it\nThe thought of listening to the testimony was too difficult for me to handle I Am proud of the women who are speaking out but there are others all around us were silently coping by the way we should note as we did at the top of the program a lot of what we're going to be discussing today\nHas to do with pretty Frank descriptions of sexual assault and harassment so if you'd like to listen to this program later on when you're more emotionally prepared for it away from the kids out of time maybe when you're ready to discuss it as a family you'll find the whole conversation on line at the one a dot org that's the words are the number one letter a dot org [noise]\nWhat's that another voice to the discussion joining us from NPR in New York is Marvin Gaye a member of the New York times editorial board more walking to the program\nThanks for having me now on Saturday you wrote in the times an account of your salt in its emotional aftermath in part you wrote quote I never felt compelled to share my story before because it is so unremarkable so common because so many women have been through worse unquote\nAn unremarkable what made you think of what you've been through as unremarkable and what changed your mind\n[noise] you know for years and my friends and I have been\nAnd colleagues as well just sharing stories swapping stories and you know in bars and and trips abroad of of our sexual assaults of our sexual harassment\nAnd just knowing how many of my friends and have been through similar experiences somewhere on that spectrum I just you know as a journalist I never want to make it about me\nAnd so my instinct is to tell other people's stories and I'm hearing from some of my friends and colleagues\nDuring Dr Ford's testimony though I'm getting text messages about the kind of pain that they were in uh the pie TST it made me rethink my decision to to stay silent Ken my own experience\nCan you share with us to whatever extent you feel comfortable what happened to you\nSure so um it was over a decade ago I was in college and um you know I I was at a party with a boy at who I'd had a crush on I guess for a long time I think and we both had an interesting one another and\nWhen you drink a lot as you know Twenty years old at the time um and he drink more than I did ah one thing led to another and we uh ended up back in his place and and we were having sex and that sex was consensual although I Would say that um it was\nA rougher frankly than I Would have expected it kind of took me by surprise\nAnd um you know suddenly all of a sudden we were actually having anal sex which I had not consented to\n'em and it was very painful and I I'm asked him to stop and and he eventually did I mean it felt like a lot longer for me at the time but frankly and you know I think ... frankly it was probably too drunk to kind of know what was going on is what what I thought at the time\nAnd you know afterwards I dated him and I think now I Know that that's a very common experience but\nWas no nationwide conversation about these things so you really didn't realize how common that is and so I think I felt so much shame um in what had happened that I I just you know stayed silent about it until a couple of years later when I started talking to some friends\nAnd you know kind of realizing owning that experience for what it was um which which is really what helped me move on\nNo last week professor Conan A democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont asked professor forward what her strongest memory was of what she accuses judge Brett Kavanaugh having done to her as a teenager here is part of what professor Ford said\nIndelible and they hit the camp this is the laughter for is laughter between the two [noise] and they're having fun at my expense\nProfessor can you explain for us from a neurological perspective why is that certain aspects of assault stand out in people's memories perhaps by way of explaining what the hippocampus ... and what it does\n[noise] um the hippocampus has a part of the brain involved in memory and um [noise]\nDoctor for it in her testimony talks about I'm being afraid she's gonna die or that he's going to kill her\nAnd the human brain has Pacific parts that are involved to encode fear and if you just think about it I'm\nI'm that's because fear especially in prehistoric times kept us alive um you don't want to see a lion and have to think oh is that dangerous or not should I run away you when people who can encode that ... that fear about lying and immediately react well escape and survive so I'm\nSimilarly and fear memories I'm like the memory of an assault on\nThe brain becomes hyper focused on specific details so it's really common to remember perhaps the color of the person's eyes or sound or the Muzak or like Dr Ford says the laughter because that even just hearing her talk about it really makes my heart clutch you know it's really emotional\nUm but forget other details like uh the house you were in or the neighborhood or the street um those aren't those are irrelevant in the moment the assault is happening um so I Hope that sort of helps explain it but it is a brain operate\nThe kind of feels like when you're you know the way she describes the way you describe that it feels like that experience you have when you're like watching a scary movie you know you were walking through on that house you'll forget all the the core was that thing that leaked out at you the kind of forced your adrenalin to rise that wouldn't codes that I Would have great example yes\nNo more you said that a moment we'll see mia Lauren Lauren Taylor these moments that includes so intensely are there are ways to weaken the power of them in the mind or did you just kind of have to deal with those things kind of trigger those images that are super vivid how do you work through the sports than\nThere are many many ways to work through those I'm\nTalking about it and getting support whether that's a therapist or a community support group or an ... a an informal group of friends can be and getting validation talking to the right people can be incredibly helpful um what we do in our empowerment self defense classes\nAre is\nHelp people find their voice and find their physical power a talk therapy can accomplish a certain amount but um as professor Conan will tell you\nThe trauma also lives in the cells of your body and um you need to have some kind of so magic um release of that and so mad at basically means so much is body so um we we do role play\nOh for asking for what you want and we also do hitting and um that can be that can really move the trauma through an out your body or not only reclaiming your power but you're also releasing whatever you've been through\nLeads to a few more of your stories Jennifer emailed my story involves a sexual predator who happened to be my boss ultimately I was raped on a business trip to get away I had to move to another state and begin my career again the cascade of consequences for each woman like me goes on for decades\nContract or low cater and more information or at bona\nDot com\nBefore we get back to our conversation we would love your help with tomorrow's program about the minimum wage this warning Amazon announced that it will raise its minimum wage for all its workers to Fifteen dollars an hour

date on future topics will share some of your stories tomorrow on one day\n[noise] back now to our conversation with Lawrence Taylor of defend yourself New York times journalist Marvin Gaye and Harvard University these terrorists and Conan we got many messages in our inbox as I said here's one\nMore that came into us my name is live\nForty two years ago I was raped by my brother and it was only last year\nThat I was able to acknowledge that and begin dealing with the fallout from that\nI keep hearing people say well why on earth would she weighs thirty six years and it really happened it must be alive and I can tell you exactly why it doesn't matter that we were victims when we are raped\nWe feel wrong we feel shame and humiliation and embarrassment and we don't want to admit it to ourselves\nLet alone to anyone else if it was not a violent rape that left obvious mar it's easy to pretend it never happened and emotionally it feels like the right thing to do\nBecause you're so scared and so hurt and so is shaped\nLupe thanks very much for sharing your story with us more geared love to get your reaction to that story particularly the shame the humiliation the embarrassment that comes after\nThat incident like that after an attack like that wow and it's powerful um\nYou know [laughter] so I spent many years in therapy and not necessarily certainly not just because of of my assault\nOr it was one of the things of many that that I dealt with but I have been so struck by by the number of friends and colleagues and acquaintances who have reached out to me after I shared my story\nAnd you know sharing things they haven't told anyone before\nI was molested I was raped I you know it goes on and on and on and and I really am also a huge fan of Brian Brown due to social researcher yeah shame and vulnerability right and I I and I have become a huge believer that shame need secrecy to survive\nOn and off huge part of the reason that I decided to share my story is selfish it's because I\nYou know I don't believe anymore or that the shame that I'd been carrying around should have ever been my own shame\nAnd so in telling my story you know I I was I feel huge sense of relief I was able to to discharge that I'm into the public arena where I Believe that belongs 'em and no longer hold onto that I feel\nFreer I feel lighter and hearing from others who haven't been able to kind of go there yet they don't have to write a piece of how they can share it with a friend\nOr family member but hearing from them I I Believe that I I did the right thing at least for me because I'm the thing that I'm most emotional about now is not my own experience it's knowing how many of the people I Love and care about and know are in you know the kind of pain they're carrying around\nAnd that uh I guess for me that's where\nWho I Am as a journalist meets who I Am and my experience as a human because I just it makes me very angry um and it it really watching you know watching Brett Kavanaugh for me and for a lot of us was kind of\nThe embodiment of that injustice and\nThat's that's where I think you know the real power in and sharing our stories and power numbers comes from\nLawrence I just wanted to um that speak to what this what lives shared about her experience there are very\nHonorable powerful reasons not to tell I Am not in any way ever going to diminish someone who feels unable to tell or who makes the choice not to tell 'em that it can be internal reason\nReasons like I might get taken away from my family or I might lose my job um but they are all very real at at the same time I'm One of the other things that live did not bring up is that\nWe have more control over our own experiences and how we shape them and how we interpret them if they're solely ours and we don't have other people telling us how we should behave\nSarah emailed I went to a small liberal arts college where sexual assault was rampant one day I met up with a friend and he gave me some vodka and I don't remember much else my next memory was me face down pants down with my quote unquote friend\nOn top of me still inside me I never thought of him that way never consented and barely have the strength to get him off of me when I tried to tell people what happened I was called a whore lucky because my rapist was apparently attractive to others and I was called a complainer\nAnd people wonder why survivors don't come forward\nPat emails when I was Thirteen Years old a podiatrist began molesting me he was thirty one\nHe told my mom he had some worked I could do for him if he checked patients in nursing homes he took me some pornographic movie theaters he taught me what a glory hole was he had a friend of his implant and I you'd be in me just went on for almost two years [noise]\nLauren let me stick with you for just a moment I Would love to get your reaction to a clip from White House adviser Kellyanne Conway who spoke this weekend about her own experiences with being assaulted listen\nI feel very empathetic frankly for victims of sexual assault sexual harassment\nAnd right now [noise]\nI ... I don't expect and judge Kavanaugh or Jake Tapper or Jeff Flake or anybody to me how responsible for that science fair own kind that\nThat was Kellyanne Conway speaking to Jake Tapper on CNN learn what do you make it become\nWell first of all I'm Glad she came out as a survivor um you could feel the emotion in her voice ... it's a site or Kellyanne Conway we none of us have ever seen before um\n\nBut she seems to put the blame entirely on herself being responsible for your own conduct when we know that\nThe\nAggressor is the only person responsible for the harassment abuse or assault you can for where anything you want you can get is drunk as you want if there is not a rape is there you will not be raped I'm I'm Sorry that that she's\nCarrying that and it's a really common thing that a lot of people carry\nCarlos wrote on our Facebook page I Am a fifty year old male survivor of sexual assault\nBy a man who was my mother's boyfriend at the time to this day and it's difficult for me to trust any man aside from my brothers because of this I rarely hug any one and I'm ... extremely protective of my daughters professor Conan would you react to that I I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of how\nThis might be playing out differently from male survivors of trauma versus women who have been traumatized\nThank you for bringing this up because I'm\nOne of the things we haven't talked much about is that men are also victims of sexual abuse and assaults um and that the effects on them I'm of developing anxiety phobia Pete GST are similar to that that women experience after being assaulted\nAnd I think for men who are victims of sexual assault and if it's possible there's more stigma there is even more stigma in terms of being able to come out I'm and I'm the heard um\nOut I Wonder how men are feeling in terms of do they feel and they identify with Dr Ford or they feel like their experiences are being\nNeglected um I think if more men um\nWho were able to and feel comfortable speaking out that actually it'd be really helpful to move the conversation you mentioned earlier about a men's involvement and I think people have mentioned hearing from Matt melt perpetrators but\nWe also need to hear from mail allies and met males to have had similar experiences I think that um that would also help this movement um advance\nLet me stick with the professor Conan what about the the nature of the reaction that someone gives you when you first share that story of sexual assault I imagined that that has a big impact on the way that you internalize that process to deal with it\nThere after ... ... you're absolutely right it can have maybe the biggest impact um she'll ... survivors who share their stories and are there heard with support\nThis is Ninety point three WPN Len National Public radio Ninety One point five WTO ... in Ninety One point seven W.

U. dot org let me start\nWith the book this alliance between astrophysics and military give us a sense of what that is\nIn a nutshell and why it is as the title of your book suggests so unspoken\nYeah so so we already are familiar with the role that other scientists have played in warfare especially engineering you know somebody had to invent the catapult when that first showed up on the battlefield was a a symmetric weapon that would have been a symmetric in the military sense where\nYour opponent has something that you don't have and you were in deep trouble because of that difference\nAnd so that they call it an asymmetric advantage so engineers definitely and if you look at the notebook of of Leonardo da Vinci where yeah he did art but he also was a master minded sort of military machines that could lay waste to your army\nSo and we know him as one of the greatest combinations of its scientists engineer and an artist\nBut moving forward you think of the physicist as a person who builds the bomb right that was well known in the during the Cold War especially\nWe also know the cameras that you know wouldn't make chemicals like napalm and things like that going back to the first World War where they were you know flood the field with mustard gas or the biologist my weaponized anthrax for example the astrophysicist ... ... you may know such association\nBecause we just humbly suited mountaintops and wait for photons to arrive from across the galaxy\nAnd then we carefully takes a detector into the coffee lounges and debate what we saw\nSo that connection is not obvious and so when I say the unspoken alliance between astrophysics and the military it just never shows up but in fact astrophysicist and then the earlier days are strong numbers have been fundamental too\nWeb streaming has made possible by diversify trust and independent wealth management firm offering an integrated approach to the investment trust in state and philanthropic needs of individuals' multigenerational families institutions and retirement plans learn more at diversified trust dot com\nSky and on any level is to give you better advantage for navigating earth's surface\nBecause the sky will just different depending on where you are on earth and things rise of different times inside out in different places\nAnd so if you knew this you can know where you're headed where you're coming from where we're the trade winds are where the hospitals are where the Friendly's are and all of this can be established and there's no end of examples where this kind of information was exploited for the game of the nation who had control over it\nI should know we didn't have a conversation on this program for those who are more interested in this connection between science and the military\nAbout the origins of chemical weapons during World War one a good bit of that heritage traces right back here to American University which is the institution that owns WAMC which produces one egg you can find that conversation on line at the one eight doc board\nNew President Trump announced the creation of a space for the summer a six to branch of the military to focus on the militarization of space I guess it will be a fifth Brandt since the coast guard is technically part of the chess which is also the topic of your book\nGive us a sense of ... within there is a topic of the book give us a sense of what this space force would need to do have accomplish avoid to be in the best interest of the American people enough humanity\nSo first of all just to to the space forces not a new concept and ah it it surely been around even before I remembered mentioning it in two thousand and one in a commission I served on\nA authorized by the White House to study the future of the U. S. aerospace industry which at the time\nWas had fallen they've fallen on hard times I lost a half a million jobs there's consolidation in the industry there's competition from Europe with Airbus\nAnd other places that were rising up like in Brazil has embraced Air Canada was making a regional jets so there was a concern that well what happens if we lose this industry\nTo what impact would that have on our security on our transportation on our commerce\nYou order something from Amazon it's on your steps the next morning some airplane delivered it they're right or at least to the nearest airport [laughter]\n... doorstep delivery by a airborne craft is still to come but we were called them drones I guess [laughter] but so so you you ... when you\nLook at this problem you say All right uh what are you going to do about it and I said well\nMight we separate the concerns of the air with the concerns of space because these are the same companies\nAerospace companies that that became a word right and if you separated out in the military you would then sort of tidy the budgeting for what the needs are and you wouldn't have to compete within under one umbrella for very different needs\nUm at the time on this commission there was a four star air force general\nAnd the air force then and now controls space activities of the military it's called the U.S air force base command and they said we think we got this we don't really need a space where as separate from what's already happening so I was in to get a second guess the general but I was intrigued by that confidence that he had\nFast forward to today on the Trump announcement as well as the pants follow on announcement\nAbout it if you just listened to it it sounded very very sort of macho look how big my biceps is as I speak\nThat was very we don't want to just be there and we want to\nLot of this kind of language and that spooked many people typically sort of peace next out there who say oh my gosh what will just mean\nDo you think that that had thing though I mean if the U.S has supremacy had Gemini over space our aims you know as a western power might be a little more benevolent than saying the aims of China or Russia or North Korea\nYeah sure I'm just saying one could have said exactly the same thing using slightly different words and it would have been less spooky to people who fear the future of what could happen if you quote militarized space as I was really represent rhetoric not reality reality is\nA space for us what would that mean you would just take all the space activities that are already happening under the air force\nAnd slide them out under one umbrella once with a coherent umbrella\nAnd if you're going to do that uh I I Would throw in you know asteroid defense right why don't you you know put that in your portfolio while you're at it\nThat could be quite devastating to any place on earth where a bad asteroids strikes and then the limit it could render us all extinct\nAs one did sixty five million years ago with the dinosaurs and Seventy percent of all species of life on earth at the time and that asteroid was only six miles across an earth is huge relative to that it's a matter of the energetic and what it does to the climate and the atmosphere\nAnd the long term survive ability right of of of the by odor that requires the sunlight to feed it so so space force\nWould might include ... by the way I Would also throw in on your clean up the debris it's up there while you're yes the space debris problem but so so here's the distinction I Want to make which ... which I don't I haven't seen the press or the public recognize\nSpace is very hard and not particularly strategic to make space and at the repository of weaponry\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport

I just if you had goals if you can't otherwise I I bet we'll find cures for both of those before we learn how to transplant a brain but I think about that all the time\nCertainly helps them certainly hope so he wants to know do you believe in aliens\nThat's not a matter of belief is there's there's no evidence for life off the earth yet but we haven't looked very far or very much I'm Jill Tarter is one of my favorite quotes from hers is if you go to the ocean and you stick a class in and your scoop out some water and they analyze the water really carefully insect\nThere no whales in the ocean [laughter]\nNo you haven't looked so we've only taken a tiny scoop out of the galaxy in our search for life\nAre intelligent life uh for example um what we think of as intelligent life or any life at all in our backyard or on Mars and perhaps other places but anyone who studied the problem is\nIn no way doubts the strong likelihood that there's life elsewhere in the galaxy and the universe is possibly teeming with it\nAmy asked on our Facebook page will the human race cease to exist in the next thousand years based on the current environmental trends not considering a possible impact from an asteroid or other cosmic influence\nWe're pretty sure that nothing extinction level is headed our way that would take us out in the next thousand years and we know that because\nThe more dangerous and asteroid is the bigger it is typically and the bigger it is the easier it is to detect so so ah I I think we're good about that it's possible that a comet could come from out of nowhere ... comments very long period comments\nThey sort of show up you know you don't have history for them and one could come in and take us out or it would be really bad luck to you if that were the case but in I regardless you want to help the space program that can deflect these things and so I'm all for\nBuilding protecting have any insurance plan that you put a little bit of money in for a to protect you against a devastating saying that it would be very rare\nSo but uh otherwise we could easily go a thousand years if we become wise shepherds of our power\nAnd over nature and we have the warnings are scientists\nWonder how what what the over under is on that I tend to be fairly hopeful younger people seem to have a very different grasp of the value of the earth that this is the one home we have then many of their parents and and forebears and I kind of guilt today's generation\nProblems are climate faces what about you yeah I'm hopeful realistically hopeful so\nBut I'm I'm I'm ... I'm\nI'm cynically hopeful so here's how this works cynically hope yes so here so people don't act even when they're warned until it gets really bad and then they act\nSo all these this topic movies that show like look at Blade Runner right the woman ever get to that point this so this ... you know because we reach it or or or soil in green no because you reach a point where people say no\nThis is to this is this I cannot tolerate any further only eat people I don't want to eight people are so rare that a grid is too hot [laughter] right\nRight so you so you so we have restoring forces in the world\nThat prevent swing too low in in this regard and this this topic story telling 'em it involves a trend that never stops and goes to rock bottom and I've ... I've seen people bounce back societies bounce back ... people in power bounce back\nSo how long you're going to deny science until it really interferes with your health and your wealth and he said oh my gosh I think I like science again and then you put the funds back in and so that's why I think we'll be okay\nJared somebody that questions through our app won a vox pop\nYou think that human beings are physically incapable of understanding the fundamental nature of the universe if not what's the timeline to solving say something like dark matter\nTo question Jared\n... so I think about that all the time I lose sleep on whether I was slightly rephrase the question I lose sleep over whether the human mind is smart enough to actually understand the universe as it is\nAnd I worry that we may not be smart enough to even who what question to ask and this disturbs me because we know who defines humans as intelligent we do we do yeah who's to say that that is sufficient intelligence to figure out how the universe works\nSo so uh now dark matter dark energy the advantage to being modern human is that we can we can stand on the shoulders are those who came before us you don't have to

A. M. U. dot org we've been hearing from so many of you Elizabeth tweets why is the minimum wage a specific amount instead of a percentage tied to cost of living or some other figure measured\nAnd adjusted annually and we'll emails us from Cape Cod I have a small landscaping in gardening business with depending on the time of year six to ten employees all skilled gardeners I pay at least Eighteen dollars an hour and I support\nA higher minimum wage we're going to be talking about the minimum wage and a living wage let's have Paul San I set the table for a little bit Paul the federal minimum wage\nIs just seven twenty five less than half of what Amazon is paying and what you can make in California starting in twenty twenty two hasn't been raised by Congress since two thousand and nine and its last ten percent of its purchasing power or even since two thousand nine how many states huge to the seven twenty five\nFederal minimum ... there are about Twenty one states where the uh minimum wage is just seven twenty five um and then there's another group of about eight states where it's been on wages is a little higher but still low or nine dollars are lower um\nBut but uh the other ... you know there's the other Twenty one states have um a you know stopped waiting for Congress to act and have have raise the minimum wage including a whole cluster of them that are raising it significantly to the twelve to Fifteen dollar an hour range [noise]\nOne of the the key things on the minimum wage to understand is you know it's a it's been because of of the role of money in politics and you know the congressional Republican leaderships refusal to um to to to allow any action on it um\nIt's really become irrelevant at the federal level it's so low it's not doing its job to rate of raising pay\nAnd this is a real issue right now for you know to get receiving increasing attention um you know we're in a booming economy jobs are growing but there's almost no wage growth jobs are barely keeping up with rise the rising cost of living\nThe one place where we're seeing wage growth workers at the bottom are in those states that are raising the minimum wage and that\nThat actually speaks to the point the important point that Mr ... and the caller raised about hey you know if some companies are raising pay may do we need a minimum wage\nBut the the data shows that while there are some leaders to really raise the floor and ... improve improve improve pay and our economy we need we need fair standards and the minimum wage has to be a lot higher and\nThe um you know things have gotten so out of whack that today close to one in three Americans are earns less than Fifteen dollars an hour that's um you know forty million workers the median age is thirty is thirty five you know these are overweight\n... and it's you know it's it's not it's fast food but not just fast food jobs you know the jobs to make her economy run about you know one one for health care workers one in five educators you know huge swaths of our economy of our workforce you're stuck in these jobs paying less than Fifteen dollars an hour\nAnd ... I I think it says a lot when you see that the minimum wages is laid down by Congress is almost irrelevant to the real economy because seven dollars and twenty five cents\nJust doesn't go anywhere in most states in most localities are and yet to have Congress advocating laws that are essentially irrelevant to how people really live\nA is a remarkable in ... and notable state of affairs necessary Europe proponent of a living wage and I and I read that tweet from one of our listeners who said why have a minimum wage why not index it essentially tour real life now what is the difference between a minimum wage and and what's become known as a living wage\nRight well MIT has a living wage calculator where you can go on there and type in where you live and it'll be allowed in number that's based on looking at the\nCost of local transportation sued housing and other basic needs I looked up on the city I live in the district of Columbia they said the living wage there I was Seventeen dollars an hour but that's for fulltime work\nAnd I want to point out that a huge ... additional problem in addition to the low wages in this country is the increase in security if work how many people are working part time at Walmart it's half\nOf their employees are part time workers and then there's the temporary workers and the subcontracted workers you know Amazon Fifteen dollars an hour is not going to apply to their\nA contractor sets the increased ... precarious ness of work that that's also a big problem it despite are low unemployment we still have so many people working every day for poverty wages\nI'm Paul even though Fifteen dollars an hour is twice the current federal minimum as you mentioned we're it from a lot of listeners who say in this economic climate or even Fifteen doesn't go very far let's hear from some of them\nWhen all is higher than the minimum wage to try to lead to better for workers but never catch up with a dog or whatever and the minimum wage that's never know\nAnd as a college graduate with a bachelor's degree and student loans I already make Fifteen dollars an hour at a fulltime job and have to supplement with at least one part time job at all times\nI think there needs to be some consideration on regional differences because I can assure you that Fifteen dollars an hour in South Carolina goes much further than Fifteen dollars an hour in California\nI work another job beside my full time job and uh so I Am kind of like we think about I don't fortunately I have lots of credit card debt and the result and actually like Eighteen dollars an hour twenty four a fulltime job what probably closer to say Bye bye\nPaul we hear from a lot of listeners there who are living on a minimum wage and for many many more this has been a big issue in Congress or workers who work for big companies can't afford healthcare don't have insurance wind up relying on state or federal public assistance\nTo make up the difference and that suggests that all of us in some way are subsidizing low wages\nKnow you're you're exactly right and I mean you're ... and ... are your callers I mean\nActually if you look at cost of living data you see that in all fifty states or a single worker will need at least Fifteen dollars an hour to cover the basics in just a couple of years and in the high cost states the your your your listeners were flogging or workers with children will need even more than Fifteen dollars\nUh pinto PIN Tio on this with the with the numbers for all fifty states and uh\nIt really highlights how Fifteen is really a basic national floor and we need to even go up from there like a you know it you know in New York and New Jersey to this week we're airport workers are getting a raise to Nineteen dollars an hour\nIn hotel workers are are striking around the country in the higher costs that he's demanding twenty five dollars an hour or so you know your workers or your your listeners are right about about about what you know as a practical matter if you do the math what would it ... individuals need to to to get by especially in the higher cost regions\nAnd as a result you know a lot of employees of of companies big and small are relying on our taxpayer funded safety net for support you know more than a hundred and fifty billion dollars a year of safety net programs go to a workers a low paying jobs and you know these are good programs and we should have them but we need\nYou know major employers to do their part to pay a decent wage of at least Fifteen dollars an hour and then to supplement that with a who's worked supports in order to help bring bring workers up to a a basic level\nNow let's hear some of the other side of the Seth writes to us on Facebook when I worked for Walmart we were all excited when they raised our wages to ten dollars and fifty cents but then they cut ours to barely twenty hours a week then told us if we even had to have an open schedule we would get even less I'm skeptical of individual companies\nThat are raising wages and we received also a lot of calls from people who were concerned that raising the federal minimum wage to say Fifteen dollars an hour could wind up backfiring on workers\nI'm all for making you know Fifteen dollars an hour at the job I'm at now I work at ... or send them all but I find that a lot of people are a lot of employers\nIf they're raising a hourly wage or just cutting down hours which in the end it either arrows I'm from the tree is\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Boehner with a bonus certified craftsmen

very important wage fight going on on the local level not in Washington as a world knows it but D.C as locals know there was a ballot initiative where voters in DC voted to raise the minimum wage for tipped workers a bar backs bartenders waiters and waitresses people who work in restaurants primarily\nAnd there was a big fight a lot of pushback it looks like grass roots resistance and then we found out that a lot of the money for the pushback was indeed coming from organizing interests for restaurant owners of the American restaurant association local chapters and others um voters voted to say yes you have to raise your minimum wage restaurants bars\nAnd now the city council here in the district of Columbia has decided that voters were wrong and they are in the process of voting\nThis very day to overturn the will of local D.C voters on this issue or what does this fight here in D.C say about the state of wages especially for tipped workers people who might get paid by their employer I don't know five bucks an hour because they make up the rest in in ones and hopefully five ...\nThe way I see it this week the living wage movement took three or four steps forward with the Amazon announcement on Fifteen\nAnd they took one big step back with the DC Council voting to repeal um that the will of the voters to eliminate and in a gradual way this sub minimum wage for tipped workers um\nFederally than minimum wage protect workers is two dollars and Thirteen cents it's been stuck there for a couple of decades here in DC it's three dollars and eighty nine cents technically if you don't make enough tips to bring that\nA wage up to that that um the local minimum your employer is supposed to make up the difference\nThat pretty much never happens I used to work in the restaurant industry and I've talked to a lot of restaurant workers that pretty much never happens and so we have a workforce of restaurant servers primarily women many women of color\nOr at at jobs where people face ramping sexual harassment they're vulnerable because they're having to do whatever customers say to get those tips because without the tips\nIn the hour wage that doesn't amount to anything so\nPeople in the district um voted to get rid of this chair system um the industry launched an incredible campaign against it they put posters up everywhere in the city saying save our tips to try to make people think that this had something to do with banning tips\nIt did not it was clearly beat ... beyond a local issue this was a national showdown between the restaurant industry and people who are trying to get a fair wage for this vulnerable sector of the workforce\nMichael Saltsman what did you see at play here I think we're familiar with workers versus management in a fight like this uh the DC Council voting to overturn the will of the voters is is remarkable but what about the economics of it well actually so I I think\nIn this case you had a situation where the interests of workers and management were actually very clearly aligned I mean there was a sixteen hour hearing\nBefore the council voted on this this bill to repeal the initiative initiative Seventy seven I'm I was at the hearing I testified at two thirty in the morning it wait until three twenty in the morning um and the number of employees who showed up to say\nThis is going to be harmful to us you need to repeal this far outnumbered those were there to support it and I just want to take a step back to I mean it was mentioned earlier that a living wage in in DC is is is Seventeen dollars an hour I mean tipped employees in D.C\nAccording to the bureau of Labor Statistics are in with their tips about Eighteen to Nineteen dollars an hour or so you have people who are\nAlready doing quite well in what happened a few years ago as a business and labor in DC came together and said okay we're we want to go to a Fifteen dollar minimum wage and regardless of what you think on the merits of that we're also going to raise the tips may win among wage in that case up to about five dollars an hour and and they did that because they heard from tipped employees who said\nWe want to keep the tip credit we want our tips to count as income\nThere was one group that New York based group called rock they didn't like that and so they they came in and they had a lot of money that come in to try and put this issue\nOn the ballot and what happened was yes the restaurant industry um was opposed to this ballot measure but you had a massive grassroots outpouring from employees hundreds of who showed up for instance to an event with council chairman Phil Mendelson to say\nWe don't want this and I think it's part of a bigger movement of employees\nThat you say you say grass roots and I'm I'm sure that you're right but grass roots are astro turf we see so much grass roots in the area of wages and minimum wage is only to find out that the grassroots workers who are fighting against increases in wages are are backed by business center as well\nSo I actually I I think it's I think that that talking point I think that's been used by proponents is is is a little bit um demeaning to the workers who who came forward um because the the testimony they gave it you know one forty five in the morning or the people who got up or at Franklin hall and said you know what this is going to be harmful to me this is going to be harmful to my industry\nDon't try and save me I'm not asking for it I mean I think that the the the the notion I think that these people are just doing that um because they're sort of put up to it or somehow that they're not real employees\nUm I I think it's kind of insulting to what they're trying to do and still Mendelson that chairman Phil Mendelson the chair of the DC Council made an interesting point um when he got to talk about this which is that he said\nI have heard from countless employees who tell me this is not good for them I have heard from almost nobody who wants who wants to keep an eye and he said people can come to me privately they can email me this is not an issue of their owners being intimidated\nHe said that the grassroots on this in support of it was silent he called them the silent grassroots and I think that's that's indicative of where the passion was on this issue\nLet's pull back from the district the\nDistrict of Columbia the local D.C back out to the nation at large in so many of you won a listeners had been reaching out to us Nina posts on Facebook I'm In a precarious position if my wages go up I won't be eligible for Medicaid so it's a wash or worst for me we talked about free riders\nUp on public assistance and Randy in Tulsa emails advocates are correct Amazon Walmart McDonald's on the other giants can afford Fifteen dollars for a minimum wage but the local donut shop the mom and pop floors those businesses will be hurt it's just another blow against main street\nNo sir I Want to talk to you about income inequality and we're in minimum wage fits into this we hear so much about the growing wealth gap in massive income inequality in this country we talk about the shrinking of the middle class but at the low end of the pay scale can increases in minimum wage actually provide\nAny real equity or is it just a drop in the bucket in a world where the top one percent on fifty percent\nIt's meaningful but in some ways it as a drop in the bucket you know a couple of years ago two of my colleagues calculated that three men the three wealthiest men in America including Amazon CEO Jeff Bass though it's Warren Buffett and Bill Gates have combined wealth that his graders and the combined wealth of the bottom half of the country\nAnd today that's an understatement because Japanese as well as increased so much but nevertheless to dramatize is just how extreme the wealth gap is and I think there's a lot of interest in\n'em adding to the fight for Fifteen efforts to look not just that the low end of the wage scale but also the top end what can we do to prevent these really obscene levels of income and wealth concentration at the top that are so damaging to our economy our democracy\nNot to mention just a moral outrage and in a country that that is so wealthy\nAnd so I'm really excited about a new tool we have for doing this this year for the first time in history publicly held companies have to report the gap between their CEO and their worker pay\nThe numbers coming out are staggering at Walmart it's a thousand to one at at McDonalds it's three thousand to one\nAnd we can build on that information to incentivize companies to to narrow there gaps and just one quick example Portland, Oregon introduced the world's first tax penalty on companies that pay their CEO\nMore than one hundred times their median worker pay this year they're going to put the revenue from that into homeless services and it'll hit companies like Wells Fargo and\nAnd Wal Mart that do business in the city of Portland I think ideas like that are going to start to spread like wildfire now that we have this information about gaps within specific company\nThis is Ninety point

Rebecca Traister you started to paint a picture of the history of women who've gotten angry and made their mark their anger is not always shown in the same form as somebody yelling in the face of a senator like Jeff Flake on live TV but anger nonetheless and Brittany Cooper you've written a book\nAbout finding your power in rage uh tell me a little bit about that theme in how the story fits into the moment [noise]\nA shore so part of what happens is that women are told 'em as many of your listeners say that to be angry it's to be irrational\nAnd I had a student when I was a graduate instructor confront me um and said to me that she loved to listen to me lecture because my lectures were filled with what she called the most eloquent rage ever and it was a wakeup call for me as someone who had to run away from the angry black woman stereotype my whole life\nBecause I didn't want to be discredited as a black woman moving through predominantly white institutions\nAnd so my student who was a young black woman thought and be a kind\nOf authenticity and she helped me to realize that\nMy anger wasn't keeping me from doing my job are showing up offering\nQuality lectures are material or material but that it was actually helping me to do a better job and so in that moment I made a connection that I've been encouraging other women to make which is to acknowledge that we have the right to our rage and some reject ideas that say that when we're angry about legitimate injustices\nThat this in some way make irrational or makes our claims illegitimate and when we then begin to own that anger doesn't mean that we would come destructive or harmful it means that we happened to the energy and power and we start to use that energy and power to build the kind of world we want to see\n'em and more women need to give themselves permission to do that I've given myself permission to do that I'm at in this moment I Am on the front lines of saying women outrage have the potential if we own it and if we don't apologize for\nUs to change that very scary our trajectory of this historical moment we have a lot to be afraid about\nWe have a lot to be angry about opposite that anger is the catalyst for being able to do something about the things we see\nNow let's move from the Senate committee hearing room\nOr in the hallways around the Senate um and even the books that are esteemed authors have written onto the tennis court and the U.S open for another moment that American shared within the last couple of weeks Serena Williams in her match against Naomi Osaka at the U.S open\nHere's a cut I'll bring it back there to refresh my memory of anger on the court Serena Williams infamous exchange with umpire Carlos Ramos\n\nSuresh I'm Shawnee you shared this moment along with the rest of America us arena is a champion and one of the most famous black women in America somebody who got angry and somebody found who founded that anger a weaponized against her\n[noise] Ah yes I think that what we saw in their response was everything that Brittany in Tribeca and I have been talking about it was interesting because\nThere are so many egregious examples of men behaving in the same way but not facing the same policing or penalties mean she she was a defined that was let it against her is the highest ever for verbal abuse in the history of the u._s. open I Believe and\nTwo very distinct response as if the responses are the people that really just wanted to see her in isolation acting um it and this exchange with this man but then there were people who really looked at that exchange within the much broader context of\nThe power dynamics in the moment and the history in the context and the legacy of discrimination within the sport that she has faced\nAnd so I think that one thing that has been\nUnexplored in the bigger conversation about that is the central and pivotal role of title nine in understanding women as\nLeaders or as people who have the right to defend themselves or engage in public conflict\nUm what she was really doing was I'm asserting her right to defend herself and to have dignity in the moment not be accused the way that she was accused\nAnd with sports I think it's important to note that we now have not one but two generations of women so a generation of role models who have benefited from title nine in the lessons of title nine which we tend to think of it as\nA athletics but it is really about leadership and the ability to act together um in teams to manage conflict to make the nuance distinctions between being assertive and being aggression and be aggressive and being angry\nI think we're seeing a fluorescence of of of that now in our political live\nThere were some pushback though to Serena Williams behavior on the court and the reaction to it even from within the tennis world a Brittany Cooper\nI don't know if you saw Martina Navratilova as response to this arena Williams episode a couple of days later but she wrote an op ed after the U.S open and she said marching speaking now said yes women are treated differently yes there are double standards\nBut Serino was wrong her encore behavior was inappropriate and I'm paraphrasing just because men region umpires and act like babies on the court doesn't make it right and a champion Serena should not emulated\nRight I'm Martina Navratilova was wrong or she did this thing that women are conditioned to do which is rather than use it as a moment of solidarity she tried police arenas conduct I'm\nAs a lifelong tennis fan I'm I Am limited but Martina Navratilova reminded me that until this moment most white women in tennis have not been allies of the Williams sisters\nUm do when I watch tennis with my friends who are African American tennis fan we often talk about watching these matches on you because of the micro aggressions that come from white women who are often knocking at the Williams sisters and having things to say but let me also add\nThat one of the things that was most infuriating about watching the way in which Ramos treated Serena\nWas that there was a broader context to her anger not only did he accuse her of cheating but this also came out on the heels of report that members of the USDA had been showing up to her house\nUnannounced and testing her over and over again on grounds that maybe she was doping even though she has come clean on every drug tested even those statistics show that they were testing her double the amount that they were testing any other players on the women's side and so she had been subjected to repeated and dignity\nAnd then as the best tennis player of her generation and perhaps ever see them has a referee pulled accuses her cheating and she's one more grassland that any woman other than Margaret Court and any woman in the open air and that is indicative of the kinds\nAnd central point energy services with more than a century of experience in business energy

Rutgers University and author of the new book eloquent rage and also ... director of the women's media center speech project and author of the new book\nRage becomes her now I read an email from Karen at the end of the last segment the said she was hurt disappointed and angry wounded about the treatment of Hillary Clinton in the twenties sixteen campaign and I want to go there because Hillary Clinton is one prominent famous\nWoman well known for\nNavigating the shoulders of how women are supposed to express themselves in public now Hillary Clinton has a history of being very careful and very deliberate\nWeb streaming is made possible by the Blair school of music and empty nest fall twenty Eighteen performance lineup between silhouettes student ensemble faculty guest musicians

fact was was tone police listen\nI regret deeply\nHow angry [noise] the tone of the campaign became [noise]\n\nNot your fault it's one audience member when when Hillary Clinton very deliberately in that you know Hillary fashion\nAs I regret how nasty the campaign became um Suresh Raleigh just this moment has clearly struck a chord Rebecca Traister who's watching here in the studio with me but how does it strike you [laughter] know she was off ... she was very very careful in her choice of words there to even as she was commenting on it I mean\nI think it was um\nIt was ridiculous that this woman was called an authentic while being held to the standard\nOf care full control in her voice and her facial the parents and her body\nAnd her motive expression I mean the two candidates um that were her primary opponents for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders could act in unhinged ways they could show up looking unkempt they could pound ...\nYou know they could turn red in the face and as men they could leverage this enormous tide of populist anger and that was a gender card nobody wrote about that as a gender card right there were all of these conversations about\nI'm Hillary Clinton as there often are with women because we associate gender with women and pretend men don't have a gender\nUm and and so they could do that and she couldn't leverage that political power and we saw that over and over and over again throughout the campaign\nRecord ... is so right about this and I'm In fact the thing that the irony of what we were told about Hillary Clinton both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump or congratulated by the political pressed for their particular skill in channeling the anger of their supporters this was their gift\nThey were able to give voice to this frustration and we were repeatedly told that some of the authenticity of Hillary was that she couldn't convey anger and passion and yet\nEvery time she spoke too close to a microphone somebody said you're yelling your shrill um she really got directives at one point Joe Scarborough she was giving an ... a speech the night she won a primary and Joe Scarborough sad smile is if it was like some catch cholera on the street smile more\nUm she was told that regularly\nAnd I think that that's again an example of of not having that tool to wield she also has done remarkable writing and talking herself\nIn instances where I've interviewed her and she's written about it in her own\nMemoir of the campaign about the process of not using that anger she writes particularly about that second debate where Donald Trump came up behind her and kind of loomed behind her and how menacing and aggressive his body language was and how during\nThe debate a presidential debate\nShe was doing internal calculations thinking can I turn around and confront this guy she said she thought about turning around and saying get away from me but then she was thinking\nNo no no that's gonna redound negatively to me that's gonna make me look bad it's gonna hurt me strategically and the debate and so she didn't and one of the things that that little story tells us is about how much energy\nWomen expand modulating considering strategizing thinking tactically about how to use their voice how depressed\nTheir anger what to do in order to be rhetorically effective and and I think that that's something that that all three of us are writing about and thinking about is the amount of time and energy women spend doing this kind of maneuvering around the rules around are angry expressions\nNow I Want to I Want to talk a little bit in the last\n... section of the show that we have about where some of this anger\nGoes because this is a moment in America and let's be realistic\nMoments have a way of fading they just do and and so I'm interested in where this goes when\nMaybe the cameras and all of the writers who aren't Rebecca Traister and Britney Cooper are not as interested anymore you know in in a couple of years I think that might happen and I want to know where this goes now we've been hearing from so many wanting listeners I Want to play you another mash up of some of the women's voices who've been reaching out to us about how they're feeling\nMy name's Aaron I'm calling from Lancaster, Pennsylvania Sarah from Cincinnati when I let my anger bubble over and I get really angry out loud it\nIt really doesn't do much good I find that if I express a strong opinion or even just a bit of discomfort with something I'm perceived as being angrier overreacting women yelling even in this day and age is not very acceptable\nMen don't seem to have that same problem and I'm\nStarting to feel like maybe it's not just a personal issue I'm dealing with what's going to be nice and and uh and keep our mouth shut however I Am so angry and so angry right now maybe women all over the place you're dealing with it I'm\nTurning my anger into action yes it helps to feel like I'm not alone but still pretty discouraging I think that's what when they have to do we have to take that anger hold onto it\nAnd that's how we're going to take back this country\nWe're hearing from listeners women who it feels like there is a senior transferring\nSome of their personal rage I'm sure a lot of it's in in personal life not just political life or cultural life but into action taking action industries taking action maybe at the ballot box we got this tweet from Tracy in Jacksonville I'm One of the thousands of women using their frustration to run for office\nI'm running for the Florida House district Fifteen I Am focused on my determination to be a voice for all and focus on issues important to Jacksonville families Tracy is one candidate who says that this moment of anger is very important for her motivation of Brittany Cooper I Want to talk about where\nThis goes in terms of maybe the midterms that might be the most immediate effect I'm I\nNone of us knows exactly how that vote is going to turn out but it seems like any\nPollster or political analyst worth anything is looking down and what they call the cross tabs and noticing a that women are mad women are going to
