A. M. U. dot org let's talk a little bit about your record it hug be Sean Clark wrote on our website the one eight dot org what can one said the holy on Castro actually did while at HUD how did he distinguish himself\n[noise] nope thanks for the question we had the most groundbreaking progress when it came to for housing during my tenure at heart you know for years decades um [noise]\nDifferent democratic administrations have been trying to get done something called the affirmatively furthering gr housing rule essentially this was part of the Nineteen sixty acre Housing Act all that said the secretary ... had the obligation to affirmatively further fair housing\nInto a rule on so in twenty Fifteen we actually came out with this rule which put teeth into the fair housing act by requiring cities that got\nA hug money basically taxpayer money to get more serious about ensuring that has equal housing opportunity in their community and I'm\nVery proud of it ah unfortunately that's one of the things that's been rolled back uh through a secretary Carson and the Trump Administration a second thing that we do that I was just fantastic for the folks who are able to benefit from it was something called connect home um\nThe vast majority of people living in public housing don't have access to the Internet at home\nAnd we know that you're having Internet access at home today is not a luxury anymore it's a necessity folks that are trying to look for a job kids that are trying to do homework and so on and so we actually created a a\nA public private partnership with Internet service providers housing authorities nonprofits to expand to extend broadband access to families living in public housing\nDean tweeted as past secretary of HUD what do you feel is the best way forward for affordable housing and how is how you doing on this now\nWell I Wish I could say I have more confidence in the direction of HUD right now um I think what you have over there is a whole bunch of\n'em a career employees that are dedicated to the mission that are trying to do the right thing but a political leadership that is not dedicated to the mission that wants to blame people for being poor secretary bank are yeah which I completely disagree with I think they've taken them in the wrong direction\nI'm the best thing that can be done is is number one to invest the resources\nTo create more housing that is affordable to the middle class and of course to low income individuals ah and\nUp and down the line from the the federal level state level and local level to do that and then also the ... work with the private sector in important ways for instance at the local level to figure out a zoning codes and planning codes to make affordable housing more develop a bull\nYou spent some time in Iowa you were in Des Moines last week supporting Democrats there who are running for office and we know\nThat President Trump's trade policies toward China are really hitting some farmers in Iowa pretty hard last month I was agriculture secretary Mike nags spoke to CNBC about what impact that that's having at home\nWhile it as we head into the twenty eighth taint harvest season for corn and soybean out here in Iowa this escalation of the trade conflict really couldn't come at a worse time so it is impacting our markets and that's impacting our\nFarmers so ah are farmers to understand that there are issues that need to be resolved particularly what China are but there is no doubt that the retaliatory tariffs are impacting our marketplace and that's impacting our producers negatively\nThat's my next secretary of agriculture in Iowa speaking to CNBC\nI Wonder if you've been hearing what you've been hearing rather from farmers and pork producers and others in agriculture as you're making trips to Iowa and and elsewhere are some of them okay with the current state of relations the U.S China they understand what President Trump is trying to do and agree\nDo they tend to be more posed what are you hearing\nHere a lot of concern a lot of worry and ah folks are also wondering what's the plan here\nOr you know I think a lot of folks are can believe that we can improve our trade relationship with China\nBut they think the president has gone about it are completely the wrong way in this go it alone style very radically starting a trade war that is going to hurt Iowa farmers they're also disappointed in their representatives are folks like Steve King right now that they felt feel have sat idly\nDavid Young is another good example out there and so I heard a disappointment with the leadership of of uh some of those Republican congressional\nRepresentatives and also tremendous concern because President Trump is so erratic when it comes to China now my neck has spoken positively about the newly renegotiated NAFTA agreements between Mexico\nAnd Canada what about the trade deals that the president has been making in his time thus far particularly if to become president and twenty twenty and have to enter office with these deals as a starting point\nWe should always begin I'm from the premise that we want to ensure that our trade deals are good for American workers\nAh we also want to ensure of course that American companies who are engaged in trade are are treated fairly and uh that\nWe don't get taken advantage of and so I don't I don't think folks disagree with that I think what folks disagree with is how erratic Donald Trump has been and so you know in San Antonio we actually hosted in Nineteen Ninety two or Ninety three the signing of NAFTA\nAnd we know that there are states that have benefited more than others from NAFTA\nOne of the challenges for this president and the next president is to strike trade deals that can benefit as much of the United states as possible [noise] we've seen uh some of the benefits of of trade deals in San Antonio we've had additional investment\nUh from auto manufacturing a to a number of on to other industries certainly along the border of Texas logistics and warehousing\nI'm so Texas probably has been the biggest beneficiary of that\nWe always need to look at our trade deals from my perspective the American worker and how they can benefit\nSo what do you say to workers though who understand where President Trump is coming from who say\nYou know I appreciate the value of trade but I see what's happened in my town how many factories have closed how many jobs have been lost\nI see immigration increasing in the U.S [noise] it just feels as an American like the rest of the world is siphoning off the best of trade and leaving people like\nMe to kind of scoop up the drags and hopefully cobble life together what do you say to those folks in terms of the future of trade here\nOf what I say is that number one I'm\nYou know we need to make the investments so that folks can be successful in this twenty first century global economy\nUm we have to be smart because I Do think we can improve these trade deals these relationships at the same time ah we're far past the point where the United states is just going to close its doors and not be part of a global trade relationship\nUm so the question becomes how do we ensure that you and your family are well positioned to thrive in this twenty first century global economy\nGive me one example of one of those investments you would start working on day one\nNo I I Would start working on um a essentially understanding in especially in these hard hit Midwestern communities understanding the assets of each of those communities um your water the skills that we can invest in in folks who live in those communities what are the industries that may\nNot be located there now that we can actively along with the private sector work on getting their ah and then how does that relate to to each of these trade deals and the thing is that uh what's missing from the Trump Administration is any kind of\nA thoughtful plan on these things in fact even with this latest a rebuke of NAFTA it seemed like they were rushing right through the finish line and just cobbled together whatever they could get at the end of it\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the alliance for lifetime income a nonprofit composed a financial services organizations working to educate Americans about options for

Maine voted for expanding Medicaid but the governor of Maine Paul Page still refuses to do so\nHe talked about his opposition to expanding Medicaid during the morning talk show on W. veal AM radio back in July is part of what means governor said\nOr one thing I Know is nobody can force me to put state in red ink and I will not do that to tell them to go to jail before I put the stage and read it and if that's the court tells me I have to do it then we're going to be going to jail\nThat's part of Maine Governor ... speaking back in July and I read ... telling voters I'd rather go to jail can kind of feel like he's telling voters to go to somewhere else but how much of his political feet are on the house is going to end\nWell a ... page is a he was sort of Donald Trump before Donald Trump was Donald Trump he uh he was the loud and and bombastic candidate in a one two races that uh uh he probably shouldn't have won in the political sending that you know main is a pretty liberal state and\nI came into shake up the old order and that that's what voters elected in foreign uh now he is refusing to follow the will of the voters I'm In the Medicaid expansion will happen in Maine at some point all the pages turn out this year or the Democratic candidate is leading in most of the surveys that ah that that up there\nUm but it it has not happened yet and as a consequence of all the pages actions\nThere are thousands of people in in Maine who not only voted for this thing but voted for this thing and now don't have\nThe health care that they that they need and and this was a ... it's a problem in Maine especially in a community is that have been hard hit by things like climate change the lobster community in the in the northwest part of the stay on the northern coast or is it has been pretty devastated and they work for a very low wages and pretty dangerous jobs and\nUh you would think that they would need that Medicaid expansion\nLet's shift gears and talk about the cost of prescription drugs an issue I think that everybody sooner or later has to grapple with dozens of states pass laws this year the aim to get rid of this kind of gag rule it prohibits your pharmacist from discussing prescription drug prices with you\nWe spoke to one democratic state lawmaker about this and about why he introduced new legislation on prescription drug pricing\nI Am representative Ryan Patrick Kennedy I Am from the state of Rhode Island\nYear as a state representative\nSo earlier this year representative Kennedy had this sinus infection a mild infection his doctor prescribed an antibiotic Kennedy went to a pharmacist that he'd known for a long time and the pharmacist told him that he paid the retail price of the if you pay the retail price the drug and didn't pay with his insurance he would pay less\nWhen I went to my local pharmacist he told me I I Can't tell you that they might be another option for you that other option would have been not to use my co pay because the cost of the of the pills was so low it would've been cheaper for me to pay those out of pocket\nRepresentative Kennedy learned that the pharmacy had a contract with a company called a pharmacy benefit management company it handled its drug insurance plan that ... that prohibited the pharmacist from discussing this with customers\nKennedy and for the Democratic state lawmakers decided to introduce legislation that would ban the so called gag clauses in the bill had not passed\nWe wanted to make sure that Rhode Island does have that opportunity to speak one on one with their with their pharmacist and and learn what their their pricing options are because\nOf that is consistently one of the big complaints we hear from our constituents on a on a regular basis says how expensive drug costs have become\nSo Scott Greenberg or we heard from representative Kennedy about what's going on in Rhode Island how common are laws like the one that he's pushing ... how many states have passed laws like this will\nBe these gag or clauses are are pretty common and uh last year there were a over a dozen states that [noise] excuse me took up legislation or\nHaving to do with these gag clauses um and actually just recently President Trump signed a bill outlawing these um gag clauses this was kind of low hanging fruit though of a\nOf a drug the drug prices issue a I don't think anyone like these gag clauses but uh\nYeah that that will the let federal legislation on these state bills won't change the fact that many many people struggling to pay for the prescriptions they need and um it's a very complicated issue and there are many states are taking other other steps to try to rein in prices\nSince you mentioned the president's he signed two bills last week as you noted that were designed to lift these gang clauses on prescription drug prices here is part of what the president said\nIt's the you know the lowest price act of two thousand Eighteen and the patient right to know drug prices act and\nObviously based in the navy you can tell that this gives people knowledge as to prices at different locations where to buy the drugs that will have an immediate impact to [noise] ah\nIt's called the law of supply and demand pretty simple but we didn't have that they didn't want to have that a lot of people didn't want to have that but now we have it then it's going to really drive prices\nScott ... back up to the the bills that various states have signed on this California signed a few bills into law in this a few weeks ago governor Jerry Brown signed them and these are considered among the strongest of these laws and the country ... what do they do\nWell I think the what a lot of states are doing in California or as is often the case with this kind of progressive legislation is and that is in the lead on this on California is trying to reduce drug prices through transparency in other words they are are requiring um uh the drug companies to be public about a\nPrice increases increases beyond a certain point and the idea\nIs that uh if these are made public that they'll sort of be shamed into into reversing some of these increases it's still too early to say though whether this is going to have the desired effect um nevertheless other states this year California passed a bill or in two thousand Seventeen and last year you had five more states um\nAll passed a drug pricing laws that are similar to California so we'll see whether transparency is enough to reduce prices and then in addition to that um some states have tried to go even even further than that Massachusetts passed a bill that would've allowed a its Medicaid program\nTo exclude some drugs from the a formula or the the um [noise]\nUh the group of drugs that are available to Medicaid recipients and the idea was that this would give them some leverage when negotiating with a drug companies over prices if they were able to exclude some FDA approved drugs and and as of right now Medicaid state Medicaid program south include all FDA approved drugs and their formula Larry\nThe idea was that if they were able to exclude drugs that would give them leverage in negotiating on prices but uh the federal government shutdown that that effort by Massachusetts\nI Want to make or understand the argument from Massachusetts what they were trying to do anything for the federal government shut that down so Massachusetts does not do this now are now for an hour an hour now but the ... it sounds like you're seeing the argument is you'll find Massachusetts\nAnd you know Julius the drug company I could say hey Julie this medication that we know is FDA approved is still too expensive and we're not going to just pay blanket leave for a medication we think it's too expensive so you have to keep negotiating or we're not going to we're not going to honor that part of the\nExactly that's right I mean interestingly enough this uh uh the federal government do it rejected a math the Massachusetts effort\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from capital one committed to reimagining banking offerings savings and checking accounts

heads up about next Monday's installment of our special series the state we're in we'll focus on state trends in labor unions and collective bargaining public employee unions have been in the spotlight this year with teachers' strikes this spring and the Supreme Court decision this summer that affects collective bargaining\nHow was the labor movement doing in your state perhaps there are laws where you live that prevent people from organizing for better wages or working conditions or benefits\nTell us what's going on where you are leave us a voicemail eight five five to three six one

tell us your story eight five five\nTo three six one a one a or you can leave us a radio quality audio files through our app won a vox pop or series the state we're in continues next Monday on one day\nBack now to our conversation with read Wilson Julie Rovner and Scott Greenberg are still time to get in a few more of your questions and thoughts about state health care policy where you live one a at W. A. M. U. dot org Julie let's get to that question from Muncie law who tweeted isn't part of the reason Medicaid expansion didn't get as good support\nIs that it wasn't available as quote unquote GAP insurance for those whose employer plan has a high deductible\nWell of course the people who have an employer plans with a high deductible or our our big problem in the lower income people of those have a particular\nLarge problem if you have many thousands of dollars in deductibles have to pay before your insurance kicks and\nThere are a couple of small demonstration programs where Medicaid has been able to ah basically fell in with employer insurance but generally medicate is sort of an all or nothing proposition you're either on Medicaid or you're off\nThe way they Affordable Care act which created with those people up two hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty we're supposed to get 'em Medicaid people between a hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty and two hundred and fifty percent of poverty get special discounts they don't have those big to Dr balls so it it and then over two hundred and fifty percent of poverty then you're sort of on your own\nI'm In Arkansas I might point out though another we've been talking about a lot of different program that they instituted was to help people who often who were right at that margin we're constantly shifting back and forth between medicate and private plant and basically what they would do is the state was allowed to basically buy them into the private plans that they wouldn't have to keep changing\nWhere two weeks sidebar for just a second let me to the point of this series this this is talk about what states we're doing on big issues healthcare is a very big one it's one of the very first things that Donald Trump said he was going to act on when he became president repealing and replacing the Affordable CARE Act AK Obamacare\nThere are some people who feel like health care should be a national matter that every human being in the United states of America should have equally good planned ... was simple set of\nUp to the states that every state has different kinds of needs and different issues and that needs to be versatility are we any closer to one side of this argument winning or is the state federal split just kind of baked into the nature of this country like where is this where is this going Julie\nActually it's where it's going it's back to where it was before the Affordable CARE Act what we're finding from all these sort of small incremental changes that the Trump Administration has done is that the the Affordable Care act was intended\nTo create more of a national floor if you will for health insurance states scale do an enormous amount of regulation of how can they always have the federal government has always been sort of at\nThe junior partner to the states um but it had gotten so such a patchwork that it made huge differences which state you live to and what kind of healthcare you were able to get to the Affordable CARE Act with trying to say\nThere's a floor beneath which people won't fall that is slowly being chipped away and we're going sort of every month looking more and more like we did in two thousand nine before the Affordable CARE Act passed\nScott do you get the sense that this means that the effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act is kind of succeeding that it is taking us back to where we were beforehand\nWells Julie said it is in some states but in states that want to go in a different direction again California Massachusetts states like that\nThey are re instituting some of the uh parts of the Affordable CARE Act that the Trump Administration has and the Republican Congress have tried to undercut so for example a on the individual mandate the requirement that you have insurance um\nSo called association health plans which are these cheaper plans that do not a ... a offer all of the benefits that were mandated under the AC a some states are saying well whatever they are joined the federal level um insurance is regulated or at the state level and if you're going to sell insurance and our state you are going to abide by these rules\nI'll tell you one issue read that states and many people have been hoping the federal government will act on and that states kind of moved on anyway and that's dealing with medical marijuana it's on the ballot in some states again this year about twenty two states have already legalized pot for medical use some of legalized for recreational use\nVoters in Utah will choose whether to join the states or not and the political battleground seems to have shifted and I want to read if you see it this way for more traditionally liberal states into more conservative areas overtime\nYeah and it's not just the medical ... that has gone that way but also legalization of recreational marijuana the two states where a legalization is going to be on the ballot this year is in Michigan in North Dakota\n... ... you know for ... for recreational notice or in in on the medical side there are three different amendments in Missouri which is nice and confusing for the voters out there to try to figure out\nWhich is which are and then a Utah is as you say on the ballot Oklahoma already approved it this year so yeah we're we're not talking about the liberal coastal elites that are legalizing marijuana ah we're talking about a red America that is now dealing with this debate or it came up and you know in Florida last year and\nLast year two years ago um but this is this is now a debate that I think it shows the shift in the political conversation around marijuana those sorts of people who approve of\nA marijuana legalization tend to be\nA older white males funny enough and then the millennial generation that the younger the basically the younger you are the more in favor of\nA legalization you happen to be um the older white males the theory is that's the that's the sort of libertarian streak a they don't want the government regulating something that\nThey don't think the government has a hand in regulating and the real swing voters or perhaps not surprisingly come down to suburban women are in talking to the people who run campaigns for and against marijuana legalization or basically the battleground is of the mothers who are worried that their kids are going to be exposed to marijuana\nSo you hit the proponents are talking about the law enforcement uh\nNot that this will not expand the market into younger people who will have to have access to recreational marijuana and then he's got the opponents who say exactly the opposite that legalization will in fact\nUh begin to rope and a bunch of kids why are there three items in Missouri\nSo they're all on the ballot from different ah proponents different sides of it with two of them are from a actual citizen groups that that put them on the ... amendment to an amendment three and then there's a proposition which if premise wrong I think the proposition goes on the ballot from the state legislatures that's going to be some kind of\nCompromise or a piece that proposition see 'em and they are all sort of competing with each other and this underscores another piece of\nThe evolution of of marijuana politics pots of big business or in a lot of these states that have legalized Colorado Washington Oregon a California Nevada Alaska or Massachusetts and Maine uh the people who are setting up\nA ... who get to write these laws\nAlso essentially get to determine who's in the market um and who owns a very lucrative space one of the biggest opponents of recreational legalization in a bunch of early states where the people who ran medical marijuana shops because they already have the monopoly right why dilute the monopoly with other people\nI should know by the way we did a program this year about state laws on marijuana and the business of pies could find that on line at the one a dot org\nScott a couple of things to add to what to read said on this very interesting issue um ah one is that it's sort of intersects with what we talked about earlier the opioid crisis because there are many people\nAre supporters of medical marijuana who argue that this is a viable alternative to uh to opioids for people who have chronic pain and then also I think we've written about this um it's interesting that social justice provisions are finding their way into marijuana\nBills or this idea that a a minority communities have been the most impacted by the war on drugs and therefore uh as we move towards legalization that makes sense to include in these bills provisions that uh\nThis is Ninety point three WPN land Nashville public\nRadio Ninety

where I'm standing at plainly ... what's going on and it just seems like we really need to come together and actually make a change or there's going to be a really bad and\nCaitlin thanks very much for sharing your thoughts with his poll I Wonder how you would respond to Caitlyn particularly because I think sometimes if I may just add to your comment the terminology often gets in trouble I mean some people use the phrase climate change some people say extreme weather as some people say global warming and\nJust beginning to get on the same page can be one of the core problems of talking about all this\nIt's a great point we need to recognize that the good news is we have the solutions to address this problem the technical solutions the energy\nSolutions the policy solutions what we lack our political will and consensus around action we know that we have to ... global emissions by twenty twenty and go to zero net carbon by twenty fifty turns out we have the technologies renewable carbon capture\nA electric vehicles and many others to make that happen if we make a real push but it is going to take a huge push likely made during the Cold War I Wish the country would come together\nLeadership leading the world again to safety I think that it's possible but when one party in the United states it's a nice factual information over twenty year period that election

irrespective of opinions on climate Katie emailed\nMy family has vacation to Mexico beach in Florida for twenty plus years and we have many friends and loved ones from Panama City who have lost everything meaning in hurricane Michael\nMy father is it this believer of climate change and it's been very upset about losing a place we love so much he won't consider that just maybe there is a greater sing at play here what is it going to take for this to change how do we those who are convinced that is happening change the way we talk about it and rather than shutting down the conversation\nNurture it Sarah how would you respond to Katie\nGosh that's a really really great question and I can feel that the pain that she is in the last that her family is\nStruggling with to describe it and you know this is this is the peace around recognizing how difficult this information as like I got exposed to the science of climate change when I started graduate school and it took me\nLike six years to integrate the scale of difficulty of that information and it it people can get exposed to the science of climate change and it ... they can be in such a vulnerable place that it's actually potentially dangerous for for students and people who are struggling with mental health issues\nSo the the way that we unpack this I think\nIs through and through relationship and trust and empathy on because as we interact as individuals and we come to terms with the scale of the change and the crisis you can have a lot of really based on emotion and fear anger um [noise]\nI anxiety all of these pieces that are we all ... away from those very challenging emotions and often when we feel those emotions we shared into our part in corners\nWhere we think we know the way the world is and we we become ever more entrenched in our existing world view and that's why being honest that yeah this is a really difficult conversation and that's exactly why we're having this conversation is one of the ways to start\nSheriff I could just doing it a little deeper on that I Wonder if this idea of being empathetic and being a little compassionate might also speak to the conversations with folks who feel very fatalistic I mean\nIt's hard not to read the latest report from the un climate change by which we discussed last week on this program\nAnd not feel like well we're all going to die anyway why bother run up your credit 'cause they're not going to be around and collect you know what I'm saying like it just feels like an intractable problem and I wonder if maybe a little empathy for folks who feel that way would go a long way\nWell I Want to so yeah I got it and I I Want to remind remind us that as we sit\nWith the privilege of western lifestyles and we look at the science that we've invested public money into you know remembering that we're living a science fiction fantasy right now and we can look to human history and see that there are many other cultures around us\nAnd specifically in the U.

your help with tomorrow's program about being Native American\nMassachusetts democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren recently announced that a DNA test has confirmed what she said all along that she is indeed of tribal heritage the test was the clock back to President Trump who mocked her for claiming that heritage and refer to her as Pocahontas\nCritics including some tribal leaders said direct ancestry matters more than DNA testing in this regard\nIt's just one of many issues that may have Native American voters talking\nHead of the midterms if you are Native American what has claiming your

blood so let's get in a few more of your questions and comments before we move on\nNoel tweeted I teach clients to think of anxiety kinda like sugar a little gives you energy to get going and too much shut you down and drains you need to keep it at that middle area I guess\nLet's get back to Arlene's question on our website and ... and Paul I wonder if you could respond to her a lean rights\nSo if you change people's minds what then I see a lot of people who believe in climate change to do nothing to try to mitigate it in their own personal lives\nThere still driving around in gas guzzling SUVs owning their ... mentioned houses with a thermostat turned up not recycling not cutting back on meat and dairy basically waiting for someone else to do something it's like someone else's tomorrow not ours\nNo doubt personal action is important not least so that you're not hypocritical\nWhen you advocate policy and political action but let's be clear that it will take large policy action to reduce emissions in the United states in globally to make the United states\nEmissions to solve this problem we have the biggest thing you can do personally\nFor climate change action is to vote out people who won't take it and voting people who will and I don't mean trust Democrat and Republican because within those parties there are a few Republicans who\nAcknowledge like uh the congressman from some South Florida um but there are many more who deny it on the Democratic side there are some who are not strong enough and do not advocate serious policies\nWe have to recognize this is an imminent threat to people's public safety national security and economic well being as all the recent hurricanes wildfires have shown we need to vote\nI think one of the kind of saving grace is air at this point in the conversation is that we we do need to deal with U.S policy issues but\nJust being able to have the conversation and useful successful way I think that's a form of progress as well you just get people kind of pointed in the direction of being willing to do something so by the by way of kind of wrapping up I Want to go through a few common objections to the basic argument around climate change and sort of role play how one might respond to those\nFor example be tweeted I often run into these excuses if warming is happening why do we still have winter and we've been told for decades that bad things would happen to years ago but they haven't Sarah how would you respond to that well\nI mean bad things are happening right now so [laughter] there's evidence that um that those projections are coming through I mean all of the pieces of projections that we have seen around temperature and carbon\nConcentration thing we are able to do a very good job at projecting a the impacts of climate change on the ground and and that's the state of the science right now it's it's phenomenal\nI guess the issues not just that we're having winter but we're having like day after tomorrow winter like we're having super winner\nRight and and so like [noise]\nYes and there is cut and so there's complexity and how the regional climate and the seas analogy of different places are

trying to catch these hackers and this year Facebook's chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified to Congress that his company needs to raise this game\nFacebook is an idealistic and optimistic company\nFor most of our existence we focused on all the good the connector and people can do and if Facebook is grown people everywhere have gotten a powerful new tool for staying connected to the people they love for making their voices heard and for building communities and businesses\nBut it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools are being used for harm as well and that goes for fake news foreign interference in elections and hate speech as well as developers and data privacy\nFacebook talks endlessly about its community and at the fringes there are some in that community who regard the platform as one of the best ways to spread terrorist propaganda over the summer we spoke to Monica bigger she's Facebook's head of global policy management about how the company is taking on terrorists\nThere are two ways that we become aware of content that might violate our policies and keep in mind we have billions as new post every day or so the first thing we become aware is if somebody reports content to ask you can report any piece of content through the site if you do it comes through and it's reviewed by Facebook\nOr the second thing is we actually have technology tools that are out looking for content that might violent our policies so for instance terror propaganda now we remove the terror propaganda that we removed from face that's more than Ninety nine percent of that our technical tools find before anybody in our community flags it for us\nNow once content has been flat as potentially\nViolating our policies it comes into one of our content reviewers and there's more than Seventy five hundred people sitting on those content review teams around the world reviewing content in dozens of languages a and making a decision if it violates the policy and ... if it doesn't violate the policy to leave it up that's\nGot to be a hard job being a content reviewer at Facebook what kind of person does it take to do that kind of work\nIt really depends on the a specific area that person is working in all content reviewers who come to Facebook are hired with a certain degree of language expertise\nWe have a really global population using this service in fact more than eighty five percent of people using Facebook on a regular basis are from outside the United states\nSo if you think about the different languages that we see we have to hire content reviewers who speak all different kinds of languages and it's important to us that we have\nNative language speakers because they really understand the way that language has evolved so that's a big focus in our hiring once you're hired as a content review or you're trained in all of our policies but then you were assigned to become a specialist in one so for instance ...\nA man harassment and bullying policies but you might ultimately be assigned to work on um identifying self harm effect of self harm when you\nCatch content that doesn't belong on Facebook that violates terms what's the difference between say reactive flagging in proactive flying how much of it is the kind of thing that say a reviewer or bought would find as opposed to something that I as a user would flag and then Facebook deals with us\nWe still rely heavily on people to tell us when something is going wrong on the side that said we've been investing heavily in tools that can proactively flag\nViolating content and I'll tell you there's a couple of areas where this is working really well in a couple of areas where it harder areas where it's working really well with terror propaganda\nI'm with child sexual exploitation with spam with fake accounts we now have technical tools that can ... majority of that content before anybody in the community\nSend it to us or sees it at all um in fact when it comes to child sexual abuse imagery or terror propaganda were able to stop the majority of that at the time of upload meaning nobody ends up seeing\nNow when you think about a policy like bullying or hate speech or harassment a lot of that is very contextual\nFor instance um you know there could be if I if I wanted to bully you on social media and you and I are our friends at work or at our university and and now we've fallen out then there's a backstory there and the words they might use to believe on Facebook would not necessarily be the things that we could train our technology to catch\nSo it's really important for us to give tools to people so that if I ... on Facebook you can report it and our reviewer will actually look at what's happening and make that decision what about topics as opposed to content patterns\nHow's that pattern recognition work well we do some most of our policies are about content that people are posting but we do have some policies that are focused on actors themselves\nFor instance if you miss represent yourself on Facebook we'll remove your account even if you're not otherwise pilot in our content policies we also have policies against terror organizations and our members hate organizations um and so forth so if you for instance wanted to create a page to support al ...\nAnd on that page you were just going to share photos of puppies and kittens in rain does we would still remove it because we don't allow those groups or anybody representing those groups to have a presence on the site\nUm if you see a page that is violating our policies in its entirety meaning it's a page that's representing al ... page that has been created for the purpose of ... somebody then it's appropriate to report the page to us the reason I mentioned that is because whatever you report that the piece of content that is going to come through to our review teams first\nAnd so if somebody has an otherwise okay profile and then they are attacking you based on your religion and you report that specific attacking comment that's what's going to come through our reviewers and they'll be able to take immediate action\nAlso worth noting if you're a mobile use or like if if you're an iPhone use or if you just have one comment directly\nSometimes it'll bring you up a menu that will say reply or lie or copy and then there's other options and in those other options there's that option to report somebody I Wonder how much Facebook is facing the learning curve of a world that is learning to use Facebook know decides designed to be intuitive\nI think it is increasingly intuitive the more you use it and because you're global you've got people in some parts of the world who are just beginning for the first time\nTo have broadband devices or to be connected to a world where there are more devices in our people house Facebook teaching people to use Facebook\nWe definitely do outreach but you're right at different in different parts of the world people will have different levels as experience and finding these reporting options and even just understanding how the fight\nOptions that we offer people to report content actually do vary by location and we're always testing ways to get more report to us to make it easier now there's a tension here if you just have one big red button", "year": "2018",
