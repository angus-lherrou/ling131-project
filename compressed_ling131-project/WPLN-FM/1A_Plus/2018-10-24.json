Gorbachev or give us a sense of the leadership styles of Reagan and Gorbachev that allowed this treaty to come to fruition\nWell when you think of Ronald Reagan or you think of a man who is extremely decent and a conservative and Republican incompetent he was just a very competent person or when you think of\nJust a but overall a decent person who wanted to do something at that time they were both very different from the president we have now Joshua or in the sense that um\nYou know when I was in government uh mothers and fathers wanted their kids to grow up like Ronald Reagan maybe not the policies maybe they didn't get rid of the policies\nBut the decency of demand the humble and this of the man the genuine niceness of him and today even if you're agreeing with Trump's policies which I don't but even if you do I don't think any mother father wants their kid to grow up to be like a Donald Trump or this\nIs probably sorry are probably some who cod and openly quality and the president\nWhether they're hard to say though they're well disguised Joshua\nAnd uh the decency the kindness of Reagan who really love the immigrants and his office was decorated with pictures of immigrants his farewell address to the country talked about the wonders of wonderful immigrants coming to our country and his whole address was about immigration how wonderful was\nHe was a fanatic about a free trade or not having tariffs at any time and he was very intense it's dry reduce government spending and reduce especially the deficit all those things were\nClassic conservative classic\nRepublican and um none of them are being followed by this so called Republican\nI'm Donald Trump but anyway this style of Reagan was a style that made somebody like me very proud to serve him and very proud to be there with him on that weekend and record back in Ninety six\nKenny ... author of Reagan had Reykjavik forty eight hours that ended the Cold War also the arms control director for President Reagan and former U.S ambassador to the UN ambassador ... thanks for talking to us okay now learn how to spell Reykjavik an extra what I'll work on it I think it's very much a very good back\nWhat two Confederate General Robert e and the Reverend Dr Martin Luther king junior have in common\nAccording to retired General Stanley McChrystal they are both leaders worth studying granted we study them for very different reasons but they did some of the same things\nThey made bold decisions that won them loyal following ... they were controversial within the very leadership structures that brought them into power and the revered today for what they represent it not just what they accomplished\nStill these men with several things in common which seemed to have almost nothing in common\nPerhaps that's the paradox of leadership\nThere is no one formula and no one checklist that defines all leaders\n... McChrystal retired as a four star general he served as the top us commander in Afghanistan from two thousand nine twenty ten\nAnd he's the co author of the new book leaders miss and reality alongside Jeff Eggers and Jason men go and he joins us to discuss that General McChrystal welcome to one a it's another to busier Joshua we'd also like to take your questions and thoughts\nFor the general about the nature of leadership and we'd love to know to some of the leaders are that you look to that you try to emulate or is that you follow whose leadership attributes you think are worth highlighting comments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a at W.

A. M. U.\nDot org General McChrystal I Want to follow up on something I heard in that montage I ... I recall some people using the word leader\nAnd some using the word hero and I wonder if we need to distinguish between that dock at a tweeted if a quote unquote leader fails to leave but makes people do what they have to do by using threats intimidation or fear are they still called leaders shouldn't they be called anything else but leaders\nI get the sense General McChrystal from reading your book that those people could still be leaders we just might not think of them as being very heroic in their leadership\nI think that's right I mean we broaden the term leader to be people in roles and people who get people to do things even though that may be bad things so we don't say leaders are good or bad we said are effective or not because\nYou can have some pretty negative people ugly objectives who effectively lead people in that direction think Adolf Hitler\nIf we really step back and say because some of the names and the ideas and the montage there were tremendous\nWe think back when we want from our leaders what should we want from our leaders the dad retired from the military I had never met President Bush forty one and yet he called me on the phone just to tell me he thought it would be a difficult day and then a short conversation he just reached out to somebody in an incredibly thoughtful way\nHe made me feel better I think we want our leaders\nTo make us feel better but more importantly I think we want our leaders to make us better\nSometimes that's not the leader who rubbed your belly and tells you you know it's everybody else's fault and you can get you deserve more sometimes it's a leader who's a little tough on you that coach that teacher that parent\nWho pushes you to be better than you would otherwise be the military commander who works you physically really harder makes you go in harm's way but at the end of it you sit back and you go you know\nI'm Better or for that yeah I'm a bit better than I Would otherwise be they ask much sometimes they demand a lot but typically they give alongside to us and and if we\nWe frame leaders in that way and look in the mirror and say are we demanding as followers are we asking and demanding from that from our leaders then I think we ask winter many questions about our society today\nIn the book there are three minutes that you're trying to tear down in terms of the way that we think about leaders let's go through them one at a time one is called the formulaic mess which is basically this idea that leadership can be boiled down to a formula you argue that it's much more can textual right\nAbsolutely you can have this list of traits or behaviors and the leader can use them and on Monday they can work and on Tuesday go to the same organization but the context is changed the followers are in a different place and it doesn't work at all so in reality a leaders got to be constantly adapting\nThe situation the second one is the attribution myth you write that we attribute too much to leaders and we give them we use the kind of tunnel vision as you describe but what do you mean by that\nWell I wrote my memoirs and twenty ten and I thought I was writing the play of my life and that would be easy 'cause I was there and I would therefore be the star\nBut when we did all the interviews the background to get the other parts of the stories in many cases I had made a decision and there'd been an outcome and therefore thought I should get credit or blame for that but I found out all the other people who had done things I didn't even know about and the other factors that are played upon that\nWhen I concluded was the leaders still part of it I mean I was still a key part of it but I wasn't the dominant part and so we find today\nWe treated a little bit like a Broadway show we put the spotlight on the leader and we keep that spotlight following the leader no matter where they are the all the other things in the situation\nOr putting shadows I think we make a mistake if we assume that the leader caused the great thing to happen or is ultimately responsible for the failure there just a part of it\nAlthough I Would say that based on one of the leaders you profile in the book Walt Disney there are some leaders who want it that way Disney did not credit his other animators initially in the silly symphonies and the short films that led up to Snow White and the seven tour so he kind of you kind of wanted it that way which\nVery calm and I mean if you think about it everybody a little bit like the the spotlight likes to be on the pedestal so it's a natural thing and Walt Disney after the success of Snow White for what she did an extraordinary job of pushing his team to create at a masterpiece\nHe wanted the basket and that and it was a natural problem but it caused a huge problems just four years later in a bitter strike in Nineteen forty one\nWas speaking to General Stanley McChrystal from NPR in New York the co author of leaders myth and reality that third myth you call the results myth which says that leadership is the process of driving people toward an outcome why is that a myth don't results matter\nWill results matter and we claim that that's how we select or choose to follow leaders whether they get a good bottom line or whether they win battles or win elections but in reality the data doesn't support that we tend to follow leaders even though many er serial failures\nOr their outcomes are often much less than they want them to be or have said that they are [noise]\nIt's really on the followers to understand this because leaders tend to feel some place in us in emotional requirement for us they give a vision for the future we're much less analytical and demanding of actual results than we think we are\nMarjorie emailed good leaders know how to train the next leaders and went to release the training wheels and step down I'm interested in March ... comic she's reflects something that a John Maxwell describes in the five levels of leadership basically the fifth level to the top two levels are about replicating yourself\nIn other people but I Wonder where you see that a lot of the leaders that you profiled weren't necessarily looking to replicate themselves and others [noise]\nIt it it is something you don't see often enough Martin Luther king Junior's puppies success story there when he was murdered in Nineteen sixty eight the movement went on headed suddenly stopped in his last than I think it would have said something\nOn the other hand if you look at Margaret Thatcher she was a very successful female politician and Britain in a tough time for a female politician she became the most famous prime minister since Winston Churchill she was extraordinarily powerful\nBut over time her art of power started to bend down and she became more autocratic people became less six\nAnd when she fell and she was essentially assassinated by some of her political allies she had left a bit of a vacuum because it had started to be about prime minister Thatcher\nIt's interesting one of the leaders that you profile in the book\nWho really did not leave a vacuum in a in his absence but rather really replicated himself was Abu Musab al Zarqawi the founder of the kind of the progenitor of what became the Islamic state when you were introduced advance we're often credited as one of the people responsible for\nFor killing him I Wonder how we learn from people like ours our car we about leadership and whether those lessons could help us defeat terrorism\nWell I think we have to I fought against our car wait for more than two years before we killed him and I stood over his body soon after\nThis is Ninety point three WPN land National Public radio Ninety One point five WPN

A. M. U. dot org\nAnthony you said that you were kind of incredulous at first when Donald Trump said he was going to run for president what were you skeptical about and then what kind of turned you around from that\nAll this and that are acquaintance ship with them for you know two decades and uh I uh he has threatened to run and now in times past than I always thought it was like a great publicity edge you say what a threatened to run yeah threatened to run yeah LA's higher than run for president are are going to support Romney 'cause you know I've decided it's not the right time for me to run for president\nSo there's something a little short of about the word threatened not he floated the idea or he hinted at its brand\nThreatened yeah let's go back and look at some of the tapes when he was running in two thousand for the reform party it was a threatening to run that's how I described it on my and I'm not describing a pejorative way but it just always he was like okay you know if you guys don't straighten out I'm going to run for president but sort of like that sort of a threat but uh\nYou know your your listeners that don't like your guest choice I'd I'd I admire them but I'm also going to caution them on something\nWhen you shut down because like I'm a pro Trump person has a shutdown intellectually and then you start to demonizing caricature the other side\nWhat ends up happening is you you lose an important element of the story and then it makes it harder for your a bottle you know so for me um I Love coming on NPR all go on the left leaning shows all the time and I'll do left leaning journalists interviews\nBecause I really do want to hear their side Jack Kennedy once said\nThat he spent a lot of time understanding the other side's ideas that he felt they were very smart people on the other side in that always understanding the other side's ideas made a person sharper and and by the way if I got to the other side and it weakened my argument\nThat I'm a strong enough of an intellect if you will to change my argument and to say you know what I'm looking at that appropriately and so so I encourage people to keep that open dialogue going\nA lot of people out there that I disagree with but I like hearing from\nWell and there's something to the the work that as you describe it in the book when when you were getting more involved with the press is the communications director where you tried\nTo convince the president said to dial down some of the rhetoric against the media you said and and this is not a secret that you said that\nIt pushed back is normal but this kind of an ongoing war against the press just isn't helpful it's it's not productive\nI hear you on that but the president didn't seem to be having it he seems to have never met a news outlet he didn't love to bash at some point or other except for except for a handful that that must have been on some level frustrating especially since you see the potential in his in his policy agenda\nNo no no question I mean listen I'm a very big believer in the first amendment\nLike if you if you if you've read the federalist papers the main reason why they put the first amendment in the air was to protect us from tyranny and they always felt that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely to quote lord act in and so\nHaving the free press there to observe leadership is a check on their power you know that's why they've always been called the fourth estate now\nThe press has gotten fragmented and it's gotten a little bit ideological but they still have that right and I always thought that the communications department and my ... plan is a online somewhere somebody lead did so it it's out there was a ... page plan\nThat basically illustrated that we were going to be in the customer service business servicing the press and servicing all parts of the press who didn't necessarily have to be right leaning press if anything\nI only did one press conference a but it was very important for me to call on CNN they had been called on for several weeks\nAnd I want to send a message to those people that hey we're now open for business the lights and cameras are back on and the press room we're open for business\nAnd you know I'm obviously not a shrinking violet build my own business and you know came from scratch so I went in the square ought to I mean you give the president good advice what why wouldn't they stick to it well I think we're headed up happening is there was a lot of commotion he clearly wanted previous and ban and out of there I made it very big gaffe when he put Kelly and the job\nHe was going to be impossible for Kelly to keep me because I was reporting directly to the president and even if I accepted a subordinate role which I have would have been happy to do with um a team player\nI don't think Kelly would have been able to sustain that I mean look let's face it I'm a New Yorker I have a New Yorkers attitude at a New Yorkers personality\nOr does that strike you as somebody like General Kelly with like you don't have to answer the question I'm saying ... having you know your General Kelly like I I I I think those might be somewhat of friction points for him to even be on the list\nBut as a matter of fact I was going to like me any more than he likes to preserve it on your advice about the press in terms of the way that the president deal with the press\nHe could have kept that advice even after you left the White House I mean\nI get the sense that the president just didn't agree with that [noise] um no\nActually ... you know ... is a funny story you know because you know it was a short period of time but you almost have like a black box recorder in your brain when it's going on I'm sitting in the oval office with them that Kenny and meeting where I'd been announces ... director is over it's him and I alone in the office\nI'm going to go on the air to three o'clock to do the press corps he looks at me and say it's a great relationship with the press I mean why do you think it's gone so poorly in the first six months\nI Lived in a while you declared war on the media I mean you can't declare war on the media first of all you going to lose that war secondarily any a president that's made a war declaration on the media how is that going to end up well because everybody gets their guard up everybody gets in a defensive posture I said well were you way better served if we dial that down\nOr any other thing is the president is a TV star a people may not like me saying that about him\nBut for me I like seeing them on sixty minutes I like seeing him in areas where he's outside of that style box of conservatism let him parity with Leslie stall let him have a real conversation with a crust Cuomo or somebody like that I mean he doesn't like these people\nLet's say at least a half of them have that voice and so I was arguing for that I think we had them in position to do that\nThen the blow up happened and then people get very very defensive and then there are there also a lot of people don't like the presidents are prone to exaggeration he's a little bit like my grandfather that one said why let the truth get in the way of a really good story or we know that about the president's or there's a lot of people inside the ... like okay\nWe got to protect the president from him telling these like ... and him telling these\nStories that ... may be a generous word for some of the things\nSo I'm seeing in accurately and and clearly and consistently over ... listen I just left a morning show where these guys like like they they really want them all day and night and so and they're calling them a rank liar and I get it I mean he does say things\nThat are inaccurate he is doing that in a way to fluff up the crowd and get everybody energized and I understand that and I understand if you're a military leader like somebody like John Kelly\nThat would probably refer your feathers because she would want accuracy and you would want all that stuff to be dial down and obviously fifty sixty percent of the public probably wants that to\nSo so but but we have to do then is you've got a town straight yesterday man this is not working you gotta you gotta you gotta said straight but what he'll stay back to you as well as energizing my base it's bringing people out to the to the to vote\nAnd and this is always going to be as ... as long as Donald Trump is the president United States it's going to be a battle between\nPolicy and personality and the people that like his policy are going to take his personality and if you don't like his policies are going to really focus on his personality and by the way there are some people\nWere the personality is actually outweighing the policy where they're like okay look I Can't take the personality even though the policies are good and you get to a few more comments I Know we've only got you for a few more minutes but let me get to

U. dot board Barbara emailed I still talk weekly by phone to a Yemeni friends in Sana'a and sought a VR living in hell and they ask\nWhy does America hate us so much why does America wants to kill us\nWhat do I say\nSomeone before we continue and before we bring in our next voices on the conversation I Wonder if you could just for those people who haven't been following the Yemeni civil war very clearly can you just boil down at the core of it what does this conflict about who are the fighters and what are they fighting for\nSo Yemen's conflict is actually quite complex conflict a it's a it's a conflict that has many layers to it but ultimately what you hear in the news is that's a it's a Saudi Iranian proxy war you also hear that the government at the ... the government in Sana'a that announced itself is actually in fact\nA coup government that has drawn by militia and that the Saudi Government is trying to restore the legitimate Yemeni government ah to power in Yemen now the problem with all of that as this conflict is failing to do all of the things that they're saying it's a it's about for example\nWhen Saudi Arabia got involved in the conflict with the Arab coalition\nThe aim is to bring back the Yemeni government the Yemeni government has been residing in jail since the war started and at is struggling to go back to places where there is no so see um Bush on the ground\nAnd on top of that that's who the militia in a sense has gained so much more since the war started in the sense that at first they had to share power with uh the former president of Yemen where you know in two thousand eleven young and had a revolution and I'm the president was removed\nBut he ... himself with the ... and was present for some time\nBut I'm the sheer power with him now fast forward three years into the war they had killed them and and now they have their own control of the majority of the north of Yemen\nAnd of course the the scariest thing about this is the Houthi militia had managed to capture the Yemeni military arsenal that belong to the former government is now all in their hand\nAnd so in a sense what the war dead is complicate an already complicated political situation\nAnd it devastated the lives of millions of enemies are for example Seventy five percent of the Yemeni population is it is suffering and and need of immediate aid and depend on foreign aid to kind of survive and this is a Seventy percent in ...\nAnd um and I didn't want to talk more about the the population on the ground that needs help I just want to both before we get to our next wars and also just want to be clear there was a sectarian part of this to these\nThese who the rebels who kind of came after the government you're Saudi Arabia involving itself but there is a Muslim sectarian aspect to this also this Sunni versus Shia conflict as a proxy war right\nSo this is what's interesting and this is what a lot of people don't realize first of all the shot and Yemen I don't practice the same sect of ... that Iran practices or the Shiites in Lebanon or Iraq practice\nThey practice a sect called the DSM and the ideas and is known as ... and it's really different from twelve or ... or the ... he formed that's practice in Iran\nWhat's interesting is that it's the closest form of she has them that resembles Cindy and some are and again and we the Sunnis there are ... and the divide isn't you know the the ... are not a minority like in other places or forty five percent of the population\nAnd so what's interesting about this you know Sunni Shia conflict is that it's entirely manufactured in a sense that of course there are differences between these those two sects of course there are situations where they don't agree but they managed to co exist for many years now the CDs or the hosts the sect\nOf of you know what's happening in Yemen they're no longer a practicing as they did and as it as it seems like they're trying to politicize said he has them and to kind of a associate themselves more with the Iranian sect of she has them and the ...\nHas struggled to maintain it sucked as it is with the influence of well how does that mean Salafis them coming into the country and so in a sense what you're saying is that the most radical elements of those two\nAre fighting each other and so in a sense you have the presence of a new ... conflict but one thing that I really have to point out to the listeners here is that that's not the only thing going on\nI'm a huge portion of the country in the liberated territory from the control\nIs actually a demanding secession and that is something that you don't hear about in the news as much you know in the south so ever since Nineteen Ninety four the people there felt that they were under occupation and the cost secession are rising day after day as this conflict continues\nI'd want to make sure we get to a voice on the ground in Yemen but I hear what you're saying summer in terms of all of these very complex fault lines of kind of come together to fuel the civil war today before we came on the air today\nWe were able to get through to Sana'a in Yemen all communication into and out of Yemen is really tough but we did make contact with least grounding she's the UN's resident and humanitarian coordinator for Yemen least laid out what the conditions are like right now for those who\nAre living and working beer here as part of our conversation that we take just a few minutes ago we used to be welcome to want to\nThank you very much can you give me a sense just in a in a larger context how many people the un fears are at risk of famine right now\nIn game and we are worried that his steps are not taken right now in order to stop the spread of hunger that we could see as many as fourteen million ... who are facing famine by the end of the year this is why the United nations is rain the alarm bells\nAnd telling everyone that we're facing possibly the biggest famine in living memory if we don't do something to stop it right now\nWhat are some of the other health risks that you're looking at their other than just starvation I'm sure with deprivation of a reasonable secure supply of food all kinds of other health problems also come into play right\nThat's exactly right\nOutbreak in modern history hit and then there were more than a million people who are suffering high there from Colorado or from watery diarrhea there had never been an outbreak of such magnitude in living memory\nNow this year because of the road work that's being done by frontline partners in UN agencies and officials here in the game and we've been able to contain the spread of and how the Democrats have similar levels there's a lot of color in the country but it's not spreading at the rate of course last year\nThat being said when people exist for months and months on supplemental rations when they are eating limited amounts of food what happens over a period of time is that they slowly start\nAnd this is absolutely what we are seeing for millions of people in this country they're immune systems are weakening and that makes some highly vulnerable to infections and water borne diseases including color\nAnd just by way of contacts leaves mentioned that there are fourteen million people that the un fears are at risk of famine the population of Illinois where we are right now doing this program and from Chicago he's Thirteen million people just by way of contacts least give me a sense of what a mother a father a parent has\nTo do in Yemen right now to try and feed their child to can you boils down to what an individual might be dealing with just to try to feed themselves and feed their family would they have to do\nSo sixty percent of all of the people who live in this country are what we call food insecure now out of that out of those Eighteen million people every single morning there are eight and a half million to wake up\nAnd they have absolutely no idea where they are going to get food from that day [noise] so what will happen is a family will use absolutely every means at their disposal to secure of what they can they'll go to their relatives in bake\nAnd we know the ones that is a great enticement if somehow you're tiring of your National Public radio mug tote ... glass sock collection but don't take my word for

or email one day at W. A. M. U.\nDot org before we continue some al Hamdani let me come back to you for a second I checked in with our audience here at W. B. easy in Chicago to kind of ask\nThem if they were tracking with us and one of the things that I think confuses a lot of people it confuses me too\nIs the nature of this secretary and aspect like several of us and we have a and a ray of of age range of your students and seniors and everybody in between have heard of Sunni and Shia Muslims\nBut then that like the the sects within the sects I think that's where a lot of us kind of get lost can you\nCan you bottom line that for us what difference does it make what ... these people are with like why why does the sects one of the sex involved matter to this can you just kind of simplified force\nSo when it comes to you and I'm like I mentioned the majority of the northern part of Yemen is historically a day and the majority of the southern portions of Yemen as historically shaft eye and said these can be called ... and the cafes are called for now\nNow the ... like a kind of began years ago and then was revived recently\nImportation of religious sects of what we're seeing at play as political Islam and that's what we're hearing about you know the chefs in a conflict it's not really religious matter today it's really a political matter of allegiance to what part of the middle east are you going to support in what we're seeing play out is that\nIran is announcing itself as the I'm\nKind of the guardian if she has them and Saudi Arabia on the other hand as presenting itself to the world is the guardian of finance them and so as soon as she our is pretty much kind of people fighting for the interests of who's going to take control in the region\nAnd that's what this what's happening in Yemen you know for instance when this war started\nWe know that the u._s. then under the administration of President Obama had struck a deal on ... on the nuclear deal with Iran\nAnd the sense they sacrificed Yemen by saying here you can fight Iran in Yemen but the U.S is going to kind of find this deal with Iran now that was a short sighted move because I think a lot of people then didn't anticipate that today President Trump would come to power and then today you have and a nuclear deal with Iran\nI and at the same time also have this devastating crisis in Yemen and so in a sense okay\nSo let me let me ... I think so let me let me back up and try and repeat back to you what you just said ah so I've been drawn a diagram everybody here ... been watching scribble in my piece of paper\nSo we've got these these two sects of Islam Sunni Islam and she Islam it's this old centuries old fight that has been made\nPolitical you use the phrase political Islam to describe\nHow we run is kind of for political and regional power reasons trying to kind of claim itself as the the defender of the Shia Muslim faith and Saudi Arabia has kind of ... anointed itself the defender of the Sunni Muslim faith\nAnd that politicized Islam has spread into other conflicts and Yemen these factions in Yemen\nIran and Saudi Arabia are supporting these factions is kind of a battle in this larger war for the soul of political Islam is that kind of it\nSure yeah exactly and so what I'm saying is that historically and traditionally the sect of Islam that ... have practiced for years are not necessarily aligned with the Saudi an Iranian sects but for political reasons they are now aligning with each other gotcha\nGotcha folks here it'd be easy does that make more sense good sums up all around or if you go and I I appreciate you explain it I think you know part of the complication Jane Ferguson is that this is complicated I mean some words you can't just\nBoil down to one cause but that also makes it hard\nFor us sworn in Yemen to zero in on them and and really think our T fan but your reporting has involved some of the people on the ground\nWho are dealing with the results of this larger fight for the soul of political Islam you described the story of an eleven year old girl that you encountered back in June the kind of stuck with you can you give us the basics of what happened to\nHer [noise] sure telling her story is one of the race for the most important reason why journalists need access to this because we have to put\nA face and a name and the picture to the statistics otherwise they're just the tip steaks and I think than we we deal with with a lot of uh of of of difficulty trying to get the public to understand the level of this crisis so I\nI was in ... um which is a product and sort of in northwest of of Santa and controlled by the who the rebels and uh and it's meant and us in the in the town of hijacking the capital of the ...\nHospital that I've seen there that the children's ward is now a de facto malnutrition wards and we were just filming there with some women and their babies' whenever a young man tall deathly than rushed and with the with the tiny what looked like just sort of like a bundle of clothes and it was hit eleven year old sister name was ...\nAnd for a horrible few moments we really thought may mono might dying in front of us on the hospital bed she was eleven years old and way too I think twenty four pounds was what it was about what we had to what we had asked at the doctors at that and it was\nAbsolutely a horrifying to watch her she you know when when a child gets so weak and so among nourished\nThey also become so vulnerable to any kinds of infection and so they tend to get a diarrhea anyway and so even even if you do manage to get through to the\nUh they get diarrhea they get devastating they hydrated as a result the whole thing just spirals until a child's body just gives in um we spent some time they're filming with my own and speaking with her family\nAnd her mother eventually came the next day we were able to talk to her and we were piecing together the family story and it is a story that reflects millions of people's stories in Yemen and it is that her father was a schoolteacher and a government school\nBut whenever the uh the government salaries stopped over two years ago\nHe his salary stop to once people lost that level of income the government was that the the biggest employer by far the country before the war and that's not just soldiers and police that's people who work in offices that's teachers any kind of clerical work or any kind of bureaucratic work in Yemen\nWants those salaries stopped people would then go on to trying to live off of what the aid agencies would call coping mechanisms to you and I that's simply do I have any savings do I have a line of credit at the local store do have any livestock in the backyard do I have relatives who can help us out after two years\nThose coping strategies run out and they ran out for this family and they simply had no money and once a child starts to go downhill it can spiral out of control like this they were lucky family because they were able to afford to pay a cab to take them to the town\nThis is only three WPN Nashville Ninety One point five W tea and I'll come home and Ninety One point seven W.

Charles a story was followed by Kevin ... I mean I found a little bit with Charles but that's really a cabin who\nI mean being I'm Sorry bang that that followed a Charles a story and they had to establish these kinds of relationships um that are important now the moment you're talking about is with tiara that's actually a story I happened to be falling\nAnd you know you have to navigate those those times where you have to be able to ask difficult questions\nBut you also have to be able to step back when when it's clear that that you know they don't really want to go there and that happens frequently with Tara because she was struggling with a lot of things at that time I thought it was relevant to include that in the film\nA few more for your comments before we bring in our next two guests Mitch writes we can't move forward if we fail to address the past and continue to ignore the inequalities of today people of color are treated differently in America period end up sentence\nAgility for fun tweeted I've watched every episode of America to me I absolutely love it I'm shocked at how clueless and the white teachers are especially that physics teacher\nThe school board is a disaster spoken word is amazing by the way by way by the news of full disclosure we should note we did reach out to the superintendent of the district Stephen ... for his thoughts on the series we did not get a response but the invitation remains open we also reached out to the principle of Oak Park in the river forest high school Nathan rouse\nWe were unable to speak with him for the program we're told\nHe is traveling for work from Philadelphia where he attended an event called the national summit for courageous conversations about race so both those invitations remain open worth noting that neither the principal nor the superintendent participated in the documentary either is that right see that's all right\nLet's see more voices to the conversation to talk more about racial equity in schools nationwide\nAmanda Louis is the director of the Institute for research on race and public policy\nAt the University of Illinois at Chicago her latest book is called despite the best intentions how racial equity thrives in good schools professor Lewis welcome to want to say thanks for having me also with us here at W. B. easy as David Stovall a professor of African American studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago\nHis focus is on the influence of race in urban education community development and housing and he is a Chicago native professor still Volkow thanks so much that have professors have you watched the series any part of it some of it all of that yes festival what do you think of it so far what is there any anything in particular that struck you the hardest\nThe thing that struck me the hardest is an episode to win one of the parents of students\nIs the empty conversation that we do not have\nAbout schools that have the illusion of integration and I said the illusion of integration because it just means that students of color are in the same place with white students\nBut when this mom talked about what happened to her in the early nineties in on that fourth floor and he still happening today that to me is the story of us ... professor Lewis what are you [noise]\nYou know one of the things that really struck me there are a lot of powerful moments in the series but I think one of the things that also struck me as the silences some of the some of that kill missions and I know a lot of this had to do I'm sure with who was willing to participate and who wasn't\nBut one of the things you notice in that district is that the people aren't in the documentary so all the white powerful wealthy families a key leaders and the district a lot of the people who had the most power and the most influence over what that school ends up looking like\nA opt out and I think that's a kind of powerful and symbolic I'm a example of what's actually going on in the district\nPay by the way for those were you listening and I forgot to mention we may be discussing some things in the documentary that if you were\nEager to watch America to me might turn out to be spoilers so do that in mind in the conversation\nIf you would like to listen to this lady because I don't want to get them tweets do not tweeting me [laughter] 'cause I ruin this film for you I don't want to hear it but if you want to listen to this later on your own after you've had time to watch the documentary you'll find our conversation in its entirety\nAt the one a dot org that's the word the the number one the letter a dot org\nWe're talking about racial\nEquity professor still vote what does that mean what does racial equity look like is it and making sure that black kids in white kids get the same test scores is it about disciplinary procedures is it about truancy is it about people feel being nice to one another like ... how would we know racial equity if we had it\nRight I mean I think the Susan thank you for that question I think the thing around equity and I think the ... to him and his point what people are unwilling to talk about equity is really talking about we distribution\nSo when you talk about redistribution so now the question becomes who has had the least\nAnd now what are those things that they talk about that they meet the other thing around equity is getting people what they need when they need it\nAnd I think is ... is the issue one concern give me an example of getting people what they need one they need it for a young person says we have a particular problem with this teacher who is constantly giving us disciplinary referrals\nConstantly grading us in ways that we feel to be dubious now there needs to be so that racial equity team at the schoolhouse whoever that is that\nNeeds to be in the conversation on that racial equity team it can't be the conversation around young people which often happens in school houses that young people are blamed for this not equitable condition professor Lewis ... what\nDo you find that the big barriers to advancing toward racial equity is it is that funding is that the people involved is it different for every school in every district what tends to get in the ...\nWell I'm going to talk about the parks in the world and there are a lot of them and I think one of the things that um my colleague John Diamond and I found when we were doing the research for our book was that when you really try to understand why changes so hard it really is especially in these kinds of communities\nAnd I came today 'cause I heard that big man's going to be here\nCelebrities people's at name you live in Nashville you run into celebrities oh yeah a WPN\nLine that we strive to bring the voices that too often going hurt and if they become celebrities in your eyes wow that's amazing to support these efforts then make a pledge keep that we're going by calling six one five seven six zero twenty ten or visit W.

what we'll be talking about in Atlanta tomorrow\nPoison it appears to be Russians preferred weapon of choice and we'll find out who Moscow was targeting and why\nWe like to know what questions you want answered so leave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one a America's relationship with Russia and what was the Soviet Union has had its fair share of ups and downs but what message do you think Washington should be sending to Moscow now\nEight five five to three six one a one a I'd say five five to three six one two one two will dig deeper into the files of ... and get to some of your questions tomorrow from Atlanta on one day\nBack now to our conversation with professors amend the Lewis and David Stovall Steve James and Charles Donaldson we asked some of the members of our one a tax club how they believe their race affected their own educations and we got a ton of responses thank you\nWhite adults in the neighborhood hated the fact that we were bussed in school we had to travel to and from school in groups to keep from being jumped by mobs\nAnother ... club member wrote being Spanish and a woman I was told I could not be a scientist growing up took me years to wrap myself around the fact that I could be slower process than most but thankfully I made it\nA third texture wrote I watched as my African American friends whose grades weren't nearly as good as mine received scholarship after scholarship I worked hard throughout high school to be the first in my family to go to college yet I suffered because I was white unfair\nProfessor stove all there is a perception as you mentioned with regards to things like advanced placement courses in international baccalaureate courses and scholarships that the way we engage with race in a larger way can push too far\nThat we can give people of color an additional advantage just because they're black or brown and not because of their academic performance what do you make\nTo me I I mean it's not a thing around pushing too far I think it's a real issue will not pushing far enough right when we talk about equity we have to talk about who has historically been denied opportunity and then how are those opportunities denied in real time\nCurrently and because one white student did not get one scholarship does not mean\nBlack and Latino students across the country do not are not see who make Lee denied access so I think one of the conversations around race that becomes critical is to understand the individual and the structural and I think in the United states we are much more hesitant to engage the structural\nSteve that's got to be one of the challenges of a documentary like this particularly some of the reaction and I wonder what kinds of reactions it's gotten so far especially from from audience who are not people of color or have you been able to parse out three actions that that finally\nWell I I'm not on Twitter for personal reasons but um [noise] but you know I think I'm so I'm not really equipped to answer that and then it kind of thorough way but um you know I think uh my anecdote experiences is that a lot of white audiences\nAre people watching it it it has been a good experience and more eye opening experience\nIf for no other reason there are other reasons is is that we've tried to\nTake you more deeply into the lives of black and biracial kids who are not living in a poor besieged neighborhood in Chicago and at risk of gang violence and all of the things that we see an awful lot of in documentary filmmaking including some I pass work\nAnd I think that you know to to be able to give people the experiences of their lives and how they look at race and their experience with the with the community and America has been eye opening for for a lot of of white parents\nCharles how do you see this this difference when you were in high school and I I Want to ask you to speak for anyone high school but yours but in terms of white students students of color achievement these comments about you know students of color getting advantages just because of the color of their skin is does that reflect your experience and all my school or do you see it differently\nUm I think in general it was like there's kind of lay\nHer essay is there's this blanket we put over white kids as like your you know they always going to be one regardless of what happens all of them are always going to be one when it comes to kids of color they're like okay well we got like\nA whole bunch of the sleeping bags but we ain't got one blanket for everybody and only some people get that sleeping bag you know I definitely think for people like me and gay who is also a feature documentary where like\nOh I didn't want to like comparison of the students but the school has like I guess prominent interest in us because of what we do with our extra curricula who's in so it was just already you're saying that they're like okay well I mean to make sure those kids are good you know but for someone who isn't in any extra curricular who doesn't have any type of\nUm non student teacher relationship with and you do in the building they like it is hard but you know trapped in between the margins they don't get that sleeping bag I was talking about they're not even consider it to get one and that's like I think that's the whole thing right there is a blank is by sleeping bags whereas like\nAll all the white kids like all those kids who come from those types of homes and have stakes in the school the parents are big funders their siblings went there whatever whatever and then\nYou got the kids who I mean like me luckily I found spoken word but you got kids like me who\nI mean a few of my cousins went to oh the but other than that\nRight there was nothing really to kind of have to fend for yourself exactly in ... that's just not the case you know I think it it goes showing 'em\nWhich episodes that we must have done it was like most of the kids when he was on the news um tutoring sessions are usually white to an all white is so yeah All right and that's that's part like you know personal accountability but that's also to school like\nYou got to have kids of color in honors classes for them to get on his tutoring but as the one right to you know so well\nTo that point I Wonder if we can dig deeper on that professor loose carry tweeted I'm eager to hear the reasons why African American kids don't get picked for tougher classes has anything changed in the past Thirty years [noise]\nYou know it's hard to look at the high school level and understand you could take a snapshot of high school level but when we study districts like a park like Evanston like Brookline mass like Shaker Heights I mean there's dozens and dozens of these kinds of district\nThat tracking that kids experience starts in first second and third grade and what we do in these districts we take hits that might be you know an inch apart in terms of their skills coming in\nAnd we track them early and what we know over and over again for research is that that tracking means that kids are in a higher tax get more they get better and better teaching and so we take his it might even be a niche apart in terms of skills and we and we make that skills gap larger and larger over time and so\nWhen we look at school like a park as Dave said earlier\nThe structures that we have in place around around things like creating these academic tracks um are inevitably going to uh take\nRacial disparities that exist in all our society and and reproduce them in our schools and the ... the troubling thing is that race becomes not only part of how these trucks get created and if you look at the history of the really deep racist history of tracking and general\nRace else becomes the explanation for why it's okay the fact that you can walk into a school today and twenty Eighteen and see that the most advantage educational spaces in school or Ninety percent white and the least advantage educational experience you know there are places in the same exact school are predominantly black\nShould have us all up in arms that the fact that we think that that's okay it's all about our racial mythology\nI I think we also have to ask questions about what defines being educated and bought a good education is and you know I've heard a beep teachers including ... Williams the black or it'd be future and the series lament the fact that as a piece students often just want to be\nGiven the information they need to score well on the test that's what they want they're not really that interested in learning\nBut just the it's a game it's in supporting\nGame I mean in terms of a larger kind of a a as an editor for vacation like no more well read learned\n... some of the some of the most interesting and I think for far reaching", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "24"}
