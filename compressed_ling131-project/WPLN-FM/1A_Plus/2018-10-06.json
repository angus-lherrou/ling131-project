Republicans and made a lot over polls in recent days showing that\nA Republican voter enthusiasm which had been very low a very turned off in this midterm election year has sparked upwards a over the last week you could argue well that's just that the election getting closer and we're not sure how much it has to do with cabinet but but my guess is that you know for different parts of the country\nUh this works entirely differently a politically\nLet me get one more comments on this and then we will keep going of course we'll keep an eye on at the vote should be happening imminently shortly\nWrote on our Facebook page sexual assault aside Kavanaugh was not someone I saw as being even killed and being neutral making political statements during his opening yes he has qualifications on paper to be a justice however his temperament should be assessed\n\n\n\nSupport for NPR I'm from this station and from Boehner with a bonus certified craftsmen program a network of hardwood flooring contractors committed to expertise and customer service contractor low cater and more information or Boehner dot com\nAnd from the Brown University school of professional studies with executive master's degrees for mid career professionals in the fields of business cyber security health care and science and technology leadership brown dot edu slash NPR\nBack now to the friday news roundup with Susan Glasser Eugene Scott and Steve Clemons let's talk a little bit more about that New York times investigation regarding President Trump's finances uh ...

O. X. P. O. P. in the app store and we will share our conversation with the ... coming up next week on one a\nWhile to vote on the Senate floor has just happened were just double checking our numbers are out of what the vote total was again this is one of two votes that's involved in either getting Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court or not today's vote is a procedural vote to end the debate it's technically called cloture\nNext vote would be the vote on whether or not senators would actually choose to put Brett Kavanaugh ... on the U.S Supreme Court\nWe heard just a few minutes ago that Senator Susan Collins Republican of Maine who might be a potential swing vote on this announce that she will side with her fellow Republicans on a critical test vote it's this cloture vote to end the debate\nWe're just double checking our numbers right now want to make sure we have the exact right so total and as soon as we have that we will bring that to you for the moment we should get to one of the Susan ... she is literally leaping out for sure go ahead Susan ...\nWell it looks like we have the votes now from all four of the undecided senators going into at least on this cloture motion and interesting they Lisa Murkowski is the only one\nThat Democrat from West Virginia has voted yes\nJeff Flake has voted yes he's in college it's voted yes now Susan Collins however previously announced she was voting yes on the cloture vote but not\nTo necessarily take that as an indication of her final stance on cabinet because this afternoon at three PM she will announce her final decision so we don't know necessarily what this procedural vote to me but I think it's quite significant\nUh to see the Joe mansion yes vote in particular and Lisa Murkowski no vote if those positions where to hold out in the final vote on Kavanaugh he would be approved\nLooks like there's still some voting going on maybe ... senators who are struggling in and out of the room Steve Clemons once this cloture vote is done with eventually it will be done with what happens then what do we expect between this vote\nIn the next one will you'll have debate on the floor of that goes on they'll bring that debate to a close and they will set a time most likely tomorrow I'm In which they will a vote to confirm or not judge Kavanaugh\nAnd that time it it could be any time during the day or is there like a particular window they had to be any time of day I mean one of the things about\nThis at it as it runs anytime I think one of the interesting things is you have a a senator from Montana\nOr a Steve Gaines whose daughter is being married tomorrow getting married tomorrow and he wants to walk her down the aisle so ushered his vote be absolutely necessary they have to wait for him to get back from Montana so it's one of those life\nUh intrusions into the way of the system runs but my sense is that Mitch McConnell\nIs obsessed with getting this done moving on and getting people out uh campaigning and\nNoting this as a success that they've achieved that's why this is so unusual that feels raced pushed whether it's the FBI investigation which many people have been saying has not been a exhaustive did not go into many corners it's because the clock is ticking for Mitch McConnell and I think he wants to shelve this and get this done as soon as possible\nYeah not one of these votes that you do one of these what you have to do in person there was no app for that so certainly has is a his other life commitments can have a big impact the final vote total fifty one yes forty nine no and indeed as Susan said senators Collins flake and mentioned voted yes to suspend the debate and move on\nLisa Murkowski voted no but it seems like for the most part this was pretty much a party line vote Eugene Scott I don't think that we really expected it to go any other way than being essentially a squeaker right on party lines absolutely I think everything\nJust leading up to this moment suggested that even before the allegations against Kavanaugh became a public and I think uh there's a a ... a larger idea I've added David Brooks tapped them\nOr to today and in his New York times piece about just how part is in the judicial branch has become um we talk often about activists judges um and concern that people on the bench are not making decisions and partially but we haven't seen that be the case for a while now and they simply appears to be a continuation of that I mean if I\nIf I may Joshua one other element on this is that it was interesting to note that Heidi Heitkamp brother tweeted that she has to look at herself every day in the mirror and us chose to vote no even though he thinks it significantly\nIncreases the chances that she will lose her seat Joe Manchin the last time there was a reasonable poll in West Virginia is looking at Seventy percent of West Virginia is likely to vote support the Kavanaugh nomination to the broader side in terms of the tectonics and the parties as they look at trying to take the Senate where the Democrats taking the Senate is\nIs also ... on this that if Manchin were to be a no vote on Kavanaugh I think it it\nLosing that states where there are different there are different issues here one is what what does the future prospects of\nA of the composite of the Senate look like with regards to this and despite the many many personal emotional and deep issues related to the capital nomination itself in this lifetime appointment\nBut many people are looking at Heitkamp is now a in a much more endangered position um and this probably if if Manchin follow through with his position on on the vote tomorrow increases the chances that he will survive a in November Susan\nI Would just I mean I think that that's our view right now a lot if Kavanaugh gets through as I think seems a tiny bit more likely after this ... than it did before because it seems to me that Joe Manchin seems somewhat more likely to vote yes on the nomination than we might have known going into this cloture vote\nThis is Ninety point three WPN National Public radio Ninety One point five W ...

U. dot org with regards to cyber hacking Michael asks with the loss and result in widespread dissemination of the CIA tool kit which allows one to spoof hacking from another country how can cyber bread crumbs lead to certainty that another country is actually guilty\nDavid what do you think well cyber attribution\nIs something that people are getting a lot better at I'm certainly there are lots of ways to make it appear that a cyber attack came from other places when the New York times was attacked by the Chinese and its computer systems uh years ago it looked like the attack was coming from a University in the southern part of the U.S [noise]\nBut the fact of the matter is that a combination of forensic evidence a motive\nPast use so similar tools can get you most of the way most of the time so there are some pretty good ways to go do it\nThe bigger question facing many governments is once they've found this out and perhaps decide one ounce of this happened in these most recent cases than the political pressures on them so what do you do about it\nThat's why the president signed a new set of executive orders and I'm\nIn August we haven't seen them they're all classified that pushes down into the system or the ability for commanders in the U.S to do cyberattacks back without having presidential sign off\nTill now that's been something that the only only the president could authorized the use of nuclear weapons and cyber weapons now it's not entirely clear that only he can authorize the use of cyber weapons in retaliation but you want to make sure you're attribution is pretty good before you strike\nBack you know who to attack yeah great married before we move on\nFrom there first of all that is no small thing that that the U.S military might have the latitude unilaterally to\nShut down a power grid or turn off or you know hydroelectric dam through the Internet\nBut beyond that do we have a sense that certain countries certain organizations are getting a better handle on dealing with cyberattacks to world clearly hasn't figured this out\nIs anyone making progress I think about the EU because I hear so much about Internet regulations from there on a consumer level but on a military level is anyone making progress\nOr not that I'm aware of the U.S I think it's still the world leader and in in terms of the you know advanced Internet abilities and and the threats are pretty clear or Russia or China and North Korea or Iran\nBut a ... figuring out or response in how you want to calibrate that response so it doesn't become this open ended escalation and you don't know the capabilities of your rivals if you respond or you you're entering really uncharted territory Vivian do we get a sense\nOut to to figure out some kind of international response to cyber attacks or is Russia really got the whole world kind of running with us here on\nHonestly what we've seen in the last couple of days of coordination of hum indictments and ... you know raising concerns about um sighing and otherwise obviously there's a lot of discussions that are taking place\nWhere countries our western allies trying to coordinate some kind of effort to counter the threat that that the Russians oppose but at the same time again you have so many ah restrictions on so many um uncertainty as to how to approach the cyber world in general in cyber threats\nAnd as David said the U.S trying to really formulate some sort of attack plan or something to counter to protect our infrastructure so that we don't have um we're not as vulnerable as we've seen ourselves\nIn the past but obviously you know the U. S. is still trying to figure out a way forward I'm having looked at what happened to us in the two thousand and six to election still we're talking about the fact that we are vulnerable in two thousand Eighteen we could be vulnerable on twenty twenty so we haven't actually tried quite figured out how to protect ourselves get alone\nThe world's kind of coordinating on a global scale to do the same it's it's it's not an easy task\nAlthough it's funny kind of a decentralization of the way that we vote that we are so many different kinds of voting systems might you know way kind of how helpful it helps insulated from according\nTo the fact that we've got all these different utility company yeah that you know dark but but the key element here is we've done a better job at discussing internally how we would do counterattacks than we have organizing the world than the sort of digital Geneva Convention what standards of what's on limits and often it\nLet's shift gears and talk about the Nobel Prize is particularly the Nobel Peace prize the winners were announced this morning Dr Denis ... and ... one for their work combating sexual violence as a weapon of war since\nThe announcement from the Nobel Committee said in part quote Dennis ... will quake is to help or who has devoted his life defending these victims not a I'm a rod is the witness who tells the abuses perpetrated against herself and others\nWere rod is an Iraqi woman she was captured and held by Islamic state skates captivity after three months and told to her story in a book called the last girl\nDr ... founded a hospital in eastern Congo that treated thousands of women many of whom are survivors of gang rape Greg my reaches pretty extraordinary people to be winning the prize especially as we've learned more about how sexual violence is being used as a weapon of war and has for quite some time\nYeah really has to two individuals who seem really deserving the the peace prize has been a lot of had a lot of controversy in recent years very politicized\nA couple of people who really been thrust into dangerous situations handle that with with incredible courage and Dr ... up built this hospital in eastern Congo which is in the middle of nowhere are just a very remote region\nTwenty years ago for maternal care there just isn't much health care of that was his intent\nBut as the Congolese civil war metastasize um rape became a huge issue a huge problem the various factions un peacekeepers who are involved in in rape there\nAnd so he became the voice of rape being used as a weapon of war and so he's been at this for Twenty years very prominent a voice but still operating in a very ah\nA dicey region of very deserving winter I mean\nI can really speak for the case of hum ... who I I spend a lot of time in Iraq and two dozen Fifteen sixteen I'm interviewing ZD women who were released from captivity from ISIS and the impact yeah obviously psychologically physically\nAssault and rape as a tool in a war is obviously a huge thing but you have to also remember that these women go back to their\nTried to go back home a lot of their family some them because of cultural sensitivities to such things and so their lives are essentially up ended by their families a lot of times don't take them back home a lot of these women were impregnated I'm as a result of this and had to really know where to go because\nThey were single mothers which in Iraq is is just completely a taboo\nAnd so uh you know it's something that you should raising awareness for that's something really really important you had a lot of people on the ground in Iraq [noise]\nTrying to educate these families that this is not of no fault of the women that they had no say in the matter but\nObviously you know changing cultural perceptions that's it's it's an uphill battle and so this one the other way I'm trying to do that and it's a it's it's worth the the know notoriety that she's getting\nLet's shift gears and talk about China vice president Mike Pence spoke yesterday accusing China of trying to sway American public opinion and undermine the Trump Administration\nTo put it bluntly President Trump's leadership is working in China wants a different American president there can be no doubt China is meddling in America's democracy\nDavid what is vice president Pence mean by meddling what do we know about what China actually is doing well it's it's pretty fascinating because\nHe is appropriating the language of the Russian attacks from on the twenty sixteen election and transferring it over to a different set of activities\nThat the Chinese are are involved in that there's no question that the Chinese have views cyber before in for political purposes but they largely haven't used it here they've used it in Taiwan they've used it in their\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from this station

Administration abandoned the nuclear deal that was negotiated during President Obama's tenure and reimposed sanctions Iran took us to court the international court of justice to argue that the u._s. actions violated the terms of the Nineteen fifty five treaty of ...\nWell the Trump Administration hit back this week secretary of state Mike Pompeo announced on Wednesday that the U.S is ending that treaty\nThis was a decision frankly says thirty nine years overdue\nIn July around brought in Marilyn's case and the international court of justice alleging violations of the treaty of amity or on six to challenge the United states' decision deceased participation in the Iran nuclear deal into reimpose the sanctions were lifted as part of that deal\n... attempt to interfere with the sovereign rights of the United states to take a waffle actions necessary to protect our national security and Iran is abusing the icy Jay for political and propaganda purposes\nThat was secretary of state Mike Pompeo speaking on Wednesday Vivian salami some have said that ending this treaty is largely symbolic or is that so\nYeah it is an unknown and a lot of ways I think in general it's more just stem reinforcing the administration says standing\nEfforts to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and um crackdown on Iran and kind of show that they're not messing around and so I'm basically this was just one more step in that process but as far as any real uh changes on the ground it really doesn't do much it's really just our sponsor\nChew on the international court of justice says ruling that ah that essentially said that sanctions that they re imposing sanctions um we're not fair to Iran\nGreg Myre we step back for just a second what is this treaty of amity [noise] uh I'm sure that was a question if the state department I just had this vision of some low level staff are going through the basement looking treaty\nOr am I think it's really damaged I as I could result think through what we've heard about this the the the big acronym to Jaycee PO way the Iran nuclear deal but\nWhat is this treaty mammoth well in Nineteen fifty three the U.S helped orchestrate that coup in Iran bringing the shah of Iran back to power or if they were us and Iran were buddy buddy at that time and so two years later\nIt's yeah you brought me back to power shirt treaty of amnesty great and they were indeed good friends from fifty three until\nThe Seventy nine revolution this is the shah who was deposed in these lemon revel in the Islamic Revolution of ... Seventy nine so for thirty nine years uh there has been no enmity between us and Iran\nUm this again seems very symbolic I'm just a last little relics that somehow didn't get shredded after the the the revolution that Seventy not\nIt was the last hurrah of Kermit Roosevelt grandson of Theodore Roosevelt CIA operative who almost singlehandedly staged this coup and then they got everybody we put it in ...\nPort Kermit he's getting no respect from the state department these days it was permanent Roosevelt\nI'm taking it I I liked that name for it for a man who had such a place in history permanent Roosevelt and a new or the American David ... is there any real effect in terms of\nThe sanctions the consequences to the U. S. for refusing to lift them if this treaty of am a tea is more sim Bali where might there be more tangible impact\nSo the tangible impact is November when President Trump has said that he will impose the full sanctions on Iran He's given allies warning that this is coming\nAnd those sanctions if he does it as he has pronounce would say to any ... company around the world but particularly European companies\nIf you do business with Iran you're not doing business with the United states and it's an effort to choke off the Iranians\nBy making the big aircraft makers Boeing's ready pulled out the big oil a production equipment makers all get out of Iran and they were doing that what's happening now though is that the ... the Europeans are saying we're going to find a method\nTo buy oil from Iran without clearing it in dollars so that the u._s. can effect that with the sanctions and a number of us went up and met a with the Iranian foreign minister when he was at the un ah last week and he made an argument to sue sue Saturday evening\nThat he believed that this method was going to come together so we're heading toward a conflict between the U.S and its European allies over on\nDo we have a sense I think I feel like the the big issue really Iran's nuclear program and the argument from the other nations who are still signatories to this this deal the Iran nuclear deal\nIs that it's it's not perfect but it's good and that it has done something to impede Iran's ability to develop a nuclear weapon do we have a sense of where we stand in that regard sending the economic stuff aside for a moment just this put us any closer on that path\nOr we still kind of in a holding pattern I mean what is what's that looks like\nThe Europeans as you say they they consistently say that they they don't want to North Korea is I mean this is of course before we became buddy buddy and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Nashville", "day": "06"}
