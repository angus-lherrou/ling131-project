A. M. U. dot org let me get to a few of your comments including some of your commenting about this Elizabeth Warren's story Martin rights do you think Native American voters will vote Republican and support Trump because of this not likely\nAndy writes I relish anything that makes Trump angrier makes him look bad and I was very happy that Warren released this DNA result\nHe showed his immaturity and lack of decorum once again when he simply replied who cares at hearing the story beat him endlessly and bring him out of his whole for all the world to see that's my desire\nAlexander I wonder if you could respond to Andy's comment this idea of beating the president and kind of showing him for what he really is\nI mean that was tried over and over again in the twenty sixteen election and it didn't end up working I think when you engage with Trump in some of the of the arguments that\nSpain has six that's in the past that's what could help Republicans on sort of succeed in the midterms and it's a dangerous strategy for Democrats in twenty twenty I think taking the higher ed still seems to be the bats tactic but we'll see how things play out\nWhat area will just go ahead for like a it's a very dangerous strategy I mean I just want to you know add to what Alexandros saying look this is what happened to two thousand sixteen every time a day when it during the primaries and the Republicans every time Rubio J uh\nYou know Jeb Bush all of them tried to take a Trump on in his you know neck of the woods kind of playing and this dirty dirty water Trump just kind of\nTook him out um and I think it's very dangerous or for Democrats or to try to play in those waters and\nThat's that's meant in many ways why Trump continues to be so powerful particularly in the Republican Party because so many of his own a party members leaders are afraid to take them on because he's so good at this stuff Josh will\nView of the way in which um you know a parochial entity like the New Hampshire Democratic Party is trying to stoke enthusiasm for its base coming up the elections are founded telling the gift so they brought up\nA typically these were the people you know our presidential runs for big fundraisers and big events to rally behind candidates have been you know stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael ... an hour Baldwin and\nThey we haven't yet seen him and typically the more traditional candidates would start arriving in preparation for twenty twenty after the midterms but\nWe've ... the people who've drawn the most attention of the people who have cast themselves as Trump antagonist and\nUh the coffers of the local Democratic Party would tell you that that's been good for them so you know the mid term to appear losers both sort of an all against all on the question of Trump\nAnother politician who at one point was an antagonist of Donald Trump on the campaign trail was Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas He is running for his seat again this week he democratic he debated his Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke\nPeople are pretty closely watching this race because it could help decide which party controls the Senate because the margin of control is so tight\nTed Cruz's ahead in the polls at the moment but as we said the race is still pretty tight in a work came out swinging in the debate he even used President Trump's nickname for Ted Cruz from the twenty sixteen election calling him lying dead at what point at one point Franco or ... what sense do we have of how the candidates came out of that debate\n[noise] um you know I think it's it's this is one of the most fascinating races it's ... it's been the most fascinating race probably a throughout the terms and it's going to continue to be as it goes down to the wire um I mean\nThis was always going to be a long shot a for Beto O'Rourke he tried to come across early on he you know tried not to say too much about a cruise and Trump and you know he but he's been dropping in the polls and he's\nHe's had to take a new tack using this language of lions had um attacking them about saying that Cruz is only for Cruz pointing out how many communities he's visited in Iowa but not in Texas um it's been a major shift in tone for art\nBut it's also been something that clearly he's been uncomfortable with just yesterday during the town hall he said I'm he perhaps went a little bit too far in the heat of the moment and this is not necessarily something that he wants a you know kind of the tone that he wants to take in his campaign\nWhether it'll work uh we'll see but you know there's a lot of hope for better or some some hope is like if he can actually take this tackled that maybe he could be a twenty twenty candidate but that seems like that seems like another ballgame\nI was going to ask you whether or not or what you read was on whether this could work I mean [noise]\nInto whether they rather progressive Democrat like O'Rourke has a chance in a state like Texas who's you know who's governor both senators you'll reliably conservative Republicans does this give us a sense of whether he moved the needle\nI mean broadly it we have to be careful not to over emphasized debates in terms of typically you know not that many voters watch them sometimes undecided voters do but unless there's a major gas\nThey typically don't move the needle that significantly in right now I think the polling average shows that Ted Cruz's up by about seven points which\nOn election day of Texas that's the way it typically does is enough I also think\nAnd under covered aspect of this race is the fact that Texas does straight ticket voting you can go in and mark a box for Republicans\nAnd the strength of the Republican Party over all the strength as Governor Greg Greg Abbott for instance who's running against Ed Ed Democrat that has been pulling in the thirties and seems to be enough to carry Ted Cruz over the finish line even if that are over ark\nHas been able to keep them to single digits\nI just want to make sure we're clear on what you said Alexandra in Texas you can just mark a box of the top of the ... and says Republican and it automatically cows that vote dressed county for all the Republicans on the ticket\nYet you can basically do for every Republican all at once I'm this is the last election that they'll be doing straight ticket voting after that it won't be as easy\nWill fundraising reports from the third quarter of the year we're due this week to the federal election commission they were doing Monday and the results\nLook pretty good for Democrats and house races at least just in terms of the dollars and cents of Democrats are dominating fund raising in house seat races the challengers the Democratic challengers outraged Ninety two Republican incumbents more than sixteen democratic candidates raised more than a million dollars that quarter\nIn the Senate Democrats are also out raising Republicans ... raised thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter Ted Cruz raised just over ten million dollars\nAccording to an analysis by five thirty eight the Democrats ability to outspend in Senate races has not correlated with a bump in the polls as it has in house races also glad to hear from some of you about the president on the campaign trail including in Texas\nKaren tweeted Trump is coming to Houston next Monday to rally for Ted Cruz Monday is also the first day for early voting in Texas\nLet's shift gears and had to Florida where the after effects of hurricane Michael continue to be felt and seen\nThe weather channel reports the death toll at at least thirty five people with fatalities spread from Florida all the way up to Virginia now those death toll figures are bad enough but Franco what's our sense of how the recovery effort is going particularly the effort to find people who've been missing\nYeah there are still people missing there's still people who are trying to pick up their lives um you know I think\nThe town in Mexico beach is not reported given any numbers um of how many people are are missing 'em but there is talk of that it could likely be in the hundreds I mean this was a massive storm I'm Talking about one of the biggest storms\nThe top three or perhaps by some accounts that you know had made landfall that would make it bigger than Katrina\nThis has been a huge effort many people still do not thousands still don't have a phone service um and people are expecting asked film is sewn services restored and more roads are clear it and you're able to get more to people that they're expecting the death toll to continue to rise\nAlexander the other big issue is when people can actually start to rebuild I mean it's it's fascinating and terrifying horrifying at the same time to look at some of the early drained camera pictures from where hurricane Michael came ashore from where it made landfall you can almost tell which homes where\nNot because of homes that were up to codes were there and the homes that weren't were gone and I wonder what points the the ... the rebuilding effort is right now is there any ... is there any expectation on when people could start to rebuild\nAnd I was actually in North Carolina for the previous hurricane there and they were saying you know anywhere from six to twelve to twenty four months people would still be in shelters waiting to rebuild and that was just flooding\nAnd from the alliance for lifetime income a nonprofit composed a financial services organizations working to educate Americans about options for securing protected lifetime income in retirement more at alliance for lifetime income dot org\nBack now to the friday news roundup with Josh Rogers Alexander ... and Frank or don't is still a little bit more time to get in your questions and thoughts about this week's top stories from across the country one at a at W. A. M. U. dot for Josh Rogers let's talk New Hampshire for a little while there are two congressional races underway there are two districts in New Hampshire\nThe race in district one\nWill be historic kind of no matter who wins because either the Democrat Chris Pappas would become the state's first openly gay member of Congress\nHis Republican opponent Eddie Edwards would be the first black house member from New Hampshire tell us a bit more about the first congressional district as I understand that it's it's a swing district that Donald Trump carried in twenty sixteen right\nFreedom\nDeparted from two thousand eight or the GOP winning and midterm years Democrats\nNow held by Carol Shea Porter fairly liberal Democrat who's retiring I'm In ... where do you have people who are running really within the mainstream of their parties are pappas has been serving in various\nOffices for a long time he's in his late thirties he says family owns a very popular restaurant in Manchester often to stop for presidential candidates\nHe um he comes from Manchester which is a town that where the even the Democrats have historically been a little bit more conservative than in other parts of the state particularly on fiscal matters\nUm Eddie Edwards is somebody who has a background in law enforcement he was in the navy he at one time a lead the states uh enforcement division of its liquor commission in New Hampshire we have those big highway liquor stores a liquor is controlled by the state uh I was a fairly big job he of ram enforcement division and he's been a police chief\nUm you know they were pretty much keeping to well within the norm to their party Eddie Edwards is you know embrace Donald Trump the every Giuliani up here campaigning with them\nUm and he's in some ways tried to cast Chris Pappas as you know part of some sort of resistance movement and saying we've obviously she nationally Chris Pappas is\nHardly a radical guy or you know family I'm Ron restaurant a you know worked I worked for Joe Lieberman when he ran for president um and uh this race though is one where the seat can go either way and uh both parties believe they have a shot\nWas also a gubernatorial race underway here the Republican government governor ... new new\nFaces Democrat Molly Kelly she is one of the Fifteen women running for governor across the country which is an unprecedented number\nThe latest fundraising numbers that came out this week showed that Kelly the Democrat has outraged Sununu the incumbent Republican three to one uh ... brand of New York came to conquered on yesterday to help campaign for Kelly\nThey met with employees of the Granite State candy shop and they discussed paid family leave if I'm interested in aware of this issue sits in terms of all the issues New Hampshire voters are considering but here as part of what happened was here ... listen\nIt's going to help families happier now we're going to help people to be more productive at work and so\nIt can win ran everywhere I go in that state I hear about the need for ... family medical leave and how important it is\nFor people to be able to have choices in their life to be able to work hard where they're working but then to be able to spend time with the people they loved that loud when they're needed to know\nThat was Molly Kelly you heard at the end senator Gillibrand was at the beginning tell us a bit more about Mali Kelly is is this paid family leave issue a big one for her based on her political background her personal background will it's\nBeen a huge issue for her whether it is for voters is an interesting test when she's been running pretty much exclusively on this issue [noise] um it's a challenge of somebody covering their traits how many stories one can write about paid family leave my understanding as Democrats\nHave polling suggests that Governor Sununu is vulnerable on this issue he was on the record supporting a paid family leave bill that didn't make it through the legislature in part because he came out against it\nAt the last minute or for fear that a payroll deduction imagine to an income tax which you know it was a real kind of fighting words here in New Hampshire where there's no income tax\nUm you know the Democrats believe this is a need for that works for ... by the end of her background at one point she was a single mother with three kids who work their way through college and that you know ... new new sort of a governor brother of a U.S senator uh\nYou know doesn't understand the the stresses and strains that many working people face and you know it does get a new ...\nUh you know boom times for people the upper income we have budget surpluses and tax collections are up but you know the wage growth for people to lower end of the scale has not been great and\nThis is an issue that for Democrats they feel that it kind of hits a lot of ... and may help mobilize women which are you know he constituent anywhere for particularly here in New Hampshire how close is this governor's race well I'm ... you know Sunni should win you know we have to your terms here no governor has been talks after one term\nUh since two thousand four and part about it had been a century so it's pretty rare that a governor doesn't get a second term apps and being a disaster or a really tanking economy we don't have either of those\nUh here polling indicates news about by about ten and you know you mentioned the fundraising numbers in Mali has outrageous person in three to one in the most recent reporting period he does enter the final stretch of this race with a cash advantage although for an incumbent\nWith a nationally known name he's a pretty bad fundraiser he will freely admit he doesn't like to do it so\nYou know he's only he's got four hundred thousand she's got two hundred thousand you know interest groups will will add to that in terms of advertising but this is a race Democrats feel they\nHave a chance to win if if a blue wave a venture weights and they think that Molly Kelly a bite in her background but it'd be a woman is somebody who perhaps his best engineered to kind of ride away\nSpeaking of nationally known names Frank or don't use I Wonder what your senses of Senator Joe brand making this trip to help Mali Kelly is there is speculation about her future maybe twenty twenty\nThere's a lot of speculation about her future and twenty twenty um I think how much is it kinda resonate as as the big question I mean obviously\nA there's so many names being kicked around ah right now or that you know it I think time will tell but there there's no question that killed rented one of the people that that people aren't talking about and certainly are watching very closely in every move\nOr that she makes 'em is being picked apart um you know analyzed a and looking for it how it could mean and how it could uh what impact that could have on twenty twenty\nLots to discuss with business and the economy this week including the U.S deficit we don't hear much about it these days but it's back in the news because of the Treasury Department revealed this week that the deficit has grown\nLast year it was about six hundred sixty six billion dollars not a significant number there at all six hundred sixty six billion this week the Treasury Department revealed that the deficit has grown to seven hundred Seventy nine billion dollars it's a six year high end projection say it is on track by the end of this decade\nTo hit a trillion dollars the deficit a trillion dollars\nNow Alexander some experts are pointing to the Trump Administration for being responsible for this particularly\nThe tax bill part of the sales pitch for the tax bill for the tax cuts is that by cutting taxes business what kind of unleash more productivity the economy would boom like never before and the resulting largest would more than make up for whatever we lost in tax revenue how's that working out so far\n... well we haven't seen that yet certainly an advantage Republicans are arguing that that's going to take on you know about a decade to even out though at this rate although the economy is booming there's ... there's no way that it can make up for where our deficit is at at this point\nOn it was sort of an open secret in Washington that the real plan that Republicans were kicking around was welfare reform\nUm to to cut down on the deficit and that conversation has started again on Capitol Hill\nI'm that obviously won't move forward until after the midterms but there is conversation about to get you know starting to work on a welfare reform bill that would cut some public benefits um like Medicare that kind of thing um and\nCare to the Republican silence on this issue when they were previously the party of deficits but it's also an opportunity for them politically to push another priority of the Republican Party which again has welfare reform\nYeah I'm Glad she mentioned that because Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell blamed the rising deficit on public assistance programs in an interview with Bloomberg News on Tuesday what's going on with\nThat but it's very disturbing and it's it's ruined by the three big entitlement programs that are very popular Medicare Social security and Medicaid\nThat Seventy percent of what we spend every year the subject we were just discussing the founding of the government\nIs about thirty percent of what we're ... there's been a bipartisan reluctance to tackle entitlement changes because of the popularity of those programs

A. M. U. dot org\nLet's keep going with this investigation and the disappearance possible murder of ...\nCatherine wrote on our Facebook page putting denies Russia had anything to do with the poisoning of the former military officer and his daughter Saudi prince denies any involvement in murder of journalists who criticized him Trump goes along with both anyone else worried about the u._s. abandoning our moral authority Sonia\nWrote on our Facebook page here's what I don't understand a Saudi national was grabbing the Saudi embassy in Istanbul it's been determined that ... was murdered based on recordings hurt by no one but some Turkish government officials who want to remain anonymous\nTurkey has not released the recordings but there have been leaks of what's in Turkey's government is not above repression and this kind of nefarious behavior themselves what exactly are we supposed to do as an uninvolved third party\nBefore I let you respond to that was your boots weeded and uninterested third party hardly ... was a legal permanent us resident with children who are us citizens the usa using interested party even if Trump is not interested in the euro would you respond to that\nAbsolutely I think it's right that were not an uninvolved third party this man was a resident he was not only that he was a columnist for a prominent American newspaper the Washington Post\nAnd let's be honest that a lot of the reason this has gotten so much attention in this country is because the post has rightly put a huge and hot spotlight on it and not let anyone forget about it and you know other newspapers in the United states in world media have picked up on it too and really kept the attention I I was struck\nBy President Trump saying yesterday when he finally acknowledge that yes it appeared this man was murdered that he said this story has captured the world's imagination unfortunately and I thought unfortunately what's unfortunate about it it is the job of the media to demand accountability to seek truth\nAnd our values as America and as we've always been a global leader we try to put ourselves forward as the leader of the free world part of that is about moral values and when we had a very close ally who by the way our military ...\nCampaign in Yemen that has killed so many thousands of civilians and children and is now leading to a huge famine in Yemen how can we say that worrying uninvolved party um you know this is someone who was a resident of our soil and working for one of our companies\nAnd it's absolutely not true when you have an ally who is alleged to have done something like this we have certain forms of leverage that include arms sales and include potential sanctions and many other things\nI Will say though I I'd James I do\nKind of feel worse Sonja is coming from in a way because we've talked about this on this program before the U.S in Saudi Arabia have had a long relationship\nBut we've never tried to exert strong moral or ethical pressure on Saudi Arabia I mean it's a very transactional relationship and so just because one is uninvolved doesn't mean that one is on entangled but I kind of take Sonia point like the U.S\nDoesn't really want to have to spank Saudi Arabia over its actions because there is a tremendous military and economic entanglements so I'm not really sure what the us has the power to do or if it has the moral authority to do it well\nThis is the let me ... me amplify that point Joshua because it's absolutely critical you know someone who's been actually a very good on this as Senator Marco Rubio who made the point I'm paraphrasing here\nThat all the money in the world and all this military contracts in the world would not be enough to buy back our credibility on human rights if we don't stand up against something as fundamental as murdering journalists for their opinions that's an international norm there's a lot of other norms that were broken here but that's a critical one\nI mean the show is called ... for the first amendment ... in our DNA to stand up for a free press around the world and if we don't stand up strongly against that it'll be a very very damaging precedent and as a Senator Rubio said will never be able to buy our credibility back on these issues\nSenator Lindsey Graham made a very similar point he was so angry and he said I've been a huge ally as NBS in Saudi Arabia but I'd never going there again as long as he is in power he's outraged by it so this is a bipartisan issue\nThan have it is worth noting that the Washington Post this week it published\nWhat is believed to be ... final column it's called what the Arab world needs most is free expression it was published in English and in Arabic and he writes about the systemic the systematic dismantling of the free press in much of the Arab world here's one brief quote from that column quote\nThese actions no longer carry the consequences of a backlash from the international community instead these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence as a result Arab governments have been given free rein to continue silencing the media at an increasing rate unquote Hayes what do you think is he right\nI think he is definitely right so\nUh this has been you know one of the longstanding problems with U.S foreign policy in the region\nIs that oftentimes strategic interests have taken of the friends he compared to human rights issues under the Obama administration you had a lot of great words about how he he actually did stand up to Saudi Arabia in word but if not indeed we never halted arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nOr despite the ongoing campaign in Yemen we'd never a threatened to sanction them over a there as you over their funding of jihad us and other extremists in Syria we never have really taken very strong action against Saudi Arabia or any any country\nOr any country in the region for their actions except for Iran who has been fundamentally aligned against the Gulf\n... a Gulf states so I I I completely agree with the sentiment in his column if we haven't been willing to take action\nWe have the fortitude to actually the people in ... that members of Congress actually have the fortitude to actually pass some sort of legislation that or does something if the Trump Administration does not but it seems unlikely given the history of the issue\nSo basically the people who killed ... may get away with is that we may never really know who killed him there may never be any real prosecution because of just the cold hard fact that that the relationship between the U.S and the Saudis is a business relationship\nAnd you you've totally see that when you look at the president's comments that it might have been wrote killers who took out the show and reporting earlier this week that said that the U.S is actively working with the Saudi Government to try and come up with some sort of feasible solution that admits the death of showed you but does not blame Mohammed bin Salman\nA coach or dropped recommend coming out of that because there's there's a point here that's important to make I think the reason compare went over to to Saudi Arabia was to say that look\nUm you have to get out in front of this this is that you cannot sweep to some of the rug I'm absolutely convinced we are going to get to the bottom of this because there's just so much evidence with the Turks now have\nThey've photographed these Fifteen individuals who flew in twelve of which are part of\nThe ... the crown princes security detail or intelligence services I think we're going to get to the bottom of this now I also think there's going to be a fall guy but somewhere just below the crown prince there already are stories that they'd be there to offer up there and tell his intelligence chief\nGeneral Ahmed Asiri as the scapegoat so I I think we will know who did this and I you know I think probably the crown prince will try to ... you know offer up a a senior scapegoat\nBut I I'm I'm pretty convince we're going to figure out what happened here\nWhat we will keep an eye on the story we're glad to get some more of your comments on this for now let's move on to some of the other big stories that make news this week in may have flown under your radar because of all the attention about ... G rightly given the course\nAnd that's the story of how I became I sustain her simple right you can do the same you can support WPN and if you get Fifteen dollars each month you will get a stainless steel thermal bottle that type of bottle that will let everyone know you are a law you'll listener\nYou can put your support by calling six one five seven six zero twenty ten or you can give 'em lined a WPN dot org\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from ... am committed to changing lives through math by building math achievement problem solving and critical thinking skills for thousands of students every day and nine hundred franchise locations not sneezing um dot com slash NPR\nFrom logged me in makers of go to meeting a collaboration meeting platform that comes equipped with features to help people stay focused to get work done and learn more it goes to meeting dot com\nAnd from the listeners to support this NPR station\nBack now to the friday news roundup with James kid field of the center for the study of the presidency in Congress in the ... of the Boston Globe and the Pulitzer center and have brown of buzzfeed do still a little more time to get in some of your questions and thoughts about this week's top stories from around the world one a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nThis week some Americans were probably green with envy and our neighbors to the north\nRight out guy now\nAnd I got out\nThey were celebrating in Montreal this week because on Wednesday Canada legalized recreational marijuana nationwide it's only the second country in the world to do so why was the first in twenty Thirteen\nAndrew tweeted Canada legalizing we'd was like California legalizing we'd both for like a long relationship where you've been dating forever but just now made official\nHays how big a deal is this and do you think this is the start of a Global Trends something that has just kind of been understood for a long time and just hasn't been made official\nYet you know that's a great question because I'm not really sure I mean I think that when you look at the way that the criminalizing drugs has gone in places like Portugal\nThan at you compare that to\nThings like the un officer drugs and crime still is very hard on marijuana and claims that it you know marijuana is this evil so it's really tough to tell where the global feeling is on we legalization if I'm your words you bring it up say at a meeting in the European Union's\nOf European Parliament then I'm guessing you still would not have ... nearly a majority of people in favor it even in a place like the USO Canada I don't know it really depends on how it goes in terms of the government controlling the access to marijuana which he did is doing now compared to you know it being a private business\nOr that private but illegal business among many small dealers\nOr it depends on how it affects the global drug trade and whether\nUh there's going to be any sort of shift and you know that I'm sure that can is going to be putting unlike the U.S a lot of funding into studying the effects of this new policy whether caused the surge in traffic accidents where the cost of search tops realization or medical affects so it can be really interesting ten years down the line to see what has happened in Canada\nThe CBC out of Ottawa has a story about how police there are increasing some of their a surveillance efforts for intoxicated drivers to make sure the more drivers aren't driving stone it is of course worth noting that in this country marijuana is considered the\nMost illegal level of illegal drugs they schedule one narcotic it's right up there\n... and ... the drugs that are deemed to have new currently accepted medical use and the high potential for abuse there was a conference call this week with Todd ... who was an official with US Customs and border patrol here's how he answered one question from a reporter\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint had smoked in the past\nYes admission of illegal drug use our arms around you found in the midst of all and the United states so yes that's possible\nThat's taught or one of US Customs and border patrol Indira give us a sense of what this might mean for the relationship between the U.S and Canada along the border\nWell it's one more complication when you know border issues have been one of the primary issues of the Trump presidency they already had a very difficult negotiation and doing this NAFTA to point out which in the end turned out to just take elements from the Trans Pacific partnership which was this updated trade deal\nThat the Obama administration negotiated that the Trump Administration pulled out of and then sort of pulled the TPP things packed the mind to NAFTA and set it snapped a to point out but it hasn't been easy there have been so many strains between the United states and Canada\nAnd you know that people are saying that essentially this is a potential marijuana mass right now I'm so I think this could be an issue because we certainly did not have legalized marijuana across the United states it's only on a state by state basis\nI Wonder also James what other kind of unintended consequences there might be for this I mean\nJustin Trudeau now has to kind of owned is whether it's seen as a good move\nOr a negative moved there remains the question as to what legalization at a national level might meet for Canada on top of that there are early reports that suggested supplies are running low because candidates takes time to cultivate the point of being syllable and there are long lines around the block and things are running out supplies are running out\nI Wonder what kinds of additional unintended consequences we might keep an eye out for a\nWhile you know the Canadian Medical Association journal called this a an uncontrolled experiment so we're going to we're going to find out a lot of things about this but I must admit that I'm not\nThat surprise when you can walk into the major states the United states like Colorado or California and mirrors dispensaries for recreational marijuana everywhere I I think this is a trend that's happening\nAll over the United states and it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna keep going because people are going to realize that there's a lot of money to be made when you tax marijuana\nA and they use has happened in any way and putting these people in jail is probably not the best use of public funds so I I see it as part of the continuum I think it was kind of inevitable that are progressive neighbors to the north we're probably going to get a jump on this on this\nBut um you know I I just been struck by going around the country and see in states where this is already happening and everyone kind of shrugs it's not a big deal\nYeah this doesn't seem James to have the kind of energy I mean it's not like to fly to love against prohibition you know where it was considered this major like\nIts issue about liberty and of course it help spur the rise of organized crime if you've never seen the Ken burns documentary what are you waiting for go see it this feels very much like something that was just kind of a matter of time like if they legalize it was going to happen sooner or later\nThat's my sense too yeah that is the trend is pretty clear in this country and and Canada Cain has had medical marijuana says two thousand and one it's very popular so too does not out on a limb by endorsing the so I I think it's a it's kind of inevitable\nYeah not one of the loudest most aggressive social movements with regards to the legalization of cannabis a much more impactful movement that has reverberated around the world is the me too movement and we should talk about that before our time is up this week M. J. Akbar who's the minister of state for external affairs in India\nLeft that post after more than a dozen women accused him of sexual assault\nThere were protests and violence meant by that but any woman trying to enter the ... temple in ... state in India groups of conservative Hindu men threw stones and attacked women and journalist who tried to get too close let's start\nWith this story involving energy Akbar Hays how have we seen the me too movement play out\nIn India or is this just kind of the beginning of its effect on men in power\nI think so it's it's interesting because the me too movement really kicked off here in the United states a year ago and for a while or I Know that our reporters at least we're watching Indian waiting and wondering when is it going to affect this culture where\nUh we were so sure that it would finally have an impact and now a in recent weeks it has finally like grab the country and shaking it\nUh we Steve is all started with one actress a one Bollywood actress coming forward and just it's been a tidal wave of accusations sense than women taking to Twitter and being unafraid to name their alleged abuse abusers and us altered by name\nAnd just being really willing to step out and do what the Indian courts haven't done before which is\nTry to bring these men into account\nAnd um it's it's really interesting that ... one of the first to go considering um he had such a long run in the Indian journalism seeing ... and\nUh the most of the women who came forward about him were fellow journalists were fellow reporters so I feel like that in a bit of credence to these allegations and we'll see whether in the future they are the the women who are I guess lower down on in social status will finally start to be believed as well\nWith regards to that protest of the ... temple and Carol estate the BBC's dreams Clinton was they're asking people why they were protesting here's what one man said\nNo no no no no no no no not yet in the media and it turns out and making them they don't really want to do the story goes up underneath religion that's the only thing these\nSome of what the BBC's dreams Clinton was told in Carol estate outside the ... temple there in there I Wonder what your sense is of this protest particularly what the gentleman said it made it sound as if there's this external pressure from the media and politician he wants to destroy our culture they want to destroy our religion he says", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Nashville", "day": "20"}
