the FBI has submitted the results of its limited investigation into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh the report came in late last night we're told hours after that Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell filed a motion\nFor friday's vote on Brett Kavanaugh's Kavanaugh's nomination on the Senate floor the final vote on whether it confirmed him\nIs expected to happen Saturday joining me to discuss the report and its potential fallout is NPR Justice Department reporter Ryan Lucas Ryan welcome thank you so we have this report or will the Senate has the report now or do we that people had any idea what he's actually contained within the four corners\nWell we don't have any sort of specific snow and this is certainly something that is confidential and not a something that is generally released to the public and there are no plans at this point according to the Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley for any of this to be made public a despite clearly a\nA fair amount of interest among Democrats to make this public and certainly I think among the Trump a chunk of the American public to to learn what's in there or what we do know is that publicly at least\nA six people have confirmed that they spoke to the FBI many of them are people who are friends of a judge Kavanaugh's during high school that would be mark judge PJ Smith Tim ... and Chris Garrett\nOr as well as one friend of a forwards that Leland Kaiser who all confirmed that they spoke to the FBI and then there's a second woman who made allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh and that's Deborah Ramirez and we know that she also spoke to the FBI now a NPR has learned um that\nUh nine people according to a to a an official nine people spoke with the the FBI in total\nUm but again a lot of this is one that you know we don't know what all the FBI was told in this uh and likely we're not going to get a full picture but what we do have so far as what a chairman Grassley has said and that is that there's nothing in there that the committee and the public of this one didn't already\nKnow so where is the report right now physically I mean how our senators looking at it because it's extremely sensitive every reporter in Washington wants to get a look at it in in every political operative does too well\nUh the process for this is governed by a memorandum of understanding that uh

to become one of the world's top economies by twenty fifty\nWords that Russia India and China wreck for short\nThese countries lay down and our second annual summit joining me now to talk about the\nOlympics the world cup one of the most exciting emerging markets in the world to Brazil was once heralded as Latin America's crown jewel\nBut then it was hit with a one two punch of a massive corruption scandal and a stunning economic collapse now unemployment in Brazil is at Thirteen percent the country has sixty thousand homicides per year on average and its current president boasts of an approval rating\nOf just three percent all of that as a backdrop to Brazil upcoming presidential elections far right populist ... he's facing off against the leftist his rival Fernando had died on Sunday and the lead up to the election has already been packed with drama including balls and arrows near fatal stabbing last month\nAnd we're here to talk about what the election means for Brazil and how what happens in Brazil will reverberate across both America's\nMonica to bowl is he or she is senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics\nShe's also director of Latin American studies at Johns Hopkins university\nAnd she she's here with me in the studio Monica thanks for being here thank you for having me Brian winter is editor in chief of America's quarterly and the vice president for policy at the American society and the counsel of the Americas he joined us over Skype from Sao paulo in Brazil Brian thanks for being here\nHello Todd happy to be with you good to talk to you and ... is director of their Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center he's also with us here in Studio ... thanks to you for being here Blatter to be\nA well Brian you're the one in Sao paolo so let me give you on her ... year to start a let's start with the nitty gritty who is ... and our most Americans might not be familiar with him\nAnd it's a ... a retired army captain who has been in Congress for nearly three decades\nNow um but despite having sat in Congress ...\nFirst so much time and he he shows open loading for ah for the legislative body I mean he has said over the years numerous times that the Congress is dysfunctional and it should be closed um he's also advocated torture of his political or of leftists and\nAnd other political opponents 'em and you know that message for a long time was was regarded as marginalized here I mean he was not a popular figure but in the last couple\nOf years because of this historic economic crisis that you mention that those messages um are resonating\nA lot more with people when they did in the past and now here we are with this presidential election coming up on Sunday and he has a ten point lead an old over his nearest rival it looks like there will be a runoff vote which would be on October twenty eighth\nAnd that one is that one's a close call right now between him and and the guy who's likely to face with this Fernando had died\nBut it's it's just so strange for me to be here because I Lived in Brazil for five years and if it was not that long ago I was here from twenty ten to twenty Fifteen\nAnd this seemed like just such a strong democracy it seemed like a place that had come so far since the period of last military rule from Nineteen sixty four in Nineteen eighty five\nBut being here this week and talking to people I mean I there's a lot of people who are ready to vote for both in our all even if it does mean a return to you know the more authoritarian ways of the past year\nSome people just both real uh Brian we're going to work on your sky blind a little bit uh we'll we'll get that cleaned up and will definitely come back to Monica what about Fernando had died in in contrast he's not as fiery as ... of course both now has been described by some as Trump being or maybe more\nGuns around and say that drug dealers should be shot or threatens to summer summarily execute them what about his opponent front for of Fernando ... what do we know about him\nSo what we know about him um is that he's not a ... organic member of the Workers Party the P. T. um he's someone who sort of an outsider when you look at the composition of the ... the far left so\nHe's not he's a moderate um but the leadership of the Workers Party of the PTA currently is very radicalized so it's very different\nFrom the time when former president Lula was in government for example from twenty three I'm twenty ten when the party really did take the ... center left and so the party at south now is very much hard left um the candidate though is that\nUm that being said that the real big problem in Brazil at the moment is that\nThere is a lot a lot of anti PT anti worker party sentiment so\nA lot of the vote that has been migrating too far right extremist both so narrow um is this anti P. T. vote so these elections are very strange because they had become elections about not who\nNecessarily voters actually went to see as president but about who voters do not see a friend\nThat we're going to talk about corruption we're going to talk about graft we're going to talk about a failing economy because all of those things play and I think to\nThe idea that voters know who they don't want they don't want the people who were taking billions of dollars in bribes which has been a major problem we're gonna talk all about that Apollo let me turn to you what about turnout in this election Brazil has compulsory voting I don't know if that means that they get to a hundred percent but people do\nCome out to the polls what's the mood like among Brazilians are they excited to to sweep out the corrupt dirty politicians and get both in our in there or are they beaten down in in weary\nI think they're more weary than a decisive in terms of going there and changing things or the electorate is very divided normally the eighty percent of the voters show up\nOr we may have less of a proportion this time\nA one important feature here is how many voters will spoil their their vote will leave it blank were canceled a vote because that is important whoever gets a fifty percent of the salad votes is elected president\nThere is an outside chance that that could happen this Sunday\nWith ... when the more like the according to the late ... is that we go to a runoff\nBut the mood before and with people are frustrated people feel betrayed by the political class in Brazil or regardless if they are the less from the left from derived from the center people feel absolutely the fed up with politics with politicians\nAnd there is no alternative because there's not going to be admitted very cool and Brazil and we're going to find our way through politics\nNow Brian I think we have your sky blind nice and clean now I'm ... has a history of violent rhetoric he's been photographed waving machine guns around as I mentioned he he likes to fantasize about his opponents or for drug dealers receives\nBeing shot but there's been some actual violence in this campaign last month general phenomena was actually stabbed at a campaign rally or what happened there and what's happened since how has it affected his standing among voters in Brazil in a way\nA political violence at that level and I was personally awful for for both in our own he he almost\nDied by his own account and and those are the doctors that treated him\nPolitically I think it's fair to say that it was helpful\n\n\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the financial services firm of Raymond James offering personalized wealth management advice in banking and capital markets expertise

climate in Brazil heading up to this weekend's presidential election what's happening in Brazil might seem familiar to Americans in the wake of the twenty sixteen us presidential elections my guests are Monica to both senior fellow at the Peterson\nIs the editor in chief of America's quarterly and the vice president for policy at the American society and the council the ... of the Americas\nAnd Paolo ... is director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center and you had been sending us your messages wanting listeners\nDrew emails I was in northwest Brazil last month staying with a gay black friend he is all in for ... and our people are so fed up after the carwash scandal\nThey will go for anything that isn't part of the Workers Party\nNow Monica before the break you were telling us about car wash the actual car wash and the broad offensive corruption scandal or is it over ... have have all of the [noise] I don't want to mix metaphors but I'm older will have all the cars been overturned it opened up and cleaned out in a car wash\nWell it is winding down um so the bulk of it has already has already occurred but let me go back in time just a little bit because it is important to put into context you'd think\nThe most important um findings have love as you had to or of car wash worrying twenty Fifteen and twenty sixteen\nAnd at that time I'm president Dilma Rousseff of the Workers Party was Brazil's leader she had been reelected in twenty fourteen and she was president at the time\nUm she was impeached in twenty sixteen and part of the reason for her impeachment there are many moving parts here but one of the moving parts was the fact that a she had lost control of hook up her coalition and her her coalition had\nUm a number of other political parties that war implicated in the car wash findings in the car wash probing the plea bargains 'em and everything else that started to come out publicly in terms of this particular investigation\nShe was ... she ... she never did anything to actually stop the investigation which was really a positive thing um but that was one of the things that actually lead to her downfall because\nThe the impeachment that\nShe suffered was really very much politically motivated by the need that some of these political parties in her coalition had\nTo try to at least slow ... if not stop it all together and this is a very important element when we look at the degree of polarization that currently exists in Brazil\nBecause the people who still defend the workers' party instilled defend the P. T.\nThey go back to the impeachment of Ruth that as one major argument for why you know things that the Workers Party has been let's say\nUnfairly treated and the way that the that that things have gone down\nMatt writes to us or on email I had a Brazilian friend years back who called his home country\nThe greatest country that never was meaning to Brazil has had such riches in terms of natural resources but it is not had the government or the leadership to make it a competitor with the United states of Paolo Matt makes a good point Brazil was\nCelebrated as the rising star not only of Latin America of emerging economies around the world compared to India and China we mentioned it at the top\nBut now horrible recession horrible corruption what happened in Brazil where was the Brazil that that hosted the Olympics and was and was on the way up\nRocks and Brazil believe too much and the magic that it's a country predestined to be great and forgot to do the necessary things you do in order to build that country or one of the major ... size of the workers are too far to the was led\nBy a man born in poverty uh that uh\n... own initially ethics in politics\nThere is this sense after Brazil\nA ... a a basic ... riding a wonderful wave in international economics major producer of commodities had the wonderful moment poverty was reduced and that is what led to this impression that Brazil was unstoppable well\nA than reality hits\nA ruler made a very bad choice in his successor a and a a lot of a shot to Cain\nAnd the magic would disappear or what we have today is a consequence and this is what I think what they should be positive and all of this we cannot blame others for our problems\nThis crisis was produced in Brazil by Brazilians are and another thing that just pull things should be a positive\nIs the fact that the state in Brazil he's basically broke\nAnd we have run off the money ah all that green now has to be has ended and the nightmare has to be confronted from a ... reality ... basis where the government has run all the money we have to adjust the economy the measures necessary to do this are very\nOff an unpopular and none of the candidates have explain exactly what the how they plan to come from the\n... now Bryan winter you're with us from Brazil or I read an article Brian date you recently wrote\nWhere you were asked by a friend I think to sum up Brazil in two sentences and I'm going to paraphrase a little bit your answer ultimately your conclusion was too many BS privileges for the elite not enough good leaders what exactly did you mean by that tourists conclusion well if\nYou look around right now at the field of candidates there's there's one thing that all Brazilians agree on which is that they find the candidates running for president to be an inspiring um the vast majority of people here as we've said during the program\nFeel like they're voting against somebody rather than voting for somebody and the consequences of that\nIs is just I mean it's it's stunning for somebody who lived here during that era when things were going really well which you've mentioned touch the degree of cynicism the degree of disbelief that people have in our system of government is just amazing and you know it's part of a global trend I mean we've seen\nThis happen in places like turkey in Hungary and elsewhere around the world\nBut this democratic recession as some people have called it really is especially strong here and that makes sense because Brazil is taking a bigger beating um in terms of its economy and in terms of the reputation of its politicians because of this\nCorruption scandal than virtually any other western democracy in recent years there was a poll by the\nPew Research center and twenty Seventy and it found that just eight percent of Brazilians say representative democracy is a very good form of government that was the lowest of thirty eight countries that that that you surveyed\n... and that just shows you the climate here right now and the reason why many people fear that both denaro if elected would basically have carte blanche to take a and you know hard right turn it could involve the curtail not of civil civil liberties and and\nOther things I I and my time and this week um I've had meetings with people from civil society and the press and others who you know these are serious people not prone to panic or anything like that who are talking openly about the possibility of exile and this just blew me away I mean it it's a Brazil that I've read about\nMilitary rule Nineteen sixty four was the last two I thought that was real results that had been firmly relegated to history books and\nYou know maybe maybe maybe they are maybe it is getting a little\nBit melodramatic in some quarters but but they're real fears and and and people are scared right now well\nBrian you mentioned a statistic that was disturbing only eight percent of Brazilian say their representative democracy is the best form of government and now I'm In right to the point is ... emails us\nWhy are we so concerned about the right versus the left in Brazil both in our is another ...

and he was red faced and he was furious on behalf of\nBrett Kavanaugh and presumably white men everywhere but contrast that with the Lindsey Graham of twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen and even twenty twelve hears Lindsey Graham at a roast dinner in twenty Seventeen poking fun at Paul Ryan speaker of the house but making a point\nForty six years older than the vice presidential nominee of the Republican Party here the speaker of the house\nThe Republican controlled house you're smart you know the budget that we're in for you have a good temperament and disposition and the judgment of Solomon you are dead men walking [noise]\nIn twenty twelve Lindsey Graham the same Lindsey Graham used to warn about the future of the Republican Party he would quit to me at any reporter who would listen we can't make angry white guys fast enough\nTo survive as a Republican Party in the future meaning Republicans at your broaden their appeal to women to minorities to Hispanics\nFlash forward to the Lindsey Graham of this week I'm a white male and I'm not gonna take it anymore stunning what does this transformation Lindsey Graham ... in the Trump ear SAT you about where we were in in in where we are\nI mean it it tells me that the divide is deepening and you know did tells me that the the lines that were kind of drawn to you that you saw in the two thousand election they say that we've lived with sense\nThey're only going deeper and the moment you talked about there and twenty twelve after twenty twelve election\nThere was as you remember that certainly the the Republican sort of um establishment nationally looked at the Mitt Romney's last to block Obama included what you know what Lindsey Graham did it demographically the way the country had been divided up for the last Fifteen or Twenty years was not going to work for them long term\nThey came up with that autopsy report they were going to change on immigration all this stuff\nDonald Trump comes along and violates every tenet of this of this autopsy and wins\nAnd I think it it's not just that he won the general election unless a huge part of it but the fact that he was able to sweep through the Republican Party like other primaries like he didn't twenty sixteen\nTold Republicans like Lindsey Graham and of course easy to forget but Lindsey Graham did run for president in twenty sixteen one of the sixteen or Seventeen Republicans who did and failed miserably and I think that's what I think that lesson there of going head to head against Trump\nOf dismissing him completely at the beginning of that race Graham called him a kooky called him a bunch of things\nUm in twenty sixteen and then watching how within the Republican world how Trump resonated with their voters it told and boy there's something about our own voters our own party our own tribe\nThat we didn't quite understand maybe we didn't want to understand ... granted more than just name calling in a primary he told Republicans we are finished if we nominate Donald Trump that he is the death knell of this party\nSo what is Lindsey Graham thinking now is he thinking I have to win a Republican primary in twenty twenty in South Carolina where Donald Trump is popular so I'd better get on the Trump train and that's all there is to it the last\nThe last gasp of the Republican Party and I'm going to be a senator from one more term or is he is he converted what's he think I mean look there's then there's all sorts of theories about this and I don't know but I'll give you a couple of them that that that that jumped out at me one is what you're saying yeah he's got to worry about a Republican primary every Republican one of the lessons\nOf Donald Trump's rise and his enduring popularity with Republican voters one of the lessons\nTo Republican officeholders as you are taking a major major risk\nIf you are seen as separating yourself from this president your next primary especially if you're a Lindsey Graham and you already have a history of sort of being\nA being antagonistic towards the right here and they're so grim has to worry about that there's also this theory that hey part of this is Lindsey Graham trying to play the influence game if you if you're you know friendly to Trump in public if you sing his praises uh if you change your tone on Trump the way he as if you're a golf with him\nMaybe if you're Lindsey Graham and you have some issues particularly on foreign policy and national security this is a way to influence them but I think one of the other lessons is to is it is again\nLindsey Graham looking at Trump in twenty sixteen and saying this is absolute political suicide for the Republican Party to go down this road\nAnd then seeing Donald Trump win the election I Know it was narrow but seeing the one I think tells Lindsey Graham and just brought more broadly tells Republicans\nThat this tribalism is so much deeper than we realized it was\nAnd it changes what you're able to do and what you can do politically Kennett last is the question given the demographics of this country Lindsey Graham I'll remind you one last time said himself over and over we can't make angry white guys fast enough we can't manufacture them fast enough to be a party if you\nUh that night whether he's changed his mind about that or not\nJames sent us an email I frequently have yard signs for political candidates in my front yard and because there are good candidates on both sides of the aisle I usually have candidates from both major parties and I am surprised at how often several of my neighbors express their genuine irritation with me\nThat I can endorse candidates from both parties very tribal instead of an evaluation on the merits and in Steve you're not him because that does not sound surprising to you yeah well\nWhat he's describing his ticket splitting yet to be in political science they those voters who go and they\nWere Democrat for president Republican for Congress they split up the ballot just election two election that that the number of people out there who do that who split their ticket has been shrinking shrinking and you're looking at single digits right now and that that is just the rise of polarization the tribal is All right let's get\nBack in our way way back machine are red and blue way way back machine go back in history with you Steve corn ... so much of what your book is about uh we talked about the speaker of the house Newt Gingrich who are on led to believe did not talk to you for this book although although he certainly could have a when he was a young rabble rousing congressmen\nWho was willing to defy the normal rules of congressional decorum in May of Nineteen eighty four he delivered an insult on the floor of the house to then time speaker from Massachusetts the legendary Tip O'Neill\nMy partner speaker as you point out to us again yesterday are in charge of this house\nIf you are saying to me the urine postmaster isn't capable of delivering from one member to another the male and the system you run\nThen I think you may want to appoint a commission to look into the post office\nNow maybe of veiled insult there that might take a little bit of parsing but give it a back story and why Newt Gingrich was slinging an insult at a well respected and legendary Tip O'Neill\n[noise]\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from ... and from Rhodes

update for you\nThe top Republican on the Senate Judiciary committee says the FBI has turned up nothing to corroborate allegations that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was involved in sexual assault in high school and another instance of sexual misconduct in college there is nothing in it that we didn't already know said Senator Chuck Grassley adding\nThere's also no contemporaneous

was Chuck Grassley chairman of the Judiciary Committee I was quoting their\nRanking member on the Senate Judiciary committee Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California disagrees she says it looks to be

back to Steve ... in just a moment but before we do a quick appeal for some help with the program in the works for next week here on one day we spend a lot of time yesterday talking with women about

want the country to hear about you tell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a that's eight five five to three six one two one two will make sure to get your stories on the air part of the national conversation in the days ahead\nHere on one day while we're talking for the most part about what politician said and did in the Nineteen Ninety so how do they define their ideologies for the American people it's not just Washington that's polarized we've been asking listeners\nFor memorable moments from politics in the nineties and here's one\nAnd the president is right\nIn many ways we are a shining city on it\nBut the hard truth is that not everyone is sharing in this city's splendor and glory\nThere is this fair Mr President\nAnd the faces that you don't see in the places that you don't visit\nYour shining city\nGovernor of New York maybe at the peak of his political career the shining city on the hill well here's what I was going for another moment to moment that listeners sent us from ... the early nineties I take you back towards any overhaul\n[noise]\n\nYou're going to be president President Bill Clinton June Nineteen Ninety two on the Arsenio Hall show remember him for five years before that year presidential\nCandidates didn't really appear on nighttime talk shows at all so that was something new talk about how politicians grappled with media coverage during those years a Steve that was a moment not just because of the president appeared on Arsenio Hall but he seemed to offer an alternative\nTo gosh even Pat Buchanan speech there is a religious war in this country very stark very serious and and a lot of Americans agreed with him here was Bill Clinton in sunglasses just having a whole lot of fun the guy you want at the party it was also the moment\nThat was June Nineteen Ninety two when Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall show Bill Clinton was actually running\nNot in first or second in third place in the presidential race at that point versus Ross Perot [laughter] begging place was Bush the incoming president in third place buried\nI was about twenty five percent was Bill Clinton instead they were his team he remembered that Bill Clinton who emerged from the Democratic primaries in Ninety two had was thought to be an electable he'd gone through the scandal about Gennifer Flowers he'd gone through the scandal about avoiding the Vietnam draft he'd gone through the I didn't inhale moment that sort of hard in this image of\nSlick willy the guy who's going to you know lawyer early tried scheme is way out of\nA out of everything and so they were trying his campaign was to change his image and he had this you know obviously winning personality and they wanted to showcase it and they wanted to get around\nInterviews with you know traditional news interviews where every question was going to be about gender flowers in the draft and all that so here was a way you go on a syndicated nighttime talk show like Arsenio Hall\nWhich was very hot at that moment you're showcase a different side of your personality\nAnd it was Ninety two it wasn't just starts anew Ninety two was the year\nThe media had been expanding in so many ways in that media expansion really met up with politics presidential politics I mentioned Perot\nWho was running in first place at that point the entire Perot phenomenon began in February Ninety two on the CNN show Larry King Larry King and and Larry King would sometimes have politicians on and sometimes aging celebrities and they'd spend an hour and they take calls\nAnd Ross Perot was on in February Ninety two and he said you know if the if there are volunteers out there who will put me on the ballot in all fifty states I'll run for president as an independent\nIn just from that\nA movement sprung up organically across the country to do in Texas about two months later volunteers submitted two hundred and fifty four thousand signatures to get Ross Perot on the ballot and he was running in first place by June and he was doing talk shows\nClinton was doing talk shows there was a Clinton Jerry Brown primary debate on the Phil Donahue show the syndicated daytime talk show 'em in in George W. Bush this was a generational aspect to sixty eight year old George W. Bush the president running for reelection his spokesman said after Bill Clinton did the ... or send you a whole show that night well\nWe won't be doing anything like that\nAnd Arsenio Hall went on his show the next night and just tore into Bush that when we went after it was beneath the presidency yeah it was beneath the presidency to go on a nighttime talk show where people goof around and make a you know goof adolescent jokes that's not\nThat's not for a president and and Bill Clinton said Oh yes Oh yes it is said and by the end of the campaign that Bush wasn't do in our city oh by the end of the campaign but he was doing you know morning shows on TV in ... he was starting to sort of get the message um\nVery very different way now going on a late night talk show is par for the course because people want you to display your personality of Iraq Obama had a winning personality an affable nice guy and used it to great political effect everywhere from Jimmy Fallon just even cold there there isn't a show that Iraq Obama didn't go on successfully\nUm Donald Trump in his campaign did the same as well because he's extremely comfortable on live television even if somehow less likeable than\nThan maybe Barack Obama was but but the mores of how you reach the public has changed just radically they changed completely since the moment when George W. Bush said we're not going to lower the presidency by going on or send your home\nAnd I think too you can you can draw a line between we were talking about Gingrich earlier\nAnd the rise of Gingrich in that moment with O'Neill what that moment came from was Gingrich looking for a way around at the time where the dominant sort of media platforms and they were just the broadcast networks and Gingrich\nThird term congressman from Georgia said I'm not going to be able to get my message out across ABC CBS NBC because they don't pay attention to me he CSPAN\nGive CSPAN was five years old in the early Nineteen eighties and he used the late night speeches and CSPAN to seek out find and develop a relationship with a new audience draw a line from that and how Gingrich was able to build his career his rise in the house around that fast forward to Donald Trump Donald Trump do\nIt television obviously a part of it but really in the campaign social media Twitter Donald Trump identified through Twitter away to go around\nNot just the news media but the entertainment media as well that's that's so engaged in politics now into directly get his message across to voters to get around it I see what Gingrich was doing in the eighties with C SPAN in Trump was doing with Twitter and then I think there's a real common thread there what\nLet's go back then in the way way back machine one more time\nTo Nineteen Ninety nine Donald Trump was people forget was involved with politics even at the time he flirted mentally and even in reality with presidential runs long before he was ever successful he went on meet the press\nBack in Nineteen Ninety nine and had some thoughts about somebody that we've already talked about Pat Buchanan the insurgent right wing politician in the Republican Party\nFor his ahead little often I guess he's an anti Semite\nHe doesn't like the black sea doesn't like the gays I I I it's just incredible that anybody can embrace this guy and maybe I'll get four or five percent of the vote and it'll be a really staunch ride wacko vote I'm not even sure if it's right it's just a wacko vote and I just can't imagine that anybody can take them seriously\nIs Ninety point three WPN National Public radio Ninety One point five W T announced hello how am I in Ninety One point seven WHM rats come down to\nGet the latest stories from WPN land new throughout the day and connect with National Public radio via Twitter and Facebook WPN land out or\nYou can also find scheduled for all of our program channel and listen to a live stream of any of our programming\nOnline learned more about connecting with Nashville public radio led WPN land dot org\n\nThe black lives matter movement has no central leadership but it does have some big names like ramen cats and how does he see his place in the fight for justice from W.

about the book's title on the other side of freedom what's the title about what are you trying to say they're\nHere you know I used to travel much more around the country talking to young people talking to to older people and what I realize is that we have a deep understanding of decided freedom so we know on this side of freedom\nA third of all the people killed by strangers killed by police officer we know that we're as more people from marijuana than all violent crimes combined we know so much about decided freedom in we have a lot of work to do\nThat I wanted to talk about like how do we get to the other side of freedom what did it look like what does it feel like how do we get there with the strategy in the plane\nBecause I Know that when I think about what freedom is that its course and not only the absence of oppression but the presence of justice enjoy that we can get rid of all the bad things and that doesn't mean that the good things automatically come to bear we have to fight for those\nSo that was where the undecided freedom came from it in the case for hope is that I think the hope is if you will for all of this I Hope is a belief that are tomorrow's can be better than that today's that when people say the system is broken and then in response and people say oh no I was designed to be like this my takeaway is that it was designed because people made it up we can make something better and that is the work\nOf hope there are a lot of questions that our listeners wanted to put to you about the work that you're doing about the black lives matter

one a I'm Joshua Johnson we are speaking to dream of catching the host of the podcast pod saved the people and the author of the new book on the other side of freedom the case for hope\nOne by graphical thing I did want to ask you briefly you right in the book that teaching was the most important thing you ever did how did teaching helped lay the groundwork for activism\nOh you know it's funny I like don't myself is very old but I taught a decade ago my my students do students are like twenty Twenty one now which is so wild uh\nYou know teaching was incredible not only because he was urging everyday like every single day I had to shut because I taught sixth grade math everything when they had to show up and I was math to my students I had to be as prepared as sixteen Ninety a hundred and twenty minute classrooms which is a whole lot of math or anybody who's ever there and eleven year old\nUh what I learned there are a couple of things one was like how to take really complex information and break it down into\nPieces that are can be consumed and can be repeated back so my skill was like what I had to learn with not only how to like get kids to understand like with an equation ones but like I did teach discreet skills like you know when she thinks tattooed sometimes means multiplication right that like\nJust how to take apart these big things to make them bite size and then have students to be able to play with them in a way that they could put them back and rearrange on their on their own\nOr the second was like really understanding what it means to like do work that will have an immediate impact for what happened a long term impacts so I remember I'll never forget\nTeaching negative numbers they struggled they like they can get in like anything lower than zero there like I don't get it by the end they can fight anybody around like how to solve the most complicated equation and they like deeply understood it\nAnd that was an understanding like the arc of how to build capacity um like I learned that the third thing is I think the best teachers with the ... just walk in the classrooms and they know the gift existed long before they got their\n... and that like I work is to help students understand that they can access the gift long after I'm gone after the teacher's gone but the worst teachers do is walk in the classrooms and\nMake people believe that the gift only exists in their presidents and like that is I think in such a corollary to organize you know when I travel anywhere where I'm In my own community and like what I'm trying to do is help people find the gifts that they have because they already have them they might not know they might not believe they might not know how to use them\nAnd that what I can do is help them find them and they use them long after we're gone\nLet's get to some questions about the black lives matter movement Morgan writes black lives matter is purposefully without a central leader so how does he you direct\n... role was in the movement what has he done to ensure that people know the names of the three black women who actually started below him I think Morgan's referring to Patrice ... and Alicia Garza who helps propagate the black lives matter ... after the Trayvon Martin shooting direct\nCertainly they got the movement the movement is an expansive space and I write about this in the book is that ah you know for those of us who are industry in for a gift\nDay to the space there was nobody who started the protests there was no one to three ten people who caught us all to the street who organized everybody was so beautiful about the protests that\nAh it was organic there were a set of people who came out every night thousands who made the protests last and you have to remember\nThat we will see for four hundred days and most people remember as a long weekend which is unfortunate that there's this narrative that if that has come up that as a race so many people that suggested there was like a small group of people who started everything who came in St Louis organized everybody the organizations did that work\nAnd that's just simply not true so when I think about like how I use my platform of how I think about my work\nIs it I'm mindful that I was one of many people in the book I highly so many people who were industry in St Louis who did incredible work for whom without you wouldn't there would be no protests are so that is important to me and then the second part is that I Know that the platform doesn't only exist for me that\nUh one of the important things about having a platform and access is that not only do I try to make sure that the truth is president and everyone but I also know that I'm not the only person that can bring the truth so you don't know the people who said all the protesters every night or the\nThe people who got people out of jail or the people who helped organize some of the biggest actions that people homes have sprayed across the country like you've never heard those names uh and in the book I Try and write about those people to you that I Know dumb because I was there we were in the middle of a street together\nBut this narrative that there's like a small set of people who like started every thing in the movement or that there's a small set of organizations who like\nWith a catalyst for the protest is just not a true narrative\nThere's always this tension with movements that have certain people certain leaders to become more prominence\nWith the concerned about but who profits off to cause I mean there are some who would critique the book and the podcast is a way to profit off of black lives matter how do you respond to that and I also wonder if there is any plan to use any of the proceeds from the book to help to cause\nYes it's interesting I think I'm always ... you know I feel like I live a pretty public life and I'm always shocked um by some of the\nThe way the question gets asked to like it's public that or a portion of all the proceeds went to the end emily's seep in a portion of all the pre order sales went to the N. double ACP legal Defense Fund that was\nPublic I did it 'cause it was important and it was my way of saying that like I Want you to buy the book but the book also like I Want the process of buying the book to also do more work than just buying the book raised to like that's what the book specifically\nBut in general in the face like I'm mindful of ... when we started campaign zero which is like our our biggest project starting twenty Fifteen a we actually didn't participate in the nonprofit funding like the nonprofit sort of research for funding specifically because of the question that you asked\nSo over the past three years we raised a about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars per year which is\nNot a lot of money and the grand scheme of nonprofits and we did it so that we could just raise enough money to do the work that we that was important right so we created the first database of police union contracts at first it public database of use of force policies continue to do a lot of data work that hasn't been done before continue to support organizes around the country and really discreet projects\nNo I I Know paid staff I'm not pay you know I'm a salary from this stuff so we try to do it is like\nWith just the bare necessities so that

I can remember an out of that and it's one of the reasons that I wrote the chapter was that I Know that we walk into every ... bringing much more than we name and one of the things that I bring into the room is what does it mean to be worthy that if she could leave it feels like anybody could leave\nAnd I like that is something I've had that sort of work within an grow with as an adult to make sure that that doesn't hurt me or other people and like that's important as we think about what it means to organize has had like we're all walk into rooms and meeting people where they are part of meeting people where they are as we know where we are and like I think that that has to be like a\nA core part of it uh the the part that you read about like how we remember pain and I remember joy\nIs that for so many people you think about like the constraints would a million people who grow up in marginalized communities where there's poverty race\nOr or any other after today deputy they they learn the constraints really well I Know I knew how much money we had as a family and I knew would pass woman not asked for I knew\nLike when we didn't have to wait how to make fun outside and you know a lot of people talk about growing up poor but I said one of the hard part is like when we grow up and sometimes we still only see a world of constraint semi that can strength to become so great and the way that we've learned how to survive that we can start to imagine things beyond it and if we're ever going to win like it'll be like uh\nAnd Mike eating whether they were seeing the right in the left is it the right has always re packaging old narrative for new time the left we're always engaged in the most intense make believe that like we're always trying to tell a story about a world that nobody's ever seen before but we know it's possible you've never seen health care for all but like you believe it you've never seen a world where every woman has a right to choose but like we believe that that's real\nAnd like telling those stories but actually really hard and there's no way to to be really good storyteller by the future that you've never seen if you aren't able to tell stories about the world that you live and how you into the world\n[noise] you also share fairly late in the book the fact that you are a survivor of sexual assault something that you write happen to you numerous times in a rather young age\nAnd you connect that was what you call the quiet quiet about the salt but also quiet about your own identity and your sexuality you've been out for some time in the book you write in part quote\nI think about the quiet instead of the closet because I've never hidden any part of myself from my self or others you go on to write quote but I grew up quieter about the parts of myself that I didn't think anyone would love\nThe parts that I had never seen loved in others unquote how does that interact with the person you became\nYeah you know one of the reasons either important for me to be out very very um [noise] I mean about for a long time but to be publicly out in a in a very ... way when the protests began with like I didn't want any kid growing up who was also gate to think that the only way to do this or it publicly with to to be in the closet and\nAh you know that chapter started from this tweet that I wrote a long time ago that was like just because you didn't know doesn't mean it was a real like I was in the quiet and not the closet\nAnd ah you know I I Walk into every room as a black man I'm like that is real to me it's important so there was no way for me to write a book about the work that we've done the work to all of us have collected with them and social justice or the work that we need to do without talking about a mile an identity\nThat I wrote about the uh the sexual assault because it was real it's one of the things that I haven't really talked much about I mean it's in the book now so it's not just you know it's not something that only I Know\nUm [noise] but it was like sort of\nIt was free in some ways to finally just they and like not have to tiptoe around it and not be ashamed to say that this happened and and it was real and it was awful and\nYou know when I told when I when I finally taught a couple of years later they realized that he had actually been sexually abusing like a whole set of kids who are even younger than me um to like you know speaking up actually made a difference in other people's lives and like that was important\nUm but I had to like you know I write about in the book is it like my own relationship to my body I had to learn that had to learn what it meant to be in relation with other people and like it'd be one where we were periods and we both have the same amount of power because that wasn't the first experience with my body right as I wanted to just give language to that\nHow far do you think that that outlook is actually goes I mean I I'm Out I've been out from most of my career if not all of my career but I Know that there's you know there's this aspect of what I Believe is referred to as an implied attribute\nWhere it's kind of known but not experience so there's a difference between me saying Oh yes I'm active with the national lesbian and gay journalist association as opposed to me showing up\nYou know a picture of me at a bar with my shirt off making out with a guy in the corner like there's a whole different kind of being out because people\nAre OK knowing it in the abstract but they don't want to know that you're actually like a gay person who does good things and that changes the conception do you find that there's a line in terms of identity versus full identification like okay you know\nLet's not say anything more about this let's not make them think any more about my that even they have to be\nYeah you know like ... I think we have to complicate this idea of like what it means to show up and gave them like this\nAll that like yeah so like sometimes it is the way rainbow shoes right and sometimes it is me just like going on a date and like that and like those are both valid way to jump in and the identity that I Am right\nUh so so yeah there are definitely people who are frustrated me feel like I might not get enough in like\nThat I don't talk about gay issues publicly as possible and like you know it's one of the things too that it's like well how much of my life to our lives to like other people can feel like it's real re felt like I Know that you know we're working with the research right now they're trying to think about HIV testing that like one of the things that some new research suggests that\nIt's not that people and people don't get tested it's not they don't care about their health or that they're necessarily afraid of the results but that ah\nThat they actually nervous about showing up at a facility and in cities that are that function as small towns and they're nervous about seeing somebody they went to high school with seeing like somebody's cause and a friend like that they actually are nervous about like what privacy really be private right and like how do you actually or how do you set up a testing mechanism that gets around that that to me it's fascinating\nAnd like so we don't quite work around that but like I've I don't feel like I Need to talk about that every two seconds for people to be like they're actually cares about being gay right so the other thing I'll say that there's some people who like a really homophobic but like me and that's now for that I don't want to be like a safe spot for your heat\nYou also talk very frankly in the book about your bed for mayor of Baltimore your willingness to meet with President Obama and with the presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders you write that because of your willingness to engage quote\nThere were calls from within the protest community and from without accusing me of political grandstanding and labeling me a sellout unquote I Wonder how you are finding your way forward in these new endeavors whether it's politics hosting a podcast so any way you are part of a media so to speak\nAnd reconciling that was kind of the social justice activism work that you're still ... involved in is that challenging to kind of have a foot in both worlds as it were\nYou know it's like a both and great that like you know it's interesting is that all those people who who commit to offer for quote participating in this system those are the same people running for office today right those are the same people who like\nI tell them everybody to vote who tell people not to vote in twenty sixteen who said that you're wasting your vote who said that politics to matter and like why would you support I remember I support Hillary in Washington Post and people literally they were like you're wasting your employment I Can't believe you did that like president doesn't have any bearing this is just for show and it's like\nThis is Ninety point three WPN land Nashville public radio Ninety One point five W ... in Ninety One point seven W.

watched just about all of that fifth season uh ... let's talk about season five\nRight let's get into it [laughter] getting dirty a big amount of season five is spent poking fun at the idea of the arch Moore show runner himself and there's a light on actually something along the lines of television it's a collaborative medium where one person gets all the credit\nAnd yeah I'd have to say ah when that line came up at the table read it got much bigger laugh when I was expected from the crowd of people\nI mean is it a little surreal to be a show runner on a press tour about a season of your show where one of the characters his show runner who are I'm sure would kill to be unimpressed you were talking about a show a little bit it's it's strange and\nYou know one of the things we wanted to talk about we're putting the season together is this weird moment we're in now of of the tourist show runner which is really like a new development in the last ten years or so\nUm and it it strikes me as very odd because I I don't think that I'm a a a brilliant genius\nWho you know touches a show and turned it into gold and it all just you know flows out of the pencil which is connected to my brain um it's a very collaborative process and we have people\nMaking it better every step of the way I have an amazing writing room the cat\nThey had all the uh directors bring so much to the episodes of the the story board animators the editors um it it it really it takes a village um\nSo it's odd that yes I Am doing all these interviews now talking about the show and talking about how I made the show because it's not have a TV show gets made at all and I think anyone\nWho presents that as how a TV show gets made is trying to sell something\nBut then what exactly does the white board in the writers' room look like when you've got the word played the slapstick puns and the ... falls a overlaid on some of the deep dark themes that runs throughout the season and the show also has a memory yeah on memory his his mistakes for\nHim it's a very I mean in a lot of ways I think we write the show like a drama but we're a room full of comedy writers so we can't help but make it funny\nUm but we really are mostly interested in you know what is the character arc of the season and what are the themes we're looking to explore what are the consequences of these actions we take it very seriously um you know but then in the middle of that we we remember like All right and this guy's talking octopus\nA you know we're we're exploring familial trauma here uh but also this woman is dating or a man that is clearly just a three small boys stacked on top of each other under trench coat like little rascals I'm so this is quite serious ah but the stories themselves can be quite silly you know what one way I think of it\nIs is we're telling stories about real grounded characters in a crazy cartoon universe\nLots of animated shows have gotten made over the last Twenty years thanks to the success of The Simpsons largely but not shows as deep and as adult as Beau jak or who to whom do you think you owe your origins in television ... who do you see is your former [laughter]\nUm oh you mean by influencing yeah or do you mean literally the people who helped me have a television show\nNot I mean the shows that you watch or or even if you weren't that into them to shows that made it possible for a show like Bo jak to be such a hit with American ... well I I think\nYou know the obviously the the the giants as The Simpsons and I would be disingenuous for\nMe to claim that that show had had no influence on me or my show or the success of my show you know one at one of the best comments I got on the the first season a bow jak if someone said it felt like a season long version of a sad episode of The Simpsons um but also when I was pitching the show I I really wanted it to exist\nOutside of the the bubble um\nOr the perceived bottle of animated TV you know I I said ah we're going to ... when we start season one you're gonna watch it and at first it's going to feel like a typical animated show like a a Simpsons or South Park but then over the course of the season as you realize what's happening is going to feel more like a girls or even a Mad Men\nUm and and so I I wanted this to feel more like a drama the um and to really take things seriously a in a way that people don't expect the animation too even though I think a lot of animated shows actually do take things very seriously\nUm but but but those shows were certainly influences as well\nAt one of the main attractions of your show for me are the amazing voice performances that you have oh yeah well our net as Beau jak and he said they are credible artist Carolyn the sort of aging Hollywood manager producer cat\nAh and and then a lot of others to you have a Keith Olbermann in there at some yeah I'm ... one of the first people we cast [laughter]\nAnd I was cast her whale\nA newscaster well uh we we had in the script to um you know a a Keith Olbermann whale type and are casting director Linda ... said I think we can get Keith Olbermann the play\nLike fun um and he's fantastic we keep bringing it back season after season\nAnd you know what am I a first memories of making the show and realizing how fun it was going to be was we had Keith on the phone from New York and we had him do all his lines um and then at the end we said we also get you making some whale noises and you know this is Keith Olbermann who I was a very serious man uh goofing around going\nYou know making whale noises and I thought this would be a fun show I think [laughter] well\nOne of your other main characters is Diane a Vietnamese American voiced by actress Allison Aubrey who is phenomenal\nNow you gave us late interview recently and also a Twitter thread which is which is the way you have to do with these days and you mentioned\nOne ramification of that choice casting Alison breeze Diane that you tend to avoid referencing her Asian American this in the show now deceased and that's changed Diane does take a trip\nTo the Vietnam of her heritage and and talks a lot about how that affects her um how did her casting come about and how did you begin to have second thoughts about it\nWell um we cast Alison ah in in the first season and we were about I'm a third of the way into the season when we cast her we've been working a with a different actress\nUm who had to drop out of the show all of a sudden because another show she was on got picked up and there was a contractual issue so she couldn't be lead on our show any more\nUm and so we really scrambled and Alison came in and we thought she was amazing uh and she's going to a a great job ever since\nUm but more and more uh as I was looking around at the cast and and thinking about you know how how the show was put together and and and the makeup of the cast it started to dawn on me that\nEveryone in our castles white and our main cast and a lot of\nThe recurring people were we were hiring were white as well and this wasn't an intentional thing uh that I was doing as a racist man um it was just I was not paying attention and we were passing these characters one at a time\nUh and I realized that oh this is my I Need to start paying better attention to\n'em and so you know since then we've tried due to cast a wider net and look particularly for for diverse voices\nOr tried to have more people of color on the show but when it comes to Dianne specifically um you know I think there is a a real problem in this industry of casting white people in Asian roles and I was not a as aware\nOf that when we first started the show as I Am now and so that's something that I Would do differently is casting a white person to play a prominent Asian character\nAnd you know as I said in these other interviews um I think it's hurt the show because I think my own self consciousness has prevented us from telling Asian Stories I think because I guess I didn't want people to talk about this it felt like this is a mistake we made and if I can just you know avoid it or you know glide passed it\nThen you know maybe this won't become an issue where this you know won't become the thing that I ended up talking about in every interview and I I think that was a disservice to the character um because I I think it ended up\nYou know we we ended up treating her as just like a white character or as a race didn't matter\nAnd it's it's difficult in our show because in some ways race doesn't matter because there is also talking ... you know anti eaters and giraffes walking around so it's hard to say how has an Asian American humans experience that different from a white American humans experience but\nAnti packed presenting

ah I got the job and I did I did it just get my foot in the door and to make writing connections\nAnd uh you know I did I did make somebody connections that I wrote for some cable shows but it was never enough to support myself so I kept under the cue cards and I got really good at doing cue cards very quickly\nAnd uh you know cut to twenty eight twenty nine years later I own my own company I've been doing it for that long and running a lotta shows\nSo clearly this was not the kind of writing that you had in mind but what was it about doing the cue cards that you liked\nYou know I I don't know I think one especially on Saturday Night live the live aspect of it and being out there\nYou know as close to the cameras as you can be without being on camera a and helping the actors and helping the guest stars or through the shows and through this hard show that the you know they'd probably a lot of them have never done lived before there was something very rewarding about that and\nUm I didn't crack under pressure and with the changes and all that stress that was involved with that and that was something that they the show noticed and uh you know I rose up pretty quickly in the ranks\nTell us a bit about your company what shows does your company do cue cards for\nUh the are four main shows that are that are that tape all year our Saturday Night live um\nThe Tonight Show

really about the spacing between the between the letters and the word in a space in between the words and the space in between the sentences\nIt's not something like I Can't just bring somebody else history and say okay start doing your guards it's almost like you know you need I Need to train up for like two or three weeks\nI'm just to get them there's so many different little things you have to learn um two or three weeks of training yeah it it ... because it's it's not it's you can't just say you can't just tell them all the rules right you know what I mean I Can't just interview spared okay these are all the rules you need to learn memorized these new things come up every time there's new like\nEye is capitalized only in certain words it's not capitalized than during whereas where how to end the card of courage to stand on a period or ... or ... or a comma in if not that you know how to end it so that it slows the next car just so many different roles where you can only learn it by by doing it and practicing it\nWe're speaking to Wally ... and the founder of NYC cue cards the exclusive cue card provider in New York\nOkay so let's say you're working for me for you know the late night with Joshua Johnson right and I come out to do my opening monologue I've just hired your company and I said Wylie I'm really excited to be working for you guys let's start building this relationship\nTell me the kinds of things that you are going to want to know for me to figure out how to be a good cue card vendor for me All right first thing I ask you how's your eyesight like near sighted or glasses\nOkay so you were a glasses were your glasses on the show where you were contacts are we're not we're either\nI don't really like contacts hourglasses\nOkay so you're wearing glasses so you can see fine I won't have to if you didn't wear glasses and you want to wear contacts I could put your letters bigger so that you could see but that would also make less words in the card and it would make\nTell us especially if you're telling jokes so I Would recommend glasses or contacts for you if you know if you want to say you got to wear your glasses you'll be fine reading cards and then I Would just you know we were we were to have her son's Robert practiced with you if you've never read two cards before that something you'd want to practice\nWhat's the main thing that I Need to think about if I'm reading cue cards from you\nOr look directly at the cue cards don't look away because that'll that'll look like you're reading the cue cards\n... how do you mean it looked as early as well if you were doing a sketch they say you were doing a sketch with your bad leader and I had cue cards near the bad leader and positioned in a way that\nYou would want to play to those cue cards now if you were looking at the cue cards and then at the bandleader going back and forth between the car to the bed later the audience would be like oh he's obviously reading something\nBut if you just played those cue cards it would look on camera like you were talking directly to that person I'm ... directly above the camera above the camera above the camera so yeah so I'll I we were opens depending on where you are in position to the camera\nI'll make the cards the right the lettering the right side so that you look directly at that card it looks like you're looking right into the camera\nShow your cue card holders are kind of part of the technical direction to the blocking of a scene in terms of figuring out where the performers need to look to look proper\nThat's exactly right especially with Saturday Night live that's what I that's my main job but I'm there on Thursdays from Fridays that's all we do all day is block sketches and I'll be out there with one set of cards working with the actor's working with the host figuring out where I'm going to put\nThe cars and I work with the director of the stage managers wild well kind of concern I think I think I Need the cards here and then I'll ask the actors if they knew that extra set somewhere else where I maybe didn't think of just want to make sure that they're covered where they're from comfortable\nSince you mentioned Saturday Night live what does a typical work week at SNL looked like for someone who's doing cue cards for that show do you just come in Saturday afternoon and scribble furiously unfilled eleven thirty five PM\nI Wish it were that a simple [laughter] now we we start on Thursday we start rehearsal is on Thursday or Thursday's a light day\nSo the music the musical group ... for the first half of the day and then we'll ... we'll be in there about noon and will print well rehearsed maybe like three or four sketches and will only put one one set of each sketch because I have to figure out how many sets we need so there's no reason to print more\nAnd it it'll change from Thursday the sketches we do on Thursday we'll go through a rewrite session on Thursday night and most most of the time will be completely written from Thursday and friday\nAnd then friday is the same process except we do about eight or nine sketches same process we print put that on friday we have to do we have to make copies we call it do being the cards so it makes sense and then we went to redo that we don't have the we don't have the luxury of waiting until Saturday to dupe the friday sketches because Saturday show day\nSo everything's print that I have about eight people there on friday just yeah basically writing all day I have the fun job I'm Out on the set blocking working with the actress having fun they're sitting underneath the bleachers from eleven o'clock to sometimes you know twelve or one o'clock in the morning just printing cards so long it's a long day for them\nWhat kind of person would want to take that kind of a job it doesn't sound like a very glamorous way to be near the TV business are you lower you mostly employing people who are looking for a foot in the door or do you have like veteran cue card writers working for ...\nThere's a little bit of both um mostly um\nPeople that are trying to get a footnote I encouraged that I I Try to tell them cue cards is not a career I I did make it a career for myself\nBut there's not much room if you want to do at great for your lives that's awesome but you should be looking to do something else I'm encouraging them I'm helping them I'm introduced them to people that want they than in a career that they want to do mostly most of it's entertainment related but\nYeah you sit those long days or friday but that leaves the Saturday\nIt never hurts him with me 'cause I Can't I Can't hold for sketches at one time you know four sets of cards at one time so I Need other people out there and then that's kind of the fun part of it", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "11"}
