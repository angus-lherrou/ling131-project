A. M. U. dot org touch will look let's talk a bit about Brett Kavanaugh we're seeing his Supreme Court nomination and confirmation\nPresident Trump is using the issue to energize Republicans Democrats are doing the same thing on the other side of the aisle I Wonder where we see this going especially since Democrats some of them seem determined not to let the Kavanaugh's confirmation go\nIt seems to have had office it affects or at least so it seems these numbers are a little sketchy I Want to put the provides though around what I'm about to say\nUh that the polls are fresh and we don't know exactly what this means yet for the upcoming midterms we will know in four weeks however it looks like now is having an opposite effect on Senate races and house races we've seen several Senate races places like\nTennessee or places like North Dakota\nWhere races that seemed to be closer where the Democrat who is challenging the Republican and a red state\nActually had a chance to bother surviving or in the case of Tennessee or maybe picking up an open seat to now a surge for Republicans that Brett Kavanaugh phenomenon seems to in Senate races\nHave solidified Republican base voters behind Republican candidates in most cases and then curiously in house races where so many Republicans are vulnerable\nUh I Can't say that it's had the opposite effect because I'm not sure that the Supreme Court fight has a cause and effect relationship on house races house members don't really have much to do with Supreme Court fights in at least not not in confirming them up but there doesn't seem to have been the same erosion\nOr you know lead or in democratic support in the house however looking forward and you mentioned that a lot of Democrats are promising their base that the fight isn't over on Brett Kavanaugh not necessarily because of his ideological positions on a rower executive power\nA but what his behavior was\nIn high school and college and more importantly perhaps whether he was truthful under oath in front of the Judiciary Committee and in his statements when he talked about his drinking when he talked about his behavior in high school and college uh I Would look to the house\nMost likely house members who may\nIf the numbers hold true control the house after January the will control the Judiciary Committee they will control the investigations committees they will have chairman ships and like and like a shame said before\nThey will become subpoena factories they will also have to respond to a base that wants Brett Kavanaugh statements investigated a lot of this Joshua comes from dissatisfaction over the extremely limited nature of that FBI background check that week in between when Christine Blasey Ford came forward and we had that high profile\nHighly emotional and remarkable hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee around here the FBI really investigate did they get to the bottom of anything did they ask\nTen twelve fourteen people who may have been witnesses in some form to some of the alleged behavior it appears that they didn't and people might be relying on Democrats to pick up that church\n... I'll add to this you know senator Kamala Harris is not just on the Senate Judiciary committee but she's also in the homeland security and government Affairs Committee and in that capacity she had the cancer can grill FBI Director Christopher Wray on that face to face\nOn how much intervention did the White House do and that's sad supplemental background check\nWill click also on ranking member of the Senate Judiciary committee Dianne Feinstein her six year term in the Senate is up she's up for reelection\nYou think that that this is going to come up in the debate between her and state senator Kevin daily own who wants to know why she sat on that letter from Dr Christine Blasey Ford for two months\nAnd last thing I'll say it she just last night with trying to take the fight from you know on the SCOTUS thing too\nThat the way that they're trying to remake the courts writ large talking about the Ninth Circuit court hearing California Trump's nomination this is a court that's been a real\nPut forth three nominees there and she didn't get to sign off on that and she's very upset about that and try and I kind of the nation currently breaking friend tradition by not giving the home state senators any fanny packs\nI Do want to see if we can leave time to talk California politics before the round up is up but a few more things out of D.C\nWe wanted to discuss including the president stepping into the middle of the feud between Taylor Swift and Kanye West he publicly just missed swift for endorsing two Democrats in Tennessee and he woke up Kanye West of the White House yesterday Connie wore red make America great again hats for the visit\nAnd we're gonna have lunch you were going to talk of even I don't want to say I don't want to put you in this buyout by love this guy right here let me give this\nI Love this guy right\nNow Connie West was reportedly at the White House to discuss criminal justice reform he also said yesterday that he doesn't like the liberals and shows like Saturday Night live make the president look bad he said the president needs to be in his words precious to us as Americans\nWe should also be clear those Shane Harris Kanye seemed rather rambling during the good bit of his visit maybe a little unhinged he had noted\nThat he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder I I'm I'm I'm hesitant to dig deep in on this story I think ... easy to mock easy to make fun of\nEasy to criticize but the fact that he said that he is a bipolar while he's meeting with the president and dropping some obscenity at the other side of the resolute desk I I'm not sure what to do with it\nI I'm not either I mean I could see was quite surreal we were actually in the newsroom working on other ... arguably more important stories I hesitate to dig through these ... deep and it's like you\nAnd looked up at the TV and we all sort of set is this is this really happening it was just so strange it's hard to know what to make of it but it is part of a litany of these kind of bizarre\nCarnival esque spectacles that we've seen both sometimes in the oval office and then from the president that have the flavor more of a reality show I mean that that seemed to remind us of the mill you that Donald Trump came out of\nA when he ran for president and so in that sense I suppose it's not that surprising but I think for a lot of people there's a sense that it almost diminishes the office of the president to see this sort of rambling bizarre what do we make it a behavior\nFrom a celebrity that has been outspoken about his politics and that's his right but there's also left many people scratching his head about what is he actually doing and is is there something wrong with him or he was just a very strange moment and I know for\nFor for for me and my heart just tried to move past it as quickly as we could\nAnd the interest in moving passes quickly if we could do that too but I should note the county's old nemesis Taylor Swift inserted herself into politics this week\nShe endorsed Democrats Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house in her home state of Tennessee on social media\nAnd the Senate race in Tennessee is tight and British then has strong support Taylor Swift has one hundred twelve million followers on Instagram and voter registrations among young people rose by more than sixty thousand after her post\nShane Harris let me stick with you for a moment because President Trump is facing another difficult situation regarding the disappearance of a journalist named ... Saudi dissident and a resident of the U.S he disappeared inside the Saudi consulate\nIn Turkey you've been doing a fair bit of reporting on this particularly the concern that the Turks have raised that the Saudis basically sent hit men to kill ... to show you because of his reporting the Turkish government hasn't really\nVideo and and and logs of people who signed in and so forth what do we actually know right now if anything about what really happened right well what\nWe know right now is largely coming from the Turks and Turkish security agencies\nAre what we reported last night my colleagues and I end up posts late last night was that the Turks have told the Americans that they actually have audio recordings and video from inside the consulate that they say definitively prove Fletcher mark a show the who was an opinion writer for the post Washington Post\nA was a beaten tortured and killed and ultimately dismembered inside\nThat facility um the Americans that we understand have not seen the footage or heard it themselves but there is a growing believe within the U.S intelligence community and I think within Congress and the White House ah that the Saudis probably did kill Jamal ... and are not\nThis is Ninety point three WPN land Nashville public radio Ninety One point five WTO ... in Ninety One point seven W.

A. M. U. dot org let's get back to that story of the Saudi Arabian journalist ... who has gone missing possibly murdered\n... we've heard a number of accounts particularly from the Turks about what Saudi Arabia allegedly did to Mr to show that they basically said hitman after him what do we know for sure about the disappearance at this point\nFor shall we know that he ... to into the come so uh in Istanbul and he didn't work out\nThat is what we know for sure there are reports that they were to go ... jets that came from Saudi Arabia or with fifty men have they they go into\nA blackout er vines are drove to the ... so the consumer generals residents which is allegedly ... show he may have been taken and they did what they did to him now there are reports that collecting that a Turkish intelligence have proof\nOr that or that they know what happened to him and that he was tortured and dismembered\nAnd a ... ... the most brutal brutal death under the fifty men then flew back to a Saudi Arabia on the Gulf Stream jets a little later in the day now we know that the the planes that were those to play movements at different times that came into his stumble ... and then went back to react\nWho was on them what that designation was within the state capital racist widowed one hundred percent no but you get the distinct sense that uh the what the Turkish are telling the authorities here\nOn what you will thirties here in the U.S on the side and he's not a million miles from what I have just sketched out because I think that there has been a willingness to believe and that is why you're seeing\nThe deep expressions of anxiety and on these over what has unfolded and what the implications might be there's some things that you can easily sweep onto the carpet in international affairs and there are some things that are just there are a bit more ... quit I miss definitely falls into the latter category\nWhere we I Wonder if we can talk about the U.S in Saudi Arabia is relationship the real long time allies at a press conference at the oval office yesterday President Trump was asked about to she'll use disappearance here's part of what the president's at\nFirst I Want to find out what happened and we're located again this took place in Turkey\nAnd to the best of our knowledge because she'll be is not a United States citizen is that right or for a permanent resident okay we'll get John would all like it and we don't like it even a little bit but as to whether or not we should stop\nCountry knowing they have four or five alternatives to very good alternatives that would not be acceptable to be okay but we're looking for the answer and I think probably you'll have an answer sooner than people say\nThe president speaking at the oval office yesterday and when we use referring to the human Saudi Arabia and the four or five alternatives would be other countries from whom the Saudis could buy arms the hundred and ten billion dollars is an arms deal a military deal between the U.S\nAnd Saudi Arabia worry I Wonder if you could give us your sense of how this case\nFits into the relationship between the U.S in Saudi Arabia especially in light of the comment that I read it earlier ... sixteen forty three wrote on our website the one eight dot org\nThere is no reason to maintain close ties with the country that the heads more people than ISIS finally gives women the right to drive but it's only window dressing\nIs killing civilians in Yemen and murdered a journalist who was critical of quote unquote royal family if I were king for a day all the weapons we've sold them would be rendered useless and Jared cush there would be banned from any policy making\nLove the sharp elbows thrown in that comment I Wonder if you can help us fact\nChecked that yeah I think um it's a it's a really a fascinating point and also that that um clip you played of Donald Trump was really striking because I'm the one hand\nIt seemed so I'm cold lead transactional in the sense that he was saying you know we have billions of dollars pouring in why am I going to stop that just because they have murdered a dissident journalist in other words I I'm so you know I don't care about human rights I mean we usually stand up for I care about money pouring into the United states economy\nAnd that attitude had activated a lot of\nUm people in Washington who are against our alliance with Saudi Arabia for example senators on both sides of the aisle that Chris Murphy and Rand Paul who have been arguing for a long time just as the commenter said I'm\nNow we're supporting a war in Yemen that it's unconscionable that is starving civilians and killing civilians killing civilians in you know bus attacks\nAnd other things that are just horrendous um why\nThe hell out of the country short but since you mentioned Rand Paul I'm really sorry to interrupt you but we have a clip of Rand Paul speaking to reporters this week on that very thing he said he would try to force a vote on us arms sales to Saudi Arabia I'll let you finish your thought but first let's hear from Senator Paul\nI think that the early reports have shown that this is linked to the Saudi Government and nothing happens in Saudi Arabia without the government's approval\nSo no I think that ah and less and less of a sudden the journalists turns of alive I think that we should we should continue our arms sales to Saudi Arabia [noise] plus I think we need to be voting in the Senate and debating whether or not we should be involved in the war in Yemen\nThat was Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky where we go ahead so I was gonna say people like Rand Paul are going to push back against armed ... about our support for the war\nIn Yemen um even saw a at a law makers invoking the global Magnitsky Act which said that that the U.S Trump's ministries and had to investigate what happened and if they find Saudi officials responsible they need to impose sanctions all that being said I wanted there is a counterpoint to this day which is that\nOur relationship with Saudi Arabia has always been transactional Trump kind of said the quiet part out loud a little bit in the way he in a way he framed it out yesterday because\nWe have never had a relationship an alliance faith and values since World War two it had all been about money and oil think about nine eleven Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers were from Saudi Arabia\nThat didn't lead to a permanent rupture in our alliance because we have always seen them as a strategic ally not as the values faith ally as in Europe and I think that's important to keep in mind that Trump Senate and particularly accentuated way and he feels you know is very transactional way past presidents have\nBut this isn't a somewhat reflective of what us presidents have sat quietly for a long time\nJoshua ... here I mean I think Donald Trump said out loud what other presidents and other prime minister\nWith regimes that are far from perfect I mean I remember when Tony Blair was prime minister\nAnd there was a huge I'm Still it was about to be concluded\nAnd the British serious fruit office launched an investigation into what Saudi Arabia or had been doing whether they'd be paying kickbacks or whatever to get contracts through\nUm old ... and you know it was clear that the Saudis who said to Blair you've got to call this the cooled off the dog's otherwise the deal is in jeopardy and highly unusually mercifully controversial e Tony Blair intervened with a ... an independent investigation and said right we're canceling this investigation\nAnd he used his power as prime minister because he felt he had to because Saudi Arabia was to take your customer too important an ally\nAnd you've seen with Donald Trump you know one of the first places he went to when he became president was to Saudi Arabia I traveled with him on that trip\nAnd it was they were one hundred percent in with Mohammed bin Salman now whether they're regrets email note is an open question however they they are there are they do Trump is determined that the arms deal will go ahead\nJosh before we moved oh go ahead and oh I was just going to\nSay if I could just add one thing that struck me as what the president didn't say he didn't mention Iran and he didn't mention the peace deal as you recall last month that the UN\nAt the United states has pretty aggressive in calling around the biggest threat to the region and by extension [noise] it was seen Saudi Arabia is that stopgap against possible Iranian expansion\nAcross the middle east on and of course Saudi Arabia would be key to any sort of a peace deal so I think it's interesting that I'm a month ago we were talking about\nPolicies and going against Iran and so going forward how much will the U.S focus on Iran and stopping an Iranian expansion on shape it's reaction or lack there of 'em to chew what's happened in Saudi Arabia and if it if and in fact is the case that they have\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from bona with the bonus certified craftsmen program a network of hardwood flooring contractors committed to

and Henri Friedman still time to get in some of your questions and thoughts about the week's top stories as well one a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nThe story of the next president of Interpol Ming hung way was reported missing last week by his wife ... moved Maine was detained by Chinese authorities on corruption charges\nHe resigned in immediate effect this week the arrest as part of a larger official anti corruption campaign by China's president Xi Jinping know grace Ming the ex Interpol president's wife is speaking out she told the Associated Press that she felt threatened\nA misuse of do we have a sense that you do of why this is going on and what it is that makes me so important to the Chinese government of what this means that a larger sense\nWell he's been a long time operative of the the Chinese government and their arguments being made that this is part of an effort to purge non loyalist to their she government and so there is no definitive answer but I think the message that um many are taken as if somebody who's been in government this long and the police capacity um\nIt could be sweat swept off the streets and his wife sent a knife a ... the day the day he disappears at knowing in China safe and and at the time of all this there was talk from\nParty officials about the importance of absolute loyalty said their suggestions certainly is that somehow he was less than a mile and the eyes of the government\nI Will say I think I'm One of the more interesting developments as well as his wife and how outspoken she has been she has been she's in French protective custody\nBut she's been speaking out in a way that we wouldn't normally see out of China and I thought it was an interesting development and may lead to more information coming out quicker than Chinese officials want it to happen\nAnd so it was fascinating to watch her sort of use um the public platform in a way we see more often in the west as a way to get information about her husband and defend her husband it's it's something we don't normally see\nWas heading out to Brazil were far right presidential candidate John ... surprised the nation when he shot to the top of the ranks he nearly took the election was forty six percent of the vote just shy of preventing a runoff Brazilians will vote in the runoff election suit on October twenty eighth\nWorry Freidman can you remind us who ... is and what makes him and his policy platform so newsworthy\nHe's a fascinating character he's been he's a former army captain has been in a Congress for almost three decades um he's a law and order candidate that his his big thing so he said you know our crime rates are too\nAnd saying you know the police need to shoot first um and and um shoot to kill 'em and and also to losing gun laws to address crime rates he's also very controversial in the sense that he said things that are most optimistic\nUm that are anti algae of beauty and one other thing that's really important it's Brazil we often forget I'm only became a democracy in Nineteen eighty five or return to democracy Nineteen eighty five for Twenty one years had a dictatorship and he has spoken ... um\nAbout the time of the dictatorship as a time when there was law and order one other point to know is that he had an armored but Donald Trump a lot of conservatives feel that Donald Trump has the right formula be pro business you know loosen regulations\nAh you know be nationalistic and be about cracking down on crime and he had promised me a really close ally of the United states all of this is\nI'm very a shocking because Brazil for many ... for decades has been led by a leftist government or there was a little more ambivalent about its relationship with the United states and certainly a didn't espouse come to the right wing view is\nThat he is ... so this is a real shock to the system I think it really goes to the fact\nThat Brazil I mean it's in deep recession embroiled in a massive corruption\nUm crisis or that affected all parties except for both an arrow who is actually not been implicated in this and that was his that was hit the winning point I'll say one other thing we you know the Atlantic wrote an article in which they interviewed\nA a cab driver who said you know things are so bad maybe we need someone with crazy ideas out who else is going to fix this math and so I think that that is that is the sentiment that it's worth keeping an eye on because that was a similar sentiment\nInbred that in Donald Trump's victory in the victory of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador Mexico I mean this is a sentiment that people are feeling against the establishment in many countries in the world\nBut to hear from some Brazilians who are listening in today and looking ahead to the election one listener emailed I'm and I'm a Brazilian listening from me sitting next to Brazil's capital Brasilia\nI'm very concerned about the future of our democracy the candidate leading the polls is an ex military who has a very anti democratic discourse which is also racist massages and homophobic\nSince last Sunday the election day more than fifty people have suffered physical and verbal aggressions from both so NATO supporters social media specifically what's app\nIs playing a very important role and lots of fake news is circulating I really believe that with ... out of our democracy is at risk John ... what's projected to happen for the runoff is there any sense of whether ... could win this for the last\nPoll I saw suggested yes that the the latest post suggests that he is at fifty eight percent\nOn the opposition leader is at forty two percent or something in it for them to her dad and so I kind of thing that you'd have to say that if it was that sort of ... that right it's got to take some quite something for the left is kind of confidence\nTo come back from that position um I mean you know they took about violence and the other thing about both not a it's a he was stabbed in September as a rally I'm so there's been a lot of violence around by his men that he's been able to say\nI really love to take part in debates really count at the moment because I'm Still you know slightly getting ready for this stopping that I had then so I'm afraid I might be able to come to your studio this evening on so I think that there is kind of a feeling that you know he is he's got his head down he has said what he said people know exactly where he stands and I think he sees the finish line\nOne story that much of the world has been talking about has to do with a new report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the eyepiece Sisi\nThe report says that the world is quickly running out of time to stem catastrophic climate change scientists predict we're on course to go beyond a crucial threshold of the world's average temperature rising one point five degrees Celsius or to point seven degrees Fahrenheit\nIn just over about ten years they save that would leave us dealing with the risks of extreme drought\nWords of millions of people we talked about this report on the program this week one comment from a listener stuck along the lines that at least here in America\nThis is just not a big enough issue I mean people will vote for a lot of reasons and the state of our climate is not something that lawmakers talk much about or that voters demand to discuss nips the use of what is your sense of that of whether or not this report has made an impact around the world enough for people to start demanding action\nI think it's made an impact but the problem is the effects of this already being seen in various ways around the world so where one country can say it's not\nA big impact another country could see it as an immediate impact and something that needs to be dealt with aggressively and of course the kinds of changes at this report says need to happen or so on\nDrastic that it demands sort of a uniform world agreed upon action and we're not there yet and so I'm ... years scene of variance in response and I think it really reflects the variants have impact that nations are already seen\nAnd you know as a as a war correspondent and one of the things I see it come up most often as as a cause of the start of\nWars and conflicts environmental changes changing where people live how they're able to eat so I'm ... ... it's an area that doesn't just hit the environment that really hits other parts of of national security and government writ large but there's because of the complexity in terms of its impact\nI think it's hard to get a uniform agreement particularly at it in such a polarized time um so it's hard to be optimistic that that will see at least in the short term the kinds of drastic changes that this report says needs to happen to stop literally famine drought wildfires really severe consequences\nJust sure I was in Europe at the beginning of the week and when the report came out and I on the main national news shows a half an hour lungs are the same as the nightly news programs here the the first six seven minutes with devoted to the side PCC report\nI Wonder how much was devoted I mean there is one of the things that really strikes me about living here compared in America where you get more was a I think the square inch than any other\nKind of country on the planet a huge huge amount about whether", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "13"}
