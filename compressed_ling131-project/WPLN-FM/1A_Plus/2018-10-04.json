Disease Control one\nWe'll experienced some form of sexual violence in their lifetime according to the rape abuse and incest national network sixty percent of sexual assaults go on report that\nIn addition one survivors do report the results it's often years later due to the trauma they suffered and sharing their stories will not be believed\nLast week I received a letter from the sixty year old California constituents who told me that she survived an attempt to break at age Seventeen she described as being terrified and embarrassed she never told his soul until much later in life\nThe assault stayed with her for forty three years I think it's important to remember these realities as we hear from Dr Ford about her experience\nThere's been a great deal of public discussion about the me too movement today versus the year of the woman almost twenty seven years ago\nBut while the young women are standing up and saying no more\nOur institutions have not progressed and how they treat women who come forward\nToo often women's memories and credibility come under assault in essence they are put on trial and force to defend themselves and often read victimized in the process\nTwenty seven years ago I was walking through an airport when I saw a large group of people gathered around the TV to listen to Anita Hill tell her story\nWhat I saw was an attractive woman in a blue suit before an all male Judiciary Committee speaking of her experience of sexual harassment\nShe was treated badly accused of lying attacked and her credibility put to the test threw out the process\nToday Dr Christine Blasey Ford has come forward to tell her story of being assaulted and fearing for her life when she was a teenager initially as I said Dr Ford did not want to make her story public\nThen within thirty six hours of coming forward Republicans scheduled the hearing without talking to her or even invite her to testify she was told she had to show up for the or the committee would move forward with a vote\nIt took a public outcry for them from the majority excuse me for the majority to back down and give her even a few days to come before the committee\nRepublicans also scheduled this hearing with Dr Ford was out having her allegations investigated by the FBI\nIn Nineteen Ninety One Anita Hill's allegations were reviewed by the FBI as his the normal process and squarely within its jurisdiction\nHowever despite repeated requests President Trump and the Republicans have refused to take this routine staff and direct the FBI to conduct and in partial investigation\nThis would clearly be the best way to ensure a fair process to both judge Kavanaugh and to Dr Ford\nIn Nineteen Ninety One the Senate heard from twenty two witnesses over three days today\nRepublicans are refusing to hear testimony from any other witness including mark judge who Dr Ford identified as being in the room when the attack took place\nAnd we believe judge should be subpoenaed so the committee can hear from him directly\nRepublicans should also refused to call anyone who could speak to the evidence that would support or refute\nDr forward to claim and not one witness um who could address credibility and character of either Ford or Kavanaugh has been called\nWhat I find most inexcusable is this a rush to judgment\nThe unwillingness to take these kinds of allegations at face value and look at them for what they are a real question of character for someone who is asking for a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court\nIn Nineteen Ninety One Republicans belittled professor hills experience saying and I quote it won't make a bit of difference in the outcome and quote\nAnd the burden of proof was on professor Hill today our Republican colleagues are saying this is a hiccup Dr Ford is mixed up and declaring I'll listen to the lady but we're going to bring this to a close\nWhat's worse many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have also made it clear that no matter what happens today the Senate will plow right through and insured judge Kavanaugh would be elevated within a week\nIn fact on Tuesday the majority went ahead and scheduled to vote on the nomination before we heard one word of testimony regarding allegations of sexual assault and misconduct by Brett Kavanaugh\nRepublican leadership even told senators they should plan to be in over this weekend so the nomination can be pushed through without the way\nThis is despite the fact that in the last few days to more women have come forward with their own serious allegations of sexual assault involving Brett Kavanaugh\nThis past Sunday we learned about Debbie Ramirez who was a student at Yale with Brett Kavanaugh she to did not want to come forward but after being approached by reporters she told her story\nShe was at a college party where Kavanaugh exposed himself to her she recalls pushing him away and then seeing him laughing and pulling his pants up\nThen yesterday Judy sweating it came forward to say that she had experiences of being at house parties with Brett Kavanaugh and mark judge\nShe were counted sing Kavanaugh engage and I quote in abusive\nAnd physically aggressive behavior toward girls and quote including attempts to quote remove or shift girls' clothing and quote not taking quote no for an answer\nGrabbing girls quote without their consent and quote and targeting quote particular girls so that they could be taken advantage of and quote\nEach of these stories are troubling on their own and each of these allegations should be investigated\nHave said that they would like the FBI to investigate please do sell all three have said they have other witnesses and evidence to corroborate their accounts and yet Republicans continue to blindly push forward\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from bona with the bone a certified Crossman program a network of hardwood flooring contractors committed to expertise in customer service

Kavanaugh and his friend mark judge both sexually assaulted her she says she was at a party had had one beer Britain work we're in her words visibly drunk\nShe made her way up a flight of stairs to use the restroom and that is when she says that one or both of them pushed her into a bedroom lock the door and then proceeded to ...\nNow we're testimony seemed to tell anyone these details I did not want to tell my parents that I at age Fifteen was in a house without any parents present drinking beer with boys\nI convinced myself that because Brett did not reach me I should just move on and just pretend that it didn't happen\nOver the years I told very very few friends that I had this traumatic experience\nI told my husband before we were married that I had experienced a sexual assault I'd never told the details to any one specific details until made two thousand twelve during a couple's counseling session\nThe reason this came up in counseling is that my husband and I had completed a very extensive\nVery long remodel of our home and I insisted on a second front door and the idea that he and others disagreed with and could not understand\nAnd explaining why I wanted a second front door I began to describe the assault in detail I recall seeing that the boy who assaulted me could someday be on the U.S Supreme Court and spoke a bit about his background at an elitist all boys school and says to Maryland\n[noise] my husband recalls that I named my attacker as perhaps capping off\nAfter that made two thousand twelve therapy session I did my best to ignore the memories of the assault because we're counting them caused me to relive the experience and cause panic and anxiety\nOccasionally would discuss these salt in an individual therapy sessions but talking about it cause more reliving of the trauma so I tried not to think about it or just I said but over the years I went through periods where I thought about the attack\nI confided in some close friends that I had had an experience with sexual assault occasionally I stated that my tail it was a prominent lawyer or judge but I did not use his name\nI Do not recall each person I spoke to about ... salt and some friends have reminded me of these conversations since the publication of the Washington Post story on September sixteenth two thousand Eighteen\nBut until July two thousand Eighteen I had never named Mr Kavanaugh at my attacker outside of therapy\nThis changed in early July two thousand Eighteen\nI saw press report stating that Brett Kavanaugh was on the short list\nOf a list of very well qualified Supreme Court nominees I thought it was my civic duty to relieve the information I had about Mr Kavanaugh's conduct so that those considering his nomination would know about this assault\nOn ... I had a sense of urgency to relay the information to the Senate and the president as soon as possible before and um and he was elected I did not know how\nSpecifically to do this [noise] I called my congressional representative and let her receptionist no that's somewhat on the president's short list had attacked me\n[noise] I also sent a message to the encrypted Washington Post confidential tip line I did not use my name but I provided the names of Brett Kavanaugh and mark judge it stated that Mr Kavanaugh had assaulted me in the Nineteen eighties in Maryland\nThis was an extremely hard thing for me to do\nOver the next two days I told a couple of close friends on the beach in ... California that Mr Kavanaugh sexually assaulted me I was very conflicted as to whether to speak out\nOn the line nights I received a return phone call from the office of congresswoman Anna Eshoo after Mr Kavanaugh had become the nominee\nI met with her staff on July ... Eighteenth and with her on July twenty is describing the assault and discussing my fears about coming forward\nLater we discuss the possibility of sending a letter to ranking member Feinstein who is one of my state senators describing what occurred [noise]\nMy understanding is that representative ashes office delivered a copy of my letter to senator Feinstein's office on July third yes\nThe letter included my name but also a request that it be kept confidential\nMy hope was that providing the information confidentially would be sufficient to allow the Senate to consider Mr having a serious misconduct\nWithout having to make myself my family or anyone's family vulnerable to the personal attacks and invasions of privacy that we have faced since my name became public\nIn a letter dated August thirty first Senator Feinstein wrote that she would not share the letter without my explicit consent and I appreciated the commitments sexual assault victims should be able to decide for themselves when and whether they're private experience made public\nAs the hearing date got closer I struggled with a terrible choice\nDo I share the facts of the Senate and put myself in my family in the public spotlight or die preserve our privacy and allow the Senate to make its decision without knowing the full truth of his past behaviors\nI agonized daily with this decision throughout August and September ... thousand Eighteen this sense of duty that originally motivate motivated me to reach out confidentially to the Washington Post and and uh she's office\nWhen there was still a list of extremely qualified candidates\nAnd Senator Feinstein\nWas always there but my fears of the consequences of speaking out started to X financially increase\nDuring August two thousand Eighteen the press reported that Mr Kavanaugh's confirmation was virtually certain\n\nPainted him as a champion of women's rights and empowerment\nAnd I believe that if I came forward my single voice would be drowned out by of chorus of powerful supporters by the time of the confirmation hearings I'd write signed myself to remaining quiet\nAnd letting the committee and the Senate make their decision without knowing what Mr cabinet had done to me once the press started reporting on the existence of the letter I'd sent to Senator Feinstein I face mounting pressure\nReporters appeared at my home and at my workplace demanding information about the letter in the presence of my graduate students\nThey called my bosses and co workers and left me many messages making it clear that money would inevitably be released the media I decided to speak out publicly to a journalist who had originally responded to the tip I'd sent\nJust it was important for me to describe the details of the assault in my own words\nSince September ... chance the date of the Washington Post story\nI have experienced an outpouring of support from people in every state of this country thousands and thousands of people who have had their lives dramatically altered by sexual violence have reached out to share their experience and have thanked me for coming forward\nWe have received tremendous support from our friends at our community\nAt the same time my greatest fears have been realized and the reality has been far worse than what I expected my family and I have been the target of constant harassment and death threats and I've been called the most vile and hateful names imaginable\nThis is Ninety point three WPN Nashville public radio Ninety One point five WGM outcome of Houma and Ninety One point seven WHM rats cook them get the latest stories from WPN land new throughout the day and connect with National Public radio via Twitter and Facebook W.

Garrett welcome to want to hey glad to be here and we can we just address how emotional this morning was first of all I I think part of\nThe story of today has just had to do with watching professor Ford who to be clear is not debilitated or broken down by the testimony but clearly there were sections where you could tell she was reliving this yes\nAnd and the tears in her voice particularly at the beginning of her testimony\nOr were you know obvious and it's very hard I think for people watching them to portray them as anything but since here I I think on that a note I think the the centerpiece for me of her testimony or and I set up in my chair you know like I had gotten an electric\nA jolt was when she was asked about details you remembered and she said the upper arias laughter\nAs they held me down a ... that's a ... a chilling detail but more to the point in terms of your question I think she has steady quite a bit since she got that out and and seems sort of still emotional but much more in command of herself\nGive me your sense of a strategy on the Democratic side and the Republican side it seems like the mainstream of questions\nFrom the Democrats have to do with what this has done to professor Ford and questioning from the Republican signed through the prosecutor Rachel Mitchell\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from

Garrett Epps Baltimore school of law and the Atlantic before we dive back in the talking about this we know that this is difficult stuff to talk about sexual assault can be very triggering\nFor some of those of you who have dealt with this yourself\nSenator Feinstein noted in her opening statement the CDC statistics\nWhich they have been one out of three women and one out of six men will be victims of sexual violence at some point in their lifetime and so if this conversation has been traumatic for you to listen to what's been kind of triggering and you need someone to talk to or if you need help dealing with the sexual assault that may have happened to you more recently\nHere's the number for the national sexual assault hotline it's eight hundred\nSix five six for six seven three again the national sexual assault hotline eight hundred six five six for six seven three\nCertainly those people who are strongly affected by sexual assault include professor for herself she described herself as being terrified early in her statements here is part of her statements from earlier today talking about the reaction to her a letter or during this morning's as sort of Judiciary Committee hearing listen\nSince September sixteenth the gate of the Washington Post story\nI have experienced an outpouring of support from people in every state of this country thousands and thousands of people who have had their lives dramatically altered by sexual violence have reached out to share their experience and thanked me for coming forward\nWe received tremendous support from our friends at our community at the same time greatest fears have been realized and that reality has been far worse\nThan what I expected my family and then the target of constant harassment and death threats and I've been called the most loyal and hateful names imaginable\nThese messages well far fewer than the expressions of support have been terrifying at rock to me to my core\nPeople have posted my personal information and that as my parents on line on the Internet this has resulted in additional emails cause and threats my family and I were forced to move out of our home\nSince September sixteenth my family and I've been visiting and various secure locales at times separated at times together with the help of security guards\nThis past Tuesday evening my work email was hacked and messages were sent out\nSexual assault apart from the assault itself these past couple of weeks has been the hardest of my life I've had to relive trauma in front of the world\nAnd I've seen my life picked apart by people I saw that in mind Twitter other social media other media and in his body never met me or spoken with me\nAnd eggs are from Christine Blasey Ford's opening statement and Garrett that gets to one of the questions that Senator Feinstein asked right off the top which is basically why ... dot professor Ford chose to keep this\nConfidential for so long ago there was there was some effort both in the opening statement and in the first democratic round of questioning\nTo make it clear that going public was not something that professor Ford want it to do it all\n[noise] well you know the ... that that that moment also in the hearings was extraordinary because she was trying to explain why she went over the edge and decided to let her name be going and and I've tried to put myself in the position of a juror you know who is listening to testimony and thinking\nWhat do you believe and the moment when she said the reporters tried to talk to my dog\nYeah it it it gave you a sense of just\nHow panicky it must have been to be under siege by\nReporters outside your house and and you know she didn't mean it turns out that he was trying to interview the dog but that's what it sounded like they're trying to calm the dog is it called the guys are trying to go on the dog down but by at first I thought holy moly you're trying to get a quote from the dog that must have [laughter]\nBut but the details have been you know very telling a ... you know little things like that\nUm and I think that she conveyed how terrifying it is to get caught up in something like this when you you sort of naive they thought if I bring this to the attention of the authorities the authorities will do something about it you know that I think is what was being conveyed by her first statement and people will either find that credible or they won't\nLet me get to a few of your comments Brendan tweeted if there is any question that the Brett Kavanaugh could have done it or any of the other assaults he should absolutely be disqualified otherwise the Supreme Court and our entire government lose all legitimacy\nLily ... tweeted well after listening a bit finding out who she is and what she has to say I think she's for real and didn't quite before\nGarrett it's early in the hearing yet but uh how much of an impact do you think Christine Blasey Ford may have had on people who are undecided there was a recent NPR News ... poll that showed that quite a lot of people have said they don't really know what to make of all this yeah\nI I think her impact us is going to be pretty strong ah because as we said she does kind of come across as this ordinary person caught up in extraordinary events she is like the professor you might have had or or even your homeroom teacher you know that kind of\nFuzzy soliciting food but more to the point is a question of showmanship and this moment this morning at ten am\nNobody in the country had any sense of what was going to happen and what she was going to be like and then there is this performance that I think most people will grant had some power and they are going to have to counter it with judge Kavanaugh\nWho is a known quantity already to TV watchers in other words we've seen hours of his testimony and so for him to produce something vivid enough to re butter\nIs going to be a challenge and that's not I'm not talking now in truth or faucet germs I'm just talking about in kind of lawyers a forensic showmanship he's he's got a heavy burden to bear\nFor those of you who may just be tuning and let me give you a sense of where we are best for the Senate Judiciary committee hearing began a paste just\nChairman Chuck Grassley Republican and the ranking Democrat Dianne Feinstein it looks like Christine Blasey Ford is coming back to her seat so I'll just note very briefly that both ... opening statements and professor Ford has were in the middle of questioning back and forth between Democrats various Democratic senators and\nRepublicans who are more ... feeling all of their questions to Rachel Mitchell who's head of the sex crimes unit at the Maricopa County ... county attorney's office in Arizona the hearing has reconvene let's get back to German Grassley\nAs being your address okay just to put it in perspective I'd like to show you a a further out of zoom doubt picture so that uh we can put it in perspective [noise]\nSo we can show the greater Washington area of course you can see the beltway on that\nThe beltway area okay and uh then number three if we could look at that we uh we drove one mile radius around the country club and then we calculated from the further as Mr Cameron again we don't have these documents\nNo we're not [noise] that's why she showed three different documents

the distance from the closest point to your house from a mile radius of the country club\nUm and then the further point you could see it's it's six point two and of course eight point two miles um in you've described this as being near the country club wherever this house was is that right\n[noise] I Would describe it as that somewhere between my house and the country club in that vicinity that shown in your picture okay and that country club is about twenty twenty minute drive from my parents' home\nA twenty minute drive and of course I've ...

final vote on whether to confirm him\nIs expected to happen Saturday joining me to discuss the report and its potential fallout is NPR Justice Department reporter Ryan Lucas Ryan welcome like you know so we have this report or will the Senate has the report now or do we the people had any idea what is actually contained within the four corners\nWell we don't have any sort of specific snow and this is certainly something that is confidential and not a something that is generally released to the public and there are no plans at this point according to the Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley for any of this to be made public\nA despite clearly a fair amount of interest among Democrats to make this public and certainly I think among the Trump a chunk of the American public to to learn what's in there of what we do know is that publicly at least\nA six people have confirmed that they spoke to the FBI many of them are people who are friends of judge Kavanaugh's during high school that would be mark judge PG\nOne friend of a forwards that Leland Kaiser who all confirmed that they spoke to the FBI and then there's a second woman who made allegations of sexual misconduct against cabin on that's Deborah Ramirez and we know that she also spoke to the FBI now a NPR has learned um that\nUh nine people according to a to a an official nine people spoke with the the FBI in total\nUm but again a lot of this is one that you know we don't know what all the FBI was told in this uh and likely we're not going to get a full picture but what we do have so far as what a German Grassley has said and that is that there's nothing in there that the committee and the public of this one didn't already\nKnow so where is the report right now physically I mean how our senators looking at it because it's extremely sensitive every reporter in Washington wants to get a look at it in in every political operative does too\nWell or the process for this is governed by a memorandum

T. um he's someone who sort of an outsider when you look at the composition of the bt far less though\nHe's not he's a moderate um but the leadership of the Workers Party of the PTA currently is very radicalized so it's very different\nFrom the time when former president Lula was in government for example from twenty three I'm twenty can wind up party really did take this sort of center left fan so the party at south now is very much hard left um the candidate though is that\nUm that being said the the real big problem in Brazil at the moment is that\nThere is a lot a lot of anti P. T. anti worker party sentiment so a lot of the vote that has been migrating too far right extremist both narrow\nUm is this anti P. T. vote so these elections are very strange because they had become elections about not who necessarily voters actually went to see as president but about who voters do not see as friends and\nWe're going to talk about corruption we're going to talk about graft we are going to talk about a failing economy because all of those things play and I think to\nThe idea that voters know who they don't want they don't want the people who were taking billions of dollars in bribes which has been a major problem we're gonna talk all about that Apollo let me turn to you what about turnout in this election Brazil has compulsory voting I don't know if that means that they get to a hundred percent but people do\nCome out to the polls what's the mood like among Brazilians are they excited to to sweep out the corrupt dirty politicians and get both in our in there or are they beaten down in in weary\nI think they're more weary than a decisive in terms of going there and change and\nVery divided ... uh eighty percent of the vote or show up\nOr we may have less of a proportion this time\nOr one important feature here is how many voters will spoil their their vote will leave it blank will cancel do vote because that is important\nWhoever gets a fifty percent of the valley devotes is elected president there is an outside chance that that could happen this Sunday\nOr with both of them out when they more like the according to the late ... is that we go to a runoff\nBut the mood people are angry people are frustrated people feel betrayed by the political class in Brazil or\nRegardless if they are to laugh from the left from the rights of from the center people feel absolutely fed up\nWith politics with politicians and that there is no alternative because there is not going to be admitted very cool in Brazil and we're going to find our way through politics\nNow Brian I think we have your sky blind nice and clean now I'm both an hour oh has a history of violent

for international economics Brian winter is the editor in chief of America's quarterly and the vice president for policy at the American society and the council the ... of the Americas\nAnd Paolo ... is director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center and you had been sending us your message is one of the listeners\nDrew emails I was in northwest Brazil last month staying with a gay black friend he is all in for ... and our people are so fed up after the carwash scandal\nThey will do for anything that isn't part of the Workers Party now Monica before the break you were telling us about car wash the actual car wash in the broad\nOffensive corruption scandal or is it over ... have have all of the [noise] I don't want to mix metaphors but have older will have all the cars been overturned it opened up and cleaned out in a car wash\nWell it is winding down um so the bulk of it has already has already occurred well let me go back in time just a little bit because it is important to put into context to things\nThe most important um findings have love as you had to or of car wash worrying twenty Fifteen and twenty sixteen\nAnd at that time I'm president Dilma Rousseff of the Workers Party was Brazil's leader she had been reelected in twenty fourteen into was president at the time\nUm she was impeached in twenty six team\nAnd part of the reason for her impeachment there are many moving parts here but one of the moving parts was the fact that a she had lost control of hook of her coalition and her her coalition had\nUm a number of other political parties that war implicated in the car wash findings in the car wash probing the plea bargains\n'em and everything else that started to come out publicly in terms of this particular investigation\nShe wasn't she didn't she never did anything to actually stop the investigation which was really a positive thing\nUm but that was one of the things that actually lead to her downfall because the the impeachment that\nVery much politically motivated by they need that some of the political parties in her coalition had to try to at least slow ... if not stop it all together and this is a very important element when we look at the degree of polarization that currently exists in prevail\nBecause the people who still defend the workers' party instilled defend the P. T.\nMay go back to the impeachment of earth that as one major argument for why you know things that the Workers Party has been let's say unfairly treated in the way that the that that things have gone down\n[noise] Matt writes to us or on email I had a Brazilian friend years back who called his home country the greatest country that never was meaning that Brazil\nHas had such riches in terms of natural resources but it is not had the government or the leadership to make it a competitor with the United states up Paolo Matt makes a good point Brazil was\nCelebrated as the rising star not only of Latin America of emerging economies around the world compared to India and China we mentioned it at the top but now horrible recession horrible corruption what happened in Brazil where was the Brazil the debt hosted the Olympics in was and was on the way up\nWell I think Brazil believe too much in the magic that it's a country predestined to be great and forgot to do the necessary things you do in order to build that country or one of the major be trails is precisely the workers bar too far to the was led\nBy a man born into poverty a that a a bill this very successful party on initially ethics in politics\nThere is this sense after Brazil\nA ... a a basic ... riding a wonderful wave in international economics producer of commodities had a wonderful moment Barbara too was reduced and that is what led to this impression that Brazil was unstoppable well\nA than reality hits\nA ruler made a very bad choice in his successor\nA and a a lot of a shot to came\nAnd the magic would disappear or what we have today is a consequence and this is what I think what that she'll be positive and all of this we cannot blame others for our problems\nThis crisis was produced in Brazil by Brazilians are and another thing that this book should be positive\nIs the fact that the states in Brazil is basically broke\nThey only have run off the money ah all that dream now has to be has ended and the nightmare has to be confronted from a ... reality ... basis where the government has run all the money we have to adjust the economy the measures necessary to do that are very\nOff an unpopular and none of the candidates have explain exactly what how they plan to come from the ...\nNow Bryan winter you're with us from Brazil or I read an article Bryan that you recently wrote\nWhere you were asked by a friend I think to sum up Brazil in two sentences and I'm going to paraphrase a little bit your answer ultimately your conclusion was too many BS privileges for the elite not enough good leaders what exactly did you mean by that tourists conclusion\nIf you look around right now at the field of candidates there's there's one thing that all Brazilians agree on which is that they find the candidates running for president to be on inspiring um the vast majority of people\nSomebody rather than voting for somebody and the consequences of that is is just I mean it's it's stunning for somebody who lived\nHere during that era when things were going really well which you've mentioned Todd [noise] the degree of cynicism the degree of disbelief that people have in their system of government is just amazing and you know it's part of a global trend I mean we've seen\nThis happen in places like turkey in Hungary and elsewhere around the world\nBut this democratic recession as some people have called it really is especially strong here and that makes sense because Brazil is taking a bigger beating um in terms of its economy and in terms of the reputation of its politicians because of this\nCorruption scandal than virtually any other western democracy in recent years there was a poll by the Pew Research center and twenty Seventeen that\nFound that just eight percent of Brazilians say representative democracy is a very good form of government that was the lowest of thirty eight countries that that that you surveyed\n... and that just shows you the climate here right now and the reason why many people fear that both denaro if elected would basically have carte blanche to take a and you know hard right turn earned it could involve the curtail moment of civil civil liberties and and and other things\nI I and my time I'm this week um I've had meetings with people from civil society and the press and others who you know these are serious people not prone to panic or anything like that who are talking openly about the possibility of exile\nAnd that's just blew me away I mean it it's a Brazil that I've read about in history books you know going back to previous periods of military rule Nineteen sixty four was the last two I thought that that was\nReal Brazil that had been firmly relegated to the history books and\nYou know maybe maybe maybe they are maybe it is getting a little\nBit melodramatic in some quarters but but they're real fears and and and people are scared right now well\nBrian you mentioned a statistic that was disturbing only eight percent of Brazilian said representative democracy is the best form of government now I'm an right to the point is ... emails us\nWhy are we so concerned about the right versus elect in Brazil ... is another

Kavanaugh hearings he angrily defended cabin on he said the other day in the hearings I think everybody thought I'm a single white male people want me to shut up and I won't shut up and he was red faced and he was furious on behalf of\nBrett Kavanaugh and presumably white men everywhere but contrast that with the Lindsey Graham of twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen and even twenty twelve hears Lindsey Graham at a roast dinner in twenty Seventeen poking fun at Paul Ryan speaker of the house but making a point\nYou're forty six years you've been the vice presidential nominee of the Republican Party here the speaker of the house the Republican controlled house you're smart\nYou know the budget that we're in for you have a good temperament and disposition and the judgment of Solomon you are\nDead men walking in his [noise]\nNow back in twenty twelve Lindsey Graham the same Lindsey Graham used to warn about the future of the Republican Party he would quit to me at any reporter who would listen we can't make angry white guys fast enough\nTo survive as a Republican Party in the future meeting Republicans\nHad to broaden their appeal to women to minorities to Hispanics flash forward to the Lindsey Graham of this week I'm a white male and I'm not gonna take it anymore stunning what does this transformation Lindsey Graham ...\nIn the Trump beer at said EU about where we were in in in where we are yeah I mean I think it\nTells me that the divide is deepening any idea tells me that the the lines that were kind of drawn to you that you saw in the two thousand election and I say that we've lived with sense\nThey're only going deeper and the moment you talked about there and twenty twelve after the twenty twelve election\nThere was as you remember that certainly the the Republican sort of establishment nationally looked at the Mitt Romney's last a Brock Obama included what you know what Lindsey Graham did it demographically the way the country had been divided up for the last Fifteen or Twenty years was not going to work for them long term\nThey came up with that autopsy report they were going to change on immigration all this stuff\nDonald Trump comes along and violates every tenet of this of this autopsy and wins\nAnd I think it it's not just that he won the general election led to a huge part of it but the fact that he was able to sweep through the Republican Party like the primaries like he didn't twenty sixteen\nTold Republicans like Lindsey Graham and of course easy to forget but Lindsey Graham did run for president in twenty sixty one of the sixteen or Seventeen Republicans who did and failed miserably and I think that's it I think that lesson there of going head to head against Trump of dismissing him completely at the beginning of that race Graham called him a kooky called him a bunch of things\nUm in twenty sixteen and then watching how within the Republican world how Trump resonated with voters it told them boy there's something about our own voters our own party our own tribe\nThat we didn't quite understand maybe we didn't want to understand ... granted more than just name calling in a primary he told Republicans we are finished if we nominate Donald Trump that he is the death knell of this party so\nWeb streaming is made possible by the University of Tennessee where research changes lives from developing plastic alternatives to taking flight with mine controlled drones learn more at everywhere dot Tennessee dot edu\nIt'd be a senator from one more term or is he is he converted what's he think I mean look there's and there's all sorts of theories about this and I don't know but I'll give you a couple of them that that that that jump out at me one is what you're saying yeah he's got to worry about a Republican primary every Republican one of the lessons\nOf Donald Trump's rise and his enduring popularity with Republican voters one of the lessons\nTo Republican officeholders as you are taking a major major risk if you are seen as separating yourself from this president your next primary especially if you're Lindsey Graham and you already have a history of sort of being a being antagonistic towards the right here and they're so grim has to worry about that there's also the theory that hey part of this is\nLindsey Graham trying to play the influence game if you if you're real friendly to Trump in public if you sing his praises or if you change your tone on Trump the way he as if you're a golf with him maybe if you're Lindsey Graham and you have some issues particularly on foreign policy and national security this is a way to influence them but I think one of the other lessons to is it is again\nLindsey Graham looking at Trump in twenty sixteen and saying this is absolute political suicide for the Republican Party to go down this road\nAnd then seeing down from when the election I Know it was narrow but seeing the one I think ... Lindsey Graham and just brought more broadly tells Republicans that this tribalism is so much deeper than we realized it was and it changes what you're able to do and what you can do politically\nKennett last is the question given the demographics of this country Lindsey Graham I'll remind you one last time said himself over and over we can't make angry white guys fast enough we can't manufacturing and fast enough\nTo be a party the future I Wonder if\nWhen he closed his eyes at night whether he's\nChanged his mind about that or not James sent us an email I frequently have yard signs for political candidates in my front yard and because there are good candidates on both sides of the aisle I usually have candidates from both major parties and I am surprised at how often several of my neighbors express their genuine irritation with me\nThat I can endorse candidates from both parties very tribal instead of an evaluation on the merits and Steve you're nodding because that does not sound surprising\nTo you yeah ... what he's describing his ticket splitting yet to be and political science they did the voters who go and they have a Democratic president Republican for Congress they split up the ballot\nJust election two election that that the number of people out there who do that who split their ticket has been shrinking shrinking and you're working a single digits right now and that that is just the rise of polarization of tribalism let's get\nBack in our way way back machine are red and blue way way back machine go back in history with you Steve corner you so much of what your book is about uh we talked about the speaker of the house Newt Gingrich who are on led to believe did not talk to you for this book although although he certainly could have a when he was a young rabble rousing congressman\nWho was willing to defy the normal rules of congressional decorum in May of Nineteen eighty four he delivered an insult on the floor of the house to the end times speaker from Massachusetts the legendary Tip O'Neill\nMy partner speaker as you as you point out to us again yesterday are in charge of this house\nIf you are saying to me the urine postmaster isn't capable of delivering from one member to another the male and the system you run\nThen I think you may want to appoint a commission to look into a post office\nNow maybe a veiled insult there that might take a little bit of parsing but give it a back story and why Newt Gingrich was slinging an insult at\nWell respected and legendary Tip O'Neill yeah there there in in hindsight now you look back Thirty years and you play you may say well what was the big deal the idea was Democrats had run the Congress at that point for Thirty years\n[noise]\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Rhodes Scholar a not for profit offerings learning adventurous for adults and natural settings across the country learn more at R.

assault in high school and another instance of sexual misconduct in college there's nothing in it that we didn't already know said Senator Chuck Grassley adding\nThere's also no contemporaneous

the product of an incomplete investigation\nThat was limited perhaps by the White House Dianne Feinstein ...\nOn your NPR station I Want to turn back to Steve ...\nIn just a moment but before we do a quick appeal for some help with the program in the works for next week here on one day we spend a lot of time yesterday to talking with women about how society views angry women and there's a broad range of opinion but most of the women were hearing from our progressive and liberals\nIf you're a conservative woman tell us how your seeing this moment what have you got to say how\nDo you want to

eight five five to three six one a one a that eight five five to three six one two one two will make sure to get your stories on the air part of the national conversation in the days ahead\nHere on one a while we're talking for the most part about what politician said\nAnd did in the Nineteen Ninety so how do they define their ideologies for the American people it's not just Washington that's polarized we've been asking listeners\nFor memorable moments from politics in the nineties and and here's one\nAnd the president is right\nIn many ways we are a shining city on it\nBut the hard truth is that not everyone is sharing in this city's splendor and glory\nThere is this fair Mr President\nAnd the faces that you don't see in places that you don't visit\nYour shining city\nAnd I believe you're hearing from Mario Cuomo their former governor of New York maybe at the peak of his political career the shining city on the hill well here's what I was going for another moment or the moment that listeners sent us from oh gosh the early nineties I take you back towards any overhaul\n[noise]\n\nSoon to be president President Bill Clinton June Nineteen Ninety to harm the Arsenio Hall show remember him with our city hall [laughter] before that year presidential\nCandidates didn't really appear on nighttime talk shows at all so that was something you talked about how politicians grappled with media coverage during those years a Steve that was a moment not just because of the president appeared on Arsenio Hall but he seemed to offer an alternative\nTo gosh even Pat Buchanan speech there is a religious war in this country very stark very serious and and a lot of Americans agreed with him here was Bill Clinton in sunglasses just having a whole lot of fun the guy you want at the party\nWas also the moment that was June Nineteen Ninety two when Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall's show Bill Clinton was actually running\nNot in first or second but in third place in the presidential race it that way at first it was a Ross Perot place was Bush the incoming president in third place buried\nI was about twenty five percent was Bill Clinton in so they were his team he remembered the bill Clinton who emerged from the Democratic primaries in Ninety two had was thought to be an electable he'd gone through the scandal about Gennifer Flowers he'd gone through the scandal about avoiding the Vietnam draft he'd gone through the I didn't inhale moment it's sort of hard in this image of\nSlick willy the guy who's going to you know lawyer Li try this scheme is way out of\nA out of everything and so they were trying his campaign was to change his image and he had this you know obviously winning personality and they wanted to showcase it and they wanted to get around interviews with you know traditional news interviews where every question was going to be about gender flowers and the draft and all that so here was a way you go on a syndicated nuts\nWas very hard at that moment you're showcase a different side of your personality and and it was Ninety two it wasn't just starts anew Ninety two was the year\nThe media had been expanding in so many ways in that media expansion really met up with politics presidential politics I mentioned Perot who was running in first place at that point the entire Perot phenomenon began\nIn February Ninety two on the CNN show Larry King Laurie can and and Larry King would sometimes have politicians on and sometimes aging celebrities and they spend an hour and they take calls\nAnd Ross Perot was on and February Ninety two and he said you know if the if there are volunteers out there who will put me on the ballot in all fifty states I'll run for president as an independent\nIn just from that\nA movement sprung up organically across the country to do in Texas about two months later volunteers submitted two hundred and fifty four thousand signatures to get Ross Perot on the ballot and he was running in first place by June and he was doing talk shows\nClinton was doing talk shows there was a Clinton Jerry Brown primary debate on the Phil Donahue show the syndicated daytime talk show 'em in in George W. Bush this was a generational aspect to sixty eight year old George W. Bush the president running for reelection his spokesman said after Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall's show that night well\nWe won't be doing anything like that\nAnd Arsenio Hall went on his show the next night and just tore into Bush that went went after it was beneath the presidency yeah it was beneath the presidency to go on a nighttime talk show where people goof around and make a you know goof adolescent jokes that's not\nThat's not for a president and and Bill Clinton said Oh yes Oh yes it is said and by the end of the campaign that Bush wasn't do in our city oh by the end of the campaign but he was doing you know morning shows on TV in ... he was starting to sort of get the message\nUm politicians now managed media in a very very different way now going on a late night talk show is par for the course because people want you to display your personality Brock Obama had a winning personality an affable nice guy and used it\nTo great political effect everywhere from Jimmy Fallon to Stephen cold there there isn't a show that Iraq Obama didn't go on successfully\nUm Donald Trump in his campaign did the same as well because he is extremely comfortable on live television even if somehow less likeable than\nThan maybe Barack Obama was but but the mores of how you reach the public has changed just radically they changed completely since the moment when George W. Bush said we're not going to lower the presidency by going on or send your home and I think too you can you can draw a line between we were talking about Gingrich earlier\nIn the rise of Gingrich net moment with a meal what that moment came from was Gingrich looking for a way around at the time where the dominant sort of media platforms and they were just the broadcast networks and Gingrich\nThird term congressman from Georgia said I'm not going to be able to get my message out across ABC CBS NBC because they don't pay attention to me he CSPAN\nGive CSPAN was five years old in the early Nineteen eighties and he used the late night speeches and CSPAN to seek out find and develop a relationship with a new audience draw a line from that and how Gingrich or legal to build his career his rise in the house around that fast forward to Donald Trump or to Donald Trump do\nIt television obviously a part of it but really in the campaign social media Twitter\nDonald Trump identified through Twitter away to go around not just the news media but the entertainment media is well that's that's so engaged in politics now into directly get his message across to voters to get around it I see what Gingrich was doing in the eighties with CSPAN and Trump was doing with Twitter\nAnd then I think there's a real common thread there well let's go back then in the way way back machine one more time\nTo Nineteen Ninety nine Donald Trump was people forget was involved with politics even at the time he flirted mentally and even in reality with presidential run long before he was ever successful he went on meet the press back in Nineteen Ninety nine and had some thoughts about somebody that we've already talked\nWing politician in the Republican Party\nFor his ahead little of I guess he's an anti Semite\nHe doesn't like the blacks who doesn't like the gays I I it's just incredible that anybody can embrace this guy and maybe I'll get four or five percent of the vote and it'll be a really staunch right wacko out I'm not even sure if it's right it's just a lack of of and I just can't imagine that anybody can take them seriously", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "04"}
