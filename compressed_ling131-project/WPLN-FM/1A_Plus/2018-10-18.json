[laughter]\nA young man Michael Brown late in the street for four hours\nWeeks of protests followed with thousands of demonstrators from Ferguson and beyond police fired tear gas\nDeployed riots [noise]\n\n\nAnd they even set up a so called five second rule where anyone who stood still for more than five seconds was arrested [noise]\n\nHow did the ... and go from Minneapolis to Ferguson, Missouri those protests and the police response to them caught in the caissons I\nHe was a community organizer from Baltimore working for the Minneapolis public schools he drove from Minnesota to Missouri nine hours each way to protest soon he was making that trip a lot and eventually he quit that job and moved to Missouri to organize full time\nToday for years later activism is just part of my caissons identity he also hosts the podcast pod saved to people he ran unsuccessfully to be the mayor of Baltimore and his new book is called on the other side of freedom the case for hope during the cast and welcome to one day\nIt's so good to be here tell us about the book's title on the other side of freedom what's the title about what are you trying to stay there\n[noise] yeah you know I used to travel much more around the country talking to young people talking to to older people and what I realized that we have a deep understanding of decided freedom so we know on this side of freedom\nA third of all the people killed by strangers killed by police officer we know that we're as more people from marijuana than all violent crimes combined we know so much about ... freedom in we have a lot of work to do that I wanted to talk about like how do we get to the other side of freedom what did it look like what does it feel like how do we get there with the strategy in the plane\nBecause I Know that when I think about what freedom is that its course and not only the absence of oppression but the president of justice enjoy that we can get rid of all the bad things and that doesn't mean that the good things automatically come to bear we have to fight for those\nSo that was where the underside of freedom came from it in the case for hope is that I think the hope is the fuel for all of this and hoping that belief that are tomorrow's can be better than that today's that when people say the system is broken and then in response and people say oh no it was designed to be like this my takeaway is that it was designed and because people made it up we can make something better and that is the work of hope\nThere are a lot of questions that our listeners wanted to put to you about the work that you're doing about the black lives matter movement and so on I definitely want to ask you about today's political scene but before we dive into\nAll of that I'm just kind of curious to know how you are [laughter] you've been a very busy due to the last four years how are you how is life treating you\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Boehner with the bonus certified craftsmen program a network of hardwood flooring contractor committed to expertise in customer service contract to locate her and more information or at Boehner dot com\n[noise] and from math ... committed to changing lives through math by building math achievement problem solving and critical thinking skills for thousands of students every day in nine hundred franchise locations matinees him dot com slash NPR\nFishes won a I'm Joshua Johnson we are speaking to dream of catching the host of the podcast pod saved to people and the author of the new book on the other side of freedom the case for hope\nOne by graphical thing I did want to ask you briefly you right in the book that teaching was the most important thing you ever did how did teaching helped lay the groundwork for activists [noise]\nHow about you know it's funny I don't think of myself with very old but I taught a decade ago my my students do students are like twenty Twenty one now too so while I\nYou know teaching was incredible not only because he was urging everyday like every single day I had to shut up and I talked to scream at every single dad to show up and I went to ... to my students had to be as prepared and I taught sixteen Ninety and a hundred and twenty minute classes which is a whole lot of math or anybody who's ever grown eleven year old\nI what I learned there were a couple of things one was like how to take really complex information and break it down into\nPieces that uh to be consumed and can be repeated back so my skill with like would I deliver was not only had to like get kids to understand like when the crazy ones but like I did teach discreet skills like you know what\nJust how to take apart these big things to make them bite size and then have students to be able to play with them in a way that they could put them back and rearrange on their on their own or the second was like really understanding what it means to\nLike do work that will have an immediate impact but we'll have a long term impact so I remember I'll never forget teaching negative numbers they struggle they like they can get in like anything lower than zero that like I don't get it by the end they can fight anybody around like how to solve the most complicated equation and they like deeply understood it\nAnd that was like understanding like the arc of how to build capacity and like I learned that the third thing is I mean they got the best teachers with the ... just walk in the classrooms and they know the gift existed long before they got there\nAnd that like I work is to help\nStudents understand that they can access the gift long after I'm gone after the teacher's gone with the worst teachers do is walk in the classrooms and make people believe that the gift only exists in their presidents and like that is I think in such a corollary to organizing that when I travel anywhere where I'm In my own community\nThat like what I'm trying to do to help people find the gifts that they have because they already have them they might not know they might not believe they might not know how to use them\nAnd what I can do is help them find them and then use them long afterward gone\nLet's let's get some questions about the black lives matter movement Morgan writes black lives matter is purposefully without a central leader so how does he you direct\nTV with his role was in the movement what has he done to ensure that people do the names of the three black women who actually started ... I think Morgan's referring to Patrice floors ... and Alicia Garza who helps propagate the black lives matter ... after the Trayvon Martin shooting direct\nYeah certainly they got the movement the movement is an expansive space and I write about this in the book is that uh you know for those of us who are industry in Ferguson we're mindful that there was nobody who founded the space there was nobody who started the protest there was no one to three ten people who\nCaught us all to the street who organize everybody was so beautiful about the protests that\nUh it was organic there were a set of people who came out every night thousands who made the protests last and you have to remember\nThat we will see for four hundred days and most people remember as a long weekend what's unfortunate is that there's this narrative that if that has come up that as a race so many people that suggested there was like a small group of people who started everything who came in St Louis to organize every body the organizations did that work\nAnd that's just simply not true someone I think about like how I use my platform how I think about my work\nThat I'm mindful that I was one of many people in the book a highly so many people who were industry in St Louis who did incredible work for whom without you wouldn't there would be no protests are so that is important to me and then the second part is that I Know that the platform doesn't only exist for me that\nUh one of the important things about having the platform and access is that not only do I try to make sure that the truth is president everyone but I also know that I'm not the only person that can bring the truth so you don't know the people who said all the protesters every night or the\nThe people who got people out of jail or the people who helped organize some of the biggest actions that people have sprayed across the country like you've never heard those names and in the book I Try and write about those people too that I Know them because I was there we were in the middle of a street together\nBut this narrative that there's like a small set of people who like started every thing in the movement or that there's a small set of organization to like\nWhat the catalyst for the protest is just not a true narrative\nThere's always this tension with movements that have certain people certain leaders should become more prominent\nWith the concern about but who profits off to cause I mean there are some who would critique the book and the podcast as a way to profit off of black lives matter how do you respond to that and I also wonder if there is any plan to use any of it\nOh yes it's interesting I think I'm always shut eye you know I feel like I live a pretty public life and I'm always shocked um by some of the\nThe way the question gets asked to like it's public that or a portion of all the proceeds went to the end of ... a portion of all the pre order sales went to the N. double ACP legal Defense Fund that was\nPublic I did it 'cause it was important and it was my way of saying that like I Want you to buy the book but the book also like I Want the process of buying the book to also do more work than just buying the book raised to like that so I think about the book specifically\nBut in general in the face like I'm mindful of ... when we started camping zero which is like our our biggest project starting twenty Thirteen ah we actually didn't participate in the nonprofit funding like the nonprofit sort of research for funding specifically because of the question that you asked\nSo over the past three years we raised a about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars per year which is\nNot a lot of money and the grand scheme of nonprofits and we did it so that\nWe could just raise enough money to do the work that we that was important right so we created the first I was a database of police union contracts at first it public database of use of force policies continue to do a lot of data work that hasn't been done ever before continue to support organizes around the country and really disagree projects\nNo I I Know paid staff I'm not pay you know I don't know salary from the stuff so we try to do it as like\nWith just the bare necessities so that it's not this question of like profit uh\nAnd with the cash you know like I could have the packets could have just been my voice but I don't think that makes sense so I invited Brittany Sam and Clinton being a part of it they get paid and the part of the ... because I think that that makes sense um and it's not like some you know huge money maker but it does allow us to like be able to be in a place where we don't have to\nRely on a nonprofit a complex to like fund our work to do this really well\nAnd you know it's a guy at\nThe way that I exist in the world right now is like not necessarily a sustainable way I'm not by state allows me to like\nOh no no I mean like I don't have you know it's like a [laughter]\nNow late at night and that's what I have a salary but um you know when I quit it was really rough it was like you know I didn't have health insurance like you know I'd defaulted on my student loans like it was a really rough um it was rough\nI only this only a couple of months ago the first time I've actually lived alone since the protests I've ever since you've been saying in the basement of a mess deck and parents are in the past three years right so\nYou know so that's not us as you know who wants to get married in the in the basement of their right second parents that's not sustainable to\nSay but it's like it's the right way that I Want to be in the work right now right that like there are these narratives of like oh I made a good feeling in dollars and it's like well no you see me on the news you came in a pod cast you like to see me out of an event that means a lot to you and like that automatically means of wealth to some people and that's just not\nThe case of that I've had high incomes and before you know that the ... income and wealth is pretty significant right oh I'm so people have been like really confused by that\nLet's talk a little more about policing one of the members of the one eight text club writes police hold a significant position of power in the legal system they should be held to a higher standard than those without power but instead they are held to a lower standard and given special treatment and a free pass in our courts and society\nContrast that with another tax club or who wrote as time goes on society will bring about necessary reform but to denigrate and disregard the entire police force as an institution is ludicrous\nHe I think you know I think for ... ... thousand years we slit people's arresting call their health care we literally drain people's blood down and we were like ... it's going to drain out all the impurities and people were like oh\nKnow they didn't have any blood writing like that actually isn't a solution but we did it for two thousand years it was one of the most popular medical procedures\nBut it didn't work so if the goal was it the people's lives just like actually wasn't a good thing if the goal was to like pretend that you were doing good then like this was excellent and I think about policing it's like if the goal is to stop crime or like to do any of that work like it just isn't whether how no matter how you feel about the police that just isn't happening\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from progressive insurance offering a way to buy a home

donate to this NPR station\nBack now to our conversation was during the catch in his new memoir is called on the other side of freedom the case for hope let's talk about some of the more personal aspects of your life that you describe in the book there's a short\nIn the book page and a half were you talk frankly about your mom leaving the family when you were a toddler and the fact that you never have asked her why she left\nA leader in the chapter you write code I'm mindful that we remember pain and trauma differently than we were a member of joy and trial when we remember pain we are trying to protect ourselves\nThat will allow us to make it to tomorrow and it's the day after tomorrow unquote talk about how those kinds of traumatic or difficult experiences as a kid kind of helped to shape you as an adult particularly an adult who would gravitate toward active as\nYou know it's interesting ah this is the first time saying this because it just happened is that my mother read the book um and she texted me recently and it was I hate to re read the book we talk\nAnd I just haven't had like having them with right back it so hopefully I write back soon\nIs one of the reasons why I wrote this chapter in the ... I can remember and now with that and it's one of the reasons that I wrote the chapter was that I Know that we walk into every room bringing much more than we name and one of the things that I bring into every room is what does it mean to be worthy that if she could leave and it feels like anybody could leave\nAnd I like that is something I've had to sort of work within an grow with as an adult to make sure that that doesn't hurt me or other people and that's important as we think about what it means to organize is that like we're all walking into rooms and meeting people where they are part of meeting people where they are that we know where we are and like I think that that has to be like a\nA core part of it uh the the part that you read about like how we remember pain and I remember joy\nIs that for so many people you think about like the constraints would a million people who grow up in marginalized communities where there's poverty race or or any other aspect of their identity they they learn the constraints really well I Know I knew how much money we added a family and I knew would pass woman not to ask why new\nLike when we didn't have toys how to make fun outside and you know there are a lot of people talk about growing up poor but not Thad one of the hard part is when we grow up\nAnd sometimes we still only see a world of constraints somebody that can strengths become so great and the way that we've learned how to survive that we can start to imagine things beyond and if we're ever going to win like it'll be like a deep imagination that gets us to the other side\nAnd my mother never seen the right in the left is it the right has always re packaging old narratives for a new time the left we're always engaged in the most intense make believe that like we're always trying to tell a story about a world that nobody's ever seen before but we know it's possible you've never seen health care for all but like you believe that you've never seen a world where every woman has a right to choose but like we believe that that's real\nAnd like telling those stories actually really hard and there's no way to to be really good storyteller by the future that you've never seen if you aren't able to tell stories about the world that you live and how you entered the world\nYou also share fairly late in the book the fact that you are a survivor of sexual assault something that you write happen to you numerous times at a rather young age\nAnd you connect that was what you call the quiet quiet about the assault but also quiet about your own identity and your sexuality you've been out for some time in the book you write in part quote\nI think about the quiet instead of the closet\nBecause I've never written any part of myself from myself or others you go on to write quote but I grew up quieter about the parts of myself that I didn't think anyone would love the parts that I had never seen loved in others unquote how does that interact with the person you became\nYeah you know one of the reasons why I was in Port in for me to be out very very um [noise] I mean about for a long time but to be publicly out in a in a very\n... way when the protests began with like I didn't want any kid growing up who was also gay today that the only way to do this work publicly with to to be in the closet and\nAh you know that chapter started from this tree that I wrote a long time ago that was like just because you didn't know doesn't mean it wasn't real like I was in the quiet and not the closet\nAnd ah you know I I Walk into every room as a gay black man I'm like that is real to me it's important so there was no way for me to write a book about the work that we've done the work to all of us have collected with social justice or the work that we need to do without talking about a mile an identity now I wrote about the uh the sexual assault because it was real\nNow so it's not just you know it's not something that only I Know um [noise] but it was like sort of\nIt with free in some ways to finally just they and like not have to tiptoe around it and not be ashamed to say that this happened and and it was real and it was awful and\nYou know when I told when I when I finally taught a couple of years later they realized that he'd actually been sexually abusing like a whole set of kids who are even younger than me\nI'm so like you know speaking up actually made a difference in other people's lives and like that was important\nUm but I've had to like you know I write about in the book is that like my own relationship to my body I had to learn that had to learn what it meant to be in relation with other people and like it'd be one where we were periods and we both had the same amount of power because that wasn't the first experience with my body right as I wanted to just give language to that\nHow far do you think that that outlook is actually goes I mean I I'm Out I've been out from most of my career if not all of my career\nBut I Know that there's you know there's this aspect of what I Believe is referred to as an implied attribute where it's kind of known but not experience so there's a difference between me saying Oh yes I'm active with the national lesbian and gay journalist association\nAs opposed to me showing up you know a picture of me at a bar with my shirt off making out with a guy in the corner like it's a whole different kind of being out because people\nAre OK knowing it in the abstract but they don't want to know that you're actually like a gay person who does good things and that changes the conception do you find that there was a line in terms of identity versus full identification like okay you know\nLet's not say anything more about this let's not make them think any more about my that even they have to be\nYeah you know like ... I think we have to complicate this idea of like what it means to show up and gave the bike and there's not one way right that there's not two ways to be gate and like\nThere's a lot of pride parade is really really all that like yeah so like sometimes it is the way rainbow shoes right and sometimes it is just like going on a date and like that it and like those are both valid ways to jump in and the identity that I Am right uh so\nSo yeah there are definitely people who are frustrated me feel like I'm not gay enough in like\nThat I don't talk about gay issues is publicly as possible and like you know it's one of the things too that it's like well how much of my life to our lives to like other people can feel like it's real re so like I Know that you know we're working with the research right now trying to think about HIV testing that like one of the things that some new research suggests that\nIt's not that people and people don't get tested it's not they don't care about their health or that they're necessarily afraid of their results but that\nAh that they actually nervous about showing up at a facility and in cities that are that function as small towns and they're nervous about seeing somebody they went to high school with seeing like somebody's cousin friend re like that they actually are nervous about like well privacy really be private right and like how do you actually or how to use set up a testing mechanism that gets around that that to me it's fascinating\nAnd like so rhythm quiet work around that but like I've I don't feel like I Need to talk about every two seconds for people to be like they're actually cares about being gay right so the other thing I'll say that there's some people who I can really homophobic but like me and that's now for that I don't want to be like a safe spot for your ...\nYou also talk very frankly in the book about your bed for mayor of Baltimore your willingness to meet with President Obama and with the presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders you write that because of your willingness to engage quote\nThere were calls from within the protest community and from without accusing me of political grandstanding and labeling the a sellout unquote I Wonder how you are finding your way forward in these new endeavors whether it's politics hosting a podcast so any way you are part of a media so to speak\nAnd reconciling that was kind of the social justice activism work that you're still ... involved in is that\nIn both worlds as it were\nYou know it's like a both and drape that like you know it's interesting is that all those people who who come in for for quote participating in this system those are the same people running for office today right those are the same people who like\nI tell them everybody to vote who tell people not to vote and twenty sixteen who said that you're wasting your vote who said that politics to matter and like why would you support I remember I support Hillary in the Washington Post and people literally they were like you're wasting your employees I Can't believe you did that like president doesn't have any bearing this is just for show and it's like\nNobody is saying that now that is that ... that was a wild statement of the day and it's wild to say today so I think that people got a I it's unfortunate that like people getting it took all of the chaos that this president continues to\nThis is Ninety point three WPN land Nashville public radio Ninety One point five WTO ...

Blacksburg he's the show runner of Netflix bow jak horsemen it just released its entire season for streaming and I've watched just about all of that fifth season or roughly a let's talk about season five\nAh right let's get into it [laughter] it's getting dirty a big amount of season five is spent poking fun at the idea of the arch Moore show runner himself there's allied actually something along the lines of television it's a collaborative medium where one person gets all the credit\nAnd yeah I have to say a when that line came up at the table read it got much bigger laugh when I was expecting from the crowd of people over there\nI mean is it a little surreal to be a show runner on a press to her about a season of your show where one of the characters his show runner who are I'm sure would kill to be unimpressed or talking about a ... a little bit it's it's strange and\nYou know one of the things we wanted to talk about we're putting the season together is this weird moment we're in now of of the tourist show runner which is really like a new development in the last ten years or so\nUm and it it strikes me as very odd because I I don't think that I'm a a a brilliant genius\nWho you know touches a show and turned it into gold and it all just you know flows out of the pencil which is connected to my brain um ... it's a very collaborative process and we have people\nMaking it better every step of the way I have an amazing writing room\nThe cast brings so much the designs by at least they had all the uh directors brings so much of the episodes of the story board animators the editors um it it really it takes a village um\nSo it's odd but yes I'm doing all these interviews now talking about the show and talking about how I made the show because it's not how a TV show gets made at all and I think anyone\nWho presents that as our TV show gets made is trying to sell something\nBut then what exactly does the white board in the writers' room look like when you've got the word play the slap stick the ponds and the ... falls a overlaid on some of the deep dark themes that runs throughout the season and the show also has a memory yeah on memory his his mistakes for him\nIt's a very I mean in a lot of ways I think we write the show like a drama but we're a room full of comedy writers who we can't help but make it funny\nUm but we really are mostly interested in you know what is the character arc of the season what are the themes we're looking to explore what are the consequences of these actions we take it very seriously um you know but then in the middle of that we we remember like All right and those guys are talking octopus\nOr you know we're we're exploring familial trauma here uh but also this woman is dating or a man that is clearly just a three small boys stacked on top of each other under trench coat like little rascals [laughter] um so [laughter] this story is quite serious ah but the stories themselves can be quite silly you know one way I think of it\nIs is we're telling stories about real grounded characters in a crazy cartoon universe\nLots of animated shows have gotten made over the last Twenty years thanks to the success of The Simpsons largely\nAs Beau jak or who to whom do you think you owe your origins in television ... who do you see is your four\n[laughter] oh you mean by influencing yeah or do you mean literally the people who helped me have a television show and\nNot I mean the shows that you watch or or even if you weren't that into them the shows that made it possible for a show like Bo jak to be such a hit with American ... well I I think\nYou know obviously the the the giants as The Simpsons and I think it would be disingenuous for me to claim that that show had had no influence on\nMe or my show or the success of my show\nYou know one at one of the best comments I got on the the first season of Bo jak if someone said it felt like a season long version of a sad episode of The Simpsons um but also when I was pitching the show I I really wanted it to exist outside of the the bubble um\nOr the perceived bubble of animated TV you know I said ah we're going to ... when we start season one you're gonna watch it and at first it's going to feel like a typical animated show like a a Simpsons or South Park\nBut then over the course of the season as you realize what's happening is going to feel more like a girls or even a Mad Men um and and so I I wanted this to feel more like a drama the um and to really\nTake things seriously a in a way that people don't expect animation too even though I think a lot of animated shows actually do take things very seriously\nUm but but but those shows were certainly influences as well\nAt one of the main attractions of your show for me are the amazing voice performances that you have oh yeah well our net as Beau jak Amy today are credible artist Carolyn the sort of aging Hollywood manager producer cat ah and and that a lot of others to even have a Keith Olbermann in there at some\nYeah I'm ... one of the first people we cast [laughter]\nAs I was cast her whale as a newscaster well uh we we had in the script to um you know a a Keith Olbermann whale type and are casting director Lynda la montage and said I think we can get Keith Olbermann to play this role [laughter] really and we called them it was like yeah sounds like fun um and he's fantastic we\nKeep bringing it back season after season and you know one of my ah first memories of making the show and realizing how fun it was going to be was we had Keith on the phone from New York and we had them do all his lines um and then at the end we said we also get you making some whale noises\nAnd you know this is Keith Olbermann who I was a very serious man are goofing around going\nYou know making whale noises I thought this would be a fun show I think [laughter] well one of your other\nMain characters is Diane a Vietnamese American voiced by actress Allison Aubrey who is phenomenal now you gave us late interview recently and also a Twitter thread which is which is the way you have to do with these days and you mentioned\nOne ramification of that choice casting Alison breeze Diane that you tend to avoid referencing her Asian American is in the show now this season that's changed Diane does take a trip\nTo the Vietnam of her heritage and and talks a lot about how that affects her um how did her casting come about and how did you begin to have second thoughts about it\nWell um we cast Alison ah in in the first season and we were about I'm a third of the way into the season when we cast and we'd been working a with a different actress\nUm who had to drop out of the show all of a sudden because another show she was on got picked up and there was a contractual issue so she couldn't be lead on our show any more\nUm and so we really scrambled and Alison came in and we thought she was amazing and she's going to a great job ever since\nUm but more and more uh as I was looking around\nYou know how how this show is put together and and and the makeup of the cast it started to dawn on me that everyone in our cast was white and our main cast and a lot of\nThe recurring people were we were hiring were white as well and this was an unintentional thing uh that I was doing as\nA racist man um it was just I was not paying attention and we were casting these characters one at a time\nUh and I realized that oh this is my honor to start paying better attention to 'em and so you know since then we've tried due to cast a wider net and look particularly for for diverse voices\nOr try to have more people of color on the show but when it comes to Dianne specifically um you know I think there is a a real problem in this industry of casting white people in Asian roles\nAnd I was not a as aware of that when we first started the show as I Am now and so that's something that I Would do differently is casting a white person to play a prominent Asian character and you know as I said in these other interviews\nUm I think it's hurt the show because I think my own self consciousness has prevented us from telling Asian Stories I think because I guess I didn't want people to talk about this it felt like this is a mistake we made\nAnd if I can just you know avoid it or you know glide passed it then you know maybe this won't become an issue where this you know won't become the thing that I end up talking about in every interview and I I think that was a disservice to the character um because I I think it ended up\nYou know we we ended up treating her as just like a white character or as a race didn't matter\nAnd it's it's difficult that our show because in some ways race doesn't matter because there is also talking elephants and you know anti ... and and giraffes walking around so it's hard to say how is an Asian American humans experience that different from a white American humans experience but\nSupport for NPR comes

do without\nJoining us from NPR in New York is the owner of NYC cue cards while the fairest and he's worked three decades behind the scenes on shows including Saturday Night live while the fairest and welcome to one a\nA sex drive me Joshua thanks for it's great to be here how did you get into the cue cards business a while you know I went to uh Syracuse and I wanted to be a writer and major writing and moved to New York and to you know my brother was working at started a lot of farmers receptionist\nAnd ah they knew that you kind of guy so he recommended me even though my printing was terrible and ah ah I got the job and I do know I did it just get my foot in the door and to make riding connections\nAnd uh you know I did I did make somebody connections that I wrote for some cable shows but it was never enough to support myself so I kept under the cue cards and I got really good at doing cue cards very quickly\nAnd uh you know cut to twenty eight twenty nine years later I own my own company I've been doing it for that long and running a lotta shows\nSo clearly this was not the kind of writing that you had in mind but what was it about doing the cue cards that you liked\nYou know I I don't know I think one especially on Saturday Night live\nThe live aspect of it and being out there you know as close to the cameras as you can be without being on camera a and helping the actors and helping the guest stars or through the shows him through this hard show that they you know they ... a lot of them have never done life D before there was something very rewarding about that and\nUm I didn't crack under pressure of the changes and all that stress that was involved with that and that was something that they the show noticed and uh you know I rose up pretty quickly in the ranks\nTell us a bit about your company what shows does your company do cue cards for\nUh the are four main shows that are that are that tape all year our Saturday Night live um\nThe Tonight Show Jimmy Fallon late night with Seth Meyers and then we do Conan on the west coast as well those are four main shows um and then we will do some reality shows we do a master we do all the Project Runway that shoot and then we do to show any show that comes to that town that he's guards you know work on that\nWell what kinds of people do well at this line of work the first thing we look for is neat printing\nUm I think that was why when I was on a med school track years ago people were like yep we've seen your handwriting [laughter] so I Wonder exactly what you're looking for in terms of printing I as a cue cards I've seen her all written in all caps yes\nCorrect It's you know it's it's a this is it's a it's block lettering it's all caps um it's it's really about the spacing between ... between the letters and the word in a space in between the words and the space in between the sentences\nIt's not something like I Can't just bring somebody off the street and say okay start doing your guards it's almost like you know you need I Need to train that for like two or three weeks\nI'm just to get them there's so many different little things you have to learn\nUm two or three weeks of training yeah it is 'cause you 'cause it's it's not it's you can't just say you can't just tell them all the rules right you know what I mean I Can't just interview spared okay these are all the rules you need to learn memorized these new things come up every time there's new like\nEye is capitalized only in certain words it's not capitalized in drawing whereas where how to end the card a card should end on a period or ... or ... or a comma in if not that you know how to end it so that it slows the next car just so many different rules where you can only learn it by by doing it and practicing\nIt we're speaking to Wally ... and the founder of NYC cue cards the exclusive cue card provider in New York okay so let's say you're working for me for\nYou know the late night with Joshua Johnson and I come out to do my opening monologue I've just hired your company and I said Wylie I'm really excited to be working for you guys let's start building this relationship\nTell me the kinds of things that you are going to want to know for me to figure out how to be a good cue card vendor for me\nAll right first thing I ask you how's your eyesight\nWhy we near sighted or glasses okay so you were a glasses were your glasses on the show where you were contacts or you're not were either I don't really like contacts hourglasses okay so you're wearing glasses so you can see fine I won't have to if you didn't wearing glasses and you wanna wear contacts I could put your letters bigger so that you could see but that would also make less words in the card\nAnd it would make it harder for you to ... to flow to the ... like if you're ... especially if you're telling jokes\nSo I Would recommend glasses or contacts for you if you know if you want to so you're gonna wear your glasses you'll be fine reading cards and then I Would just you know we would we would have versus where I Would practice with you if you've never read cue cards before that something you'd want to practice\nWhat's the main thing that I Need to think about if I'm reading cue cards from you\nOr look directly at the cue cards don't look away because that'll that'll look like you're reading the cue cards\nHow do you mean it looked as rapidly as well if you were doing a sketch they say you were doing a sketch with your bad leader\nAnd I had cue cards near the bad leader and positioned in a way that you would want to play to those two cards now if you were looking at the cue cards and then at the bandleader going back and forth between the card in the bed later the audience would be like oh he's obviously reading something\nBut if you just played those few cards it would look on camera like you were talking directly to that person I'm ... directly above the camera above the camera above the camera so yeah so I'll I we were opens depending on where you are in position to the camera\nI'll make the cards the right the lettering the right side so that you look directly at that card it looks like you're looking right into the camera\nShow your cue card holders are kind of part of the technical direction to the blocking of a scene in terms of figuring out where the performers need to look to look proper\nThat's exactly right especially with Saturday Night live\nThat's what I that's my main job but I'm there on Thursdays from Fridays that's all we do all day is block sketches\nAnd I'll be out there with one set of cards working with the actor's working with the host figuring out where I'm going to put the cars and I work with the director of the stage managers well we're all kind of confirmed and I think I think I Need the cards here and then I'll ask the actors if they need an extra set somewhere else where I maybe didn't think of just want to make sure that they're covered were there\nOh what does a typical work week at SNL look like for someone who's doing cue cards for that show do you just come in Saturday afternoon and scribble furiously unfilled eleven thirty five PM\nI Wish it were that a simple [laughter] now we we start on Thursday we start Russell's on Thursday and Thursdays a light day\nSo the music the musical group ... for the first half of the day and then we'll ... we'll be in there about noon and will print well rehearsed maybe like three or four sketches and will only put one one set of each sketch because I have to figure out how many sets we need so there's no reason to print more\nAnd it it'll change from Thursday the sketches we do on Thursday we'll go through a rewrite session on Thursday night and most most of the time will be completely written from Thursday and friday\nAnd then friday is the same process except we do about eight or nine sketches same process reprint but then on friday we have to do we have to make copies we call it ... the cards so it makes sense and then we I mean that we do that we don't have the we don't have the luxury of waiting until Saturday to dupe the friday sketches because Saturday show day\nSo everything's print that I have about eight people there on friday just yeah basically writing all day I have the fun job I'm Out on the set blocking working with the actors having fun they're sitting underneath the bleachers from eleven o'clock to uh sometimes you know twelve or one o'clock in the morning just printing cards so long it's a long day for them\nWhat kind of person would want to take that kind of a job it doesn't sound like a very glamorous way to be near the TV business are you lower you mostly employing people who are looking for a foot in the door or do you have like veteran cue card writers working for ...\nThere's a little bit of both um mostly um\nPeople that are trying to get a footnote I encouraged that I I Try to tell them cue cards is not a career I I did make it a career for myself\nBut there's not much room if you want to do it great for your lives that's awesome but you should be looking to do something else I'm encouraging them I'm helping them I'm introduce them to people that want they than in a career that they want to do mostly most of it's entertainment related\nBut yeah you sit those long days or friday but that leads to Saturday where ever heard that they may come out from behind the scenes and never her sing with me 'cause I Can't\nI Can't hold for sketches at one time you know four sets of cars at one time so I Need other people out there and then that's kind of the fun part of it\nThis is Ninety point three WPN land National Public radio Ninety One point five W ... in Ninety One point seven W.

A. M. U. dot for\nThe call I Wonder if we could pick up with that last question I asked\nCasey Kendra tweeted what I Would like to see is all of the Democrats and Republicans voted out of Congress they are so polarized we need to start over\nHow much do you get a sense that the pure polarization\nOf today's politics is just changing the way voters approached this year's midterms I mean you know Nancy Pelosi's named still comes up quite a bit on the campaign trail she's a of an obvious kind of a hot button for many Republican voters but it is that working in terms of making people show up or is it just turning people off\nYou know a lot of people might be an are frustrated with politics and the country but we're seeing the opposite effect\nNot keeping people home or or voting for some third party coalition in fact it's people strapping on the T shirts and going as hard as they can\nI Do in their political corners I mean the fact is midterms are usually about activist they're usually about the hardest core a people within the party but in fact we're seeing the potential for a surge this year in turnout I spoke to Michael McDonald who's a professor at the University of Florida who's really\nOne of the preeminent turnout experts in the country maintains a turnout database he expects there to be a turnout of about forty five fifty percent of eligible voters this year that doesn't sound like a lot but it would be the highest level for mid term since the mid Nineteen sixties\nAnd that is really spurred on by\nAll of this high interest we're seeing high turnout in primaries in in special elections and you know frankly you've seen Democrats really fired up to vote against this president and we've seen that according to a Pew sixty percent of people say the president is a factor in their vote and that's higher than it's ever been\nA wonder wanna summers what your take is on that in terms of the the potential playbook for Democrats first of all let's just said a little context is focused on the house for example how many seats with the Democrats need to flip the house\nShirts that Democrats would need twenty three seats in order to take control of the house of representatives and right now most public pull in when we look across the landscape suggests that\nThey're doing they're making good efforts and things are looking good for them right now one thing that I've noticed as I've been talking to folks you work on the Democratic side of the aisle who are professional political folks is they're spending a lot of money to make sure that their voter turnout and particularly looking appetites\nUp in a presidential election year but are more likely to stay home and I'm an off year or mid term here and there was a reason for that\nTypically when we look at the electorate that shows up for mid term elections it's typically older whiter and more Republican tell things that you see Democrats spending a lot of money and a lot of time on the ground trying to turn out younger voters those millennials voters of color or Latino African Americans and Asians\nWho are more likely to vote for Democrats are also more likely to stay home and ...\nIs there a certain benchmark wanna for what Democrats would consider for lack of a better word a blowout slide you use the goal just to get a fifty percent plus one or is there a larger like a stretch goal but the Democratic party is aiming for\nWhat I'm hearing from most people including Ben ray Lujan congressmen who chairs the demographic democratic congressional campaign committee is they don't think this is going to be a blowout year they feel confident and their chances of taking back the house\nTurning the house ... but I don't think most people most members of Congress were involved in this would say that there's going to be a huge blue waves crashing over a pack of some tendency if there had been like that they're focused on delivering that\nTwenty three at turning the house bill in the message I keep hearing from them as they want to do that as a balance of power right now Republicans control every branch of government and they want to restore balance of power to this administration\nYou know this idea of a blue wave was the focus of an email from Marty who wrote I'm all about the blue wave but I'm afraid that between voter disenfranchisement lingering gerrymandering and possible foreign interference we're about to be pumped again\nDominican let me ask you about some of the polling water some of the main trends in national polls right now in terms of how the Democrats and Republicans might do well\nWhen we look at our NPR PBS NewsHour Marist polling Democrats have had an advantage on what's known as the congressional ballot who would you prefer to be a two run Congress ... the Democrat and your district or the Republican the ... in your district\nYou know we've had an advantage for Democrats anywhere from seven to twelve points over from the summer until now\nOr other polling other public bowling shown it to be double digits that's about the range that Democrats feel like they would be able to take at least those twenty three seats in the house and I look at some other factors to just look at the landscape and the playing field and when I was gamed out or how many seats would be up for grabs this year\nI found that there are ... seats that were a competitive to potentially competitive despite all the talk of cabinet or you know that confirmation battle in ... Republicans and it certainly did\nOnly six of those seats are democratic held seats Seventy four seats are of the potentially competitive to competitive landscape are held by Republicans no matter what you look at that and you know if the Democrats win half of those that's the house\n[noise] glad to hear from some of you with regards to your concerns about the midterms including about the nature of polling in general do medical I Love you to respond to this comment from a listener who left a note in our inbox\nI'm Alan from Ashville North Carolina and I'm frustrated with the elections with not having enough holes in down ballot races even even the U.S house but state house and stuff because if it's a close election I Want to vote Democrat\nAt least at the federal and state level but it it's a good weekend that I Want to vote a third party greener libertarian\nOr write my own in there and you know the razor close or not if it's a if it's true it if my vote might be the deciding vote and I need a all I Need some polls do art to decide and it it actually changes my vote the old change my vote\nAlan thanks for your comment to me to go that cracks me up or if\nHe wants to run for office he should run for office if he wants to\nSince then he should do so I get a pragmatic approach though and I think a lot of\nYou know establishment Democrats would argue that they wish there were a lot more voters like him who voted in Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania for the Democrat instead of voting for the third party candidate now when it comes to polls look\nThere is a huge problem in this country when it comes to a polling generally and then when you go and drill down into the state level or district level or state house level my goodness\nThe response rate that people are getting from polling is lower and lower and lower every year in other words you make a phone call does somebody wish to participate in that that just continues to decrease\nIt takes a lot of money to conduct a good pole and to get a sizable enough sample that the results are representative and it's really tough and I would just say go based on the issues and vote your conscience\nYeah quite a lot of you express real concern with the very nature of polling Peter wrote on our Facebook page please discuss the obsession the media NPR included has with a horse race method of election coverage is an irresponsible journalism to report on polls one such reporting could affect turnout or elections are not sporting events\nAnd Michael wrote on our Facebook page unit which still trust polls remember how that turned out in twenty sixteen\n[noise] yeah I mean I you know look I mean this is a this is a tried and true a criticism\nUm you know we can get into the science of polling and whatnot and I would disagree that were obsessed quote unquote with polling we do use it to pepper our coverage and to give us a sense of what the snap shots are within districts in fact\nI'm far more interested in trends in polls rather than poll to poll horse race I think that's a not a good way to look at the polling ah I think that uh again overall trends and you know issues and questions\nOne can predict the future but everyone can prepare for it for ... for individual families or to supplement Medicare Farm Bureau health plans have got you covered powerful membership campaign begins on Monday when you support Nashville public radio you'll not only help pay for the programs you\nValue your also have a chance to win a thousand dollar Amazon gift or free and I said okay since both for seven months in Costa Rica make a gift no W peeled and taught or\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the financial services firm of Raymond James offering personalized wealth management advice and banking and capital markets expertise along with the legacy of putting clients financial wellbeing first learn more at Raymond James dot com\nAnd from the science Sims foundation since Nineteen eighty five supporting advances in science education and the arts towards a better more just society more information is available at size Sims foundation dot org\nBack now to our conversation with one of summers of the Associated Press Katie centers of politifact and NPR's Dominican ... still time to get in some of your questions and thoughts about the mid term elections email us one a ass W.

P. R. dot org let's get to some of your comments about the midterms Laurie emailed I Am a lifelong Democrat and I can tell you what frustrates me and has for years\nThe complete inability of the Dems to get a message and stick to it I've gone to my local Democratic Party website and the front page does not see what they are for does not told me what they care about one summers you've been following the Democrats in the run up to the midterms how common is Laurie complaint and\nHow well are Democrats doing an answering it\nWell I think the largest pointing to is actually really comment and I think Democrats are trying to figure out how to fix that and number of the conversations I had I have recently wrote an article that looks at how Democrats are trying to\nMake sure they have record Mitt turn turn out and they said that when they're talking to voters are sending out mailers are going and knocking people's doors in these battleground states and districts are trying to make sure\nThat they're telling their voters that they have a message that they are running on rather than just having these conversations that are about just running against President Trump may say um I was talking to some groups that dead centerfield testing recently among Latino voters and they said ... and when they get this field testing\nAnd they were saying people were turned out they said if they got a ... a mailer from their local democratic candidate had President Trump space on it they be super turned off right they throw that away they wouldn't even engage or the who the candidate was so I think they're really trying to tweak that matching you're talking about what they can do for them what's at stake that that's\nThat's why you hear are Democrats nationally talking about how this is the most important election of our lifetimes why you hear about health care message I think as Dominican noted being such a huge share of the advertising that you're seeing from pro democratic groups it's because they do realize that they need a message for their voters to coalesce around otherwise they're not going to turn out\nTo him in the car wonder if we could follow up on that was one more voice mail from a listener on the east coast here's what judge John left in our inbox\nShould John ... sure to New York show off\nPeople ... the Republicans the Democrats the Republicans the Democrats or Republicans ... instead of doing that they should be focusing on specific policies namely the Democrats that stand for ... for\nThe Republicans to stand for such and such it helped educate listeners because you don't gain anything by just growing Democrats Republicans Democrats Republicans\nJohn thanks very much for calling and sharing your thoughts with us no medical for me I don't know how you hear this but for me as a journalist I feel uncomfortable saying the Democrats who stand for X. I feel more comfortable saying the Democrats who say they stand for ... or the Democrats who have done\n... to me journalistically that's more reliable but I Do take John's\nPoint that it just feels a little bit too broad brush\nYeah I mean we have to always be aware of trying to get into some of the issues and where are the party stand on these things and what they've been pushing I think that that's been part of the pushback and why you've seen so much interest from Democrats\nObviously in this election because they've seen so much of what President Obama did and regulations that were put in place that have been rolled back for example or by the environmental protection agency a and a whole host of other things including an immigration policy that Democrats are firmly against\nAnd it's also what you saw a as a rise of the Tea Party in twenty ten where they didn't trust a lot of their government officials including a lot of Republicans in how they essentially took over the Republican Party with that message of uh taxed enough already and being really in opposition to\nA President Obama's health care act so the parties stand for a very very different things and we're seeing that play out and going to come to a head and in this in this midterm\nSteady I Wonder if you can respond to a listener who left a note on our website the one eight out or the listener writes with the upcoming midterm elections and Michelle Obama's advised to go high when opponents go low what is the effectiveness of negative campaigns are the negative campaign ads coming from a particular party or group Cady\nOh I think everyone's guilty and I don't think any party as a\nAs Israeli going going high all the time right and I think that's because it's effective and that really sticks with people as much as people like to say that they dislike negative advertising and I think actually do it is a memorable\nAnd it certainly a bill that impression that people are going to remember and that's why we see so much of it and that's why we have jobs here fact checkers [laughter] there's plenty to do\nYou you will never be unemployed not ever\nThe medical research on some of the diversity of the candidates this time around quite a few record numbers of women running a record numbers of el ... out L Judy Chu candidates running some of whom spoke to Ari Shapiro on all things considered earlier\nGive us a sense of what that means for the midterms and whether or many of these candidates are considered to stay in a strong chance of winning\nLook you're correct that there are a lot of people um who are\nA ... of diverse backgrounds I mean women are the biggest bloc of this that are really driving the midterms you think a lot of Native American candidates or you know just a New Hampshire there Chris Pappas who is\nA an openly gay man I he would be the first gay representative from the state of New Hampshire if he wins in a new in the first congressional district there in New Hampshire as Democrats now\nBut when again we look at the power of the midterms women they has been fired up since the day President Trump was elected moment talking about when and where I Am a democratic women there have been two hundred and thirty five women who have been nominated for ah for Congress for their party's nomination a hundred and ...\nHe has been democratic women just if you were to take the number of democratic women who are running a hot that would be bigger than the record previously of all women combined do or nominees and that was a hundred and sixty seven\nSo I'm Sorry you just just to clarify the numbers you're basically saying three out of four women in this in this go round a democratic woman who'd been nominated\nAbsolutely that's absolutely right and the the wave of democratic women the year of the woman quote unquote round to ah after Nineteen Ninety two after the Clarence Thomas Anita Hill areas\nHave been driven by democratic women and we've seen them be very fired up in poll after poll and you know they are going to lead the march to the polls for Democrats and if they win the house it's going to be largely because of women\nWanted there are some races where you know women are making a very historic a historic showing I mean the Arizona Senate races going on right now between just send them the Democrat and more with Sally the Republican you know Arizona is going to have\nA female senator in that seat but I Wonder how much you see this as a bipartisan trend we heard the numbers from Dominican oh but do we get the sense\nThat both parties both major parties are trying to be part of this trend trying to embrace this trend\nSure so I think that the energy and when we talk about female candidates is certainly more on the side of the Democrats than Republicans I think that's frustrated\nAnd number of Republican women I spoke to chew women who founded the group Republican women for progress recently and they told me that they were really concerned that their party doesn't have an apparatus to cultivate young promising Republican conservative went and\nFrom the local those local level seats all the lap so nothing that really reflects say what you see on the left on the Democratic side from emily's list the group that cultivate and backs\nA pro abortion rights when in female candidates so there there is some concern certainly among Republicans and my colleagues that he actually asked\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell about that the question came and this back and forth about the Senate Judiciary committee and the lack of Republican women on that panel during the hearings around Dr ... Ford and justice Brett now justice Brett Kavanaugh and he's on them early and why there were no women there Mitch McConnell said you know\nThat's something he doesn't like it is something he wants to see more U.S but I still haven't heard Republicans\nForthrightly at least to me answer if this is such a problem if you want to see more women in the Senate on your side if you want to see more women moving up in the house and we should note that there is a woman and Republican leadership and Cathy McMorris Rodgers but where did as women come from because\nThis is Ninety point three WPN land Nashville public radio Ninety One point five W ... in Ninety One point seven W.

college degree not and we did a show last year called how to earn six figures without a four year degree about how to get into some of the skilled trades\nThat requires some training or an apprenticeship but that don't require a four year bachelor's degree one of our guests are Nicholas when Louis Wyman who was the c._e._o. of the Institute\nFor workplace skills and innovation wrote a book called the job of you\nAnd he put a question to answer on our website about what an apprenticeship is how does an apprenticeship work\nOnce you do you consider taking one where do you go to find one you'll find all this information on our site a program called how to earn six figures without a four year degree on line at the one at a dot for that's the word ... the number one the letter a dot org\nBefore we bring in our next two guests Russ one more thing about the job market here you mentioned\nHousing as a challenge New Hampshire is one of many states has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic how does all of this show up in in the job market is adjust and aging job market or or does it manifest in other ways and that\nWell I think the main thing that is that what she right now is sort of the lagging wage growth in the state than it is kind of a deterrent to\nBringing more people into the labor force attracting more people to the state our wage growth has been around two two and a half percent a year as sort of lagging this prosperous economy that we hear so much about\nI think one of the quips that I recall a woman said yeah we have a great job market in New Hampshire I should know I have three jobs and I need three jobs Joe yet by\nSo I think that that's a that's sort of the main a stumbling block right now we're beginning to see a little bit of labor force growth as I said we've added sixty five thousand jobs in this state since the down turn kind of reversed course and started becoming an improvement but we've only got a Seventeen thousand workers\nSo that their lives to crunch glad to get to some more of your comments about what you're experiencing where you live with work especially in skilled trades\nSean emailed I work in the steel mill and union and management have been complaining about the lack of quality candidates were even taking mc Donald's employees if they will come in a big issue is drug testing half our potential potential candidates don't come in for an interview after hearing that we randomly drug test\nJulian tweeted that gives ... jobs are no consequences if they don't pay a living wage all the jobs I see what ...

this is Christine car the executive director for the New Hampshire career and technical educators association Christine welcome thank you Brian can you give us the big national snapshot of what's happening across the country right now in terms of the labor market we know what the national picture as\nWe've talked about New Hampshire are most states doing OK really struggling what does it look like on a more granular level\nSure what I think that it's important to start from a long term perspective to understand where we are now ah and I think it can be summarized with the idea that the labor market is not always linking workers with economic opportunity I start by saying that productivity growth overall has been unusually low since the mid to thousands\nWage growth has also been quite weak\nOr and then there's also tremendous variation in wage levels across the country it's not always easy for workers to access jobs in those high wage places are at the health of project we've released a paper recently that describes\nHow over the last forty years geographic mobility has plummeted in those geographic imbalances those wage differences I just mentioned have tended to persist over time and they're struggling areas in this country are not generally catching up with the prosperous places\nWe asked members of our one a tax club for their input one person wrote it wrote us at age Seventy one I was shocked to be hired I Am a retired attorney working as a state employee Ryan do we officially qualify now is being in a a labor shortage capital L capital asked labor shortage\nSo I actually have a different perspective on this or that and as an example I like the kind of illustrates my thinking about labor shortages or if you go into a store and you offered to pay less than the posted price for something and the store refuses to do that or we don't say there's a shortage\nAnd I think the same logic applies to the labor market fit in recent years we just aren't seeing broad signs of extreme labor scarcity international data or that scarcity should produce rapidly rising waste\nAfter we adjust for inflation remains very weak\nAnd there's little evidence of earnings and brought industry groups out pacing other industries by big margins\nAre for example of wage growth in construction and manufacturing is not so different than for the overall economy\nAnd a and also say that wages are growing at roughly similar rates across regions going a bit faster in New England in the Pacific states but\nAh but not tremendous gaps and and then I'll just end by saying that that's all to say that they were not seeing this at the broad national level but there could certainly be particular occupations in particular places that are characterized by labor scarcity and that have seen some pretty rapid wage growth I just don't think that's probably true of us labor market\nWe heard from quite a lot of you about just the nature of wages as an impediment to feeling these jobs Ronald posted on our Facebook page\nAs someone who works for many years in construction mostly trim carpentry I can say wages in the field aren't enough to attract and keep people willing to do the work Michelle emailed it's wages not supply\nAnd Christine car I Wonder if you might respond to this tweet from Fran who wrote New Hampshire eliminated the state minimum wage a few years ago so even though all surrounding states have raised there's we're at the national minimum wage thousands travel to Massachusetts daily where the pay is much better\nChristine in terms of what you're dealing with trying to get jobs matched up with workers how much does the state's minimum wage factor in just structurally\nOr [noise] well I I don't have any empirical data why so many uh employees are working at NASA traveling there that I Know and I lived there that are over ... million a caters everyday into the city and out and many of those coming from New Hampshire\nSo you know wages is one aspect of it but there for sure is an actual shortage of people and my feeling is we've got to really just focus on how they can get the people that we as into the jobs that are out there\nYou see is the Roosevelt shortage Christine was there a point at which you begin to notice more viscerally that the job market and the labor pool were significantly mismatched\nThat you know I feel like you know my point of view is sort of a wider industry perspective in in a sense that at work in technology for the last ten years and come to New Hampshire and looking at each other days hiking end\nUm occupation such as automotive construction manufacturing there just seems to be shortages across every single single sector whether it's in India factoring or in high tech\nLet's get to a few more of your comments particularly about the nature of what we've described as an aging workforce Christian in Wisconsin emailed\nTo all the companies out there whining that they can't hire enough people stop discriminating against older workers and older is in quotes we're not old and we have so much experience plus we don't always want a huge salary\nJan in Manchester New Hampshire emailed I Know several educated and qualified older women who lost their jobs here in Manchester they've been out of work for at least six months I've overheard conversations in my local local supermarket from older employees losing hours to sixteen year olds ages them is a big problem\nHand Parker diamond company offering excellent cuts conflict free diamonds and gemstones for more than

Bo and Ryan ... let me get to a few more of your comments before we bring in our next guest particularly with regards to training skilled workers\nChris writes as a current plant manager of a manufacturing facility and for manufacturing HR director slash production manager for over Fifteen Years in both metal and plastics I Am calling BS\nManufacturing in the U. S. has completely abdicated any responsibility for training new employees since the eighties\nThey want to experience people at relatively low wages right off the street if you want lower wages to remain competitive you must develop an inhouse training program that brings lower wage entry level employees up to speed over time\nWe also heard from some of you in some pockets where employers are increasing wages here's one listener who left a voicemail in our inbox\nThis is bill I live in North Carolina and I work in the logistics and we're out and supply chain industry and we've had uh\nAnd we're really struggling with two items one is employee turned over where there\nAre chasing higher wages and a new facility is a new employers and secondly\nTrying to hire the right people are as a result of that we've had to probably increase our incoming salaries the hourly salary is probably anywhere between ten and Fifteen or twenty percent\nFrom what we did last year so we're struggling with both turnover and securing the right employees so having unemployment down as low as two to two and a half percent is definitely impacting logistics and warehousing\nIt's easy to see how Bill thanks very much for sharing your story with us\nAnother one of our listeners tweeted I hold a four year degree strangely enough in journalism but transitioned into a trade jobs shortly following college because the pay was three times what a starting job in my field would be I Know makes six figures yearly and work in the rural community I grew up in\nI Will withhold my thoughts on your ... your journalism degree good for you glad you found something that works for you but\nThis listener has an interesting point because to them their brain drain some cities and counties and states are offering to pay workers to move there\nThere's a city in Nebraska that'll match signing bonuses for newcomers to the tune of five thousand dollars Vermont passed a law to pay people ten thousand dollars to move to Vermont and work remotely\nAn accounting northeast of Detroit is offering to take a chunk out of your student debt that plan was the idea of Randy ... the president and CEO of the community foundation of St Clair county and he joins us now to discuss it Randy welcome to winning\nThanks Joshua so this is called the come home award tell us what the come home award is how does that work\nYeah they come home award program that we launched in ... and early twenties sixteen is really turning traditional scholarship business models on their head um there are too many flaws and traditional scholarship to talk about and doing that but at its core what we're doing is changing the scholarship business model\nAnd instead of investing heavily in a Seventeen or Eighteen year old who may or may not complete college or maybe not be a writer college we've flip it around and we said we will pay you significantly a pot of completion of some kind of degree but only if you return to our region to live and work\nAnd it's really our home home reward paying off of that\nSo this is for people who are who are from saint Clair counting to come back home to St Clair county\nYeah we have a very strong preference for those with family ties I mean to to help protect our investments we want people to know what it's like to live in a small town America or we want to keep them here and so we feel that they have some family connection here there's probably a better bet they'll stay\nTell me about St Clair county pay me a picture of what's it like\nSo small town America or its waterfront community along the shores of lake here I'm going to St Clair river\nUm our largest port Huron as a population of about thirty thousand people we do not have a four year University in our region we did I have a fortune five hundred company in our region a thirty percent of our workforce leaves are counting heads down in metro Detroit to to be employed but they love the small town\nLife or the family friendly environment amenities a small town America Josh\nI was just going to ask you about Detroit you're about an hour outside of Detroit is that right\n[noise] yeah and you were talking about something earlier Josh I Want to mention you know Detroit has become a talent magnet which is great for Detroit um but the health of America and the health of Michigan I think is better judged\nOn the economic health of regions like park here at er Marquette or Muskegon, Michigan right it gives you a better barometer of what is our our true health\nHow did the recession do to do in St Clair county where people hit they're pretty hard\nYeah I Would say it hit here earlier than than hit the country and much more severely\nReally one of the things that led to this come program was once we really hit rock bottom our stakeholders whether it was philanthropy government business\nAny other sector we realize that we all had to get together and play a piece in economic growth and prosperity we all had something to bring to the table but more importantly we we reached a point where we stopped waiting for someone from Washington or someone from Lansing to come in and save us with a plan\nIt had to be an organic planned that drove our prosperity\nWe're speaking to Randy Myers the president and CEO of the community foundation of St Clair county in St Clair accounting Michigan\nAlso still speaking to Russ T. Bo the president of applied economic research and Ryan non policy director of the Hamilton Project and a fellow in economic studies\nAt the Brookings Institution still time to get in some more of your questions and thoughts\nAbout the labor shortage won a a W. A. M. U. dot org tweet us ... when a or comments on our Facebook page where you can watch our video streams so Randy tell me how the come home award work suppose I'm from saint Clair townie and I moved to Chicago\nFor work and now I'm considering coming back and how does that work\nYeah Chicago's a great example Chicago Austin's south um as long as you do not have primary residence here so let let's say your parents still live in this region may be completed college six years ago\nAnd you're still living in Chicago but you met someone you met a party that medicine every other you're you're weighing the option of staying in Chicago which is a great place to live or you want to come back home settled down started family spend\nMore time doing what you want to do as long as you don't already live back in our region\nOr you're eligible for Fifteen thousand dollar award if you're selected we give the recipients a hundred and twenty days to establish a permanent residency or they have to find a job that they don't already have won several already have jobs lined up\nAnd then we stretch those payments out over two or three years as the carrot to keep you here\nAnd it's really a simple back on scholarship would pay the loans holder directly which in every case for us has been the federal government\nSo I Do so you you pay it out a little bit overtime so by over time by the time to two years or up\nSinclair county voted this program to come home award will have put in Fifteen thousand dollars towards ones that I'm guessing it's like where there'd be three thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars like every six months or so and it adds up to Fifteen thousand overtime\nThat's exactly it Josh when the goal you know I'm is to really give young people actually young they could be in their twenties or thirties or forties\nI'm the chance to go two or three years without making debt ... nationally I Know you see data that says the average college student has thirty thousand dollars in debt I don't know where they're getting that data Josh because out of the fifty plus applications we've received our average at an eighty thousand dollars\n... that's that's a crippling amount of debt that's preventing people from living the American dream\nI can relate to that I'd finally paid off my private student loans I had to settle them it was [noise]\nOh God it was it was the most bustle form of financial slavery I can possibly imagine and definitely like that's a whole other our where I Will I Will ... will you with my tearful story of dealing with Sally Mae before I I Know rusty but wants to jump in but before he does Randy I just want to\nAsk you about some of the perception issues that we discussed with regards to New Hampshire there's this there there is evidence that young people are moving to bigger cities in in large numbers\nYou've talked a lot about this feels kind of small town America New Hampshire specifically conquered for sure definitely feels like small town America\nDo you think there's this misperception about smaller communities that young people were getting I haven't seen the TV show that kind of glorified young people in this", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Nashville", "day": "18"}
