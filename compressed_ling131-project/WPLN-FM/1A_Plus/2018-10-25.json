W. A. M. U. dot org\nDominican wonder if we could pick up with that last question I asked Casey\nIs all of the Democrats and Republicans voted out of Congress they are so polarized we need to start over\nHow much do you get a sense that the pure polarization\nOf today's politics is just changing the way voters approached this year's midterms I mean you know Nancy Pelosi's named still comes up quite a bit on the campaign trail she's a a an obvious kind of a hot button for many Republican voters but it is that working in terms of making people show up or is it just turning people off\nYou know a lot of people might be in our frustrated with politics in the country but we're seeing the opposite effect of not keeping people home a or a voting for some third party coalition in fact it's people strapping on the T shirts and going as hard as they can\nI Do in their political corners I mean the fact is midterms are usually about activist they're usually about the hardest core a people within the party but in fact we're seeing the potential for a surge this year in turnout I spoke to Michael McDonald who's a professor at the University of Florida who's really\nOne of the preeminent turnout experts in the country maintains a turnout database he expects there to be a turnout of about forty five fifty percent of eligible voters this year that doesn't sound like a lot but it would be the highest level for mid term since the mid Nineteen sixties\nAnd that is really spurred on by all of this high interest or seeing high turnout in primaries and in special elections\nAnd you know frankly you've seen Democrats really fired up to vote against this president and we've seen that according to a few sixty percent of people say the president is a factor in their vote and that's higher than it's ever been\nA wonder wanna summers what your take is on that in terms of the the potential play but for Democrats first of all let's just said a little context is focused on the house for example how many seats with the Democrats need to flip the house\nChurch that Democrats would need twenty three seats in order to take control of the house of representatives and right now most public pull in when we look across the landscape suggests that they're doing that they're making good efforts and things are looking good for them right now one thing that I've noticed as I've been talking to\nFolks you work on the Democratic side of the aisle who are professional political folks is they're spending a lot of money to make sure that their voter turnout and particularly looking at the types of voters infrequent voters who say\nMay show up and a presidential election year but are more likely to stay home\nAnd I'm an off year or mid term here and there was a reason for that typically when we look at the electorate that shows up for mid term elections it's typically older whiter and more Republican tell things that you see Democrats spending a lot of money and a lot of time on the ground trying to turn out younger voters those millennials voters of color or Latino African Americans and Asians\nWho are more likely to vote for Democrats are also more likely to stay home and midterm years\nIs there a certain benchmark wanna for what Democrats would consider for lack of a better word a blowout slide you use the goal just to get a fifty percent plus one or is there a larger like a stretch goal but the Democratic party is aiming for\nWhat I'm hearing from most people including Ben ray Lujan congressmen who chairs the Democratic democratic congressional campaign committee is\nThey don't think this is going to be a blowout year they feel confident and their chances of taking back the house of turning the house blew but I don't think most people most members of Congress were involved in this would say that there's going to be a huge blue waves crashing over a pick up some ten feet or something like that\nThey're focused on delivering that twenty three at turning the the House bill and the message I keep hearing from them as they want to do that as a a balance of power right now Republicans\nControl every branch of government and they want to restore balance of power to this administration\nYou know this idea of a blue wave was the focus of an email from Marty who wrote I'm all about the blue wave but I'm afraid that between voter disenfranchisement lingering gerrymandering and possible for an interest\nDominican let me ask you about some of the polling water some of the main trends in national polls right now in terms of how the Democrats and Republicans might do\nWell when we look at our NPR PBS NewsHour Marist polling Democrats have had an advantage on what's known as the congressional ballot who would you prefer to be a two run Congress ... the Democrat and your district or the Republican the ... in your district\nYou know we've had an advantage for Democrats anywhere from seven to twelve points over from the summer until now\nOr other polling other public bowling shown it to be double digits that's about the range that Democrats feel like they would be able to take the at least that was twenty three seats in the house and I look at some other factors to just look at the landscape and the playing field and when I was gamed out or how many seats would be up for grabs this year\nI found that there are ... seats that were a competitive to potentially competitive despite all the talk of cabinet or you know that confirmation battle in ... Republicans and it certainly did\nOnly six of those seats are democratic held seats Seventy four seats are of the potentially competitive to competitive landscape are held by Republicans no matter what you look at that and you know if the Democrats win half of those that's the house\n[noise] glad to hear from some of you with regards to your concerns about the midterms including about the nature of polling in general do medical I Love you to respond to this comment from a listener who left a note in our inbox\nI'm Alan from Ashville North Carolina and I'm frustrated with the elections with not having enough holes in down ballot races even even the U.S house state house and stuff because if it's a close election I Want to vote Democrat\nAt least at the federal and state level but it it can ruin that I Want to vote a third party greener libertarian\nOr write my own ad for our need to know the raiders coach or not if it's a if it's true it if my vote might be the deciding vote and I need all I Need some polls through art to divide and it it actually changes my vote the oil change my vote\nEllen thanks for your comment Dominican\nThat cracks me up or if he wants to run for office he should run for office if he wants to a vote third party because that's his conscience than he should do so I get a pragmatic approach though and I think a lot of\nYou know establishment Democrats would argue that they wish there were a lot more voters like him who voted in Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania for the Democrat instead of voting for the third party candidate now when it comes to polls look\nThere is a huge problem in this country when it comes to a polling generally and then when you go and drill down into the state level or district level or state house level my goodness\nThe response rate that people are getting from polling is lower and lower and lower every year in other words you make a phone call does somebody wish to participate in that that just continues to decrease\nIt takes a lot of money to conduct a good pole and to get a sizable enough sample that the results are representative and it's really tough and I would just say go based on the issues and vote your conscience\nYeah quite a lot of you express real concern with the very nature of polling Peter wrote on our Facebook page please discuss the obsession the media NPR included has with a horse race method of election coverage is an irresponsible journalism to report on polls one such reporting could affect turnout or elections are not sporting events\nAnd Michael wrote on our Facebook page unit which still trust polls remember how that turned out in twenty sixteen\n[noise] yeah I mean I you know look I mean this is a this is a tried and true\nWeb streaming is made possible by states and harvest and a full service for managing sophisticated transactions challenging litigation and complex regulatory matters on a daily basis across Tennessee and beyond learn more at ... dot com\nInterested in trends in polls rather than poll to poll horse race I think that's a not a good way to look at the polling ah I think that uh again overall trends and you know issues and questions of giving you a sense of a kind of a temperature read of people is way more useful\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the financial services firm of Raymond James offering personalized wealth management advice and banking and capital markets expertise along with the legacy of putting clients financial wellbeing first learn more at Raymond James dot com\nAnd from the science themes foundation since Nineteen eighty five supporting advances in science education and the arts towards a better more just society more information is available at science Sims foundation dot org\nBack now to our conversation with Juana Summers of the Associated Press Katie Sanders of politifact and NPR's the medical ... still time to get in some of your questions and thoughts about the mid term elections email us one a X.

P. R. dot org including of some of the things that make New Hampshire unique\nThere's a story about a giant pumpkin boat race in ... town I didn't know pumpkins where that boy it but I Will after the show I'm gonna check it out in each PR die\nAbout the midterms Laurie emailed I Am a lifelong Democrat and I can tell you what frustrates me and has for years\nThe complete inability of the Dems to get a message and stick to it I've gone to my local Democratic Party website and the front page does not see what they are for does not told me what they care about one summers you've been following the Democrats in the run up\nTo the midterms how common is Laurie complaint and how well are Democrats doing an answering it\nWell I think the lord is pointing to is actually really comment and I think Democrats are trying to figure out how it affects that number of uh conversations I had I recently wrote an article that looks at how Democrats are trying to\nMake sure they have record mid term turnout and they said that when they're talking about her as are sending out mailers are going and knocking people's doors in these battleground states and districts are trying to make sure\nThat they're telling voters that they have a message that they are running on rather than just having these conversations that are about just running against President Trump's\nBase it on I was talking to some groups that dead centerfield testing recently among Latino voters and they Simon and when they get this field testing\nAnd they were saying people were turned out they said if they got a ... a mailer from their local democratic candidate had President Trump space on it they be super turned off right they started out a way they wouldn't even engage or see who the candidate was so I think they're really trying to tweak that match and you talk about what they can do for them what's at stake that that's\nThat's why you hear are Democrats nationally talking about how this is the most important election of our lifetimes why you hear about health care message I think has Dominican noted being such a huge share of the advertising that you're seeing from pro democratic groups it's because they do realize that they need a message for their voters to coalesce around otherwise they're not going to turn out\nTo him in the car I Wonder if we could follow up on that theme was one more voice mail from a listener on the east coast here's what judge John left in our inbox\nShould try and raise share to New York so often on the shows people ... the Republicans the Democrats or Republicans the Democrats the Republicans would instead of doing that they should be focusing\nOn specific policies namely the Democrats that stand for such and for\nThe Republicans to stand for such and such it helped educate listeners because you don't gain anything by just growing Democrats Republicans Democrats Republicans\nJohn thanks very much for calling and sharing your thoughts with us no medical for me I don't know how you hear this but for me as a journalist I feel uncomfortable saying the Democrats who stand for X.\nI feel more comfortable saying the Democrats who say they stand for ... or the Democrats who have done ... to me journalistically that's more reliable but I Do take John's\nPoint that it just feels a little bit too broad\nBrush yeah I mean we have to always be aware of trying to get into some of the issues and where are the party stand on these things and what they've been pushing I think that that's been part of the pushback and why you've seen so much interest from Democrats\nObviously in this election because they've seen so much of what President Obama did a and regulations that were put in place that have been rolled back for example a by the environmental protection agency a and a whole host of other things including an immigration policy that Democrats are firmly against\nAnd it's also what you saw a as a rise of the Tea Party and twenty ten where they didn't trust a lot of their government officials including a lot of Republicans and how they essentially took over the Republican Party with that message of uh taxed enough already and being really in opposition to\nA President Obama's health care act so the parties stand for a very very different things and we're seeing that play out and going to come to a head and in this in this midterm\nStudio I Wonder if you can respond to a listener who\nWith the upcoming midterm elections and Michelle Obama's advised to go high when opponents go low what is the effectiveness of negative campaigns are the negative campaign ads coming from a particular party or group Cady\nOh I think everyone's guilty and I don't think any party has a\nHas Israeli going going high all the time right and I think that's because it's effective and that really sticks with people as much as people like to say that they dislike negative advertising and I think actually do it as memorable\nAnd it's certainly a bill that impression that people are going to remember and that's why we see so much of it and that's why we have jobs here ... [laughter] there's plenty to do\nYou you will never be unemployed not ever\nTheir medical research on some of the diversity of the candidates this time around quite a few record numbers of women running a record numbers of Elgin beauty of out L G two candidates running some of whom spoke to Ari Shapiro on all things considered earlier give us a sense of what that means for\nThe midterms and whether many of these candidates are considered to send a strong chance of winning\nWell look you're correct that there are a lot of people um who are\nA ... of diverse backgrounds I mean women are the biggest bloc of this that are really driving the midterms you think of a lot of Native American candidates or you know just a New Hampshire there Chris Pappas who is\nA an openly gay man he would be the first gay representative from the state of New Hampshire if he wins in a new in the first congressional district there in New Hampshire as Democrats now\nBut when again and we look at the power of the midterms women they have been fired up since the day President Trump\nWas elected when we're talking about when and where I Am a democratic women there have been two hundred and thirty five women who have been nominated for ah for Congress for their party's nomination a hundred and eighty three of those a hundred and eighty three has been democratic women\nJust if you were to take the number of democratic women who are running a hunt that would be bigger than the record previously of all women combined do or nominees and that was a hundred and sixty seven\nSo because I'm Sorry you just just to clarify the numbers you're basically saying that three out of four women in this in this go round a democratic women who've been nominated\nAbsolutely that's absolutely right at the the wave of democratic women the year of the woman quote unquote round to ah after Nineteen Ninety two after the Clarence Thomas Anita Hill areas\nHave been driven by democratic women and we've seen them be very fired up in poll after poll and you know they are going to lead the march to the polls for Democrats and if they win the house it's going to be largely because of women\nWanted there are some races where you know women are making a very historic a historic showing I mean the Arizona Senate races going on right now between here and send them the Democrat and more with Sally the Republican\nYou know Arizona is going to have a female senator in that seat but I Wonder how much you see this as a bipartisan trend we heard the numbers from Dominican oh but do we get the sense\nThat both parties both major parties are trying to be part of this trend trying to embrace this trend\nSure so I think that the energy and when we talk about female candidates is certainly more on the side of the Democrats than Republicans and I think that's frustrated\nAnd number of Republican women I spoke to chew women who founded the group Republican women for progress recently and they told me that they were really concerned that their party doesn't have an apparatus to cultivate young promising Republican conservative went in\nFrom the local those local level seats all the lap so nothing that really reflects say what you see on the left on the Democratic side from emily's list the group that cultivate and backs\nA pro abortion rights when in female candidates so there there's some concern certainly among Republicans and my colleagues that he actually asked Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell about that the question came in the back and forth about the Senate Judiciary committee\nDuring the hearings around Dr ... Ford and justice Brett now justice Brett Kavanaugh and he's on them are like and why there were no women there Mitch McConnell said you know that something he doesn't like it's something he wants to see more U.S but I still haven't heard Republicans\nForthrightly at least to me answer if this is such a problem if you want to see more women in the Senate on your side if you want to see more women moving up in the house and we should note that there is a woman and Republican leadership and Cathy McMorris Rodgers but where does lemon come from because\nAs we know running for office is very expensive it's very tough it's very tactical if you don't have help and you don't have an apparatus those people are never going to show up\nSpeaking of women Republican leadership to medical I I'm not sure if you've seen anybody\nRunning or campaigning talking about Senator Susan Collins of Maine and her decision to allow the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation before the longest petitions should be on the Senate floor that made a lot of people rather upset with her final decision I haven't personally seen\nThis is Ninety point three WPN land Nashville public radio Ninety One point five W T amount of Houma and Ninety One point seven W.

Bo of applied economic research here in New Hampshire we'd love to hear from you to share what you know about finding a job in today's economy comments on our Facebook page where you can watch video stream courtesy of New Hampshire public radio\nTweet us at one a or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot org before we keep going and introduce our next guests I just want to kind of add a yes any men to what then you'll you just said\nThere is no shame and getting a career that doesn't require a college degree not and we did a show last year called how to earn six figures without a four year degree about how to get into some of the skilled trades\nThat requires some training or an apprenticeship but that don't require a four year bachelor's\nDegree one of our guests are Nicholas when Louis Wyman who was the c._e._o. of the Institute for workplace skills and innovation wrote a book called the job you\nAnd he put a question to answer on our website about what an apprenticeship is how does an apprenticeship work when should you considered taking one where do you go to find what you'll find all this information on our site a program called how to earn six figures without a four year degree\nOn line at the one at a dot for that's the word ... the number one the letter a dot org\nBefore we bring in our next two guests Russ one more thing about the job market here you mentioned\nThat New Hampshire has an aging population affordable housing as a challenge New Hampshire is one of many states has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic how does all of this show up in in the job market is it just an aging job market or or does it manifest in other ways them that well I think\nThe main thing that is that what she right now is sort of the lagging wage growth in the state than it is kind of a deterrent to bringing more people into the labor force attracting more people to the state our wage growth has been around two two and a half percent a year that sort of lagging this prosperous economy that we hear so much about\nI think one of the quotes that I recall a woman said yeah we have a great job market in New Hampshire I should know I have three jobs and I need three jobs go yet by\nSo I think that that's a that's sort of the main a stumbling block right now we're beginning to see a little bit of labor force growth as I said we've added sixty five thousand jobs in this state since the down turn kind of reversed course and started becoming an improvement but we've only added Seventeen thousand workers\nSo that they're in lies to crunch\nTo get to some more of your comments about what you're experiencing where you live with work especially in skilled trades\nSean emailed I work in the steel mill and union and management has been complaining about the lack of quality candidates were even taking mc Donald's employees if they will come in a big issue is drug testing half our potential potential candidates don't come in for an interview after hearing that we randomly drug test\nJulian tweeted like his billion jobs are no\nAll the jobs I see what ... my education and pay a third of what his manageable\nLet's try to zoom out a little bit more and talk about what's happening not only here in New Hampshire but also nationwide joining us from our home base in Washington is Ryan none policy director of the Hamilton Project and the fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution Ryan welcome to want to thank you for having me on\nAlso here with this is Christine car the executive director for the New Hampshire career and technical educators association Christine welcome\nThank you\nRyan can you give us the big national snapshot of what's happening across the country right now in terms of the labor market we know what the national picture as we've talked about New Hampshire are most states doing OK really struggling what does it look like on a more granular level\nSure what I think that it's important to start from a long term perspective to understand where we are now ah and I think it can be summarized with the idea that the labor market is not always linking workers with economic opportunity I start by saying that productivity growth overall has been unusually low since the mid to thousands\nWage growth has also been quite weak\nOr and then there's also tremendous variation in wage levels across the country it's not always easy for workers to access jobs in those high wage places are at the health project we've released a paper recently that describes\nHow over the last forty years geographic mobility has plummeted in those geographic imbalances those wage differences I just mentioned have tended to persist over time and the struggling areas in this country are not generally catching up with the prosperous places\nWe asked members of our one a tax club for their input one person wrote it wrote us at age Seventy one I was shocked to be hired I Am a retired attorney working as a state employee Ryan do we officially qualify now as being in a a labor shortage capital L capital as labor shortage\nSo I actually have a different perspective on this or that and there's an example I like the kind of illustrates my thinking about labor shortages or if you go into a store and you offered to pay less than the posted price for something and the store refuses to do that or we don't say there's a shortage\nAnd I think the same logic applies to the labor market fit in recent years we just aren't seeing broad signs of extreme labor scarcity in the national data or that scarcity should produce rapidly rising wages as employers compete for workers\nAnd we just haven't observe that you know overall real wage growth after we adjust for inflation remains very weak\nAnd there's little evidence of earnings and brought industry groups out pacing other industries by big margins\nAre for example a wage growth in construction and manufacturing is not so different than for the overall economy\nAnd I'd also say that wages are growing at roughly similar rates across regions throwing a bit faster in New England and the Pacific states but\nAh but not tremendous gaps and and then I'll just end by saying that that's all to say that they were not seeing this at the broad national level but there could certainly be particular occupations in particular places that are characterized by labor scarcity and that have seen some pretty rapid wage growth I just don't think that's probably true of us labor market\nWe heard from quite a lot of you about just the nature of wages as an impediment to filling these jobs Ronald posted on our Facebook page as someone who works for many years in construction mostly trim carpentry I can say wages in the field or it's enough to attract and keep people willing to do the work\nMichelle emailed it's wages not supply\nAnd Christine car I Wonder if you might respond to this tweet from Fran who wrote New Hampshire eliminated the state minimum wage a few years ago so even though all surrounding states have raised fares we're at the national minimum wage thousands traveled to Massachusetts daily where the pay is much better\nChristine in terms of what you're dealing with trying to get jobs matched up with workers how much does the state's minimum\n[noise] well I I don't have any empirical data why so many uh employees are working in natural traveling there that I Know when I Lived there that it played over at a caters everyday into the city and out and many of those coming from New Hampshire so you know\nWages is one aspect of it but there for sure is an actual shortage of people and my feeling is we've got to really just focus on how they can get the people that we as into the jobs that are out there\nYou see the Roosevelt shortage Christine was there a point at which you begin to notice more viscerally that the job market and the labor pool were significantly mismatched\nThat you know I I feel like you know my point of view is got to sort of a wider industry perspective in in a sense that at work and technology for the last ten years and coming to New Hampshire and looking at each of these high demand\nUm occupation such as automotive construction manufacturing there just seems to be shortages across every single single sector whether it's an ... or in high tech\nLet's get to a few more of your comments particularly about the nature of what we've described as an aging workforce Christian in Wisconsin emailed\nTo all the companies out there whining that they can't hire enough people stop discriminating against older workers and older is in quotes we're not old and we have so much experience plus we don't always want a huge salary\nJan in Manchester New Hampshire emailed I Know several educated and qualified older women who lost their jobs here in Manchester they've been out of work for at least six months I overheard conversations in my local local supermarket from older employees losing hours to sixteen year olds ages them is a big problem\n... how do you see this to the impact of of older workers\nFrom the three I O T powering enterprise digital transformation with artificial intelligence predictive analytics ... solutions learned more it see three I O T dot AI\nAnd from the William T grant foundation at WTC grant foundation dot org\n\nBack now to our conversation with Russ T. Bo and Ryan ... let me get to a few more of your comments before we bring in our next guest particularly with regards to training skilled workers\nChris writes as a current plant manager of a manufacturing facility and for manufacturing HR director slash production manager for over Fifteen Years in both metal and plastics I Am calling BS\nManufacturing in the U. S. has completely abdicated any responsibility for training new employees since the eighties\nThey want to experience people at relatively low wages right off the street if you want lower wages to remain competitive you must develop an inhouse training program that brings lower wage entry level employees up to speed over time\nWe also heard from some of you in some pockets where employers are increasing wages here's one listener who left a voicemail in our inbox\nThis is bill I live in North Carolina and I work in the logistics and we're out and supply chain industry and we've had a a pretty good expansion of our business over the last six months\nAnd we're really struggling with two items one is employed turned over where there are chasing higher wages and a new facility is a new employers and secondly trying to hire the right people are as a result of that we've had to probably increase our incoming salaries the hourly salary is probably anywhere between ten and Fifteen or twenty percent\nFrom what we did last year so we're struggling with both turnover and securing the right employees so having unemployment down as low as two to two and a half percent is definitely impacting\nLogistics and warehousing\nEasy to see how Bill thanks very much for sharing your story with us\nAnother one of our listeners tweeted I hold a four year degree strangely enough in journalism but transitioned into a trade job shortly following college because the pay was three times what a starting job in my field would be I Know makes six figures yearly and work in the rural community I grew up in\nI Will withhold my thoughts on your abandoning your journalism degree good for you glad you found something that works for you but\nThis listener has an interesting point because to stem their brain drain some cities and counties and states are offering to pay workers to move there there's a city in Nebraska that'll match signing bonuses for newcomers\nTo the tune of five thousand dollars Vermont passed a law to pay people ten thousand dollars to move to Vermont and work remotely\nAnd accounting northeast of Detroit is offering to take a chunk out of your student debt that plan was the idea of Randy ... the president and CEO of the community foundation of St Clair county and he joins us now to discuss it Randy welcome to want to say\nThanks Joshua so this is called the come home award and tell us what to come home award is how does that work\nCome home or or ran that we lost in ... and early twenties sixteen is really turning traditional scholarship and smiles on their head um there are too many flaws in traditional scholarship to talk about doing that but at its core what we're doing is changing the scouts\nHeavily and a Seventeen or Eighteen year old who may or may not complete college or maybe not be right for college we've flip it around and we said we will pay you significantly a pot of completion of some kind of degree but only if you return to our region to live and work and it's really our home home reward paying off of that\nSo this is for people who are who are from saint Clair counting to come back home to St Clair county\nYeah we have a very strong preference for those was family ties I mean to to help protect our investments we want people to know what it's like to live in a small town America or we want to keep them here and so we feel that if they have some family connection here there's probably a better bet they'll stay\nTell me about St Clair county pay me a picture of what's it like\nSort of small town America or its waterfront community along the shores of Lake Huron in the St Clair river\nUm our largest how to port Huron has a population of about thirty thousand people we do not have a four year University in our region we did I have a fortune five hundred company in our region a a thirty percent of our workforce leaves are counting heads down and metro Detroit\nTo to be employed but they love the small town life or the family friendly environment amenities a small town America Josh\nI was just going to ask you about Detroit you're about an hour outside of Detroit is that right\nYeah and you were talking about something earlier Josh I Want to mention you know Detroit has become a talent magnet which is great for Detroit um but the health of America and the health of Michigan I think is better judged\nOn the economic health of regions like port Huron are Marquette or Muskegon, Michigan right it gives you a better barometer of what is our our true how\nHow did the recession do to do in St Clair county where people get their pretty hard\nYeah I Would say it hit here earlier than than hit the country and much more severely um the ironic part that we tell people and that's really one of the things that led to this come on the program was once we really hit rock bottom our stakeholders whether it was philanthropy government business\nAny other sector we realize that we all had to get together and play a piece in economic growth and prosperity we all had something to bring to the table but more importantly we we reached a point where we stopped waiting for someone from Washington or someone from Lansing to come in and save us with a plan\nIt had to be an organic planned that drove our prosperity\nWe're speaking to Randy Myers the president and CEO of the community foundation of St Clair accounting in St Clair accounting Michigan\nAlso still speaking to us T. Bo the president of applied economic research and Ryan non policy director of the Hamilton Project and a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution still time to get in some more of your questions and thoughts\nAbout the labor shortage won a a W AMU dot org tweet us ... when a or comments on our Facebook page where you can watch our video streams so Randy tell me how the come home award work suppose I'm from saint Clair townie\nAnd I moved to Chicago for work and now I'm considering coming back and how does that work\nChicago's a great example Chicago Austin's south um as long as you do not have primary residence here so let let's say your parents still live in this region maybe completed college six years ago\nAnd you're still living in Chicago but you met someone who met a party the medicine every other year you're weighing the option of staying in Chicago which is a great place to live or you want to come back home settled down started family spend more time doing what you want to do as long as you don't already live back in our region\nOr you're eligible for Fifteen thousand dollar award if you're selected\nWe give the recipients a hundred and twenty days to establish a permanent residency or they have to find a job that they don't already have won several already have jobs lined up and then we stretch those payments out over it\nKeep you here and it's really a simple back scholarship we pay the loans holder directly which in every case for us has been the federal government\nSo how do so you you pay it out a little bit overtime so by over time by the time to two years or up\nSinclair county voted this program to come home award will have put in Fifteen thousand dollars towards ones that I'm guessing it's like would that be three thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars like every six months or so and it adds up to Fifteen thousand overtime\nThat's exactly it Josh when the goal you know I'm is to really give young people at the lake it'd be in their twenties or thirties or forties I'm the chance to go two or three years without making debt\nNationally I Know you see data says the average college student has thirty thousand dollars in debt I don't know where they're getting that data Josh because out of the fifty plus applications we've received our average editor eighty thousand dollars\n... that's that's a crippling amount of debt that preventing people from living the American dream\nI can relate to that I'd finally paid off my private student loans I had to settle them it was\nCaught it was it was the most awful form of financial slavery I can possibly imagine and yeah definitely like that's a whole other our where I Will I Will rebel you with my tearful story of dealing with Sally Mae before I I Know rusty but wants to jump in but before he does Randy I just want to\nAsk you about some of the perception issues that we discussed with regards to New Hampshire there's this there ... there is evidence that young people are moving to bigger cities in in large numbers\nYou've talked a lot about this feels kind of small town America New Hampshire specifically conquered for sure definitely feels like small town America\nDo you think there's this misperception about smaller communities that young people are getting I haven't seen the TV show\nThat kind of glorified young people in a small town since dawson's creek I mean you don't see it much anymore do do you think people are just getting the wrong idea about living and working in smaller parts of the country that we're all just kind of dazzled by the big city\nYou know that's that's a great point I was when I speak around the country about this program in this effort of traction there is a complete misperception that young people don't want to move the small town America I'm One of the biggest impact of this program in dispelling that\nNo I'm not saying ten thousand young people a year want to move to a small town America New Hampshire or this part of Michigan but we've already had far more applications for this program that we can possibly find\nAnd the sea MACs or welcoming our logo three houses restaurant popular demand tour anywhere thirteenth tickets are available this Friday at ten am more information at ... dot com [noise]\nThis is not only three WPN Atlanta Nashville Ninety One point five WTO ...

A. M. U. dot org\nThat in common with regards to avoidance versus evasion of taxes Suzanne I Wonder how your reporting turned out in terms of how much money it appears that Trump's should have paid in taxes but didn't do we have a sense of what the difference was between those two\nI mean it it it comes into the hundreds of millions of dollars range I mean they did pay some tax on um the schemes that that we found 'em in the IRS push push back\nOn some of the um some of the things that they submitted that didn't add up to them but ultimately we we felt that there was hundreds of millions of dollars that should have been paid to various talks authorities that weren't\nSusanna one of the aspects that comes up in the investigation has to do\nWith valuations I mean when French Trump's children took over his empire the value that at all over forty one million dollars all the buildings and all the businesses that they had in the various kind of larger Trump family organization\nWhen they sold the business ... business is off over the next decade they sold for sixteen times more\nThan devaluation can you give us a sense Suzanne of how valuations kind of what you say something is worth factors into all of this valuations\nBecame a a a theme quit quickly in the in our reporting once we got into the documents\nAnd we saw um sort of writ large when it when it benefited the trumps to put a low valuation on buildings when they didn't want to pay taxes on it they would do that and go to great lengths to to put values that just seems\nRidiculous to us I'm low buildings worth you know a hundred million plus we get a valuations of you know five ten million\nBut on the same hand when they had a charitable donation um where they were a high valuation um would benefit them they went high so when it benefited them to go high they went high when it benefited them to go low we saw them go very low\nAnd of course if you inaccurately state the value of something to the IRS and that compromise is the amount of taxes the IRS may or may not be able to assess on that but rest I Wonder if you could respond\nTo a tweet from Matthew who asks how common are the various tax Dodgers committed by the Trump family that also does with another comment from Bryce several have you been asking whether this is kind of unique to the trumps Bryce run on our Facebook page I Would like to know how common to sort of tax dodging inheritance scheme is among the very rich\nAfter the Panama and paradise papers I just assume everyone riches engaged in a lifelong struggle to subvert the law in order to get richer [laughter]\nThose are those are very good questions I there are some of these\nSome of the things that we are talking about here that we uncovered\nAre um trust arrangements that the IRS has endorsed sometimes after being pushed by a trust in the state attorney ...\nI'm a ... and that that that are widely used one of them the scratcher attained annuity trust which is the formal name for the mechanism through which Donald Trump in his siblings took\nOwnership of their fathers empire in the nineties there's actually a commercial BDO the consulting firm runs a commercial where my daughter is trying to persuade her father to pass on the family winery through one of these trust 'em so there there are quite common\nThen there are other aspects of of things that we uncovered that are not common at all and are not endorsed they set up a corporation that serves no purpose of and pat invoices so Donald Trump and his siblings could start a kicking someone there\nIt's indoors by the IRS that's patently fraudulent on on its face um and so those kind of things are a gray area and they're not widely used so it's a it's a mix of things that we're talking about here and even in the cases where\nThey use a mechanisms like the trust that are well established and widely used by wealthy people to Trump's really push the limits the boundaries of those things in ways that a trust in the state attorneys that we consulted with an exam and these things said we're beyond the pale of of anything they'd seen in their careers\nBefore we get into more of the details I like to get to one more comment that were sent in a through voice mail from one of our listeners who is struggling with the idea that the trumps actually did anything wrong here's what Jeff left in our inbox\nIs he Jeff St Clair falls Wisconsin many many successful people have received benefits and their father I see this is a story the second part is taxes avoided\nThat is illegal method of reducing your tax bill through existing a statute to actually get it now that would be interesting but so far all areas that he use certain ... to avoid paying taxes\nAs we all do we all take deductions standard or otherwise\nJeff thanks for sharing your thoughts with Suzanne what would you say to dress\nUp\nAt the top I mean these are standard deductions that one at one of the um one of the things that we wrote a book that Russ you mentioned\nUm was a company that was set up it's interesting because it's true that the rich due to a lot of things to avoid taxes the trumps cross the line into illegality and one of the companies that we wrote about um this company called all county building supply\nIt was set up in Nineteen Ninety to its sole purpose was to defraud the ... the IRS to avoid taxes what it was it was a fairly simple mechanism and explain it and and I think reader or your listeners can kind of come to their ... to a conclusion on it\nWithout your support the station they're offering more upwards like myself the chance to join this incredible opportunity we now have an ... and also a new political reporter\nBut we want to do more to how quickly this fight

W. A. M. U. dot org before we get some more questions from our listeners Suzanne what about the IRS his role in all of this\nIs their job to catch the Fred trumps of the world doing what Fred Trump did how do they reflect on this\nIt it is their job and it's an interesting um you know theme throughout\nThe story when we started to look at the different um schemes and I think one thing to remember about the IRS is um you know ... large um they're understaffed and and often a lot of stuff does get through 'em and I I think that that sort of became apparent to us as we were sort of looking at the totality\nOf the ah the toxin out against\nThat we saw we do see I'm In some of the things that we found that the ...\nYou know from talking to the tax experts that we did um you understand when when the IRS does something um there's back and forth I'm with you know and it would have been in this case the trumps but with the people were where were problems are found and eventually they come to a settlement\nAnd we we saw that additional tax in certain things was paid when they saw valuations that they too agreed were low um and then the cases settled and and and things move on and the case of all county um we found no evidence that the IRS I'm like oh county as the company where they had they were putting the voices in order to drain\nI'm Fred Trump's empire and in in cases like that we saw no evidence um that they were aware of what the Trump we're doing there so it's sort of a ... a mix of they caught some stuff in and they push back an extra tax was paid here and there and in other cases where we're not convinced they even knew what was going on\nNow that you report has come out Ross have we heard anything more from the IRS they plan to look into any of these allegations or is it is it too late are are there statute of limitations that are involved\nThere are statute of limitations on any potential criminal charges those have since told there is if there's a fraud involved there's not a statute of limitations on civil penalties and and collection of back taxes we haven't heard anything from the IRS\nWe wouldn't necessarily expect to they generally run\nVery silent and most people who work at the IRS are forbidden by law from talking about any individual taxpayer we have heard from New York City in New York state taxation authorities\nWho said based on ah the the reporting that we did they have opened investigations and and are looking for ways or if there's a reason to collect a back taxes with penalties\nBenjamin has a clarifying question about all county building supplying maintenance Benjamin tweeted did all county building have to pay taxes on the income it made how much of a difference is the percentage from the estate tax Suzanne ...\nUm ... it's a good question the estate tax that they were looking at what have been fifty five percent and all county the partners in our county Donald Trump and his siblings I'm would've had to pay some taxes it would have been a business tax\nUm and it would have been substantially less than it's interesting at least in the case of the president we know because of the law says that he had incurred throughout his um his life that he may be for potentially would have been able to shelter the income and not paid taxes on it because in America when you have\nYou know lost his you're allowed to use those losses to offset future income so we just don't know exactly what each of them paid but it would have been substantially less than the fifty five percent state tax that they were facing\nPart of the story also one of the other aspects of this the kinds of stands out is it how Fred Trump went to some pretty great lengths to bail out Donald Trump repeatedly if he ran into financial trouble rush there was one story that involves millions of dollars of poker chips\nOne of Donald Trump's fails casinos ... can you explain that to us\nSo that was uh in in Nineteen Ninety Donald Trump was really in his darkest moment he was facing a payment on a bond basically a a money he own oath to lenders um and he couldn't make it from the revenue the casinos his father's a lawyer showed up\nWith checks totaling three and a half million dollars\nBought some gambling chips took the chips back out to the limousine and went back to queens with them and and never cash them so that was an eventually determined to be an illegal loan Fred Trump or had given his son to help them make a payment get over that hump\nWonder if we all should be clear here I mean even if even if officials in New York or the IRS had known all of these things about the Trump family Suzanne\nWeb streaming has made possible by David Alaska gallery a fine art gallery located in the ... neighborhood of Nashville showing work in a variety of media by contemporary artists working in the southeast and beyond open Tuesday through Saturday current exhibitions and artists that David luck gallery dot com\nOr a big one is they would have had to pay taxes on all the uh on all the money but there could have been civil civil fines I'm there potentially could have been criminality I mean we talked about one area with all county where you know they use these padded receipts that they are\nThat they came up with to drain the empire they didn't pass those costs\nOnto the tenants and I'm In doing so you know they inflated they they did it on and you know they did it with inflated receipts and they shouldn't have done it\nThat potentially could go into areas of wire fraud among other areas and not\nSo there's a range of things um and now you could be looking at not only having to um they're they're facing potential not only back taxes but penalties in interest on the money that's out so there's there's a lot of things that that I think various taxing authorities um another authorities could be looking at um\nWhat does this could have ended up in in federal prison for this ...\nFederal or state prison it depends on who choose to prosecute it the the clearest a legal violation that could go into a crime was what she was describing all county they were filing false documents or with a state agency um and there would be slower level charges that would flow to that\nAnd yes those could be we've talked to several former prosecutors who said that looks like\nSomething that could have clearly been prosecuted as a state crime\nClearly some of our listeners some of you feel that this is not as big a story as some of our listeners feel it is Charlie wrote on our Facebook page sounds like President Trump is more brilliant than we ever thought\nAnd freedom and Jay tweeted so you're prove that Donald Trump success did start with a loan from his father as he stated ... exactly is the discrepancy none Sudan and they're interesting\nComments I had one one thing that when when we started out Donald Trump has has stated that he started with a million dollar loan and he built it into a billion dollar empire he's now in the White House and he ran a campaign based on being sort of a self made\nBillionaire um there is no evidence necessarily that he is a billionaire but what we showed is that he inherited hundreds of millions of dollars over his lifetime from his father um and some of that was done through tax fraud\nAnd electronic express with a comprehensive selection of smart appliances

A. M. U. dot org mark before we get into the details of Sergei Skripal is life I Wonder what you make of this story over all this kind of captured the world's attention why do you think that this got such international attention\nWell it's an outrage assigned his name uh to use that kind of substance on on the streets of a foreign city in order to settle the school I think it's something that a lot of people find extraordinary and you know\nIn in both senses of that would that it's an extraordinary provocative thing but some people I think to have trouble\nBelieving the British Government marriage had been ...\nI have to say though you know as time has gone on particularly things we've seen in the last month now off\nWith the identification of two suspects and then rushing Janice and acts but it's working to find out the real identities of those people who came to the u._k. on season and and then to link them to this ministry intelligence service the geo you you know it'll do seem to be pointing pretty clearly in that direction\nLet's talk more about the G are you what exactly is it and what is it do\nWell at the Russian initials stand for main intelligence directorate and it's the it's a direct threats of\nThe Russian general stuff the ...\nOr the ... that I think some plans for the Russian ministry and this is the same in a lot of countries that historically the general stuff will have its own intelligence development and that's been the case in changing one or two that bureaucratic details but more or less since the Russians civil war in the ... century\nThat the a Soviet then Russian general stuff has had this organization\nAnd ate embraces a whole a sway the capabilities and the idea of a good kid reconnaissance so intelligence as practiced by the geo you as a very broad concept\nAnd that can be two guys creeping forward on their bellies in eastern Ukraine trying to see if they can ... the Ukrainian forces and basically behaving as soldiers on the battlefield\nAnd it can be a guy in a ... tell policy in Madrid in Nineteen Ninety six\nOn direct cover of being a scientific and technical for sex tree at the embassy and it can also embrace things like cyber warfare and spy satellites so it's an organization that has many thousands of people working for it it also has special operations forces\nAre ... and a very broad capabilities\nHow Sergei Skripal joined the G argue\nWell joining the GI you particularly ah back in the Soviet period when he got involved or he was invited in Nineteen Seventy nine\nIt was a pretty mysterious thing you weren't supposed to really know about it you couldn't supply it was them who approach you and he'd been involved he was in the ... and he was a in a reconnaissance unit that did some pretty daring things like they went into China or on the cover and\nYou know and there are other missions as well that are described in my book\nAnd I think this protein to the attention of the G all you as being the kind of stay the guy who who had the right stuff and they invite you to have you had an ... an exam and he goes through that said later that year he started at the ... what's cool limited to just

A. M. U. dot org tweet us at one at a or comments on our Facebook page regarding the poisoning Martin asks\nAnd there were five people substantially exposed to the nerve agent insults break one of whom died what's the condition of the others\nMark [noise] um well ah\nSo those people on Nick ... who was a police officer who went to this ... house on the day of the poisoning he is a much better but to still not ready to return to work [noise]\nUh of course a Charlie Rose Lee who was one of those\nWho are then found the bustle\nOr in the summer in June and uh he's caught in the dorm study 'cause the person who died Charlie Rose the lightning Bailey is to have had a very small very small dies so he was a very on well for a week or two but he also has made a recovery of salts\nAnd then of course you get to you to a script pile and ... and\nUh she was discharged from hospital a several weeks before he was once again I think one can infer from that but to a lesser dosage\nAnd so I suppose you could say the most serious they affected person who survived well ... himself\nUm when I interviewed the medical stuff their hospital you are you how to ... talk to Steven jokes\nThey was saying well ah we think that will be long term side effects but it's very hard for us to predict what may also I think one would still say that ... call themselves within the prices of ... my understanding or they're all some long term effects but of course\nYou know if people are not a keen to discuss the specific that advice because it's an issue of ... medical confidentiality and ah because I think there are still quote of unknowns\nWith regard to Yulia ... daughter Anna emailed\nIt's often assumed in the media that his daughter was an accidental casualty however her fiance was a gi argue employee whose mother was also a high level G R U operative\nWhen she tried to reach her fiance from the hospital he and his mother disappear also interesting and it goes on to write also interesting that the two alleged hit men flew on the same flight as the daughter to London\nConsidering that scruples wife and son died earlier somewhat suddenly it seems that the poisoning when the daughter was visiting was not an accident\nThe big question in my mind is this an operation ordered by some unhappy G R U operatives or a higher level order\nMark [noise]\nWell I I'll just pick colds and one little base it on as a description that the the two people are two suspects or did not flying on the same plane as you describe how they arrived the previous day at a different London apple got wake\nA she arrived then on the science data sowed amounts at Heathrow\nA on a plane for mostly but anyway um let's just talk about uh that's just a detail um look there is definitely something ... about a half\nArrival in the u._k. and the timing of the attack\nI'm ... and right from the outset people I was speaking to who are involved in trying to work out what has happened investigated a believed that the timing was critical now we know even more so that the a suspect named as ... had the\nThe same here the last few days of February\n... and the first couple of days in March during the previous year twenty six team or a big problem twenty Seventeen and then another man\nWho's been isolated or identified by Russian newspapers probably a pseudonym so gay few ... had been in the u._k. at the same time as ... in twenty Seventeen and at the same time late February early March twenty sixteen\nNow this raises questions about or would they ... pounds for some time whether they using the ... but she lived in Russia and therefore they could pack a email account and that's been alleged by the u._k. government that they were hacking it from twenty ... woods and indeed him ...\nUm she seems to have come back to be with her daddy Shia around that time because have bravo Russia had his birthday on the first of march [noise]\nSo that's the ... uh by a light switch Seventeen I'm fortunate they tragically a Sasha by the way he died but it's still supposed that she had come in twenty Eighteen to be with her dad at that time because it would be a difficult time because it was a time they were normally together as a family\nSo that the that it's always been um a a a line of inquiry for the investigators that the\nTiming of the attack was critically linked to use his arrival ah hacking her data by females and stuff which said sure I'll come pick you up from the ... would help them to locate the gay make sure he was not a business trip or in some other way absence\nAnd uh that this would be a good time to do it now and I also mentioned a boyfriend that I'm usually a hat boats and he is a bit of a cab yet he is salt by some to have has connections with\nA one of the Russian intelligence agency thought he was not on the scene for example back in twenty sixteen\nWhen it's believed that they um they got a using the names that if it does have traveled to the u._k.\nHe was not on the scene back in ... when we know according to the u._k. governments\nThat her email account was hacked and he hadn't been on the scene so much more than a year so\nYou know we don't know and no fan of he's not here to defend himself against any allegations that he had played some policy in this um that we know that after the attack um [noise]\nUh well nearly a month off of there was a court hearing to do with medical procedures that to happen and it was stage in ... that he had not been in touch with a hospital for example to find out how she was\nSo the idea that he kind of a vanished from the scene seems to have some substance\nOr you'd have had access to the Internet since a fairly early on in a recovery we don't know whether she's reached out to him or whether indeed they often ... by a social media or messaging ... or email or whatever or buts we have to assume that they no longer income times\nTo get to a few more of your comments and questions from our urban another market tweeted you got that out quick if it's half as good as your previous books it will be a pleasure and an education to read [noise]\nCO asked listening to this broadcast I was wondering if we knew why it was that he decided to defect to and my six mark you kind of suggested that he had kind of bad enough that he had kind of lost faith\nAs it were in the end she are you do have a sense of whether there was a last straw for ...\nUm yeah that's a good question um the way he describes it and it was a gradual process\nWeb streaming is made possible by
