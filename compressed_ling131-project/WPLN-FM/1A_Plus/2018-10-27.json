A. M. U. dot org\nAdam or go see a before we move on to our next story I Wonder if you could respond to that tweet from Michael that reads this just further reinforces that people solely look for media that confirms their already set beliefs\nHow do we break out of this than show people that does you disagree with are still human Adam\nBoy uh I don't know\nI think uh the technologically enabled a fracturing of media is a really really significant factor in the status of our public life right now on the other hand I'm not sure that it's the causal agent um it might be a corollary uh\nI think that um you know we can talk all day about the norms as to the discourse breaking down but a nice that's very real trend are actual substantive policy disagreements between Americans differences in fundamental values\nThat are really really wide and were perhaps paper to over for a lot of years by the media mano culture and now we're able to see them for what they are I Am personally kind of amazed that more political violence doesn't happen in the United states given the depths of these differences\nUm I don't think it's just in how we talk and who we are talking to and who were listening to I think a lot of what we're experiencing hears about fundamental differences in what we believe to be important in life and what we want government to do\n... we had fundamental differences forever and what we believe that but I think\nThere is increased in rhetoric I think I'm demonizing people making people your enemy making than it is the enemy of the people has made a difference and I think that people don't generally talk to each other anymore there's not enough people that go up I mean I\nKind of because I'm a report I talked to everybody but I Will ask people did you vote why did you vote who did you vote for people don't talk anymore they look at their phones and they are in their little bubble\nAnd Eugene I think it's important to note that and I don't know if you encounter those\nWorking for the Washington Post but certainly I Do on a program that's on NPR is that the people who comments on our show or not just our fans are critics listen to I mean I understand the idea about the division but if you hate NPR so much how do you know what we sat on one aid to criticize us if you made the Washington Post so much\nHow do you know what was printed there to criticize it\nYeah and that quite frankly I think that that a behavior if exemplified most\nFrom the president himself who really hate CNN but seems to watch a lot of it um and and I I'm blown away by how many people are are engaging us who don't want us to do what\nIt is that we're doing and and it's unfortunate because I think we all need criticism or the media needs to be criticized we need to be held accountable but we need to be criticized well so that we can serve the public better\nGoing to keep moving from the story again just a quick caution as you listen to the coverage of this story over the weekend you please just remember that the story is moving really really fast we're going to try really hard not to jump to any conclusions\nAbout what has happened there already been some details of the story that had been clarified a walk back so that is common in a fast moving breaking story like this keeping your on your NPR member station for the latest and an eye on NPR dot org ...\nA few more of your comments before we move on\nMatt emailed if Trump is responsible for the bombs are Democrats responsible for the shooter at the Republicans baseball team practice both of these statements are untrue leave mass referring\nCongressman Steve ... beliefs of Louisiana was injured [noise] Philip emailed the suspicious packages may have originated in Florida but the perpetrator or perpetrators tours are not necessarily based there the Unabomber lived in Montana but traveled to Utah and the bay area to physically male here's devices in order to deceive law enforcement\nAll right let's keep moving on with some other stories and if the story continues to move in the next few minutes we'll certainly let you know but let's talk a little bit more about politics particularly with President Trump he was at a rally this week in Houston and he made headlines for a different set of remarks listen\nThat wants to do well frankly not care about our country so much [noise] and you know what we can either\nTo make sure\nReally we're not supposed to use that word you know what I Am I'm a nationalist sub [noise]\nUsing Scott I Wonder if we can get to a clear definition of this term sheer what exactly is a nationalist I mean there's this ... is it typically consider to be what President Trump says it is\nKnowing and neither is global if I'm a according to President Trump to to be charitable or a nationally it's it's just someone who puts America First um\nBut the reality is anyone with a it's a historical context of nationalism knows that it is a world view embraced on other rising I that has led to um you know genocide and violence and separating people not like yourself a\nFrom a spaces that would give them rights that uh\nWe we deemed essential importance as human beings um and so a truck you know early in his campaign I'm really distance himself from the ... the term nationalist when we saw\nA Steve Bannon associated with it primarily because uh the ... the form of nationalism back what's most a familiar with a ban it in the Breitbart community west vat of white nationalism which we've seen um\nYou know sweep Europe and I even hate groups in the states um and so it it's been it's been deemed by most people to be problematic\nTo see Trump embrace it um while misrepresenting it or put him on the receiving end up significant criticism\nAdam are you see I Love you to chime in on this I Know that you are a stickler and rightly so for precision in language and I wonder what your take is on the use of the word nationalist versus say patriot\nParticularly because words like nationalist often heard in in phrases like white nationalism global list has connotations of being anti Semitic give us parse the words parts of the language for us here\nI mean I think Eugene has already done a pretty good job of that I'm a I'm a little bit mystified by this whole story um the ... the idea that for President Trump to say hey I'm a nationalist is remarkable is kind of nuts to me um\nAmerica First his secondary campaign slogan is a perfect crystal ... of nationalism it's\nFor him to put a label on it is I think totally and consequential it would be like if President Trump got in front of a good group of people and said hey my hair is kind of weird\nWill die we all know that um I suppose it's sort of remarkable that you said it but you know it's it's it's a truth that's right in front of us\nI think are a lot of why the comment has gotten the attention is that yes I'm as Eugene fed 'em nationalism has really really bad track record in the twentieth century of leading the genocide and a world wars\nSome people have been a rounding nationalist up to white nationalist and that's a pretty big trip\nNow you could make a very cogent argument that President Trump is functionally a white nationalist in terms of his rhetoric in terms of his policies that that's an arguable point um but he didn't say I'm a white nationalist he said I'm a nationalist anti is manifestly so I don't get why this is a big deal\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nOoh [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and

President Trump sent troops to the U.S Mexico border during the spring defense secretary James Mattis is authorized deploying eight hundred more troops\nTo the southern border give us a sense of what role these troops might be expected to play there and how that might factor into this whole saga regarding the the ...\n[noise] well it it really is as car ruined was pointing out apply of thoughts to play into the political debate here in the United states about these migrants making their way to to the United states and the whole notion of securing the border is also is is a strange one on this because\nI mean if you look at who these migrants are and what they're escaping from they are tired they're hungry they're escaping countries like Honduras and El Salvador Guatemala where they are escaping violence they are extremely poor they they as they are walking up a north towards the United states\nOf their agenda and their hopes and dreams quite clearly is to try and seek asylum in the United states why because they think that they could have better lives in the United states they think that that children would have better lives and really there is no great testament\nTo American soft power that you have you know essentially all around the world people who want to vote with their feet and come to the the the United states and settle\nA and have children and have better lives than simply and and so the troops are part of this larger\nA Trump ... and I guess Republican rhetoric that play into the the idea that some migrants who are coming are coming I'm a you know as sources of great danger when in fact a ... you know if you look at the pictures of who they are and how they're coming in they or anything but\nAnd I also do want to point out a cartoon mention that President Trump or use it to the ... a A R mentioned\nThat uh these migrants are Middle Eastern well for one there was actually no evidence that points to the fact that they could be Middle Eastern but perhaps more importantly he was using um Middle Eastern as a slower of sorts which which\nWe ... we should we should just clarify vice president Mike Pence said that there it's possible that mixed in with these thousands of migrants who were from Central America there may be a few dozen who were Middle Eastern and might have you know ... ... ferry is aims for the country\n... that's exactly right thank you for the car for vacation there but the the point I was getting too was that the use of the of of of Middle East and as the um it is extremely dangerous because it it it ... van tries to create the impression that being Middle East and\nI'm means you're dangerous so that you're a terrorist and and and that too is is is a dangerous loaded way of looking at as Carlin was pointing out again\nYou know migrants from from those parts of the world often try to make their way to the United states and the reason why this has become a bigger thing right now the numbering into thousands is because it has been politicized here and the United states\nMichael Goldfarb I Wonder if we should be careful with the language we use to describe this large group of people a number of you have comments that to us about that with these this terminology including the use of the word and migrants\nMaria writes I Am Honduran I was born and raised in Honduras I came to the U.

[laughter] what they're doing it on\nI was just gonna say it's an interesting case because of the way that the British laws are structured to say for have that that this this question which is the greater good here right because this is that\nIt does that mean ten minutes already then a question as can you know the the little guy or the little girl in this instance you know stand up against that big powerful wealthy usually now and then player who's pulling things at ... ... ... doing things that they shouldn't be doing that because as power and\nI'm inclined to able to get away with that it it kind of perfect and ... and ... it's kind of the perfect at ... I guess to see what else\nActing more is it the reputation of the kids in this way where it ended as can be applied to these papers that were never a party to them or is it getting us out in the public space and so there's like an extra level in the u._k.\nAnd determining you know how much of a national or international conversation I guess at this point all of this is going to be in terms of does one wrong done effect you know an entire society and and how should it be sorted out\nRight now here in the U.S we are understandably focused on the mid term elections what Brazilians are focused on a presidential election they have to the polls on Sunday to choose between two radically different candidates in the second round of voting\nFernando ... on the left ... is on the right in ... the lead in most polls many expect him to win the election joining us now from Sao paolo is Sarah ... who is Brazil correspondents for the economist Sara welcome to want to\nThank for having me\nRemind us about ... he's been pretty controversial explain to us why\nWell Booker has been a congressman for a couple of decades now and then they become ... or ask for any particular\nLegislation that that are more for ... ... ... and a woman and a minority and ... and go and and that has given money to\nBurn a provocative reputation that a lot of people to compare him to come by its own otherwise known as ... and our Congress and our acreage so\nOn and it could have a full blown up to ... put it up as an outsider or your feet on you know like around to pretend regarding that are kind of hoping a so called up and put the country back on TALK\nShows that why he is so popular I mean you know the Brazil has had a number of issues that kind of the cascading issues with corruption over the years have just kind of she's outsider status has eclipse any social misgivings or maybe about him\nWell what kind of I'm I'm a ... he would um Ramon club popular me when I heard about a year in Laos on high end the call but everyone looks sort of expecting that long it would be kind of lost touch", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "27"}
