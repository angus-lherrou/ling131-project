to Thomas comments on Facebook Tommy rights\nWhen speeches free and in the open people get pushed back when it is driven underground is giving legitimacy and leads to action\nOne of the sites that has made news lately is this social network called gab dot com which I don't think a lot of people had heard of before this incident what what can you tell us about gab\nAnd the kind of online footprint that Robert Bowers had\nThere so a gab dot com is a sort of a basically a Twitter clone um and it is was created under the premise of a maximalist free speech beliefs so the idea was a lot of you know racist begets [laughter] we're getting kicked off of Twitter\nFor for violating Twitter's community standards are\nAnd gab was sort of a a another refuge for them a place where you could say anything because we believe in the you know the absolute power of of free speech but what ended up happening with gab is at it it became a cesspool it became a place where only these sort of worst people would go to express ideas that\nAre that we're really not tolerated elsewhere because they were hateful because they were angry I ... it it has become a\nA place where white nationalism a and an extreme or bigotry homophobia whatever a has a has been embraced and and uh and this was a place where the the Pittsburgh shooter I'm not going to say at his name\nWas ... maybe not radicalize necessarily but but certainly able to express and have an audience for a lot of his\nI truly hateful views it was the last place where he\nPosted before at the ...\nSort of a a a an unproductive vent for a lot of that hatred I'm an after\nAfter um after it was clear that the shooter had been an active participant on gab there was a lot of push back a lot of people who are coming in realizing this for the first time a note noticed that ah that that this place is a dark\nPlace to incubate a lot of awful ideas gab\nResponded saying a words are not bullets in social media posts a have a body count at zero sort of saying that you know this free speech is different from from action\nAnd I started when they did they actually say words are not bullets anyone who says that should go read the declaration of independence with\nIt you know what's interesting about this and this is something that happens a lot of free speech communities on line that they don't really believe necessarily for speech but just in being able to say anything outrageous I is that it actually shows that that that the owners of gab\nDevalue speech to a degree if they believe that it has no consequences than than there is sort of this you know this odd warped understanding of why protected so hard if it means nothing um and and I think that that is something that that a lot of people don't quite grapple with especially on the Internet\nRobotic cars I Wonder how you view kind of the phenomenon of of sites like ... job is off the only place where this kind of speech to lift weights on line it is worth noting since our program one a as maimed up to be First Amendment the first to limit lesson\nHate speech is protected by the first amendment you were allowed to make hateful nasty vitriolic comments\nIncitement to violence tends to be the line whereby speech becomes\nCurtailed so there is a case for protecting this kind of hateful rhetoric but rabbi Jacobs the Internet has given a new kind of speed and virulence that I can only imagine makes makes encounters like what happened to Pittsburgh all the more worrisome looks like you\nShort well first of all it's not news that hate speech can lead to violent actions the book of proverbs teaches us that death and life or in the hands of the tongue and that unfortunately\nHas become more and more true I've seen how true that ancient wisdom is particularly over the last two years but certainly over thousands of years of history\nAnd it's true that hate speech is protected speech that said that doesn't mean that every privately owned platform has to give everybody the right to ... such hate speech\nSo it's different when we're talking about the government controlling speech then when we're talking about whether everybody has the right to say whatever they want wherever they want on whatever platform they want\nThey also just wanted to say something about the ... that one of the to respond to one of the Facebook comments that you read\nThere has been particularly over the last couple of days certainly over the last couple of years a lot of ... and it's true of course that their corners of the left where there is anti Semitism it's true that there's anger but we've seen nothing like\nThe white nationalism that we've seen from the right and what's crucial is not the question of where there's more hate I think it's clear that there's more hate on the right against Jews against people of color against algae ... people against immigrants refugees et cetera\nAnd what's crucial is that that is being\nThat that hatred is being supported and embolden from the very top when the president of the United states that the white nationalist see him as an ally they see him as somebody who will come out after Charlottesville and talk about the very fine people on both sides\nAnd that's what's crucial we don't have a situation in which we have somebody on the last two is in charge we have somebody\nAnd who is at the very least winking at the white nationalist the racist anti Semite sometimes retreating them sometimes putting out content like the very last campaign ad before the election in which he\nHighlighted George Soros Janet Yellen and Lloyd Blankfein and suggested that they were a part of some large conspiracy pulling the levers of power in the United states of course trap the taps into very old anti Semitic tropes ... and so we\nYeah but it was a a I'm Sorry where am I going to do you wanna get a little deeper into that\nA lot of thought a lot of our listeners have been trying to get on that and endure I'd love to to get your thoughts with that on that I mean the president did address this during a speech at the future farmers of America convention in Indianapolis on Saturday he began his speech by talking about the shooting\nToday with one unified voice we condemn the historic evil of anti Semitism\nAnd every other forms of evil and unfortunately the vote comes in many forms and we come together as one American people\nPart of the president's opening of his speech to the future farmers of America in Indianapolis over the weekend but contrast that with what the president tweeted this morning she wrote quote\nThere is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news the fake news media the true enemy of the people\nMust stop the open an obvious hostility and report the news accurately and fairly that will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides

I actually feel some hope after the massacre it was obvious that the bigoted crude and hateful language from prominent people would end in tears we were told it was just trumping trumped telling it like it is you could be as prejudiced and root as he liked it was his right under the first amendment it wasn't his fault people looked on him as a role model\nNow that everyone sees the consequences we can all mobilize against hate speech and hate crimes and frankly it's about time [noise]\nA GW tweets hate speech is free speech if we're going to live in a free society that's how it has to be but legally acceptable behavior isn't necessarily morally or socially acceptable behavior we can fight back against hate speech with our own words are votes and our money\nAce in Chapel Hill North Carolina writes real media has to start calling out outlets like Fox News for their lives and propaganda that enables hate speech to be propagated NPR and other rational sources have to call out the president's lies and distortions there\nNeeds to be consistent strong resistance to the hateful devices speech that is anti American journalists needs to be less accommodating end quote unquote fair to all opinions and stop repeating without strong criticism of the president's ignorant ramps if not you who make America kind again\nLet's get back to the phones and again thanks to those of you who have been patient with us on the phones we know that screening has been tough today but we've had to screen very hard with some of the people who felt like sharing their comments on our air we won't hear from those folks but we will hear from David who's here in Washington DC Hey David what's on your mind\nI'm well thanks orange forever the show I um I guess I'm I'm speaking as someone who's both religious suggestion also very much scientific I think there's a strong feeling\nAmong a lot of us that there has been a a much lower acceptance on the left of people who have started with religious is\nAt a closed next to the state of Israel I mean uh I teach at a a small just ... here in the city and or in the in the suburbs and a lot of ... out in the bill that um you know they express a\nStrong inherent that Israel or those religious views that are um you know about\nThat they won't be accepted and I think that that's something that needs to be talked about to um\nYou David how how do you deal with it when it comes up on on your campus can you give us an example of how it shows up and and how ... will be a little bit\nWell I mean we're Jewish religious school so you know for us you know we\nNeither are students who are you know are not strictly\nStrongly support of Israel in one way or the other but um when our students leave the school you know they often find their captives unfriendly they're fun professors especially a friendly if they want to express a pro Israel standpoint and uh so I mean while it's true I mean I don't\nThink it's reasonable say that you're seeing a lot of violence from the left and that that's true I think you are saying and I think our students feel certain intolerance 'em when they go to college um and it's you know I don't know we we felt\nWe do some kids who probably should need need to shut up you know an artificial it but the you know you can't argue with that we're\nJust not going to have to learn to live with that she kind of pick your battles and I think it was a hard thing\nYeah depicted battles which I mean I don't speak for the school uh but I've certainly advised to do that and not\nAn idle everything will David ... book can be can be very hard\nDavid let me put that to you for sharing that when you put that to ... Jacobs rubber what do you make of David comment\nThank you David I wanted to respond both to you and to Stephanie who are speaking about one of the the same phenomenon really I Want to save Seventy first of all I'm really sorry that your son is going through that unfortunately it's not unusual these days but of course a high school students shouldn't have to experience that kind of hatred\nAnd for both of you I Want to be very clear that there certainly is anti Semitism and the left and very often it expresses itself\nAs as attacks on Israel on Israel's right to exist now that's different from saying that criticism of Israel's policy is is anti Semitic which it's not and you can criticize any countries policies but often that criticism of Israel crosses a line into anti Semitism\nAnd as an organization that is pro Israel and also critical of many of Israel's governmental policy as we are all the time speaking out against the places on the left where\nWhere that criticism crosses the line and we have to be really clear about where those places are I have an article actually in the Washington Post that tries to lay out some of the places in which criticism of Israel is not criticism of a country and its policies but rather crosses over into\nStraight up anti Semitism and unfortunately we have seen incidents around the world in which there are people who carry out\nWho carry a violent acts and say that they're motivated by hatred of Israel but the targets are actually choose who are shopping in a grocery store in a jewelry store in a synagogue\nAnd at the same time in the United states right now again saying that we have to call out that anti Semitism the left what's different about the anti Semitism and other hatred a race racism and homophobia and seeing a phobia and the right is it it's being supported by the government\nIt would be different if we had a situation in which there was hatred on the left hatred on the right and somebody at the top who is trying to restore who's ... who is criticizing\nAny kind of hatred and who is trying to restore civil discourse to the U. S. but instead we have somebody at the very top who is encouraging the hatred on the right and riling up his people\nAnd we get to a few more of your comments as we continue our conversation which has many recalls as we can is well Stacy wrote on our Facebook page I Am emotionally exhausted I was in my own synagogue on Saturday when I heard the news\nWeb streaming is made possible by the national opera presenting three December is Jake Aggies emotional often humorous trauma explores how to love and embrace the family are given especially during the holidays based on the play by parents McNally opens November eighth Nashville opera dot org\nFilled me with hope various religious leaders offered support strengths and loved to a community crushed by its loss if anything is going to change we citizens must make it happen last night's fellowship help to bind our wounds and set us on the path for making our town better\nIndira would you react to that I feel like part of what worked [laughter]\nI hate to say in Pittsburgh favorable one of the things I think helped in this whole process as you described scroll hill\nIs it's the kind of community that had these ties long before this happened so that people who needed to come together already had someone crisis struck they just they just rolled out and they knew how to lock arms with one another\nThat's right I mean a squirrel hill is a very ... this is one factor is a very educated community\nUm it's right next to CMU Carnegie Mellon university and pet and a lot of the people who live and scroll hill are um you know doctors lawyers professors teachers accountants dentists it's an educated community at tolerant community and Pittsburgh overall\nIs also um you know politically a liberal community and it voted something like between Seventy and eighty percent for Hillary Clinton and this last election even though Pennsylvania\nUm went for Donald Trump so the community of Pittsburgh overall and the mayor I'm Bill ... has been you know talking about tolerance for a long time and that is the history of the city so that's why I Would say yes it did help in Pittsburgh favor but\nYou know all of the negative rhetoric that we have coming um we were talking about the end of the enemy of the people line earlier that the president tweeted this morning\nI'm we now know that a bomb was apparently headed for CNN was just intercepted today in Atlanta just four months ago and attack or killed five reporters in Indianapolis News the Capitol is that\nSo you know I I Do think we have to worry about drawing the line um I mean meaning there is a line between hateful rhetoric and I'm hateful actions because of group polarization that happened\nThen just attack on the one in here just mentioned CNN is reporting that a suspicious package that was addressed to CNN was intercepted in a post office in Atlanta the investigation I don't think has at least field at any public information in terms of what was in the package whether it was similar to the ones\nThis is Ninety point three WPN land Nashville public radio Ninety One point five WTO mountains of Houma and Ninety One point seven W.

that came up earlier we had a comment referring to one\nOf the victims of the shooting in Pittsburgh referencing her as a Holocaust survivor one of the victims who was Ninety seven years old rose ...\nThere's been some reporting on this rose ... wasn't ... not a Holocaust survivor so some of those stories have been\nCorrected however there was a Holocaust survivor who was on the scene and narrowly escaped being caught up in the mass shooting ... it\nWas a few minutes late to synagogue vet date but was in the area of the tree of life congregation in Pittsburgh when the shooting took place who just wanted to correct that before we move on again this is a fast moving breaking story best to keep an eye out on NPR dot org for the very latest or on your NPR member station [noise]\nHow do we prevent accused sexual predators like Harvey Weinstein team from silencing the people the abuse\nAmong other things some states are passing new laws that prohibit certain kinds of confidentiality agreements Zelda Perkins was an assistant to the Hollywood mobile and she says some of the current laws protect criminals\nPerkins left Weinstein's company Miramax back in Nineteen Ninety eight after a colleague revealed that winds dean had tried to rate park last year Perkins broke her confidentiality agreement after about Twenty years of keeping her co worker secret here she is in an interview with the BBC\nI understand that no disclosure agreements have the patience\nAll right um but it's really it's really important that legislation is changed around how these agreements and ... you cannot have\nAn equal document that protects the criminal\nMany state lawmakers agree with ms Perkins this year in the wake of the me too and time's up movement Tennessee Vermont and Washington state among others pass laws banning certain kinds of confidentiality agreements other states including Maryland and California passed laws that expense sexual harassment protections to workers like freelancers\nIt's another example of states taking action while Congress makes promises and remains deadlocked\nSo they will discuss these new state laws and what impact they could have workers and employees it's the final part of our special series this state where where we've been focusing on the bills and initiatives that are trending in state capitals\nJoining us here in Studio to discuss it is Emily Martin the vice president for education and workplace justice at the national Women's Law center\nThe organization administers the time's up legal Defense Fund\nWhich assists with sexual harassment cases Emily welcome back to want to say thanks for having me joining us from the University of Oregon is Elizabeth tip it an associate professor at Oregon law school\nShe's also a former employment lawyer Elizabeth welcome thanks for having me and Suzanne whole team is the program director of the employment labor in retirement program at the national conference of state legislatures in Denver Suzanne thanks for making time for us yes things happening we also have to make time for you particularly\nIf you had experience with sexual harassment sexual abuse and felt like the law did or did not\nProtect you if the law did not protect you in your state\nWhat went wrong or perhaps what did the laws in your state do write\nComments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a acts W. A. M. U. dot for Emily Martin before we get into the state laws let's talk about the federal sexual harassment laws who do they cover and who don't recover\nSo when you look at workplace sexual harassment laws um title seven as the federal law that says that you can't discriminate based on sex and that includes harassing people on the basis of sex\nBut title seven only covers you if your employer has at least Fifteen employees that if you work for a very small employer federal law doesn't protect you against sexual harassment\nAnd title sudden also only covers employees so that means if you're an independent contractor if you're a freelancer maybe if you're a volunteer or an unpaid intern that you aren't protected by our federal sexual harassment law\nShe was in ... the number of states including Vermont and New York in Delaware have expanded sexual harassment protections to apply to lure workers tell us a little bit about more tell us a little bit more about which states are expanding protections and who they're covering\nYeah definitely so we've seen at least twenty states introduce legislation in twenty Eighteen on workplace sexual harassment and the majority of the states I had introduced legislation as it relates to lending or prohibiting nondisclosure agreements or ending first arbitration agreement so\nWe've seen states are so far enact legislation on that area including Arizona Maryland New York taxi California and he mentioned Vermont and Washington\nAnd other states are also looking at extending training requirements and so how many hours messed a employees are employers and require training and so we've seen legislation on that path in um California is just one example of that\nElizabeth tipping I'd love to hear from you about some workers like freelancers and contractors who may or may not be protected by these laws we heard from the inner ear is already who told NPR\n... when she was a contract worker once while singing in a band and once while working as a tutor she says she could not report the incidents to a chart and as a contract worker she had no employer to sue\nI thought about it and I was like I don't want to pose that on my social media ... it can change your reputation I really wish I could have protecting myself in both situation there I feel like I Would have had a sense of the agency and and what it felt in control of my life\nFrustrated but how common is this for freelancers in in a situation\nI Do think it's really important to extend protections for independent contractors and that's because employers have no incentive\nTo provide a remedy an internal fix for contractors if they're not even covered by the laws that at all\nSo even basic protections are like your caller referenced like being able to use the employers hotline being able to use the employers complaints system the employer is not going to be interested in extending those the contractors unless they're covered by the laws\nWere speaking to Elizabeth typically associate professor at the University of Oregon school of law Susan whole team program director for employment labor and retirement at the national conference of state legislatures and Emily Martin the vice president for education and workplace justice at the national Women's Law center Emily I'd love you to react to a comment that came in from Charlotte\nCharlotte emailed I Am a Florida based graduate student at Boston University\nThis year ... required all students all staff in all faculty to complete a sexual assault training course\nI had no idea how many legal terms are associated with such a difficult subject it's complicated without this require training I Would never have known about my rights as a Floridian much less where to look\nEmily this is rather complicated although some states including Delaware Illinois California have passed laws expanding sexual harassment training and the education requirements for for some employers\nThat is true we have seen this year and generally seen a lot of policymaker energy in the states around the issue of workplace harassment which is exciting that they've been creative [noise]\nUm well to bear thinking about how do we really solve this problem and one of the things that lawmakers have focused on is\nRequiring training or expanding training requirements again under federal law there is no requirement per se that employers train employees on sexual harassment a lot of employers do but it's not because I'm federal law makes them do it\nNow we don't know as much as we wish we did about what sorts of training are really affected what sorts of training really make a difference in changing behavior\nSo one of the things that I Hope comes from this long overdue attention she workplace harassment is some attention to learning more about what kinds of training can really make change in the workplace\nYeah I I Do want to put that to you professor to but also in terms of what you think makes the biggest difference I mean as a certain types of training or the other new kinds of state laws that you think would be the most effective in reducing harassment\nWell when\nYou think about me to as a sign of a broken system you want to attack all of the aspects of the system so part of it might be that our laws in general do not really hold employers accountable when there is harassment in the workplace that it's relatively easy especially under federal law for employers to get out of them\nMore at Frist art museum daughter worked\nAs a journalist it feels great to meet a deadline under

Eric in dot edu\nBack down to our conversation about so called me to legislation trends in New state laws the name to strengthen protections against sexual harassment\nWas Emily Martin of the national Women's Law center Suzanne whole scene of the national conference of state legislatures\nAnd University of Oregon law school assistant professor associate professor Elizabeth typically we welcome some more of your questions and thoughts as well especially if the laws in your state that deal with sexual harassment sexual abuse worked for you or failed you we'd love to hear your story or even just your questions about the way these laws work\nComments on our Facebook page tweet us at one eighty or email one day at W. A. M. U. dot org Emily Martin I Love to get your reactions to what we heard from California state senator ... Jackson sounds like can't like California is trying to do quite a bit to improve the way that we prevent and prosecute sexual harassment what do you think\nThat California's ban a real leader in space those with the laws that um we just heard about that\nAs well as if you love the unfortunately we're vetoed by the governor that would have expanded the statute of limitations for bringing a workplace sexual harassment claim you know in under federal law it's often as short as a hundred and eighty days from the date of the harassment when you have to bring a claim and given that we're talking about\nI'm Talking about activity that really leaves people traumatized that is not enough time often for people to figure out what they need to do how they want to do it to find their attorney to find out how they can take action\nSo you know we joined the national Law Center joined with more than two hundred and fifty other organizations this week\nCalling for twenty states by twenty twenty to pass comprehensive sexual harassment protections and California I think is really a beacon\nFor other states and thinking about how can they strengthen their laws in meaningful ways many states Emily that you're targeting in particular\nWell I think that one of the things that we've seen this past year is that it's not just progressive states for example Tennessee a past new prohibitions on employers requiring employees to sign non disclosure agreement that the condition of coming to work that would ah\nKeep employees from talking about sexual harassment when it happened and so we're really thinking broadly that this is a nationwide problem that requires a nationwide solution\nSuzanne ... your thoughts on what we heard from state senator Jackson\nYeah I think that's a great example of a legislators I'm really trying to grapple with how to deal with sexual harassment in the workplace and and\nI'm introduced a lot of different types of legislation to get at that I think we've seen a lot of creative um pieces of legislation in other states one thing that\nI did want to mention is Illinois has a really interesting piece of legislation where they created a sexual harassment hotline which is the first time that we've seen that across the states and that provides legal assistance as well as as a way to report sexual harassment of workplace in private and public sector\nBefore we keep going I Would note that quite a few of you have commented to us today about state laws that are aimed at statute of limitation laws we did an entire hour not too long ago discussing just that very topic\nYou can find the conversation on statute of limitations on line at the one a dot org sets the words are the number one the letter a dot org Susan let me stick with you we mentioned nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements you mentioned the state of Tennessee\nCalifornia, Maryland and other states have also banned certain kinds of those agreements and in a number of states those laws passed unanimously I Wonder if she's in if we could begin to the line of where nondisclosure agreements come into play I mean they're not\nInherently illegal they can have a purpose\nIn contracts I work in news a lot of people who work in journalism have certain kinds of contracts about disclosing privileged information Dennis wrote on our Facebook page\nThere was a place for legitimate nondisclosure agreements however it is a disservice to our communities one beer used to hide illegal behavior I Would be comfortable with laws that allowed anyone to speak with law enforcement in such cases regardless of the existence of this agreement Suzanne\nYes well that's interesting and I will say that states are not all states in their legislation specify these contracts as nondisclosure agreements\nAnd sometimes they just called them contracts um or other types of agreements most of the legislation that we've seen us specifically says nondisclosure as it relates to sexual harassment in the workplace so it wouldn't necessarily ban nondisclosure in great agreements and hold but just as it relates this specifically\nWant to too much for there can you just define that term force what exactly is a non disclosure agreement what exactly do they do\nWell there's actually two types there's the type that you mentioned that people sign at the start of their employment that says keep our information confidential and that was another type of people signed usually after they're already involved in a lawsuit or they've hired a lawyer\nAnd those are to settle the person's legal claims and those are the ones I think that had become most problematic because in those cases it's clear that some sort of bad conduct of the current or is disputed and in those cases both parties might agree that they're not going to talk about the facts on her line the case\nFor someone who speak with you from it I I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of the line for confidentiality agreements or help for hurtful in terms of dealing with sexual harassment I understand that you have said that they may not be enforceable because they may be some there may be some contradictions\nWith federal law but I Would gather that sometimes they can be in the best interest of the person who's been sexually harassed where do you see the line\nWell\nFor the contracts that you sign up the start of your job I think it's helpful to have a law that makes clear that does can't cover sexual harassment or other forms of harassment or discrimination because essentially forces the employer to disclose in the contract\nThat keep our business information confidential but if you experience unlawful conduct you're allowed to talk about that so the contracts in a way educate the employees about their rights\nIt's a lot more complicated though if you're talking about settling a lawsuit because in that case many times the person who's represented by a lawyer and I've heard plaintiff lawyers say that they like these provisions because it's moving a path toward the settlement\nAnd the thing that's kind of hard about this is the people who maybe had the most interests and learning this information aren't at the table future effect and potential victims of harassment they don't have a say in whether the victim and the employer decides to keep the information secret\nWas because of some of your comments and questions Alix tweeted earlier this year in the army I got sexually harassed by another soldier\nLuckily we have to go through sharp training every year we all like to make fun of it we make fun of it to the point where when I actually had to use it I knew exactly what to do\nStuff on emailed my girlfriend works for a college in upstate New York while in Chicago for a work conference a resident of Illinois sexually assaulted her despite my encouragement she is terrified of coming forward for fear of retribution\nDo laws across state lines especially in Illinois and New York\nComplicate the legalities that would otherwise helped bring perpetrators to justice Emily Martin what would you say the stuff on\nWell that's a great question if you're talking about state law protections that go above and beyond federal lie yes there can be complicated questions that arise if the person is usually employed in one state but the harassing or assaulting behavior was in another\nBut it's important to remember that we're talking about state last day in the ways in which states are going above and beyond federal protection there are core federal protections they should be strengthened in various ways that\nTheir core federal protections against workplace sexual harassment against sexual harassment in schools and so that is a baseline that covers everybody with the important exemptions that we've talked about but no matter you know what's that ... they live in\nA suit and I'd love to get your take on one of the states that did not pass at least one of its proposed bills on sexual harassment and that was in Louisiana it had to do with settlements of sexual harassment cases Louisiana State House bill five seven eight would have stopped employers\nFrom forcing workers to settle sexual harassment disputes are but\nWeb streaming is made possible by Williamson medical center offering a reminder that with deductibles being met
