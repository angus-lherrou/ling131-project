we had to screen out very quickly\nAnd productive calls on the air\nTo those of you who've been making that job a little bit harder I think it might be worth sharing a comment from Alexander who emailed I have a message for those who hold this kind of have in their hearts I don't care who you are I don't care what race you are a part of what creed you follow who you voted for an twenty sixteen I Will find you\nAnd I will love you there's absolutely nothing you can do to stop me\nCharlie ... let's get back to Thomas comments on Facebook Tommy rights\nWhen speeches free and in the open people get pushed back when it is driven underground it has given legitimacy and leads to action\nOne of the sites that has made news lately is this social network called gab dot com which I don't think a lot of people had heard of before this incident what what can you tell us about gab\nAnd the kind of online footprint that Robert Bowers had\nThere so a gab dot com is a sort of a basically a Twitter clone um and it is was created under the premise of a maximalist free speech beliefs so the idea was a lot of you know racists bigots [laughter] we're getting kicked off of Twitter\nFor for violating Twitter's community standards are\nAnd gab was sort of a a another refuge for them a place where you could say anything because we believe in the you know the absolute power of a free speech but when ended up happening with gab is at it it became a cesspool it became a place where only these sort of worst people would go to express ideas that\nAre that we're really not tolerated elsewhere because they were hateful because they were angry I became it it has become a a place where white nationalism\nA and an extreme\nOr bigotry homophobia whatever ah has has been embraced and and and this was a place where the the Pittsburgh shooter I'm not going to say at his name was ... maybe not radicalized necessarily but but certainly able to express and have an audience for a lot of his\nI truly hateful views it was the last\nPlace where he had posted before at the shooting 'em and it seems that it was it was sort of a\nA A N unproductive vent for a lot of that hatred I'm an after after um after it was clear that the shooter had been an active a participant on gab there was a lot of push back a lot of people who are coming and realizing this for the first time\nA note noticed that at that at this place is a dark place to incubate a lot of awful ideas gab responded saying our words are not bullets in social media posts a have a body count at zero sort of saying that you know this free speech is different from from action\nAnd I started when they did they actually say words are not bullets anyone who says that should go read the declaration of independence\nWith it you know what's interesting about this and this is something that happens a lot of free speech communities on line that they don't really believe necessarily for speech but just in being able to say anything outrageous I is that it actually shows that that that the owners of gab\nDevalue speech to a degree if they believe that it has no consequences then then they're sort of this you know this odd warped understanding of why protect it's so hard if it means nothing right um and and I think that that is something that that a lot of people don't quite grapple with especially on the Internet\nJacobs I Wonder how you view kind of the phenomenon of of sites like Gavin Gavin thought the only place where this kind of speech proliferate so online is worth noting since our program one a as named after the first amendment a quick First Amendment lesson\nHate speech is protected by the first amendment you were allowed to make hateful nasty vitriolic comments\nIncitement to violence tends to be the law\nCurtailed so there is a case for protecting this kind of peaceful rhetoric but rabbi Jacobs the Internet has given them a new kind of speed and virulence that I can only imagine makes makes encounters like what happened to Pittsburgh all the more worrisome looks like you\nShort well first of all it's not news that hate speech can lead to violent actions the book of proverbs teaches us that death and life or in the hands of the tongue and that unfortunately\nHas become more and more true exceed how true that ancient wisdom is particularly over the last two years but certainly over thousands of years of history\nAnd it's true that hate speech is protected speech that said that doesn't mean that every privately owned platform has to give everybody the right to speak to such hate speech\nSo it's different when we're talking about the government controlling speech then when we're talking about whether everybody has the right to say whatever they want wherever they want on whatever platform they want [noise]\nI also just wanted to say something about the ... that one of the to respond to one of the Facebook comments that you read\nThere has been particularly over the last couple of days certainly over the last couple of years a lot of ... and it's true of course that their corners of the left where there is anti Semitism it's true that there's anger but we've seen nothing like\nThe white nationalism that we've seen from the right and what's crucial is not the question of where there's more hate I think it's clear that there's more hate on the right against Jews against people of color against algae ... people against immigrants refugees et cetera\nAnd what's crucial is that that is being\nThat that hatred is being supported and embolden from the very top when the president of the United states that the white nationalist see him as an ally they see him as somebody who will come out after Charlottesville and talk about the very fine people on both sides\nAnd that's what's crucial we don't have a situation in which we have somebody\nOn the left who is in charge we have somebody on the right who's the president of the United states and who is at the very least winking at the white nationalist racist anti Semite sometimes retreating them sometimes putting out content like the very last campaign ad before the election in which he\nHighlighted George Soros Janet Yellen and Lloyd Blankfein and suggested that they were part of some large conspiracy pulling the levers of power and the United states which of course trap the taps into very old anti Semitic tropes ... yeah\nIt was a ... I'm Sorry where do you want to get a little deeper into that a lot of folks a lot of our listeners have been trying to get on that and endure I'd love to to get your thoughts with that on that I mean the president\nDid address this during a speech at the future farmers of America convention in Indianapolis on Saturday she began his speech by talking about the shooting\nToday with one of our borders we condemn the historic evil of ...\nAnd every fan of the vote and unfortunately the vote comes in many forms and we come together as one American people\nOf the president's opening of his speech to the future farmers of America in Indianapolis over the weekend but contrast that with what the president tweeted this morning she wrote quote\nThere is green anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news the fake news media the true enemy of the people must stop the opened an obvious hostility and reporting\nThat will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony\nFake news must end unquote gotten a number of comments from some of you about the president's potential role in all of this Susan as in Silver Spring Maryland right outside D.C Susan writes\n[noise]\n\nOh ... what\n[noise] oh\n[noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from visiting

wrote price invest with confidence\nNow to our conversation with rabbi Jill Jacobs Charlie ... let's get to more of your questions and comments Constance in Silver Spring Maryland writes I Know this sounds weird but I actually feel some hope after the massacre it was obvious that the big\nIn tears we were told it was just Trump being Trump telling it like it is you could be as prejudiced and root as he liked it was his right under the first amendment it wasn't his fault people looked on him as a role model now that everyone sees the consequences we can all mobilize against hate speech and hate crimes and frankly it's about time [noise]\nA GW tweets hate speech is free speech if we're going to live in a free society that's how it has to be but legally acceptable behavior isn't necessarily morally or socially acceptable behavior we can fight back against hate speech with our own words are votes and our money\nRace in Chapel Hill North Carolina writes real media has to start calling out outlets like Fox News for their lives and propaganda that enables hate speech to be propagated\nNPR and other rational sources have to call out the president's lies and distortions\nThere needs to be consistent strong resistance to the hateful divisive speech that his anti American journalists need to be less accommodating end quote unquote fair to all opinions and stop repeating without strong criticism the president's ignorant rants if not you who make America kind again\nLet's get back to the phones and again thanks to those of you who have been patient with us on the phones we know that screening has been tough today but we've had to screen very hard with some of the people who felt like sharing their comments on our air we won't hear from those folks but we will hear from David who's here in Washington DC Hey David what's on your mind\nI'm well thanks orange forever the show I um I guess I'm I'm speaking as someone who's both religious the Jewish and also very much scientific I think there's a strong feeling\nAmong a lot of us that there has been a a much lower acceptance on the left of people who have a starting with religious views and a close connection state of Israel I mean I teach at a a small just ... here in the city and or in this in the suburbs and a lot of her students do feel uncomfortable with House bill that um\nYou know they express a\nStrong and here is that if Israel or especially religious views that aren't um you know but I mean about hot button social issues but is there to see is that they won't be accepted and I think that that's something that needs to be talked about to um\nYou David how how do you deal with it when it comes up on on your campus can you give us an example of how it shows up and and how you are how the school deals with it\nBut I mean we're a Jewish religious school so you know for us you know we\nI mean there are students who are you know are not particularly\nStrongly support of Israel in one way or the other but um when our students leave this school and they often find their campuses unfriendly they find professors especially a friendly if if they want to express a pro Israel standpoint and uh so I mean while it's true I mean I don't\nThink it's reasonable to say that you're seeing a lot of violence and the left and that that's true I think you are saying and I think our students feel certain intolerance 'em when they go to college um and it's you know I don't know we we felt\nWe do tell kids probably shouldn't need need to shut up you know and I don't say shut up that you know you can't argue with every\nJust kind of how you're going to have to learn to live with that she kind of pick your battles and I think that's a hard thing\nTo pick their battles I should I mean I I don't speak for the school uh but I've certainly advised didn't do that and not\nThe not federal everything will David I'm going to be can be very hard\nDavid let me put that to thank you for sharing that let me put that to rabbi Jill Jacobs right but what do you make of Davis common\nThinking a day that I wanted to respond to you and to Stephanie who are speaking about one of the the same phenomenon really Ellen ... first time really tired at your sinus going tree that unfortunately it's not unusual these days but of course at high school state and shouldn't have to experience that kind of hatred\nThat there certainly is anti Semitism and the left and very often it expresses itself\nAs a as a tax on Israel on Israel's right to exist now that's different from saying that criticism of Israel's policy is is anti Semitic which is not even criticize any countries policies but often that criticism of Israel crosses the line into anti Semitism\nAnd as an organization that is pro Israel and also critical of many of Israel's governmental policies we are all the time speaking out against the places on the left where\nWhere that criticism crosses the line and we have to be really clear about where those places are I have an article actually in the Washington Post that tries to lay out some of the places in which criticism of Israel is not criticism of a country and its policies but rather crosses over into\nStraight up anti Semitism and unfortunately we have seen incidents around the world in which there are people who carry out\nWho carry a violent acts and say that they are motivated by hatred of Israel but the targets are actually Jews who are shopping in a grocery store in a Jewish store in a synagogue\nAnd at the same time in the United states right now again saying that we have to call out that anti Semitism the left what's different about the anti Semitism and other hatred a race racism and homophobia and seeing a phobia and the right is that it's being supported by the government\nIt would be different if we had a situation in which there was hatred on the left hatred on the right and somebody at the top who is trying to restore\nWho's ... who is criticizing\nAny kind of hatred and who is trying to restore civil discourse to the U. S. but instead we have somebody at the very top who is encouraging the hatred on the right and riling up his people\nGet to a few more of your comments as we continue our conversation which has many recalls as we can as well Stacy wrote on our Facebook page\nI Am emotionally exhausted I was in my own synagogue on Saturday when I heard the news I was looking forward to going to synagogue to escape the news of the week now there is no escape and no sanctuary but as our nation rabbis teachers the world is a narrow bridge and the main thing to remember is not to be afraid\nLynn wrote on our Facebook page yesterday's interfaith service in Pittsburgh filled me with hope\nVarious religious leaders offered support strengths and loved to a community crushed by its loss if anything's going to change we citizens must make it happen last night's fellowship helped to bind our wounds and set us on the path for making our town better Indira would you react to that I feel like part of what worked [laughter]\nI hate to say in Pittsburgh fever but one of the things I think helped him this whole process as you described school he'll if it's the kind of community that had these ties long before this happened so that people who needed to come together already has shown crisis struck they just they just rolled out and they knew how to locked arms with one another\nRight I mean scroll hill is a very ... this is one factor is a very educated community um it's right next to CMU Carnegie Mellon University in pit\nAnd a lot of the people who live and scroll hill are um you know doctors lawyers professors teachers accountants dentists it's an educated community a tolerant community and Pittsburgh overall\nIs also um you know politically a liberal community and it voted something like between Seventy and eighty percent for Hillary Clinton in this last election even though Pennsylvania\nUm went for Donald Trump so the community of Pittsburgh overall and the mayor I'm Bill ... has been you know talking about tolerance for a long time and that is the history of the city so that's why I Would say\nKnow all of the negative rhetoric that we have coming and we were talking about the end of the enemy of the people line earlier that the president tweeted this morning\nI'm we now know that a bomb was apparently headed for CNN was just intercepted today in Atlanta just four months ago an attacker killed five reporters in Indianapolis News the Capitol gets that\nSo you know I Do think we have to worry about drawing the line um I mean meaning there is a line between hateful rhetoric and I'm hateful actions because of group polarization that happened\nThen just attack on the one in here just mentioned CNN is reporting that a suspicious package that was addressed the CNN was intercepted in a post office in Atlanta the investigation I don't think has at least yielded any public information in terms of what was in the package whether it was similar to the ones\nThat were sent last week but that story is just kind of breaking as of this morning let's get to a few more of your calls and comments including one from Pittsburgh where Lee is on the line highly what's on your mind\nThis is Ninety point three WPN land National Public radio Ninety One point five WTO mountains of Houma and Ninety One point seven WHM rats Cookeville get the latest stories from WPN ... news throughout the day and connect with National Public radio via Twitter and Facebook and W.

station\nThis is one a I'm Joshua Johnson before we continue just wanted to offer a quick clarification for something that came up earlier we had a comment referring to one\nOf the victims of the shooting in Pittsburgh referencing her as a Holocaust survivor one of the victims who was Ninety seven years old rose ...\nThere's been some reporting on this ... was indeed not a Holocaust survivor so some of those stories have been\nCorrected however there was a Holocaust survivor who was on the scene and narrowly escaped being caught up in the mass shooting Judas some it\nWas a few minutes late to synagogue that day but was in the area of the tree of life congregation in Pittsburgh when the shooting took place or just want it to correct that before we move on again this is a fast moving breaking story best to keep an eye out on NPR dot org for the very latest or on your NPR member station [noise]\nHow do we prevent accused of sexual predators like Harvey Weinstein team from silencing the people they abuse\nAmong other things some states are passing new laws that prohibit certain kinds of confidentiality agreements\nZelda Perkins was an assistant to the Hollywood mobile and she says some of the current laws protect criminals Perkins left Weinstein's company Miramax back in Nineteen Ninety eight after a colleague revealed that Weinstein had tried to rape her\nLast year Perkins broke her confidentiality agreement after about Twenty years of keeping her co worker secret here she is in an interview with the BBC\nI understand that ... has had the ... and sometimes they side um but it's way too many important legislation is changed around how these agreements and ... you cannot have an equal document that attack criminal\nMany state lawmakers agree with ms Perkins this year in the wake up to meet you in times of movements Tennessee Vermont and Washington state among others pass laws banning certain kinds of confidentiality agreements other states including Maryland and California passed laws that expands sexual harassment protections to workers like freelancers\nIt's another example of states taking action while Congress makes promises and remains deadlocked\nToday will discuss these new state laws and what impact they could have workers and employees it's the final part of our special series this state where where we've been focusing on the bills and initiatives that are trending in state capitals\nJoining us here in Studio to discuss it is Emily Martin the vice president for education and workplace justice at the national Women's Law center\nThe organization administers the time's up legal Defense Fund\nWhich assists with sexual harassment cases Emily welcome back to what I thanks for having me joining us from the University of Oregon is Elizabeth tip it and associate professor at Oregon law school\nShe's also a former employment lawyer Elizabeth welcome thanks for having me and Suzanne ... is the program director of the employment labor and retirement program at the national conference of state legislatures in Denver Suzanne thanks for making time for us yes things ... we'd also love to make time for you\nAnd sexual abuse and felt like the law did or did not protect you if the law did not protect you in your state what went wrong or perhaps what did the laws in your state do write\nComments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a X. W. A. M. U. dot for Emily Martin before we get into the state laws let's talk about the federal sexual harassment laws who do they cover it and who don't recover so when you look at workplace\nSexual harassment laws um title seven as the federal law that says that you can't discriminate based on sex and that includes harassing people on the basis of sex\nBut titles seven only covers you if your employer has at least Fifteen employees that if you work for a very small employer federal law doesn't protect you against sexual harassment\nAnd title sudden also only covers employees so that means if you're an independent contractor if you're a freelancer maybe if you're a volunteer or an unpaid intern that you aren't protected by our federal sexual harassment law\nShe was in ... the number of states including Vermont and New York in Delaware have expanded sexual harassment protections to apply to more workers tell us a little bit about more tell us a little bit more about which states are expanding protections and who they're covering\nYeah definitely so we've seen at least twenty states introduced legislation in twenty Eighteen on workplace sexual harassment and the majority of the states I had introduced legislation as it relates to limiting or prohibiting nondisclosure agreements or an enforced arbitration agreement so\nWe've seen states are so far enact legislation on that area including Arizona Maryland New York taxi California as you mentioned Vermont and Washington\nAnd other states are also looking addict standing training requirements um so how many hours messed a employees are employers um require training and so we've seen legislation on that passed in California is just one example of that\nElizabeth tipping I'd love to hear from you about some workers like freelancers and contractors who may or may not be protected by these laws we heard from the inner ear is already who told NPR she was sexually harassed on two separate occasions when she was a contract worker once while singing in a band and once while working as a tutor\nShe says she could not report the incidents to a chart and as a contract worker she had no employer to sue\nI thought about it and I was like I don't want to post that on my social media it can change your reputation I really wish I could protect myself in both situation there just I feel like I Would have had a sense of agency and and what it felt in control of my life\nProfessor tipping how common is this for freelancers in the in the situation\nI Do think it's really important to extend protections for independent contractors and that's because employers have no incentive\nTo provide a remedy an internal fix for contractors if they're not even covered by the laws at all\nSo even basic protections are like your caller referenced like being able to use the employers hotline being able to use the employers complaints system the employer is not going to be interested in extending those the contractors unless they're covered by the laws\nWere speaking to Elizabeth typically associate professor at the University of Oregon school of law Susan whole team program director for employment labor and retirement at the national conference of state legislatures and Emily Martin the vice president for education and workplace justice at the national Women's Law center Emily I Love you to react to a comment that came in from Charlotte\nCharlotte emailed I Am a Florida based graduate student at Boston University this year ... required all students all states\nI had no idea how many legal terms are associated with such a difficult subject it's complicated without this require training I Would never have known about my rights as a Floridian much less where to look\nEmily this is rather complicated although some states including Delaware Illinois California have passed laws expanding sexual harassment training and the education requirements for for some employers\nThat is true we have seen his share and generally seen a lot of policymaker energy in the states around the issue of our place harassment which is exciting that they've been creative\nUm will to bear thinking about how do we really solve this problem and one of the things that lawmakers have focused on as\nRequiring training or expanding training requirements again under federal law there's no requirement per se that employers train employees on sexual harassment a lot of employers do but it's not because I'm federal law makes them do it\nNow we don't know as much as we wish we did about what sorts of training are really affected what sorts of training really make a difference in changing behavior\nSo one of the things that I Hope comes from the long overdue attention to workplace harassment is some attention to learning more about what kinds of training can really make change in the workplace\nYeah I I Do want to put that to you professor too but also in terms of what you think makes the biggest difference I mean there's a certain kinds of training or the other new kinds of state laws that you think would be the most effective in reducing harassment well when you think\nAbout me to as a sign of a broken system you want to attack all of the aspects of the system so part of it might be that our laws in general do not really hold employers accountable when there is harassment in the workplace that it's relatively easy especially under federal law firm lawyers to get out of them\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from farmers insurance committed to

God doesn't marry can di di di you\nBack down to our conversation about so called me to legislation trends in New state laws the name to strengthen protections against sexual harassment\nWas Emily Martin of the national Women's Law center Suzanne whole scene of the national conference of state legislatures\nAnd University of Oregon law school assistant professor associate professor Elizabeth typically we welcome some more of your questions and thoughts as well especially if the laws in your state that deal with sexual harassment sexual abuse worked for you or failed you we'd love to hear your story or even just your questions about the way these laws work\nComments on our Facebook page tweet us at one eighty or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot org Emily Martin I Love to get your reactions to what we heard from California state senator ... sounds like can't like California is trying to do quite a bit to improve the way that we prevent and prosecute sexual harassment what do you think\nI agree that California's ban a real leader in the face those with the laws that um we just heard about that were passed last last session\nAs well as if you lost that unfortunately we're vetoed by the governor that would have expanded the statute of limitations for bringing a workplace sexual harassment claim you know in under federal law it's often as short as a hundred and eighty days from the date of the harassment when you have to bring a claim and given that we're talking about\nI'm Talking about activity that really leaves people traumatized that is not enough time off and for people to figure out what they need to do how they want to do it to find their attorney to find out how they can take action\nSo you know we joined the national science lesson or joined with more than two hundred and fifty other organizations this week calling for twenty states by twenty twenty to pass comprehensive sexual harassment protections and California I think it's really a beacon\nFor other states and thinking about how can they strengthen their lives and meaningful way many states Emily that you're targeting in particular [noise]\nWell I think that one of the things that we've seen this past year is that it's not just progressive states for example Tennessee a past new prohibitions on employers requiring employees to sign non disclosure agreement that the condition of coming to work that would ah\nKeep employees from talking about sexual harassment when it happened and so we're really thinking broadly that this is a nationwide problem that requires a nationwide\nSolution Suzanne ... your thoughts on what we heard from state senator Jackson\nYeah I think that's a great example of a legislators I'm really trying to grapple with how to get\nA different types of legislation to get at that I think we've seen a lot of creative um pieces of legislation in other states one thing that\nI did want to mention is Illinois has a really interesting piece of legislation where they created a sexual harassment hotline which is the first time that we've seen that across the states and that provides legal assistance as well as as a way to report sexual harassment or place in private and public sector\nBefore we keep going I Would note that quite a few of you have commented to us today about state laws that are aimed at statute of limitations laws we did an entire hour not too long ago discussing just that very topic\nYou can find that conversation on statute of limitations on line at the one a dot org sets the words are the number one the letter a dot org Susan let me stick with you we mentioned nondisclosure in confidentiality agreements you mentioned the state of Tennessee\nCalifornia, Maryland and other states have also banned certain kinds of those agreements and in a number of states those laws passed unanimously owners and if we can begin to the line of where nondisclosure agreements\nCome into play I mean they're not inherently illegal they can have a purpose\nIn contracts I work in news a lot of people who work in journalism have certain kinds of contracts about disclosing privileged information Dennis wrote on our Facebook page\nThere is a place for legitimate nondisclosure agreements however it is a disservice to our communities when they are used to hide illegal behavior I Would be comfortable with laws that allowed anyone to speak with law enforcement in such cases regardless of the existence of this agreement Suzanne\n[noise] yes well that's interesting and I will say that states are not all states in their legislation specify these contracts as nondisclosure agreements\nAnd sometimes they just call them contracts um or other types of agreements\nMost of the legislation that we've seen us specifically says nondisclosure as it relates to sexual harassment in the workplace so it wouldn't necessarily band nondisclosure in great agreements and hold but just as it relates this specifically to sexual harassment in the workplace\nProfessor typically before we move on to too much for there can you just define that ... what exactly is a non disclosure agreement what exactly do they do well\nThere's actually two types there's a type that you mentioned that people find at the start of there and play meant that says keep our information confidential and that was another type of people signed usually after they're already involved in a lawsuit or they've hired a lawyer\nAnd those are to settle the person's legal claims and those are the ones I think that had become most problematic because in those cases it's clear that some sort of bad conduct has occurred or is disputed and in those cases both parties might agree that they're not going to talk about the facts on her line that case\nFor someone who stick with you for a minute I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of the line for confidentiality agreements or helpful or hurtful in terms of dealing with sexual harassment I understand that you have said that they may not be enforceable because they may be some there maybe some contradictions\nWith federal law but I Would gather that sometimes they can be in the best interest of the person who's been sexually harassed where do you see the line\nWell\nThe contracts that you sign at the start of your job I think it's helpful to have a law that makes it clear that does can't cover a sexual harassment or other forms of harassment or discrimination because essentially forces the employer to disclose in the contract\nThat keep our business information confidential but if you experience unlawful conduct you're allowed to talk about that so the contracts in a way educate the employees about their rights\nIt's a lot more complicated though if you're talking about settling a lawsuit because in that case many times the person is represented by a lawyer and I've heard plaintiff lawyers say that\nAnd I think that's kind of part about this is the people who maybe have the most interests and learning us information aren't at a table future back then potential victims of harassment they don't have a say and whether the victim and the employer decided to keep the information secret\nLet's get some of your comments and questions Alex tweeted earlier this year in the army I got sexually harassed by another soldier luckily we have to go through sharp training every year we all like to make fun of it we make fun of it to the point where when I actually had to use it I knew exactly what to do\nStuff on emailed my girlfriend works for a college in upstate New York while in Chicago for a work conference a resident of Illinois sexually assaulted her despite my encouragement she is terrified of coming forward for fear of retribution do laws across state lines especially in Illinois and New York\nComplicate the legalities that would otherwise helped bring perpetrators to justice Emily Martin what would you say the stuff on\nWell that's a great question if you're talking about state law protections that go above and beyond federal law yes there can be complicated questions that arise if a person is usually employed in one state but the harassing our thoughts and behavior was in another\nBut it's important to remember that we are talking about state law stay in the ways in which states are going above and beyond cetera protections there are core federal protection they should be strengthened in various ways\nThat their core federal protections against workplace sexual harassment against sexual harassment in schools and so that as a baseline that covers everybody with the important exemptions that we've talked about that no matter you know what's it called they live in\nA suit and I'd love to get your take on one of the states that did not pass at least one of its proposed bills on sexual harassment and that was in Louisiana it had to do with settlements of sexual harassment cases Louisiana State House bill five seven eight would have stopped employers\nFrom forcing workers to settle sexual harassment disputes through arbitration state representative Raymond cruise voted against the bill among other things the rep said it would open up litigation for everything\nRight now we're considered one of the most ... states and the nation's one source I just looked at said we're number six six out of fifty on worst states for litigation\nThis is Ninety point three WPN land Nashville public radio Ninety One point five WTO amounts of Houma and Ninety One point seven W.

U. dot org\nToday we're looking at a surge in early voting across America with the help of three stations we're partnering with\nZoe Clark is a program director at Michigan Radio in Ann Arbor Michigan she's also the co host of its program it's just politics so we welcome Joshua joining us from UNC public radio in Greeley, Colorado north of Denver is reporter Michael ... Michael glad to have you with us\nHi Joshua and joining us from Kate M. U. W. public radio in Wichita, Kansas is reporter Brian grim it Brian ... glad to have you with us I happen to be here too by the way our other three partner stations for one a across America or W. B. H M public radio in Birmingham, Alabama\nMinnesota Public radio and Houston Public media and we look forward to hearing more from them in the weeks and months to come but let me start with the three of you in Michigan Colorado in Kansas\nWith regards to early voting in your state particularly accounting for absentee ballots mail in ballots and so forth ... in Michigan let me start with you what's early voting looked like in Michigan\nRight so we actually are seeing an increase or over the last midterm elections I Want to kind of do apples to apples instead of apples to oranges has an inch all watching just 'cause turnout is higher here in Michigan as it is across the country during presidential election so we are comparing to twenty fourteen\nTony fourteen we had six hundred and eighty nine thousand requests for absentee ballot we are now almost at one point one million as of October twenty seconds like sixty percent increase here in the state\nMichael do you want and what about in Colorado what's early voting look like they're\nIt's too early to tell us so far but a big a flood of ballots have already come in about six hundred Nineteen thousand of them and I'm more expected this morning a we have male voting here and people can register\nOn election day and um it's a it's it's too early to tell a but there is a strong turnout so far\nUm and it mirrors or what your guest earlier was talking about um the Republicans are tend to be a voting early but I'm over the past week or so I'm the I'm Democrats are starting to um get their ballots\nAnd Brian grim at what's Kansas look like with early voting\nIs falling out of those those national trends there's a there's there's so many of the counties across the state of reporting a\nRecord or near record turnout especially in some of the more populated areas they Hispanic and particularly when it comes to early voting you know a ... they're saying requests in in one of the most populated counties Johnson county by near Kansas City uh they've had request for more than forty thousand advanced voting ballots\nLet me stick with you how does early voting works in Kansas to people tend to find it easy accessible or there are a lot of hoops to jump through how to Kansas handle voting early\nWell it depends on the county I think it's it's a county by county the way they decide um obviously how many polling places are open where those polling places are uh you can also request a ballot to get in the mail so vote by mail isn't the common way to do it but if you would like to do that you can request steady and you can get it sent out um it's\nSo it's it's kind of reasonably are open to people who'd like to early votes I'm here in the county that I'm In and in Wichita, Kansas uh we've had early voting now for a week or starting today they've opened a few more locations for early voting so they're trying to make it\nI'm somewhat accessible to to to voters who'd like to take that option\nWe heard from some of you in Kansas Colorado in Michigan about early voting\nA critical mass tweeted I voted I Am in Colorado we have early voting and mail in ballots mailed to us early it's very easy to research a candidate amendment or proposition at leisure welcome pleading the ballot Michael would you respond to a critical mass in Colorado house has early voting work\nWill ah basically you get your ballot in the in the mail they mail it to you um you you got to do a lot of research in Colorado this year is a very full ballot and um you go through the subjects one by one it's great because\nUh you can really sit down with it and um do your homework um you know have a micro brew we love that here in Colorado and\nFill out that ballot and then um get it off in the mail or\nOr some other kind of relaxing recreational or some kind of a cup of tea my whatever you want to ...\n... um you know and so uh you know a lot of people um like the system in Colorado but not everyone um you know that ... ... ... world is full of procrastinators so um there are people who wait until the last minute and at this point\nI'm you know the secretary of state's office is saying if you haven't mailed in your ballot already um and now you've got to think about a delivering it by hand or just going in on election day and voting\nGlad you brought that up Michael that's probably something that everyone who lives in a state with early voting are male and voting should bear in mind that there is a certain cut off\nBy which your ballot has to be received November sixth tens and I I don't know how it is for your three states\nBut every state I've lived in election day is the day your ballot has to be in not just the day that your ballot has to be in a blue mailbox so that is exactly what you're in mind whatever state you're in your ballot has to be in an election officials hand\nOn election day not a postal carriers hand on election day glad to get some of your comments as to why you do or don't like voting early\nDetails may change through election day I Want my vote to be cast exactly as it should be since there are no do overs or take backs Rachel is in Fayetteville, Arkansas and Rachel emailed I Love the convenience of early voting I don't have to worry about long lines or work or travel on election day that would prevent my voice being hurt\n... tweeted no early voting for us in Michigan we can vote absentee if you're willing to lie about the reason why you're not able to vote in person on election day do you have to live in a vote early America\nFor all practical matters yeah so basically how it works in Michigan is if you want an absentee ballot you have to ah basically say that you are going to possibly be out of town let's say a and there are folks that go and say sure I'm going to be out of town\nAnd and lie there are also some other ways that you can get absentee ballots here in Michigan one is to be a over sixty years old or another is may be due to religious reasons or if you were in jail awaiting arraignment or trial but no it is\nWell known around the state that that folks do just say you know what I'm going to be out of town just stick to get an absentee ballot\n... what is being over sixty have to do with voting early uh possibly can make it easier right so let's say you're over sixty years old and maybe the idea is that there are long waits let's say for example in the city of Detroit it's gonna be cold and maybe the idea is that if you know you don't want to Seventy eight year old having to to\nSit outside let's say in a wheelchair for three four hours and wait to vote so that is one a one way that that you can get an absentee ballot\nWas being ... program director at Michigan Radio based in Ann Arbor Michael do you
