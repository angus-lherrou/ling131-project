him back with interest\nBut according to a recent investigation by the New York times Mr Trump was a millionaire by the age of eight thanks to his father's money\nOver the years Donald Trump received the equivalent of what would be more than four hundred million dollars today what are we now know about how the president got his wealth how does this report from the times affect his image as being a

A. M. U. dot org\nThat in common with regards to avoidance versus evasion of taxes Suzanne I Wonder how your reporting turned out in terms of how much money it appears that Trump's should have\nPaid in taxes but didn't do we have a sense of what the difference was between those two I mean it it it\nComes into the hundreds of millions of dollars range I mean they did pay some tax on um the schemes that that we found 'em in the IRS push push back\nOn some of the um some of the things that they submitted that didn't add up to them but ultimately we we felt that there was hundreds of millions of dollars that should have been paid to various toxic stories that weren't\nSusanna one of the aspects that comes up in the investigation has to do with valuations I mean when French Trump's children took over his empire the value that at a little over forty one million dollars all the buildings and all the businesses that they had and the various kind of larger Trump family organization\nWhen they sold the business ... business is all over the next decade they sold for sixteen times more\nThan the valuation can you give us a sense Suzanne of how valuations kind of what you say something is worth factors into all of this\nValuations became a a a theme quit quickly\nThe documents and we saw um sort of writ large when it when it benefited the trumps to put a low valuation on buildings when they didn't want to pay taxes on it they would do that and go to great lengths to to put values that just seemed\nRidiculous to us I'm low buildings worth you know a hundred million plus we get a valuations of you know five ten million\nBut on the same hand when they had a charitable donation um where they were a high valuation um would benefit them they went high so when it benefited them to go high they went high when it benefited them to go low we saw them go very low\nAnd of course if you inaccurately state the value of something to the IRS and that compromise is the amount of taxes the IRS may or may not be able to assess on that but Russ I Wonder if you could respond\nTo a tweet from Matthew who asks how common are the various tax Dodgers committed by the Trump family that also goes with another comment from Bryce several have you been asking whether this is kind of unique to the trumps Bryce run on our Facebook page I Would like to know how common to sort of tax dodging inheritance scheme is among the very rich ...\nAfter the Panama and paradise papers I just assume everyone rich is engaged in a lifelong struggle to subvert the law in order to get richer [laughter]\nThose are those are very good questions I there are some of these\nSome of the things that we're talking about here that we uncovered are um trust arrangements with the IRS endorsed sometimes after being pushed by a trust in a state attorney ...\nI'm a ... and that that that are widely used one of them the scratcher retained annuity trust which is the formal name for the mechanisms through which Donald Trump in his siblings took\nOwnership of their fathers empire in the nineties there's actually a commercial BDO the consulting firm runs a commercial where my daughter is trying to persuade her father to pass on the family winery through one of these trust 'em so there there are quite common\nThen there are other aspects of of things that we uncovered that are not common at all and are not endorsed they set up a corporation that serves no purpose of an pad invoices so Donald Trump and his siblings could start\nTaking some of their fathers profits that's not that's not anything that's endorsed by the IRS that's patently fraudulent on on its face um and so those kind of things are a gray area and they're not widely used so it's a it's a mix of things that we are talking about here and even in the cases where\nThey use a mechanisms like the trust that are well established and widely used by wealthy people that Trump's really push the limits the boundaries of those things in ways that a trust in the state attorneys that we consulted with an exam and these things said we're beyond the pale of of anything they'd seen in their careers\nBefore we get into more of the details I'd like to get to one more comment that was sent in a through voice mail from one of our listeners who is struggling with the idea that the trumps actually did anything wrong here's what Jeff left in our inbox\nIs Jeff St Clair falls Wisconsin many many successful people have received benefits and their father I see this is a story the second part is taxes avoided that is illegal method of reducing your tax bill\nThrough existing a statute taxes evaded now that would be interesting but so far as I hear is\nThat he use certain back in ... to avoid paying taxes\nAs we all do we all take a deduction standard or otherwise\nJeff thanks for sharing your thoughts with Suzanne what would you say to Jeff\n... at the top I mean these aren't standard deductions one at one of the um one of the things that we wrote about the rust you mentioned um with the company that was\n... to a lot of things to avoid taxes the trumps cross the line into illegality and one of the companies that we wrote about um this company called all county building supply\nIt was set up in Nineteen Ninety to its sole purpose was to defraud the ... the IRS to avoid taxes what it was it was a fairly simple mechanism and explain it and and I think reader or your listeners can kind of come to their ... to a conclusion on it\nSupport for NPR comes from this session and from American University's ... school of business committed to business being a force for meaningful change through graduate and undergraduate degrees mission driven curriculum and their hands on approach more Ed Koch God dot American dot edu\nAnd from ... committed to changing lives through Mac by building math achievements problem solving and critical thinking skills for thousands of students every day and

you'll find more details on one a across America on line at the one eight dot org will share some of your stories and tell you a bit more about across America this Monday\nOn one day\nBack now to our conversation with Suzanne Craig ... of the New York times still times to get in a few more of your questions and comments won a X. W. A. M. U. dot org before we get some more questions from our listeners Suzanne what about the IRS his role in all of this\nIs their job to catch the French trumps of the world doing what Fred Trump did how do they reflect on this\nIt it is their job and it's an interesting um you know a theme throughout\nThe story when we started to look at the different um schemes and I think one thing to remember about the IRS is um you know ... large um they're understaffed and and often a lot of stuff does get through 'em and I think that that sort of became apparent to us as we were sort of looking at the totality\nOf the uh the toxin out against\nThat we saw we do see I'm In some of the things that we found that the IRS did push back\nAnd you know from talking to the tax experts that we did\nUm you understand when when the IRS does something um there's back and forth I'm with you know and it would have been in this case the trumps but with the people were where were problems are found and eventually they come to a settlement and we we saw that additional tax in certain things was paid when they saw valuations\nThat they too agreed were low um and then the cases settled in and and things move on in the case of all county um we found no evidence that the IRS um my county as the company where they had they were ... voices in order to drain\nI'm Fred Trump's empire and in in cases like that we saw no evidence um that they were aware of what the trucks were doing there so it's sort of a um a mix of they caught some stuff and and they push back an extra tax was paid here and there and then other cases where we're not convinced they even knew what was going on\nNow that you report has come out Ross have we heard anything more from the IRS they plan to look into any of these allegations or is it is it too late or are there statute of limitations that are involved\nThere are statute of limitations on any potential criminal charges those have since told there is if there's fraud involved there is not a statute of limitations on civil penalties and and collection of back taxes we haven't heard anything from the IRS we wouldn't necessarily expect to they generally run\nVery silent and most people who work at the IRS are forbidden by law from talking about any individual taxpayer we have heard from New York City in New York state taxation authorities\nWho say based on uh the the reporting that we did they have opened investigations and and are looking for ways or if there's a reason to collect a back taxes with penalties\nBenjamin has a clarifying question about all county building supplying maintenance Benjamin tweeted did all county building have to pay taxes on the income it made how much of a difference is the percentage from the estate tax Suzanne which said her husband\nUm it's a good question the estate tax that they were looking at what\nAll county the partners in our county Donald Trump and his siblings I'm would've had to pay some tax would have been a business tax\nUm and it would have been substantially less than it's interesting at least in the case of the president we know because of the law says that he had incurred throughout his um his life that he may be potentially would have been able to shelter the income and not pay tax on it because in America when you have\nYou know lost his you're allowed to use those losses to offset future income so we just don't know exactly what each of them paid but it would have been substantially less than fifty five percent state tax if they were facing\nPart of the story also one of the other aspects of this the kinds of stands out is is how Fred Trump went to some pretty great lengths to bail out Donald Trump repeatedly if he ran into financial trouble\nRush there was one story that involves millions of dollars of poker chips at one of Donald Trump's failed casinos ... can you explain that to us so\nThat was uh in in Nineteen Ninety Donald Trump was really in his darkest moment he was facing a payment on a bond basically a money he own oath to lenders\nAnd he couldn't make it from the revenue to the casinos\nHis father's a lawyer showed up with checks totaling three and a half million dollars\nBought some gambling chips took the chips back out to the limousine and went back to queens with them and uh and never cash them so that was an eventually determined to be an illegal loan that Fred Trump or had given his son to help them make a payment get over that hump\nI Wonder if we all should be clear here I mean even if\nEven if officials in New York or the IRS had known all of these things about the Trump family Suzanne and had decided you know what let's go after them let's rain down to full force of the law on the trumps and make an example of them\nHow much did they have really done I mean what what's the worst case scenario that Fred Trump and the trumps might have faced at the time if they had been caught and fully prosecuted\nOr a big one is they would have had to pay taxes on all the uh on all the money but there could have been civil civil fines I'm there potentially could have been criminality I mean we talked about one area with all county where you know they use these padded receipts that they are\nThat they came up with to drain the empire they didn't pass those costs onto the tenants and I'm In doing so you know they inflated they they did it on and you know they did it with inflated receipts and they shouldn't have done it\nThat potentially could go into areas of wire fraud among other areas and not\nSo there's a range of things um and now you could be looking at not only having to um they're they're facing potential not only back taxes but penalties in interest on the money that tote so there's there's a lot of things that that I think various taxing authorities um another authorities could be looking at 'em\nWith us today have ended up in in federal prison for this\n...\nFederal or state prison it depends on who choose to prosecute the clearest a legal violation that could go into a crime was what she was describing that all county they were filing false documents with a state agency um and there would be slower level charges that would flow to that\nAnd yes those could be we've talked to several former prosecutors who said that looks like\nSomething that could have clearly been prosecuted as a state crime\nClearly some of our listeners so if you feel that this is not as big a story as some of our listeners feel it is Charlie wrote on our Facebook page sounds like President Trump is more brilliant than we ever thought and freedom and Jay tweeted so you're prove that Donald Trump success did start with a loan from his father\nAs she stated where exactly is the discrepancy none Sudan and they're\nInteresting comments that had one one thing that ...\nHas has stated that he started with a million dollar loan and he built it into a billion dollar empire he's now in the White House and he ran a campaign based on being sort of a self made\nBillionaire um there is no evidence necessarily that he is a billionaire but what we showed is that he inherited hundreds of millions of dollars over his lifetime from his father um and some of that was done through tax fraud\nPeople may or may not care about that but I think it's an important\nUm narrative of of somebody now in the White House about how he got his fortune in where the money came from it doesn't necessarily um say he didn't get revenue or money from other areas um you know there's been stories that some of it has come from Russia but what we showed is that much more of that came from his father\nUm over his lifetime and that he was willing to cross the line\nUm to shelter from having to pay taxes I think that's an important chapter and the president's life that\nThis is Ninety point three WPN land National Public radio Ninety One point five W T amount of Houma and Ninety One point seven W.

A. M. U. dot org lock before we get into the details of Sergei Skripal life I Wonder what you make of this story overall this kind of captured the world's attention why do you think that this got such international attention\n[noise] well ... it's an outrageous I acted in it or to use that kind of substance on the on the streets of a foreign city in order to settle a school I think it's something that a lot of people find extraordinary and you know\nIn in both senses of that was that it's an extraordinary provocative thing but some people I think to have trouble\nBelieving the British Government narrative in its details I have to say though you know as time has gone on and particularly things we've seen in the last month now off\nWith the identification of two suspects then rushing Janice and experts working to find out the real identities of those people who came to the u._k. on season ends and then to link them so they Smith tree intelligence service the geo you you know it'll do seem to be pointing pretty clearly in that direction\nLet's talk more about the G are you what exactly is it and what is it do\nWell at the Russian initials stand for main intelligence directorate and it's the it's a direct threats all\nThe Russian general stuff the ...\nOr the ... that I think some plans for the Russian ministry and this is the same in a lot of countries that historically the general stuff will have its own intelligence department and that's been the case in changing one or two that bureaucratic details but more or less since the Russians civil war in the early twentieth century\nThat the a Soviet than Russian general stuff has had this organization\nAnd ate embraces a whole a sway the capabilities and the idea of a good kid reconnaissance so intelligence as practiced by the geo use a very broad concept\nAnd that can be two guys creeping forward on their bellies in eastern Ukraine trying to see if they can ... the Ukrainian full says and basically behaving as soldiers on the battlefield\nAnd it can be a guy in the ... tell policy in Madrid in Nineteen Ninety six I eat a ... who was serving that Under Cover\nOf being a scientific and technical for sex tree at the embassy and it can also embrace things like cyber warfare and spy satellites so it's an organization that has many thousands of people working for it it also has special operations forces\nAre ... and a very broad capabilities\nHow'd Sergei Skripal joined the G argue\nWell joining the GI you particularly ah back in the Soviet period when he got involved or he was involved today and in Nineteen Seventy nine\nIt was a pretty mysterious thing you weren't supposed to really know about it you couldn't supply it was them who approach you and he'd been involved he was in the ... and he was a in a reconnaissance unit that did some pretty daring things like they went into China or on the cover and\nYou know and there are other missions as well that are described in my book\nAnd I think this protein to the attention of the G R U as being the kind of steely guy who who had the right stuff and they invited him you you got into an exam and he goes through that said later that year he style to to the what's cool limited treated from Africa ketamine which is effectively bad spy school in Moscow\nWet you spent four years are doing everything from you know the real um spy novel trade crossed off of agent meats and counter surveillance a ... means of communications firm ... thoughts to secret writing to\nYou know encrypted email all that stuff or through to intelligence analysis and the rest of it so it's uh\nAnd having done all that he got ... uh in not Stacy full to move to\nA on his first job working on the diplomatic cover and that's what a generally speaking a lot of these gee all you people who are deployed on strategic intelligence gathering that's what they do they assume a civilian personnel let's say\nOr maybe ... maybe in the embassy maybe in a trade mission Iran they carry on with that tree intelligence ... says all of these people are you mentioned in your introduction expelled from the U.S\nAre following the soles free incident were gee all you people working in in Russian organizations in Washington and New York\nDescribes Sergei Skripal and his day what did he look like how did he come across\nWell he's pretty he's a well built guy I mean he's he's a man who uh was a Russian Army a boxing championship level a boat so\nHe he was in the ... where they they put quite a premium on physical strength or rural coverage you know throwing yourself out airplane up nights into an ... kind of stuff\nA ... and so you know he's a tough guy he's he's broad um of course now in his mid sixties or he doesn't have quite the same physical condition you did back when he was working with a jail you\nBut he's still a fairly um striking physical presence he's got a very dry sense of humor I'm a deadpan and you know tends to make light of the sort of negative things in life so when we were talking\nAbout his experiences under interrogation in the fall to the prison in Moscow well then in the labor camp he was sent to\nYou know he would struggle loss of Adolf and say well I got the stakes are arranged for that to happen and you know this made me more comfortable and and you know he asked us thing yeah I think he would have said

what's the condition of the others\nMark [noise] um well ah\nSo those people on Nick ... who was a police officer who went to this ... house on the day of the poisoning he is a much better but still not ready to return to work [noise]\nUh of course a Charlie ... who was one of those\nWho are then found the bustle\nOr in the summer in June and uh he's ... he's the person who died Charlie Rose the lightning Bailey is to have had a very small very small dies so he was a very on well for a week or two but he also has made a recovery of salts\nAnd then of course you get to you to a script pile and ... and uh\nShe was discharged from hospital a several weeks before he was once again I think one can infer from that but to how to a lesser dosage and ah so I suppose you could say the most seriously affected person who survived will ... himself\nUm uh when I interviewed the medical stuff their hospital you ... you had a clip earlier of ah don't just even juice\nThey was saying well ah we think that will be some side effects bought it's very hard for us to predict what may also I think one would still say that ... themselves within the presidents of come with essence that's my understanding that they're all some long term effects but of course\nYou know if people I'm not a keen to discuss this\n... medical confidentiality and ah because I think there is still quote on nuns\nWith regard to Yulia ... daughter ... emailed\nIt's often assumed in the media that his daughter was an accidental casualty however her fiance was a gi argue employee whose mother was also a high level G R U operative\nWhen she tried to reach her fiance from the hospital he and his mother disappear also interesting and it goes on to write also interesting that the two alleged hit men flew on the same flight as the daughter to London\nConsidering that scruples wife and son died earlier somewhat suddenly it\nSeems that the poisoning when the daughter was visiting was not an accident the big question in my mind is this an operation ordered by some unhappy G R U operatives or a higher level order\nMark I'm well I I'll just pick colds and one little bits of Anna's a description that\nThe the two people are two suspects or did not flying on the same plane as you describe how they arrived the previous day at a different London apple got wake a she arrived then on the science data sowed amounts at Heathrow\nA on a plane for mostly but anyway um\nLet's just talk about ah that's just a detail um look there is definitely something ... about a half\nA rival in the u._k. and the timing of the attack\nI'm ... and right from the outset people I was speaking to who were involved in in trying to work out what has happened investigated a believed that the timing was critical\nNow we know even more so that the suspects are named as ... had been in the u._k. on exactly the same period the last few days of February\n... and the first couple of days in March during the previous year twenty six team or a big problem twenty Seventeen and then another man\nWho's been isolated or identified by Russian newspapers probably a pseudonym so ... had been in the u._k. at the same time as ... in twenty Seventeen and at the same time late February early March twenty sixteen\nNow this raises questions a bounce or would they target ... for some time whether they using the fact that she lived in Russia and therefore they could hack a email account and that's been ... by the u._k. government that they were hacking it from twenty third genome woods and indeed him my ball fine [noise]\nUm she seems to have come back to be with her daddy Shia around that time because his brother Sasha how to use the stay on the first of march [noise]\nSo that's the ... uh by a lake twenty Seventeen I'm fortunate they tragically a Sasha by the way had died but it's still supposed that she had come and twenty Eighteen to be with her dad at that time because it would be a difficult time because it was a time they were normally together as a family\nSo that the that it's always been um a a a line of inquiry for the investigators that the\nTiming of the attack was critically linked to use his arrival that are hacking her data by females and stuff which said sure I'll come up from the ... would help them to locate Sergei make sure he was on a business trip or in some other way absent [noise]\nAnd uh that this would be a good time to do it now and I also mentioned a boyfriend that um you had ... and he is a bit of a cab yet he is filled by some to have had connections with a one of the Russian intelligence agency thought\nHe was not on the scene for example back in twenty six\nA figure of using the names for dose of traveled to the u._k. he was not on the scene back in ... when we know according to the u._k. government that her email account was hacked and he hadn't been on the scene for much more than a year so\nYou know we don't know and no fan of he's not here to defend himself against any allegations that he had played some ... um that's we know that after the attack um [noise]\nUh well nearly among solved there was a court hearing to do with medical procedures that to happen and it was stage in ... that he had not been in touch with the hospital for example to find out how she was\nSo the idea that he kind of a vanished from the scene seems to have some substance or you've had access to the Internet since a fairly early on in her recovery we don't know whether she's reached out to him or whether indeed they often ... by\nA social media or messaging or or email or whatever or buts we have to assume that they no longer income times\nTo get to a few more of your comments and questions from our urban another market tweeted you got that out quick if it's half as good as your previous books it will be a pleasure and an education to read [noise]\nCO asked listening to this broadcast I was wondering if we knew why it was that he decided to defect to at my six mark you kind of suggested that he had kind of had enough that he had kind of lost faith\nAs it were in the G are you do have a sense of whether there was a last straw for ...\nUm yeah that's a good question um\nThe way he describes it and it was a gradual process so when he was in middle to which is Nineteen eighty four to eight to nine he says he was walking home he was recruiting souls his he was really playing the game\nBut he also says that he began to have downs\nA and began to question the audio logical conditioning he'd been given you know to view members of the CIA or am I say so west admitted tree as enemies interview them in what the um you know Soviet communists cold cold or through a prism of cloth hatred\nSay he's don't seem to have a certain doubts in that regard [noise]\nUh then obviously pretty quickly off to he'd go back ... events happened uh the button will fail and then of course the Soviet system began to a ...\nAnd enough to present the comedian and

A. M. U. dot org\nOut and we're going to see a before we move on to our next story I Wonder if you could respond to that tweet from Michael that reads this just further reinforces that people solely look for media that confirms their already set beliefs how do we break out of this than show people that does you disagree with are still human Adam\nBoy uh I don't know [laughter] I think uh the technologically enabled a fracturing of media is a really really significant factor in the status of our public life right now\nOn the other hand I'm not sure that it's the causal agent um it might be a corollary uh\nI think that um you know we can talk all day about the norms is civil discourse breaking down but a nice that's very real trend are actual substantive policy disagreements between Americans differences in fundamental values\nThat are really really wide and work perhaps paper over for a lot of years by the media mano culture and now we're able to see them for what they are I Am personally kind of amazed at that and more political violence doesn't happen in the United states given the depths of these differences um\nI don't think it's just in how we talk and who we're talking to and who were listening to I think a lot of what we're experiencing hears about fundamental differences in what we believe to be important in life and what we want government to do\n... we had fundamental differences forever and what we believe in but I think\nThis increase in rhetoric I think I'm demonizing people making people your enemy making and then you just the enemy of the people has made a difference and I think that people don't generally talk to each other anymore there's not enough people that go up I mean I because of because of my report I talked to everybody but I Will\nAnd they are in their little bubble\nAnd Eugene I think it's important to note that and I don't know if you encounter this\nWorking for the Washington Post but certainly I Do on a program that's on NPR is that the people who comments on our show or not just our fans are critics\nListened to I mean I understand the idea about the division but if you hate NPR so much how do you know what we sat on one aid to criticize us if you ate the Washington Post so much how do you know what was printed there to criticize\nYeah and quite frankly I think that that a behavior is exemplified most\nFrom the president himself who really hate CNN but seems to watch a lot of it um and and I I'm blown away by how many people are are engaging nuts who don't want us to do what\nIt is that we're doing and and it's unfortunate because I think we are a need criticism or the media needs to be criticized so we need to be held accountable but we need to be criticized well so that we can serve the public\nBetter we're going to keep moving from the story again just a quick caution as you listen to the coverage of this story over the weekend ... please just remember that the stories moving really really fast we're going to try really hard not to jump to any conclusions\nAbout what has happened there already been some details of the story that have had to been clarified a walk back so that's common in a fast moving breaking story like this\nKeeping your on your NPR member station for the latest and an eye on NPR dot org\nA few more of your comments before we move on\nMatt emailed if Trump is responsible for the bombs are Democrats responsible for the shooter at the Republicans baseball team practice both of these statements are untrue bleed mass referring to the the congressional baseball game which Republican Congressman Steve ... piece of Louisiana was injured\nPhilip emailed the suspicious packages may have originated in Florida but the perpetrator or perpetrators tours are not necessarily based there the Unabomber lived in Montana but traveled to Utah and the bay area to physically male his devices in order to deceive law enforcement\nAll right let's keep moving on with some other stories and if the story continues to move in the next few minutes we'll certainly let you know but let's talk a little bit more about politics particularly with President Trump's he was at a rally this week in Houston and he made headlines for a different set of remarks listen\nThat wants to do well frankly not care about our country so much [noise] you know what we can I make sure it's\nAnd really we're not supposed to use that word you know what I Am I'm a nationalist so [noise]\nDo you think Scott I Wonder if we can get to a clear definition of this term sheer what exactly is a nationalist I mean there's this ... is it typically consider to be what President Trump says it is\nAnd neither is global if I'm a according to President Trump to to be charitable or a nationally if it's just someone who puts America First um\nBut the reality is anyone with a it's a historical context of nationalism knows that it is a worldview embraced on other rising uh that has led to um you know genocide and violence and separating people not like yourself a\nFrom a basis that would give them rights that uh\nWe we deem a central and important to human beings um and so a Trump you know early in his campaign I'm really distance himself from ... the term national if when we saw a Steve Bannon associated with it primarily because uh the ... the form of nationalism back with most uh\nBye community what that of white nationalism which we've seen um you know sweep Europe and I even hate groups in the states um and so it's it's been it's been deemed by most people to be problematic to see Trump embrace it hum while misrepresenting it put him on the receiving end up significant criticism\nAdam reduce the I'd love you to chime in on this I Know that you are a stickler and rightly so for precision in language and I wonder what your take is on the use of the word nationalist versus say patriots\nParticularly because words like nationalist often heard in in phrases like white nationalism global list has connotations of being anti Semitic give us parse the words parts of the language for us here\nI mean I think Eugene has already done a pretty good job of that I'm a I'm a little bit mystified by this whole story hum the ... the idea that for President Trump to say hey I'm a nationalist is remarkable is kind of nuts to me um\nAmerica First his secondary campaign slogan is a perfect crystal ... of nationalism it's\nFor him to put a label on it is I think totally and consequential it would be like if President Trump got in front of a group of people and said hey my hair is kind of weird\nWill die we all know that um I suppose it's sort of remarkable that you said it but you know it's it's it's a truth that's right in front of us\nI think are a lot of why the comment has gotten the attention is that yes I'm as Eugene said um nationalism has a really really bad track record in the twentieth century of leading the genocide\nAnd a World War Z I'm On the other hand I don't I think that some people have been a rounding nationalist up to white nationalist and that's a pretty big trip\nNow you could make a very cogent argument that President Trump is functionally a white nationalist in terms of his rhetoric in terms of his policies that so that's an arguable point um but he didn't say I'm a white nationalist he said I'm a nationalist and he is manifestly so I don't get why this is a big deal\nGetting on a monthly basis whatever works for you any amount and we are grateful for every every single amount and and donation entertaining

community there's this ban on trans people serving in the military that's working its way through the courts\nOf reality start ... gender published an opinion piece this week in response to this proposed changing the definition of sex by age or just in the Washington Post she wrote quote\nThe reality is that the trans community is being relentlessly attacked by this president's the leader of our nation has shown no regard for an already marginalized and struggling community he has ignored our humanity use insulted our dignity this is politics at its worst unquote\nNow usually we interviewed Caitlyn Jenner on this program some months ago and she said that she knows that a lot of conservatives are not very trans friendly but she appreciates it leads to being in the room and being able to talk to them about trends issues\nI also had to push back on her a little bit 'cause she\nDo not want her there what do you make of her comment I mean she can't be surprised by the president's actions on this she just kept you\nKnow it's been really fascinating she uh is arguably one of the most visible transgender people in America and um has actually been criticized significantly by\nThe transgender rights community because\nUh she does not seem to be deeply informed about the political history that the community has been a fighting for the idea that she likes to be at the table almost implies that no one has tried to be at the table before her\nUm and and that the administration has been criticized by the broader community perhaps\nA for not a being a a boat advocate of the transgender\nA community and and gender has been a critique for parents that have just noticed that\nOne of the things I most fascinated by a I think this story right here reveals how\nPeople in different ah identity groups can listen to the same candidate and walk away with different things in general and wrote in that Washington Post op ed\nSeat back Trump because she heard him\nInclude algae beats the communities and has a speech at the Republican National convention and she saw people applaud and so she thought he would in bands algae beats he writes\nSocial conservatives who voted for Trump because they believe he would reverse algae beats he writes a that perhaps went farther than they would have liked them to go and the Obama administration so it's just one of those amazing moments about how different Americans here different things\nWhen they get to a few of your comments before we keep moving Kurtz emailed\nWhen was the meaning of gender changed to reflect the psychological state rather than a physical identity gender has always been a polite and more specific sending him for sex and is routinely used as such on birth certificates it seems that we're talking about here is more accurately described as sexual identity rather than gender itself\nCook I'll take this one on actually that's not correct your sexual identity has to do with attraction gender has to do with identity sexuality has to do with who you see yourself with\nGender has to do with who you see yourself\nAs one more story related to the ... community today the remains of Matthew Shepard are settled in their final resting place at the Washington National cathedral\nShepherd was brutally murdered Twenty years ago in the October of Nineteen Ninety eight by men

hundreds to the ... for a musical event that included several of shepherds favorite songs including imagined by John Lennon\nLet's get to some more of your comments including about the refugee care of and and to be clear I think I misspoke earlier and said that the caravan of a possibility to care man's real the troop plan is real it is possible that the care of and might not get to the border by may have misspoke when I brought that up\nBryan emailed is this column of potential immigrants really such a big deal it's not like they're trying to sneak in they're coming up to knock on our door to ask for help sounds like they're following our rules\nAnd tweeted can we please start calling the care of and what it is a group of refugees fleeing communities destroyed by a two thousand nine military coup with which the U.S had a hand\nAlso on right now is lots of your commenting on this idea of nationalism let me read a few of your comments there irrepressible use ... to the coast from George Orwell nationalism is hunger for power tempered by self deception\nDaniel tweeted why did Trump used the word nationalist instead of saying he was an American and Matthew tweeted or match tweeted equating nationalism\nRounding socialism up to ... both sides are talking past each other more and more and demonizing their political opponents\nLet's talk about economic policy the president made a statement to reporters this week that he will propose new ten percent tax cuts for middle class the president was somewhat vague in his timing for this to happen but said that quote will do the vote after the election\nKathy Lohr I'd love to get your sense of what this means whether this was just something to say during the midterms whether it seems that President really has a plan to continue making more tax cuts\nAnd this and I hate to say this but I don't think he has a point [laughter] I think that it is I'm playing to his base maybe trying to expand his base because the original tax cut that he promised I don't think it helped middle class people as was promised\nThe first time so maybe this is an effort to do so it's an effort to get ... voters out for this election and I\nAsked them how do you see it\nI I don't think that we should even be talking about it on a news program until there's something more substantive for us to talk about an actual policy there's of everything about this is just so an serious I'm right now\nAnd I think that if anything that we are playing into the president's a political a gambit by even acknowledging the existence of a plan that isn't even a plan I mean to to to bring it back to what we were just discussing with the migrant caravan\nUm uh making its way through Central America this is another place where I think the way that we are talking about it is inherently a complicit in\nUm uh in reinforcing really unrealistic and politically craven view of what's happening I'm four thousand people marching from uh the northern triangle countries' interests uh bought 'em all and I'll Salvador um through Mexico hoping some of them hoping to reach the United states\nThis does not represent any kind of significant uptick in the number of people seeking refuge from these increasingly violent countries they just happened to be in a big group it's more a reflection of a change in strategy among people trying to make that journey whereas previously they had tried to do it\nOr in small groups to try to uh not be noticed um that made them vulnerable to all kinds of hazards along the way and so there's a new strategy to try to go in ... openly in one big group that's all that's going on here border patrol apprehended\nUm about a hundred and fifty thousand people from the northern triangle countries and twenty

S.\nSeven thousand people traveling or set number fluctuates course this group of migrants has become the target of President Trump and other Republicans during the upcoming mid terms car and what do we know about the folks who are in this caravan who are they worded they come from and and what made them start heading for the U.S for\nWell for the most part they seemed to be a migrants that started off in Central America that have been moving up through Mexico that are heading to the U.S border and this is that something has been organized to kind of make the point of the plight of the migrants that um\nI have been trying to travels a very very long way to get to the U.S border and are seeking to come to the United states for\nEither reasons of at economic attraction or because they are fleeing some sort of threat\nUm and they're just sort of thing that happens every day and less organized fashion it's become though a weapon after the ... for for Trump to use in advance in the mid term elections they look at all these people coming towards our border there might be middle Easterners and they're you know how do we know that they aren't bad people in that group but just just to quote his terminology used\nUm and this is kind of a poking at\nThe that that the existing a tension that exists in this country between people who are sympathetic toward that people who wants to come to the United states for various reasons of personal safety and economic instability and everything else\nAnd those people who think a scary outsiders don't let them in this place real well as Trump's base Trump is trying to whip up his base in advance of the mid term elections because they're public ends need to hold on for dear life to make sure they keep\nThat majorities in both houses of Congress because house especially it seems like it's quite likely to flip to Democrats and that will be at the problematic for Trump in the last two years of his first term so it is um classic\nHad it's a very emotional issue for people on both sides of this issue and this is a classic uh politicking for how it's being portrayed right now I'm In ... on television on there how is is we're what two weeks out\nLoud you mix away from the point at which um everybody's going to cast their ballots healing how they feel about you know the issues that affect the country and how the president's grappling with them\nBefore we continue talking about the care of and I'm Sorry I forgot to clarify something earlier and what we were discussing Michael Goldfarb raise the point\nAbout treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and we clarified that he did not attend the conference this so called doubles in the desert that is true but just to be clear the treasury secretary did meet with Saudis crown prince Mohammed bin ... on Monday in Riyadh he did not attend the conference\nBut she and the crown prince did meet one on one earlier this week\nOn Monday just by way of clarification\nRavi president troops that President Trump sent troops to the U.S Mexico border during the spring defense secretary James Mattis is authorized to point eight hundred more troops\nTo the southern border give us a sense of what role these troops might be expected to play there and how that might factor into this whole saga regarding the ...\nWell it it really is as car ruined was pointing out apply of thoughts to play into the political debate here in the United states about these migrants making their way to to the United states and the whole notion of securing the border is also is is a strange one on this because\nI mean if you look at who these migrants are and what they're escaping from they are tired they're hungry they're escaping countries like Honduras and El Salvador Guatemala where they are escaping violence they are extremely poor the V. as they are walking up a north towards the United states\nOf their agenda and their hopes and dreams quite clearly is to try and seek asylum in the United states why because they think that they could have better lives in the United states\nIn really there is no great testament to American soft power that you have you know essentially all around the world people who want to vote with their feet and come to the the the United states and settle a and have children and have better lives offensively and and so the troops are part of this larger\nA Trump and and and I guess Republican rhetoric\nThat play into the the idea that some migrants who are coming are coming I'm a you know as sources of great danger when in fact you know if you look at the pictures of who they are and how they're coming in they or anything but\nAnd I also do want to point out uh current mentioned that President Trump or as you did to the ... a A R mentioned\nThat uh these migrants are Middle Eastern well for one there's actually no evidence that points to the fact that they could be Middle Eastern but perhaps more importantly he was using um Middle Eastern as a slower of sorts which which\nAre over there we should we should just clarify vice president Mike Pence said that there it's possible that mixed in with these thousands of migrants who were from Central America there may be a few dozen who were Middle Eastern and might have you know ... ferry is aims for the country\nAnd that's exactly right thank you for the car for vacation there but the the point I was getting too was that the use of the of of of Middle East and as the um it is extremely dangerous because it it ... van tries to create the impression that being Middle East and\nI'm means you're dangerous so that you're a terrorist and and and that too is is is a dangerous loaded way of looking at a as Carlin was pointing out again a movement that happens very often that you know ... ... migrants from from those parts of the world often try to make their way to the United states\nAnd the reason why this has become a bigger thing right now numbering in the thousands is because it has been politicized here in the United states\nMichael Goldfarb I Wonder if we should be careful with language we use to describe this large group of people a number of you have comments to us about that with these this terminology including the use of the word and migrants\nMaria writes I Am Honduran I was born and raised in Honduras I came to the U.S to study and now I live and work here this quote unquote caravan is a cry for help cry of desperation from my people who will risk their lives to escape the extreme poverty and violence that I Know Israel\nThey are indeed refugees seeking refuge please don't blame them blamed the corruption that has run a Honduran government\nAnd dug into Anthony tweet they are not migrants they are asylum seekers words matter now Michael Merriam Webster is might go to in terms of the English language\nMiriam Webster defines a migrant as one who migrate such as a person who moves regularly in order to find work especially in harvesting crops a refugee is one that fleas\nEspecially a person who flees to a foreign country or power to escape danger or persecution what do you make of the words that we're using to describe this\nYou know John it was as you've been talking about this I suddenly had Woody Guthrie's old song\nAbout about a group of migrants being sent back to Mexico in the Nineteen thirties and their plane

P. in your store and we'll share some of your stories\nBack now to our discussion with current emerging of the Washington Post Ravi Agarwal of foreign policy magazine and Michael Goldfarb with the first rough draft of history the host and creator of that podcast wrote me let me come to you wonder what you think of the overall message\nOf Tim Cook speech the c._e._o. of apple we heard him refer to the data industrial complex which has been a phrase it's been quoted fairly often in the days since he spoke kind of\nHarkening back to that idea of the military industrial complex with the prison industrial complex ... what did you make of of cooks remarks\nI thought these were really strong words and coming from a taxi or perhaps the strongest we've seen so far now ... what he didn't say in that speech was he didn't mention Google he didn't mention Facebook\nAnd that's bad because I mean well he doesn't want to go that far but but also because apple is a business is quite different from Google and Facebook apple doesn't it's not in the the ah the ad tracking business the way Facebook and Google both are\nBut I think what all of these companies know collectively is that whether they like it or not regulation of some ... some farm is is on its way it's coming and so at some level of the other they have all endorsed uh GDP are which is Europe's data protection bell\nAnd I think they're beginning to imagine that some version of that will at some stage be implemented in the United states and the only question that is is what kind of language will be in that what it within tail\nAnd and and and I think what cook has tried to do in the speech again very strong words in his visit to Europe is to try and come out ahead of it knowing that this is going to happen anyway to try and appear to be one of the uh the tech support as a of a potential data privacy laws in the United\nStates we should be clear also GDP are as the general data protection regulation it's just a new area law that protects the privacy the data privacy of individuals within the EU or even the export of their personal data outside the you if you've noticed in the last few months\nThat a lot of the Web sites you go to have had these pop up saying hey we use cookies on this website we may be tracked your information click here to accept\nThat was those websites complying with GDP are that's why they all had to begin putting those pop ups on those sites another story about privacy that caught our attention the British newspaper the telegraph\nPublished an investigation on Tuesday into a wealthy businessman who was accused by multiple employees of racist and sexist mistreatment the story had the headline the British me to scandal which cannot be revealed\nThat's because the accused was granted an injunction against the newspaper to prevent it from publishing his name\nBut then this happened at Britain's house of lords\nUs feel it's more juicy under parliamentary privileged to name for green as the individual in question given that the media have been subject to an injunction preventing publication of the full details of a story which is clearly in the public interest\nThat was the voice of lord Hain or Baron the pain of nice in the British house of lords using British parliamentary privilege to name the billionaire at the center of this story Michael Goldfarb what's behind this what makes this\nSuch a big deal it sounds like it's kind of an example a clear example of a very significant differences between free speech laws in the u._k. and in the U.S\nWell that's certainly part of it just for you in in this particular case I'm having a parliamentary privileges is pretty unique tool you can say things in parliament that you cannot say outside and and not suffer\nHer hand was a working he'd been approached by some of the women who had spoken to the Daily Telegraph there's this guy of Phillip Green is you know a fairly typical contemporary entrepreneur yet he was a night to bite Tony Blair for services to retail is set up\nA series of of um clothing shops over over the decades and made himself very very wealthy indeed [noise] and um apparently was just the kind of ball she would expect it was a bully and he was\nHe sexually harassed people and\nLike Harvey Weinstein when when he settled up there were no disclosure clauses inserted into the settlements\nAnd the difference of course is that in the U.S [noise] New York times in the New Yorker can report that Harvey Weinstein is this and that and you know the details who can't get because of these non disclosure agreement so at least we know his name and here in Britain it's something else\nYou know and moving oh go ahead Michael go ahead no no because I could go on about this guy forever and I ... [laughter] that's what they're doing it on\nI was just gonna say it's an interesting case really because of the way that the British laws are structured to say to have that that this this question of like which is the greater good here right because this is a\n... that the me too movement it's already been a question of can you know the the little guy or the little girl in this instance you know stand up against a big powerful wealthy usually male and in player who's pulling things at ... ... ... doing things that they shouldn't be doing but because of power and\nI'm In Flint is able to get away with that it it kind of the perfect and ... and ... it's kind of the perfect at ... I guess to see what is\nWhat society kind of value is protecting or is it the reputation of the kids in this way where it ended as can be applied newspapers that were never a party to them or is it getting this out in the public space and said he was like an extra level in the u._k.\nAnd determining you know how much of a national or international conversation I guess at this point all of this is going to be in terms of does one wrong done effect you know an entire society and and how should be sorted out\nRight now here in the U.S we are understandably focused on the mid term elections will Brazilians are focused on a presidential election they have to the polls on Sunday to choose between two radically different candidates in this second round of voting\nFernando ... on the left ... is on the right in ... lead in most polls many expect him to win the election joining us now from Sao paolo is Sarah ... who is Brazil correspondent for the economist Sara welcome to want to\nThank for having me\nRemind us about ... so now he's been pretty controversial explain to us why\nHas been in Congress night for a couple of decades now and I agree with the current owner or for\nAny particular letter I say that are more for ... at an earlier comment and a woman and a minority or in and\nGo and buy them when they're very provocative recognize that a lot of people who come by its own otherwise when I when I was ... and our ... our acreage so\nI'm kind of like all over the place up as an outsider or you're on like around the earth and regarding our kind of a ... and a country back on TALK\nShows that why he is so popular I mean you know the Brazil has had a number of issues that kind of a cascading issues with corruption over the years is it just kind of she's outsider status has a clips any social misgivings or maybe about him\nUm I don't know what I'm Ramon ... on and the call but I don't even look at it I think that anyone can watch it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Nashville", "day": "26"}
