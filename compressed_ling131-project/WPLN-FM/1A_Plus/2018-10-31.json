Michael glad to have you with us\nHi Joshua and joining us from Kate M. U. W. public radio in Wichita, Kansas is reporter Brian grim it Brian ... glad to have you with us a habit of beer too by the way our other three partner stations for one a across America or W. B. H M public radio in Birmingham, Alabama\nMinnesota Public radio and Houston Public media and we look forward to hearing more from them in the weeks and months to come but let me start with the three of you in Michigan Colorado in Kansas\nWith regards to early voting in your state particularly accounting for absentee ballots mail in ballots and so forth so a court in Michigan let me start with you what's early voting looked like in Michigan\nRight so we actually are seeing an increase over last mid term elections I Want to kind of do apples to apples instead of apples to oranges if I had the ... turnout is higher here in Michigan as it is across the country during the presidential election so if we are comparing to twenty fourteen\nTwenty fourteen we add six hundred and eighty nine thousand requests for absentee ballot we are now almost at one point one million as of October twenty seconds like sixty percent increase here in this day\nMichael do you want to what about in Colorado what's early voting look like they're\nWell it's too early to tell us so far but a big a flood of ballots have already come in about six hundred and Nineteen thousand of them\nAnd I'm more expected this morning a we have male voting here and people can register all the way up until election day on election day and um it's a it's it's too early to tell a but there is a strong turnout so far\nUm and it mirrors or what your guest earlier was talking about um the Republicans are tend to be a voting early but I'm over the past week or so I'm the I'm Democrats are starting to um get their ballots in\nAnd Brian grim it what's Kansas look like with early voting\nIs falling out of those those national trends there's a there's there's so many of the counties across the state of reporting a record or near record turnout especially in some of the more populated areas they are Hispanic and particularly when it comes to early voting you know\nA ... they're saying requests in in one of the most populated counties Johnson county near Kansas City uh they've had requests for more than forty thousand advanced voting ballots\nLet me stick with you how does early voting work in Kansas to people tend to find it easy accessible or there are a lot of hoops to jump through out of Kansas handle voting early\nWell it depends on the county I think it's it's a county by county is a way they decide um\nObviously how many polling places are open where those polling places are uh you can also request a ballot to get in the ... vote by mail isn't the common way to do it but if you would like to do that you can request and you can get it sent out\nUm it's so it's it's kind of reasonably are open to people who'd like to early votes I'm here in the county that I'm In and in Wichita, Kansas uh we've had early voting now for a week or starting today they've opened a few more locations for early voting so they're trying to make it\nWeb streaming is made possible by states and harvest than a full service for managing sophisticated transactions challenging litigation and complex regulatory matters on a daily basis across Tennessee and beyond learn more at ... dot com easy to research\nA candidate amendment or proposition at leisure welcome pleading the ballot Michael would you respond to a critical mass in Colorado house has early voting work\nWill ah basically you get your ballot in the in the mail they mail it to you um you so you got to do a lot of research in Colorado this year is a very full ballot and um you go through the subjects one by one it's great because\nUh you can really sit down with it and um do your homework um you know have a micro grew we love that here to Colorado and\nFill out that ballot and then um get it off in the mail or\nOr some other kind of relaxing recreational or limit on a cup of tea my whatever you want to Broadway\n... um you know and so uh you know a lot of people I'm like this system in Colorado but not everyone um you know that ... ... ... world is full of procrastinators so um there are people who wait until the last minute and at this point\nI'm you know the secretary of state's office is saying if you haven't mailed in your ballot already um now you got to think about a delivering it by hand or just going in on election day in voting\nI'm Glad you brought that up Michael that's probably something that everyone who lives in a state with early voting are male and voting should bear in mind that there is a certain cut off\nBy which your ballot has to be received November six times and I I don't know how it is for your three states\nBut every state I've lived in election day is the day your ballot has to be in not just the day that your ballot has to be in a blue mailbox so that is an object to remind whatever state you're in your ballot has to be in an election officials hand\nOn election day and not a postal carriers hands on election day got to get some of your comments as to why you do or don't like voting early\nMitch tweeted I don't vote early details may change through election day I Want my vote to be cast exactly as it should be since there are no do overs or take backs\nRachel is in Fayetteville, Arkansas and Rachel emailed I Love the convenience of early voting I don't have to worry about long lines or work or travel on election day that would prevent my voice being hurt\n... tweeted no early voting for us in Michigan we can vote absentee if you're willing to lie about the reason why you're not able to vote in person on election day ... do you have to live in a vote early and\nMichigan for all practical matters yeah so basically how it works in Michigan is if you want an absentee ballot you have to basically say that you are going to possibly be out of town let's say a and there are folks that go and say should be out of town\nAnd and lie at their office in other ways that you can get absentee ballots here in Michigan one is to be a over sixty years old and now there is a may be due to religious reasons or if you were in jail awaiting arraignment or trial but no it is\nWell known around the state that that folks do just say you know what I'm going to be out of town just take to get an absentee ballot\n... what is being over sixty have to do with voting early uh possibly can make it easier right so let's say you're over sixty years old and maybe the idea is that there are long waits let's say for example in the city of Detroit it's going to be cold and maybe the idea is that if you know you don't want to Seventy eight year old having to sit\nOutside let's say in a wheelchair for three four hours and wait to vote so that is one a one way that that you can get\nClark program director at Michigan Radio based in Ann Arbor Michael do you want to an

public radio in Wichita, Kansas today we're introducing won a across America\nThe country that don't tend to play an outsized role in national elections before them come come back to ... let me get to a few more of your comments Linda tweeted I voted in Hamilton County Ohio over a week ago no lines was fast and easy\nCounty is in Illinois and county wrote on our Facebook page I'm choosing to vote on election day because I bring my children and want them to see and feel the import of this rights\nAnd Melissa tweeted I loved to vote in person I enjoy seeing all of the people getting out to the polls and making their voices heard\nThere's a way I Love you to react to a message that one of our listeners since we're at one a vox pop from Michigan and told us three reasons that he's voting this year and all of his reasons for voting after you do with voting\nTrip from Michigan where all three branches of government or a Republican controlled and have been for a number of years\nThe main driver of my voting this year or two constitutional amendments that tried to rectify the Republican attempt to suppress or control election participation\nProposal and to put redistricting in the hands of a nonpartisan commission the other makes registering to vote easier\nMakes apps and a team voting available to oil and finally to prove it straight ticket voting those are pretty important to our democracy and that's why I ...\nTruck thanks for calling for leaving us voicemail rather than through the ... what would you say the trucks call is that the kind of reflected in why a number of Michigan are voting this year\nWell let's say yes that I mean there he is speaking of that proposal to which is a redistricting as he is ... and then proposal three which is being called promote the vote and and that would allow no excuse absentee voting earlier of course we're talking about whether you have to lie or not to to get an absentee ballot that would change how that works um [noise]\nYes uh particularly a prop too which would create this independent commission has just sort of taken the state has been at a bar and storm of\nA ballot I Am most ballot initiatives like one would like to think right that some people some community folks who are like we want to change the law in Michigan let's gather together and let's go you know get enough signatures and put it on the ballot no no no that is not usually how it works in this state usually a\nOrganization some kind of a political organization pays\nFor signature sometimes a dollar two dollars per signature to get questions on the ballot but um this voters not politicians as prop to\nChanging redistricting a young woman Katie Faye he twenty eight years old when she started this all grass roots organization got four hundred fifty thousand signatures\nAgain grass roots volunteers to get this question of redistricting on the ballot and this is just sort of fascinated both voters and political watchers in general\nWe've heard from a number of you who are reacting to some of these initiatives in Michigan pat emailed in Michigan seniors over sixty are allowed absentee ballots I Love not having to stand in line at the polls\nThis year a referendum called promote the vote is on the ballot which would allow anyone to use an absentee ballot too many people having trouble getting to the polls on election day\nAnd John emailed I live in Ann Arbor Michigan I voted with an absentee ballot for the first time this year I Do so because I'm volunteering as an election inspector this year I'm also working with the voters not politicians group and supportive prompt too which is passed will make Michigan one of only a handful of states with fear of voter\nThe kind of the split in terms of who is supporting these measures and who is opposing them is it kind of a partisan split or do Michigan voters tend to kind of agree that the time has come for this how how does that shake out\nWell I mean again if you're going to take this idea that this grassroots organization that four hundred and fifty thousand signatures one would portend that that is going to create some turn out on election day or for folks who got absentee ballots I'm\nBut you you have seen the Michigan chamber of commerce which tends to lean towards conservative Republican candidates I come out against a proposal to you've got the freedom fund which is um\nI I get money from other device organization just last week uh putting one point two million dollars against proposal to again this is about redistricting\nProposal three though which is that promote the vote which would allow an shrine I should say straight ticket voting automatic voter registration same day voter registration and no excuse absentee voting\nWe really haven't seen a a organization fall and wholeheartedly come out against this proposal because for many folks are not only are these popular ideas but\nA majority of states in in the country twenty seven states in DC all allowed no excuse absentee voting\nMichael do you want to let me come to you with another proposition that seems to be energizing voters in Colorado and that might affect other races Jennifer's in Colorado and she left his voice mail explaining her view on prop one twelve listen\nProposition one twelve on our ballot this year\nWould increase the distance between new oil development and any building that\nIs designed for human occupancy it would increase it to twenty five hundred feet which is less than half a mile and it's not unreasonable to me that the ads we see here are hugely fear mongering they're paid for by companies and they say you're going to lose on your jobs all your schools are going to close\nFires going to rain down from this guy it's ridiculous\nJennifer thanks for calling in Michael can you give us a little more context on prop one twelve particularly this couch or argument that ... Jennifer ... she's been seeing on antibiotics\nSure it will be a ... to put her finger point on it right now there are also a a current setback distances which are\nA five hundred to a thousand feet depending on where where you are and and supporters say supporters of on twelve say that the wells are you know just like Jennifer are are two already too close to people's\nHomes schools places at work and that's a threat to their health because there are these are basically the industrial sites\nThat are dangerous and uh they admit pollutants um the oil so the other side of this is the oil and gas industry which is ... which is big and Colorado um they say a this measure would essentially run them out of business because\nUm it would be difficult to find sites that are twenty five hundred feet away for every potential new site a but just how difficult that is will you know that's debatable the the state's oil and gas conservation commission\nUm did a study a is saying that as much as eighty five percent of new development would be halted\nA but there was an analysis from um another one of the Colorado School of mines that used a slightly different methodology\nAre taking into account possible drilling strategies and they came up with fifty eight percent so still in either case you know the industry says that's a lot of business for them that would be lost in with it\nUm there are jobs and a potential economic impacts um estimates are into the billions of dollars one real high estimate was four hundred and Seventy billion dollars\nUm but you know let's go back to the other side as supporters one twelve um say that you know the industry's benefit to the state has ...\nIt's it's now about five percent of the state's economy here or there are about thirty thousand direct jobs um and uh you you know they um note that the um uh current oil and gas operations those would be affected at all\nRight Michael let me speak with you for just one second uh you've been covering the governor's race to rather wealthy candidates are running one related to the Bush family the other made millions in online businesses can you give us a sense of how much that race is or is not driving early voting\nYou know it's it's tough to tell um the two candidates are a Democrat your polish and Republican Walker Stapleton and\nI'm a you know a ... Walker Stapleton is currently the state treasurer a juror polish is a congressman I'm a ... a Stapleton as a relative of the Bush family planned and I'm\nThis is Ninety point three WPN land Nashville public radio Ninety One point five WTO ... in Ninety One point seven W.

go you go to a synagogue is going to be all Jews there if you want to target Muslims you can go to a mosque if you want to target black people you can go to it a predominantly black church I mean so

thousand members across four campuses it's considered one of the most influential mega churches in the nation\nPastor Hamilton says that he has observed deep divisions within his congregation that reflect the nation's divides what's his plan to get people of faith thinking differently we discussed it this summer when we were both in Aspen, Colorado for this year's Aspen Ideas festival here's the first part of our conversation\nJosh what's great to be with you today thank you describe your congregation to United Methodist church of the resurrection in Hollywood Kansas or tell us about your company sure we'll leave it as a suburb\nOf Kansas City we've got four campuses throughout Kansas City of downtown Kansas City Missouri was friends with her in a couple and the Kansas on and it's a very diverse congregation are highly educated largely a highly educated\nWe have um we did a poll that long ago we found out that forty nine point two five percent of our people are Republicans and fifty point seven five percent of our people are divided between independents and Democrats\nThe Republicans are divided between conservatives and ... you know conservatives on social issues and those were moderate progressive on social issues but conservative fiscally\nBut Democrats are largely moderate to a progressive and the independents are divided between Republican leaning independents some democratic leaning independents are we ever were pretty divided congregation and I think we represent the country you know fairly well they're kind of divided within divisions dish exactly that's exactly right and so it's an interesting thing when you come you know you have to as a religious leader\nSpeak about the issues that are happening in the world you know I constantly have not constantly better regularly get emails from folk saying well you know you're being too political and we shouldn't talk about politics and\nAnd I have to say okay wait a minute I'm not standing endorsing candidates I'm not even talking about the candidates but what you're calling politics I'm calling ethics and morals and values when we're talking about\nJustice issues we're talking about people who are being hurt\nWe're talking about moral issues we're talking about and and so if you think about what forms your politics what is it is it just thirty second soundbites on you know in radio spots or TV spots for a campaign or is it a deeper sense of spirituality in a deeper sense of the meaning of life and why we're here and and surely you're not pray that\nWhen you're doing your politics\nYou're doing that through the lens of a deeper moral system in the value system\nHow much do you as a as a pastor as a minister lean into the political debates\nAnd a religious lens on them as opposed to trying to have times where you may be lean away from them like I imagine there are some weeks where you say let's just do a sermon on you know tithing earlier I just do a sermon on the story of the garden to anything but politics so here's a sauce\nFeel like I'm doing all the time but here's the way I Try to look at it is um if I were reacting to the news stories every week and in particular in this than the Trump era\nThere's always some you know big thing that's happened in the last week I Would be rewriting my sermon every ... every Saturday\nBased on what happened in the news that week and then probably Sunday Morning than manned again probably something morning and so what I've set is and that's not how I'm going to do this I outlined my sermons a year in advance you know actually I have ideas for two years in advance and yet somewhere in the midst of those is preaching on these themes the things that are happening in the news are going to come into play\nBut my ... isn't that a I mean I I think people are hearing so much news all the time and so much political rhetoric and so much divisiveness that when they come to church I'm not sure they always need one more\nYou know round of what they're already getting every day\nSo what I'm trying to do is is carefully choosing where one of the moments when I Need to say something this is this has to you know something has to be said when there's a school shooting and even then there are so many school shootings I'd be preaching about school shootings too you know or violence in in our society so like I said we're going to talk about that a couple of times this year but I'm not going to talk about it every Sunday\nI Try to build into the ... into the year at least one sermon series is going to be focused on Christian ethics the entire series we're going to look at one of the issues that were that are dividing us or one of the issues we're facing in our society and then we're going to take a look and see how you know for it to be a sermon and not just a an ethical electing a lecture on ethics\nWe're going to see how the scripture speak into this how does our faith shape our response to these things and when I Try to do the pressure I tried to take us to say okay I Know we're divided about these things I'm I'm gonna try to help you see things through the eyes of the other and so we are going to try to understand what might be the truth in this complex moral issue that this one side has\nWhat does this side of bringing to the tables were having this conversation and I'm going to say now you know with all the humility I can muster you can disagree with me but this is how I see this issue right now I could be wrong but just as I say this issue right now [noise]\nGun guns as a as a great example of this and uh recently I've preached the sermon on gun violence in schools I did a sermon on a on gun control and and gun legislation to a year ago [noise]\nAnd as I did that you know I surveyed the congregation and laid out some basic common sense kind of measures that one can take to um to address the prevalence of guns and how easy access to them and\nAnd it was interesting how how many people agreed on both the left in the right on some of these basic things now that sounds like potentially risky ground because it begins to get out of spirituality in actual policy yeah uh it does actually so so here we're talking about what would what would we as people of faith how how might we respond\nTo you know the issues of shootings in school so the shootings in schools is the presenting or just violence in our communities as a present an issue and so and obviously there's no guns in the Bible but there are swords and spears so he got plenty of plenty of places where we talk about\nHow do we respond to people who are our enemies we've got Jesus saying love your enemies we've got Paul talking about you know doing good to those that would harm you you know you've got a lot of things you could [noise]\nSo there's a part of that that is going to be about those basic biblical principles but then there's going to be another part that is going to say so are there any solutions and is there any way that we as people of faith\nOn the left in the right can come together to find some solutions and in the end we found that more than two thirds of our people who were gun owners agreed with us or you know we lifted up four or five basic things that people said yes that that makes sense\nAnd in the end you know part of what we did as I said you know\nFor those of you know it's easy sometimes in the ... in the world around us to think that those people are and they are in RA are all gun toting nuts\nBut I I have friends and people who I Love dearly who are in the in our and they love to hunt and they're not gun toting nuts and they grieve every time there's a shooting in the school\nWeb streaming has made possible by diversify trust and independent wealth

diversified trust dot com\nThey want a place to deal with the social issues that they want a refuge from the politics of the day do they just want you to stick to the scripture or do they want you to be more prophetic on the issues of our times what is your congregation expressing to you know the answer is yes all of a lot of it if I if I get emails across the spectrum\nI have people who are like you know I it just it makes me so mad when you talked about what's you know what's going on the news I don't want to hear about politics when it comes to church and again politics becomes the catch all phrase for something you said that I don't agree with\nAnd uh but I've got other folks were like ... so the immigration on the border when a when the children are being separated or the news broke about that\nYou know I'm hearing this News I'm out of town I'm hearing this news throughout the week I'm studying and I'm like do I talk about that this Sunday or do I spend another week really trying to see how it's going to resolve because I have a feeling within a week it's going to be it will start to be resolved and sure enough within a week there was an executive order and it's not all result but\nAnd I had people who are really mad like why didn't you you should have preached on this this weekend and I had other people were like thank you for not preaching on this weekend and the next week and I did I did that it was Father's Day weekend I did talk about it but um so I it's all over the map on that are there\nBut here we we also served the congregation recently to find out we're doing at worship survey to find out about music and different things what they what they want but we asked about the sermons which the sermons or do you find most compelling and the number one response was when Adam deals with current issues where he's dealing with what's going on in the world\nBut for every person says that there's somebody else who's saying I Wish you wouldn't do that and you just stick to talking about love\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from farmers insurance committed to helping people understand the ins and outs of insurance so they can prepare for

inbox\nThis is Steve from suburban Park Maryland my concern is the constant resorting to violence and quote quote\nIn your face politics and actions by both sides the left and the right the Dems and the Republicans how many people out of restaurants is not a good way to start a good civil political discourse\nSupposed to talk to them well I hear your focused on the political white women seem to have more of violence benefiting the political left as an example Hillary Clinton saying they will not be suitable until they are empowered what's the opposite of being so we'll be by\nMy name is Audrey I was in the synagogue when the shooter came in we need to stop teaching hate everyone who hates has been tied whom and how to uh rationally blame accused threatening target\nWe've lost some of

continue\nIt's our job to be stronger and to keep trying to teach\nHas a better way of life but we've lost these particular tones and the campus of our congregations we've lost their chair and their laughter and their boundless optimism may there so it was the sound and the bonds of like the turtle we are greatly reduced without them\nYou're always welcome to add your voice to the conversation feel free to leave us a voice mail at eight five five to three six one a one eight it's eight five five to three six one to one to\nHow we move forward as one is something we talked about was pastor Adam Hamilton he founded the church of the resurrection which is America's largest Methodist congregation\nNow a recent study found that Methodist or one of the nation's most politically divided denominations congregants and pastors are both split almost fifty fifty between Democrats and Republicans\nThat rising partisanship is particularly challenging for pastors like Hamilton and that's where we pick up the conversation how\nDo you help your congregation see themselves as children of God first I think it's very easy today to just see people as jets and sharks this kind of political duality which to me is\nNegates the three dimension Audi of of humanity I Wonder how you as a faith leader especially with a gigantic congregation them help keep people seeing one another in an equivalent way and and see through and around and pass the politics\nYeah so that is something that we talked about regularly and I try to model for them the modeling of treating people with dignity and respect and hearing their voices and not that they're all equal voices but just being able to treat people I mean the so and the drink juice up to how sixteen I had our our ... versus\nA do another just should have them do unto you I Hope you'll have this memorized already but if you don't we're going to memorize that and I want you to think about that every time you have a conversation about politics\nWhat does it mean to do unto others as you'd have them do unto you and then there was a a ... I think I actually had three I think the second one was love your neighbors you'll have yourself so what does it mean to love your neighbor who's a Democrat or Republican or somebody across the aisle or somebody who's ... loves Trump or somebody who hates Trump\nHow are you going to love them because you know in the end God God doesn't really care so much about what you thought about this or that President the gutters deeply about what do you love your fellow human beings and John says if you can't love your neighbor who you can see how can you say you love God you can see\nAnd uh and so we talked about that in another one was a passage from Paul where he says let no evil talk come out of your mouth but only what is useful for building others up as there is need that your words might give grace to those who here\nAnd it's just right and that not only applies to your words out of your mouth but the ones you type in social media how are you\nAllow your words to give grace to others as opposed to the humanizing them or you know so if you can\nFollow him on past under some people who we just need to lead habit feels so good I mean really like we're having this debate about civility right now and I feel like it's just it's too satisfying\nTo take the moral high ground men say what you know those people whoever those people are and I need the here\nAnd I have the answer and you need to hear it and this is America and doggone it it's my turn to talk and I'm tired of bite my tongue needs now feels to satisfy the finally let her at\nI think that's exactly right I think that's what we feel that we have to guard against I think it\nIt naturally now there's not this isn't saying don't share what you think but sharing what you think in a way that's reflects the humility like I could be wrong about this I don't think so but I could be wrong about this and that treats the other as a human being is really important and most of the time when we send those zingers out it feels really good and\nWhat if I'm quoting the Bible I Know one right 'cause it came out of the Bible\nYeah yeah yeah well that goes back to our question about the second ago about the new law says the Bible and how we read the Bible it's not quite as simple that cause I can pull out I can pull it averse and I can sing you with a thousand different versus that aren't really in keeping with the spirit of scripture but I certainly pulled out one verse out and made it made it saying\nHere's the thing especially when it comes to complex arguments political or moral arguments is you cannot have a complex argument\nIn two hundred and eighty characters on Twitter and thankfully they doubled the amount of space we have so we went from a hundred and forty to two hundred eighty you can't do it you can't have those kind of arguments and you're you know nasty responses on Facebook to somebody's post\nAnd you also when it comes to posting on Facebook to figure out how can I so here's the thing I I have challenged people pastors across the country we talked about prophetic preaching\nAnd prophetic preaching has to do is saying the hard things you know in addressing justice in and righteousness all these things\nBut but when it comes to prophetic preaching ask pastors you've got to decide do you want to irritate people are influenced them\nIt irritating people's easy it's just not hard to say something that's going to hurt their feelings or irritate them or make them out but if you actually want to change somebody's mind or you want to influence their thinking you've got to figure out how do I do that so if you if you're on Facebook and you want to influence your ...\nHow could I Do that in a way that my mom who feels totally opposite of me might actually go well I hadn't thought of it that way before and that's why you know when it comes to preaching unconsciously issues are typically my approach is to say here's why thoughtful people on this side see this as well here's what level people on the side it this way both quoting the Bible\nHere's where I come out I appreciate the folks on that side on this side I find myself more compelled by this but if you're on the other side no how much I Love you and you I mean I've had people come and go I came in and I knew you were preaching this I was going to hate your sermon 'cause I kind of had a feeling where you're going to let it came in ready to hate but then the way you approached my side\nOpen my ears and my heart to hear what you had to say\nThat's kind of be hard for you though as a pastor I Know you're not trying to do harm now but just personally in your own and I I Know I got to let you go shortly but in your own spiritual walk\nI Wonder how you are dealing with this as someone who has a tremendous responsibility over a huge congregation who knows the obligation on a pastor\nAnd who's trying I'm sure try not to hurt anybody and doesn't like being told I was ready to start arming Iraq believe it or that\nBefore I let you go pastor Hamilton how are you dealing with this what's your spiritual walk like these days to be prophetic and helpful and resilient in these crazy time\nI actually feel like that's a a that's a part of the calling and how God is wired me so I I feel grateful to have a chance to do that and and I feel energized by having a congregation is divided and that I'm trying to help them hear each other and find a I I told them in our polarized country you know I feel like the church has a role to play in bringing healing to a polarized nation\nAnd we're we're a place it's are defining value as love so if we can't figure out how to do this together in our congregation\nWhat hope is there for the world so I Want you to be in a small group or a Bible study or a science class of people who disagree with you and I want you to figure out how do you listen to each other and treat each other as brothers and sisters and how do you come out with a stronger view a better view better informed because you've listened to both sides\nI mean seldom are issues that were really divided about as a country\nCompletely black and white ... if they weren't we wouldn't be divided everybody degree but instead there is some truth on both sides there and so so anyway I when I was younger and so I'm fifty turned fifty four next month when I was in my

A. M. U. dot org me get to a few more of your comments Laura is in Goshen, Indiana\nLaura emailed Trump as the vanguard of our worst angels is effectively sounding the horn to release previously restrained prejudices latent in some Americans\nHate is now fair game and high volume what they call the end the political correctness is the end of civility and democracy missing McCain and Obama now you don't know what you've got till it's gone and it's gone\nHeidi by Eric I Wonder if you could respond to that comment I Wonder if what Laura is saying in a way takes a little of the pressure off of President Trump in so far as he didn't create these views he happened to have tapped into them but you can tap into something that wasn't already there\nWell I think that's a completely fair position I mean you know the United states has had a long problem with white supremacy and racism and legally oppressed you know parts of its own population for centuries\nSo that it's legitimate to say that this kind of hate has been there\nI Will say that the work we do at the Southern Poverty Law Center found a great escalation and the number of hate groups for example on line hate rhetoric particular lane during the years that Obama was in office as an African American he very much a\nSet off white supremacist who were unhappy with him being elected to the highest office\nAnd the Internet itself has allowed this kind of material to proliferate radicalized people you know it's allowed to be shared in a way that wasn't the case in prior air as so we have a lot more of it around and that's certainly something Trump has tapped into\nMick how do you see it uh there's no question that there is a hybrid polarization in American politics and I think it's important to also recognize that something is going on internationally when you look at Europe ah there is a larger\nCut a breakdown of a post World war two consensus um you know in general throughout through the developed world and certainly in Western Europe and North America\nA Trump did not create that he is an ... and he's exploiting it to his political uh aims we need a a tremendous reset I think in American political discourse and this is not a I'm not even talking about the rhetoric of hate per se um of polarization\nGallup about twenty six percent of people in America identify as Republican about twenty seven twenty eight percent identified as Democrats these are historic lows as those noted before there is a historically low level of trust and confidence in the government and other major institutions\nWe need to come up with a a political rhetoric of public rhetoric actually that is\nI'm not a you know that is not based on demonization polarization and again either Trump Trump bears a certain core responsibility as president of the United states because he is not simply a politician he is also on some level or he should be leading the discussion in a way that us more productive than he is\nBut he's also not the only one are you doing this um [noise]\nAnd um the other thing to think about though is what is the distinction between rhetoric and action um and you know when we we live in a violent the society that is filled with a lot of a fantasy violence whether we're talking about games whether we're talking about rhetoric et cetera but\nIn general crimes are going down and violence is going down so again recognizing that rhetoric is one thing in reality is another I think is you know as the starting point of any conversation about this but I Do think we need a reset and that it needs to be a it needs to move away from polarization but this is much much bigger than Donald Trump I Wonder though Nick how much\nPower we give the words that are set especially in the political sphere I mean anyone who thinks that and I I Know you're not saying that words have zero power but ... who who minimize the power of words needs to go back and read the declaration of independence those words yeah weapons for sure and they led\nTo a war ah you know yeah I I you know I I agree completely with that and and I realized that I you know or maybe it's a slippery position where I'm saying you know simultaneously that words matter in rhetoric matters but also that we need you know\nWhat what are we going to do about that so I guess as it is another way of coming to this question of\nTrump's rhetoric is ridiculous or it has hate filled it is garbage I mean it is and it you know it's been now uh we we can go on and on that doesn't get us any closer to figuring out how do how do we have a better conversation about politics about places where we need to\nReach a consensus and and then in that policies that actually work for the benefit of of people\nI Do want to talk a little bit more going forward a little later in the conversation about what next steps my looked like next so we'll we'll circle back to that Jennifer mochi a number of people\nHave commented on the role of the press of various media outlets that I Will try hard not to use the term is a media because there are so many different kinds of media out there will try to be a specific as we can and thanks to those of you who've commented who has been specific\nWho've mentioned specific networks or specific people that is extremely helpful so keep that up\nLet me get to a few of your comments about various media outlets in various press outlets\nCheryl tweeted the largest responsibility belongs Judy twenty four seven media and those who absorb commentary an opinion as if it were factual news that President much like Andrew Jackson stands up to the press should he just let the Ninety percent negative coverage go we all need to be personally responsible\nMod asks why does he get so much airtime\nAnd Jim Wright's why hasn't anyone addressed the years of conditioning the public has received from talking heads such as Rush Limbaugh Glenn Beck Alex Jones et cetera\nThey have permeated our society and finally elected their leader which only embolden stump Jennifer before you react to that sweet of comments I should note that Glenn Beck in recent years\nHas tried to walk back some of his rhetoric has as publicly apologized in his words for for taking some of the rhetoric too far but I Do wonder Jennifer what your senses of how much of a of a role various media outlets\nQuestion and I think that um there's a little bit of a historical big picture that um maybe would inform my answer here I'm In part of that is a reciprocal ruled that used to exist between the president and the press\nAnd it used to be the case that uh there was a mutually beneficial relationship between the presidency and the press a largely because they needed each other that press needed the president for information and the president needed depressed because the president needed to disseminate that information and get their message out\nAnd that relationship has fractured a and that's largely due to um cable news and social media and the fact that we all now have this platform to disseminate and circulate information including the president\nUm and so information circulates in a very different way than it did twenty thirty fifty years ago um which is really fractured this relationship between the press and the president and Trump has been able to take advantage of that\nAre in a way that that previous presidents had tried to do but Trump has really done much better for worse job depending on your perspective um and so a Trump is completely mastered the news cycle and the way that\nIs especially cable news has been complicit I think in\nIn amplifying his message\nAt you know on Twitter he has followers and many of them are bought a but most of Americans aren't on Twitter but we see his tweets everywhere right\nAnd because those messages are amplified and that is Trump using the bully pulpit the good poll that of the presidency and also taking advantage of all of these other social media opportunities\nUm and and so in this case a lot of times the press is than guilty as amplifying the messages when they shouldn't have\nAnd tumbling trust and independent trust company

trying to find a scapegoat and it is truly unfair but then again he is blamed for everything\nDone writes the shooter is responsible dumb question\nDrew tweeted Trump may not be responsible for the violence\nBut the people who are feeling Bolden and encouraged by what he says as long as he remains inconsistent in denouncing violence and hatred they'll continue seeing him as an ally stripped from what she can you respond to that last week from drew it is true that the president\nHas denounced the violence I mean the first statement he made after the carnage in Charlottesville was to denounce white supremacy bigotry hatred knowledge forms\nThen in that press conference that impromptu press conference in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York on that Tuesday I think he said there were good people on both sides ... I Wonder\nHow you view this in terms of the the way that the president denounces violence at least in a statement and then makes comments that are vitriolic thereafter how do you see this\nYeah it's a great question and and I'd also like to address that question of responsibility and if we have a moment that after answer\nAnd so Trump will say the thing that somebody has written for him to say he will read from the teleprompter when he has for city that um but that isn't his natural inclination and so I have tracked in fact the way that Trump uses denial\nWeb streaming is made possible by the Blair school of music ... opera theater presenting Leonard Bernstein's can be November knowing that the eleventh and grow hall a budding music and ... and the best of all possible worlds details that Blair dot ... dot edu\nBy Julie coffee in GQ um and so they sent her um hate messages and death threats and you know did all kinds of terrible things to her\nUm and when they asked Trump about it he said he didn't know anything about it so his first strategy was to deny any knowledge and then they said well and you know the sun CNN they said well but you know do you have a message about this now you you clearly know about it I'm telling you about it\nAnd then he denies association with the people write a he says I don't know I don't know those people and he says what fans of mine you know are these are these fans who've done this\nUm and then he does a third thing which is to wonder what um the journalist Julie ... had done to deserve this hatred you know did she write this terrible article that is full of you know lives about me\nUm and then to accuse at other people have doing the same kinds of things right to an appeal to hypocrisy on and if you look at when Trump is responding to these situations where people are trying to hold him accountable for his violent rhetoric\nAnd he follows that same pattern he denies knowledge of it he denies association of it and maybe praises the people who've done it he wonders what the person did to deserve it and then he finally uses to quote ... which is an appeal to piracy to say oh everybody else does is it's not just me\nUm and that is classic for Trump he cannot be held accountable [noise]\nThis is why I call him a demagogue a demagogue is an an accountable leader and that's a historic definition deriving from ancient Athens\nUm and and we're talking about whether Trump is responsible and we can say that he's responsible but I'm telling you Trump does not accept responsibility he won't take that responsibility um and admit that he in fact has been wrong\nI Wonder how effective do Jennifer's in a situation like this to refer blaming you for this kind of wondering what your take is on it to refer to President Trump\nAs a demagogue I mean she is the duly elected president of the United states of America she won the electoral college and when you call him a demagogue\nYou call all the people who looked at him supporters enablers of demagogue him at a time when something like this happens but it's got to make it harder to have the kind of debate we need to have about ... about refining the civil discourse\nSure it's an accurate term\nSo um if you look it up and the Oxford English dictionary and the lady you'll see that the first step finishing of a demagogue is positive for neutral it says that it's a leader of the people which is the etymology of the word\nWho defends the rights of the people against the other parts of the state the second definition of demagogue is a leader who uses polarizing propaganda for their own personal gain\nDonald Trump is a demagogue in both senses of the word\nFor his fans for his followers and his voters the ones who won't leave him who will defend him at all costs they just send him because they see him as a heroic demagogue they see him as sending their rights against the other parts of the state that they believe are corrupt\nEveryone else who sees him as a demagogue into bad sense of the word sees him as using polarizing propaganda for his own gain\nFor the use of the word to use the word accurate\nThough it may be is it helpful\nI think so [laughter] it's an analytic point we can't understand what Donald Trump is doing if we can't understand what he's doing an unaccountable leader is a danger\nThis is Ninety point three WPN land Nashville public radio Ninety One point five WTO mountains of Houma and Ninety One point seven W.

in theaters now John Carpenter welcome to want to thank you for having me you've been away from a Halloween movie franchise for some time now what made you decide to come back\nWhen his producer Hollywood producer Jason Blum a convinced me to come back\nI knew that one was a a a sequel was going to be made as I Know a Malik the cod he's the the son of the man who put up the money for the original Halloween so I knew there was a sequel coming\nBut Jason bomb a talk to me and they said you know where it's going to be made with or without us so why don't we meaning he he and I\nI'm getting bored and try to help it be good so nobody had put it to me that way before so I thought that's a great great thing\nJason Blum spend doing some pretty interesting things with horror movies lately ... what do you make of where the genre stance today\nThat's in good shape but it's always in good shape horror has been was cinema since the very beginning and I have a feeling\nA will be with us until doomsday just because everybody's scared of something that were all born afraid we all understand fear and so it's really fun to go to a horror movie with your girlfriend or your significant other and cuddle and scream and so forth\nWhat was it like for you not being in the directors chair for the twenty eighth team version of Halloween you were involved in the film but what about watching someone else direct this movie it was a relief\nBecause I don't have to suffer the stress and anxiety that directors suffer and that's a worst profession in the world other than being a coal miner\nThe worst other than a cold I'll come on now well it could it could be worse I guess you could be a slaughterhouse technique that you're right ah it's not the worst now\nUh when when things were a it's great to be a director when they don't work it's it's really garbage\nWhat do you think movie fans least understand about what it takes to direct a movie especially a horror movie\nWhere ever or did they at least understand let me think that uh directors\nAre responsible for all the central elements of a movie if it's supposed to be funny they're responsible for the humor of it if it's an adventure and so forth and so on so director of a horror movie think of it this way horror and comedy or a lot\nLike 'cause it's turning it's all about timing and it's all about when things happen and how they unfold and it's more complex than than people assume but uh people just think that horror as a lot of war\nWeb streaming is made possible by snow creek wealth management hosting a

Can't\nOh come on you can tell me something\nWell look to make it really simple\n[noise] ah there are no rules for any horror film\nThe horror horror movies come out of the story and horror is every\nAction think of it that way not a genre necessarily so that's a reaction to things\nAnd uh if the story is is unfolding then you use the story telling to a a a set up your scares and set up things they're frightening for the audience he said the word earlier suspense that's what's you if you get the audience in suspense and you can scare them\nSo maybe the key is having a story it's got enough of the right elements to make me feel that suspense so that they're there can be that pay off so that there can be the scare is that it\nThat is correct you got it what about the music you contributed music to this film and and the music to the original in Nineteen Seventy eight what does it take to make that kind of music work for a scary movie\nWhat does it take it takes a certain amount of talent and ability to play musical instruments and a feeling for him\nThat's what it takes\nNow were you always musically inclined when you put the original movie Halloween together Nineteen Nineteen Seventy eight or wasn't something that kind of came together unexpectedly\nNo I I grew up in a musical household my father was a music professor he was a [noise]\nA virtuoso violin player and he had taught to college level music courses at a university where I grew up I grew up with music in the house all the time classical music listening to it\nHe decided when I was about eight years old that I should learn to play the violin there was only one problem with that and I had no talent other than that it was a great idea\nBut I moved on from the violent to the piano and tar and other things I picked a lotta stuff up\nWere there any particular influences that you draw on when you made the music for the original Halloween or that you've drawn on over the years\nYes I'm all classical a\nMovie composers and classical ... ah musicians and rock and roll I'd get influenced everywhere\nWhat about the timing I did this seem to the original Halloween is not in a plain old for for your time it's in five four time it's an odd kind of time's signature was what drew you to that\nMy father taught me five four time uh when I was Thirteen he'd try on that I had a pair of bongos I got for
