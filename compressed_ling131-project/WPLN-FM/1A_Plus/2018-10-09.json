Republicans are OK with philandering and sexual assault\nThe only reason was Ford was not believed was because she was testifying against the Republican nominee the white didn't even listen to her and the FBI quote unquote investigation was a total sham and John ... investigation in quotation marks much and I didn't want to ask you about that in terms of\nWho was believed in this whole process set aside for a moment evidentiary question of whether there should have should be thinking beyond a reasonable doubt like in court for or you know preponderance like set that aside for for just a moment but just\nThe visceral way in which some people seemed to be more believed\nThan others what did you make of that [noise]\nSo this episode like so much in our highly highly polarized society um\nIs two completely different world views so when Democrats um both partisan Democrats any way I look at what happened with Kavanaugh they see a Republican Party that is ... that doesn't believe women that diminishes charges\nA sexual assault doesn't take them seriously\nAnd um they have some things in their in their quiver they can point to the Roy Moore episode and ah and to the president himself and so forth so that their view um the the Republican view is\nThat the allegation a of Christine Blasey Ford was even though it was held until the very last moment and they're they're very angry about the the processes um I was saying\nBut they also point to the fact\nThat this accusation the blazing Ford won was taken seriously was listen to but then it was roped in\nBy many Democrats on the committee with two other allegations that were so absurd that they should not have even pass the\nLaugh test I'm the one by Julie sweat neck which she immediately walked back\nYou know that that there was some sort of rape gang going on in a in in but says the Maryland in the Nineteen eighties and to the students in that she has a college student was attending a lot of high school parties and saw Kavanaugh spiking the drinks have girls with ... and then attacking them well of course she she walked all of that back but\nUh and of course the Ramirez story too was quite thin so thin that the New York times looked into it and we refuse to publish it\nSo um [noise] so so the the problem was that when Michael ...\nSort of collard sweat neck and dragged her forward and included her absurd allegations in with\nLazy Ford's more um believable accusation it had the paradoxical effect of ... of um making sleazy Ford's case all the um weaker because it was seen to be part of this political hit\nAnd um and I think of an ... a may have a lot to answer for from his Democratic colleagues\nWill the president did also make some political hay with Christine Blasey Ford's case or her story as well I mean she was part of what you said at a rally on Wednesday in Mississippi in an act of what he said was to help defend Brett Kavanaugh and he was unfair treatment here's a bit of the president\nKind of characterizing washing cars a generous word what professor Ford said to the Senate\nHow did he get home I don't remember how did you get there and remember when I was trying to remember how many years I don't\n\n\nI don't know what I Want to [noise]\n\nI don't know man a man lies just shot a\nPart of what the president said at this rally last Wednesday in Mississippi it's worth noting that the president is incorrect in his assertion that all the professor Ford remember was having one beer indeed she said that seared into her hippocampus clearly a psychology professor was the fact\nThat she was laughed at during the assault\nYes she also remembered that it was upstairs I mean she remembered many things the president did not cover himself with Gloria in that moment where he was mocking current diminishing her of course a that was that was disgusting on the other hand\nUm there has been a tremendous amount of behavior on the left during this process that was also I'm really ... um stopping people in restaurants and and driving a people are from the public square um\nUh you know accusing someone of a absurd\nCharges and not taking into account his whole life you know uh if judge Kavanaugh where the monster that are the some of the Democrats had been portraying you would think that somebody would have picked up on it at some point in his adult life\nWell and that's kind of what I'm Wondering in a way I hear you on that Mona El Yon also kind of noticed that\nOne aspect of the debate around Brett Kavanaugh that seemed to not get a whole lotta mentioned in the final analysis that didn't get a lot of mentioned from Susan Collins of Maine when she gave that like fifty minutes exploitation on the floor of the Senate which was actually rather fast moving toward hearing if you've ever heard it\nIs just how Brett Kavanaugh handled the accusation I mean if someone accused me of something that awful but I Know I did not do\nI think I Would hope that I'd be able to say listen this is an awful thing that happened it sounds like a tragedy I Wish I could give you the closure you're looking for but I'm not the person who did it like something about temperament in this whole discussion kind of fell by the way ...\nYeah I Do think that once the additional allegations came out in ... in his testimony had to answer not just for a lousy Ford's allegation but also for the other two allegations\nAnd and he was upset angry in tears enraged are outraged\nOn Democrats sort of their their arguments a became one not about necessarily guilt or innocence\nBut one about temperament and did he have the appropriate temperament sit on the bench and it\nAh their argument necessarily uh it it became one not about do we believe her but that he doesn't have a judicial temperament and Republicans answered in turn that Democrats have said he was to ... and the Fox interview and to detach and then when he got angry they that that wasn't good enough\nOn it from a from a report ... perspective and that the temperament question was an\nInteresting one to me it's sort of seemed to me from afar\nThat looking at the justice says on the bench we know all of their politics are based on the president to a point that it's based on the way they ruled so the temperament question was interesting I'm not sure how relevant today is because we know all the politics of all the justices not really sure how cabinets temperament plays into it with\nRegards to temperament and civility Sam wrote on our Facebook page there's\n\nSupport for NPR comes

with you know step in early on a Johnson and motive sharing you know let me let you jump in and responsibility on his comment before we could go\nA little early on I mentioned that that Republicans might suffer in the midterms and that was a political sacrifice worth making I I actually think that the opposite I mean I'm not in that political prognostications business I think after twenty sixteen that's a dangerous business for sure\nBut I don't think they'll suffer at all in fact I'm especially among Republican women there's been a big jumping enthusiast and there's a twelve point\nUpward swing among Republican women and that's because the left doesn't actually owned the voices of women\nOn for a lot of women out there this this hearing about fairness\nIt was about fairness read their husbands their fathers their sons on that a lot of blame moms who are are really scared about the standard that Mona mentioned right the idea that as single accusation\nWithout any kind of corroborating evidence is enough to destroy a man's life I think there are a lot of women who see a problem with that standard as well and they are also energized taken out to the\nThis is no doubt very very visceral for quite a lot of you including gene\nGene emailed urging contacted us in road we're more concerned with the men who were falsely accused two to five percent of the time than the women who are raped Ninety five Ninety eight percent of the time\nWhen one in four women in America deal with rape and tens of thousands of rape kits remain untested there are bigger issues than your panel is talking about our justice system is broken the women on your panel or making my blood boils ... are we losing sight of something larger here [noise]\nAh well the um the problem of rape has always been with us as long as there's been human civilization\nStarted when I I hate to interrupt you but I just want to clarify something from the comment the comics wrote that one in four than America deal with rape Senator Dianne Feinstein and the shearing said that according to federal statistics it's one in ... the one in three women will deal with sexual violence\nSo uh yeah well not rape that's that's way overstated sexual violence of sexual so and that's a very very broad description drunk lose even just being funneled over your clothes against your will so right over here with a number yeah go ahead and\nGo okay so yeah the number is is is a is not not right but look at the problem of of male sexual aggression or has been a problem throughout human civilization all civilized society seek to cope with it\nUh and it's also one of the most difficult crimes to prosecute because in most cases there are only two people it happens in privacy there are no witnesses um it's very hard to show proof if there was no actual if there were no wounds on the woman's body et cetera et cetera\nSo it is you know when people say well we're not being believed it's because it's it's very hard to prove and also you have to recognize that the consequences of finding of guilt at finding someone guilty of rape I mean\n... years and years and years in prison and so of course we do need to be careful about how we evaluate rape accusations it's it's it's an awful thing it's but I don't see any way around yeah keeping in mind our standards of justice and fair play and see any way around\nThe difficulties inherent in these kinds of accusation\nLike this is one of those moments early on as there were a lot of women including several who commented on this program not that I think that the show is a perfectly representative sample of the country but a preponderance of the woman who commented on this program have essentially said I don't want to hear it\nFor our society to deal with the fact that men can treat women like pieces of meat and get away with it with impunity that day is over yesterday so fix this or we will shut you down until you do\nI hear your Mona but it's that emotional visceral part of politics early on I I don't think that the political will is there especially among women who have been assaulted to say okay I'll take a breath and wait another term for this to get\nBetter well I think there are two challenges the first is that we have a justice system based on a presumption of innocence and the cabin are confirmation presented another challenge which is that he was not being tried in the court of law and the question raised and it was should he at\nBenefit from the presumption of innocence and we had a lot of senators saying no he should have the presumption of guilt and he should have to clear his name and not seem not to go over a well there was a political backlash on the right to that\nAnd so I think that there certainly is energy on the left but it has met with equal force from energy on the right with people who feel that that's\nGreatly unfair but the cabinet confirmation and saying that a ... a presumption of guilt when an accusation is level\nWas sort of met with an equal and opposite energy from the right and emailers and callers can say that that makes their blood boil but covering this as a reporter and that is simply a sort of what we saw\nI Do want to move on and talk about the impact on the Supreme Court but I should note that this has left some of you just regardless of your politics feeling very cynical about the process over all I mean this was very high political theater in some ways when you get down to it and that was kind of a reflection of one listener who just left a note in our inbox\nMy name is far I'm calling from Cleveland, Ohio I'm very disappointed\nAttack and our Congress and I'm very disappointed with the United states at this time and an African American woman I really do feel that it was all of the joke that they went behind doors and said okay let's get the country a good show they already know what\nThey were going to do it's not a government by the people on Oh yes it is only up to take care of a group of people\nFor us to appreciate your calling and sharing your thoughts with us when we get to a few\nMore comments as we continue Tina in Grand Rapids

Maine\nTalked about in her long exploitation explaining why she was going to vote for Brett Kavanaugh and some of his background particularly as it relates to dealing with\nPresidents on the Supreme Court she mentioned roe versus Wade very specifically what what's your read on whether or not Brett Kavanaugh will drag the court kind of as Irwin suggested to the far right\nI'm because he's replacing Anthony Kennedy I think there will be a shift the right on the court um I think it will be much more measured\nUm I think it's really unlikely that you see roe versus Wade something like overturned precedent overturn I think it's much more likely that we see some narrowing of the precedent on abortion allowing states\nI'm a little bit more leeway to regulate abortion and the second and third trimester as I think that's more likely outcome on those issues\nUm I Do think that Susan Collins overstated a cabinet as moderate credentials a little bit and her her speech um because he

of uh their population and then the number of seats in the U.S house of representatives they'll get\nThere's a really complicated math formula called the Huntington he'll method which I still haven't quite figured out even though I've been staring at it for a couple of years but that that's how so every state's all fifty states get one member of the house of representatives at least you know they're four hundred and thirty five\nSo that eliminate those those first fifty seats that everybody gets and then the fifty first seat is awarded to the largest state using the hunting can heal method so California gets the fifty first date\nAnd if I'm not mistaken I think they get the fifty seconds a seat as well but then that does the the seats are allocated by population all the way down to the four hundred and thirty fifth\nAh and that's how we figure out that say you know Washington state has ten districts this time or California has fifty three and whether or not they're going to gain or lose a seat on the margins depending on uh the population shift and the relative populations of each state so this happens every ten years and then\nEvery ... the U.S constitution gives the state legislatures the power to a draw those district lines now that clause has been interpreted in different ways\nUh some legislatures have challenged uh the the various independent commissions around the country so that they can maintain that power from other states other legislators have more willingly given up that power to an independent commission but basically every state does it in its own way in some with with some you know various quirks here and there\nAre and uh the legislatures will then draw those maps and the district lines are meant to go in place by the twenty twenty two\nTwenty uh the the official numbers are given to the states about a year later and then the states have about a year to draw district lines everybody knows pretty much where the districts are going to be running minor tweaks that happened here and there\nAnd when we get to gerrymander young that's when a that that sort of the pejorative term for when a party draws district lines that are meant to favor their candidate a in crazy ways in ways that where the the communities are divided or to diminish one side's political power or bolster another sides political power\nUm and and you know throughout the years or every state has gone through its own\nHiccups with political gerrymandering a it's become a dirty word now and it's something that we're going to see thrown around a lot of in this next redistricting\nYeah North Carolina is one of those states has got quite a few stories to tell about redistricting and gerrymandering and David your in Charlotte following the national democratic redistricting committee which Eric Holder is leading we had him on this program to talk about it a while back give us a sense David of what's at stake\nPolitically with redrawing the district lines particularly with North Carolina being this kind of interesting example of redistricting and and the efforts to reform it\nI think there's an awful lot at stake um if you think about it this way if you look at the five competitive swing states of Pennsylvania North Carolina Michigan Ohio Wisconsin you might imagine that those five competitive swing states Sunday similar number of members of Congress of both parties\nTo Washington except the reality is dramatically different those five states than forty eight Republicans and Twenty one Democrats to Washington\nThat Democrats have only been successful and flipping one seat\nRed to blue in any of those competitive states in this entire decade and that's the Conor Lamb state and the special election in two thousand Seventeen so when the two thousand twelve two thousand fourteen and two thousand sixteen elections there was no swing in any district in any of these competitive swing states\nYou also see this as as well at the state legislative level so you have all of these states\nThat are closely divided like say North Carolina I'm you know states in which that Democrats may often when more votes state wide for it chamber and yet here for example Republicans have a super majority\nIn in both the state assembly and also in the state Senate so they're able to completely override the actions of a democratic governor here at mix politics more extreme it in the late ... members\nFrom voters it allows them to do things like the transgender bathroom build it wildly unpopular and yet the politicians um you know feel completely empowered to go ahead and\nEnact that kind of legislation um and it also discourages competition in a lot of these states in North Carolina in two thousand sixteen forty nine percent of all statewide seats went without a major party\nCompetitor so voters had no choice and almost half of their districts here because folks\nTook a look at those races and said I Can't win or raise enough money to actually make it worth the investment of time\nTo get to some of your comments as well clearly gerrymandering is is as some of your fans and the show no one of our audience is hottest taught us topics including with Michael who wrote on our Facebook page any party that requires gerrymandering to stay in power doesn't deserve power there shouldn't be partisan\nMichael writes Ohio is heavily gerrymandered however in an election earlier this year voters heavily approved with support from both parties and the issue on the ballot\nTwenty and Laura writes Pennsylvania was gerrymandered rewrote the map but I Do not believe they were making an active for this twenty eight feet a lecture and he's got a load of crap\nThat's all the same in North Carolina Laura by the way we did a program a while back in February ... actually about gerrymandering where we put a quiz online and we have some gerrymandered districts and we wanted to see if you could tell the difference\nBetween the map of gerrymandered district and the ink blot on a Rorschach test you can find that quiz if you search the word gerrymandering G. E. R. R. Y. M. A. N. B. E. R. I. N. G. it was a program that aired this February you'll find that on our website the one a dot org\nKatie let me come to you talk about voters not politicians I understand that this was a redistricting initiative that got started after you were trying to find some way to be politically active but not overtly hyper partisan and this is something that galvanized people around you right\n[noise] yeah I'm I accidentally started a political movement with a Facebook post it was after that twenty sixteen election uh before\nI'm headed to a Thanksgiving dinner and I had heard my friends and family really are being drawn to both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders I'm with these messages about draining the swamp and the political revolution and\n[noise]\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station

couple of you wrote us to respond to lower his message about Pennsylvania's redrawn maps\nNot being in place for this year's election mark writes that the new Pennsylvania congressional maps are effective this election cycle\nSteve writes the state Supreme Court had to intervene to get us fair districts\nSomewhere so badly gerrymandered districts formed pictures\nLook at the old seventh congressional district\nThankfully the new districts are enforced for twenty Eighteen\nIn some of them say that the seventh congressional district in Pennsylvania looks like goofy and Donald Duck facing one another's seriously to Google it speaking of which Maurice tweeted gerrymandering has transcended the political realm and infiltrated the fashion world he sent us a link\nTo a website called gerrymander jewelry dot com this is they say\nGerrymandered jewelry has all these pictures six in fact of voting districts than North Carolina sixth district Texas is thirty fifth district's Louisiana six Florida fourth Michigan fourteenth\nAnd Ohio's first district and they're selling them as jewelry a hundred and Ninety five dollars each but the proceeds benefit of political action group is trying to get more Democratic governors secretaries of state and attorneys general elected in six key Republican controlled states we got a lot of comments read about\nThe role of Republicans in gerrymandering Scott wrote on our Facebook page I live in Virginia the GOP is dragging its feet on this because they ...\nOr he met her in their favor they're simply trying to push this past the ... election to stem their losses is that fair I don't think that the Republicans have cornered the market on gerrymandering neither party wants to be disadvantaged but what what what do we know\nWell the Virginia example he's talking about the house of delegates and how they were Democrats came within one seat of winning back the house of delegates back in twenty Seventeen\nThe way originally elections work the delegates are elected in a odd numbered years so it has and that doesn't actually have anything to do with the twenty teen election uh there are some there have been some federal challenges to the congressional district lines in Virginia\nBut but that there's a difference between the state legislative districts which is sort of part of a larger story of how Republicans locked in a lot of their gains in the U.S house of representatives\nBut that's those are two different things you're you're exactly right there the there's no party is blameless in this\nUh gerrymandering started we get the word from a guy named Eldridge Gary who was the governor of Massachusetts\nUh back in Eighteen twelve he drew a district line that effectively packed all of the federal and members of the federalist party into one district and that allowed his party the Democratic Republicans imagine if those still existed today\nA reason to win all the districts around it\nUh the a newspaper ... and in Boston took a look at the map they said it looked like a salamander was Jerry's salamander he was a gerrymander so that's how we actually get the word and so yeah this has been happening since like the beginning of the republic hum you could argue that some of this happened back in in a female and democracy back in you know the\nFive hundred BC uh but when we talked about today yeah both parties do this look Democrats controlled the house of representatives from Nineteen fifty four to Nineteen Ninety four and they did it in a large part by a drawing favorable districts in the south\nThat were meant to lock in their members and in in large degree to discriminate against African American voters\nAre and now even today we see some challenges to district lines drawn by Democrats especially in the state of Maryland\nUh there's one district or out in western Maryland they used to be held by Republican until Democrats redrew the winds and now it's a safe democratic seats so yes\nBoth parties do this Republicans have done it a more publicly lately and so therefore they are getting the heat but yeah when we started hearing about\nA fair district lines that generally comes from the people who think that the winds aren't fair and therefore are probably the ones who are losing elections that's not to diminish the fact that that these lines may not be fair but the people who who ... tend to be the ones who are not ... not holding the pencils if you will\nWe do get comments from folks on both sides of the aisle complaining about how both sides of the aisle tension gerrymander Harry wrote on our Facebook page the G O P is going nuts in Colorado over ballot initiatives to redistricted by a nonpartisan commission\nSlow deep tweeted I Wish this was such a hot topic back when Democrats in my state had districts in the shape of a pencil [noise]\nJoanne wrote on our Facebook page redistricting reform has been an issue for several years in Indiana as we have a super majority Republican general assembly a Republican governor and the state Supreme Court with the majority appointed by Republican governors and approved by the Republican legislators\nNothing will change as long as the gerrymandered legislative branch is controlled by one party\nSeveral bills have been put forward with lip service for leadership then killed by Republican chairman who do not believe that Indiana is gerrymandered and safe so publicly\n... he I Wonder if this gets back to something that you said earlier about trying to find something political but not partisan can you give me a sense of some of the conversations you've had\nWith folks that you've been witness to folks kind of talking across the aisle about this does this feel practically to you on the ground like uh\nMy experience really has been that um I mean in Michigan though we have had Democrats and Republicans control the line drawn process so maybe that helps but\nWe have volunteers who are Democrats Republicans independents and I think that what we've seen is that no matter which party is in charge in Michigan the really common sense things\nThat we all looked to government to at least help provide basic things like clean water or roads that aren't falling apart um those things aren't happening no matter who's in charge and um\nYou know where is also a Detroit is pretty gerrymandered they try and pack a lot of Democrats into one district but there there are still Republicans do you live in those districts and so their voices aren't heard\nOr because a lot of these races are happening in the primaries and we don't really have competitive elections at the statewide level of Michigan we're a lot of people talking about even if they're\nThe of fish all that is there um representative as the party they leg they're much more extreme than what they would like to see\nAnd so I think that in Michigan in particular people have just had enough we feel like our government's doing a lot of overreach and want to help restore some transparency in the system especially for consistently ranked one of the least transparent states when it comes to transparency in government\nUm and that's the biggest thing we heard while you're doing those town hall is a lot of people saying you know I don't know why these lines are being drawn and then eight years later some emails coming out a talking directly about how the lines were drawn to guarantee one party an advantage or another\nAnd people are tired of it they want to be looked at as having our politicians accountable to us and not special interests um what's been really cool to is that you see a lot of families who have joined voters not politicians to volunteer together even for my family it did

showing wrote on our Facebook page maybe the real issue here is that the criminal justice system in general and law enforcement in particular are being deployed to manage the effects of social and economic problems that they are ill equipped to resolve\nAnd Seth wrote on our Facebook page as a white person who works in an office that staffs mostly black people\nHearing stories of police shootings scares me that one day I might lose a loved co worker just because of their skin color when I found out they found this man guilty I was elated it's time for bad cops to stop being protected killers\nOr do I know I had to cut you short before we pause my wonder if we can pick up with sets comment and finding officer Van Dyke guilty it seems rare that officers are convicted after shooting someone under questionable circumstances what's the legal reason behind that\nWell there is a decision from the United States Supreme court that really is the\nKey to all of this and that is that decision that the court made many years ago Graham case that basically said that when you are determining whether or not an officer is engaged in the use of excessive force it much basically\nTake faith in the ... the steps of the state of the officer so it's a very subjective standard what what a waste noble officer have\nDone in that situation so it is a lot and that ... is what is the officer feeling what is the officer seeing what is the officer experiencing so that's what the jurors are required to do it as a result you find very few judgments\nFirst of all you know and and civil ensuing police departments jurors have to again how hold the standard and prosecutors before they decide to to charge the officer have to look at the standard and say what would an officer reasonable officer in that situation has done so\nIt is the Supreme Court that has set this world for\nAll law enforcement agencies in the country\nAnd they were over Eighteen thousand separate police departments throughout the United states they all have different rules but they are\nWhatever the Supreme Court said correct that is the rule that is out there now\nYou were by the way referring to the cheeses Graham versus Connor it's a case from Nineteen eighty nine and some of you actually commented with regards to what's going on and officers mines like Peter Peter emailed\nIt seemed like today was the mentality of police officers that their life is paramount beyond all else including their safety I feel like whenever they are threatened with any sort of possible harm to use deadly force in the new somehow justified\nThis is a career in which they signed up for similar to the military where they know they're going to be put in harm's way to protect and serve the are paid for this\nLet's add one more voice to our conversation before we get to some more of your comments joining us now on the line is Shannon ... the Chicago police officer who was also a whistle blower with in the department and worked undercover with the FBI Shannon welcome to the program\n[noise] thank you Joshua\nNo I understand you had been working as an FBI informant within the department and as a result of what happened that caused some of your fellow officers not to be too fond with you what what happened the cause such a store or did it have to do with with corruption inside the Chicago police department\n[noise] absolutely Joshua I was working as an undercover narcotics officer with the FBI and um I had discovered that some of my fellow officers were\nActually involved and the money that are kind of trade with and the Chicago area and\nThere for I began\nAnd operation dumped operation brass tacks like and some of my fellow officers who\nI used the term officer loosely because if you are on the other side of the law you are really not an officer but they did have badges and ultimately that\nLed these officers one of them being a bus to go to federal prison and that made me very unpopular among the rank and file within to Chicago police department\nBecause before I came forward with operation brass tacks code of silence\nWas unheard of you didn't talk about it it didn't exist a they tried to label man it's crazy for believing that this was actually going on within the ... the department so it made me very unpopular and lead to a lot of police retaliation\nI Wonder why that is from your\nPerspective I mean I Can't imagine I've never been a law enforcement officer have law enforcement and my family but I've never taken an oath so I Can't I'm speaking as an outsider\nBut I Would think you know if I knew that there were reporters who worked for my station who were lying in stories and they got caught I Would be grateful to see them go because I drugs all of us now why do you think it's not a similar mentality and law enforcement\nScale honestly a lot of police officers get approach man they still talk to me and you are correct on as police officers absolutely do not want to work alongside with corrupt officers however the code of silence\nIs so strong within the Chicago police department and I feel that does go across departments nationwide that\nOfficers actually\nFear what will happen to them if they break this code of silence and\nWhat was interesting to discover during this journey of breaking the code of silence is that there is this common misconception that ate the blue officers blue shirt comments\nLearned that the retaliation came from the top down by says we're actually\nInstructing the officers who were working with me not to back me up\nOr they would be the next Shannon Spalding so out of\nFear of becoming me out of fear of retaliation themselves or putting their lives in danger losing their job what could happen to them they complied because they it it's easier and easier than blowing through everything that I had to go through and even though officers didn't\nWant to they thought they had to I had officers come up to me and say you know I Believe in what you're doing but I Can't be seen ... because I'll be next\nWe'll let me let me play a clip from the president of Chicago's fraternal order of police

P.\nIn the store and we'll share some of your questions and stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with new Franklin Shannon Spalding Patrick Smith and judge will Doris Cordell let's get to some more of your comments before we start kind of looking forward at where the effort to improve policing in America might be going\nHey sailor tweeted the reasonable officer standard is a very easy standard to apply it's not that hard\nWe do need to eliminate the criminal justice college major and higher police with degrees in psychology or sociology too many cops have no business carrying a badge and the gun however Galvin had these questions Galvin writes\nThe question is what is reasonable\nDoes disobeying a police officer shouting orders constitute the right to use deadly force\nDoes a drug dealer running away from the police deserved to be shot\nWhile they may be criminals or the actions from the police equivalent to the criminals actions judge Cordell maybe you should respond to golf and how do we suss out in a finer sense what reasonable ... years\nSaid well this is in the eye of the the holder it really has\nNo one definition and what jurors are required to do is put themselves in the shoes of the officer and what was the officers thing and oftentimes incidents happen and you know just a matter of a few seconds so it's there really is not one\nDefinition of it but I Do want us to\nI Believe it's time to we imagine policing in America\nPolicing in America today is is ... militaristic and police departments officers are seen as an occupying force especially in communities of color and in low income communities that's not how policing started in this country\nPolicing started with individuals who lived in a community who knew everyone and they were people who were not seen as an occupying force there were\nPeople there to basically provide a service and help the individuals in the community and it has dramatically changed we have police departments armed to the teeth with tanks\nAnd all kinds of of the equipment that uh are commonly used in the military and I think it's time to change this whole thing we need to start thinking outside the box why do we need police officers to basically\nA patrol and and take care of traffic issues for why can't that come from within the humidity why can't individuals' community members somehow ... ties to deal with with those kinds of things that the minor kinds of things that are happening in the community\nMoon some some of these ... and I'm I'm not disagreeing with you or just by way of conflicts there are some places where a lower level of sworn law enforce off or worse when officer does deal with things like parking enforcement and traffic enforcement things that are less likely to require deadly force\nSure but but but my point is that that our our whole attitude and this is even within police departments they see themselves as this you know kind of a militaristic force and they they do have a command structure and\n... and and so what I'm saying is that maybe it's time now to say let's pull back from this whole image we have of police being occupiers and look at a different model entirely\nI'm not opposed to criminal to criminal justice reform but look what happened\nWe we get body cameras and what what happens well we have officers settled oh don't turn the cameras on or we have places like Chicago where it takes more than a year and a court order ticket footage out on for example in liquid shooting so that that the whole lack of transparency\nPolicing for example has very little sunshine\nThere's very little sunshine and policing we don't get to know who these officers are their track record their history they're disciplined history it's very very difficult to get that information and state\nI think that do to us with the comment that one of our listeners left for us Reggie who lives in Maryland with this in our inbox\nI talked to who we both black and white and ah they seem to have this new drifting approach to the community I have\n... experiences where you know we that we would rather have conflict where are we meaning rather than actually serve it I really think that they should you\nKnow take away the gums first couple of months but we do but he is the community without guns make them stand up comedian before she might have a dialogue with community I think it'd be a ... a lot better uh which serving a community\nWhere did you thanks for calling in and sharing your thoughts with us Neal Franklin I Love you to respond to that but if I could first\nIf we could contrast what Reggie said with another set of comments that we've gone from some of our listeners like what's scholar Rhodes Scholar rides\nPolice put their lives on the line everyday protecting our society Ninety percent nine zero percent of the cases put forward by activists as examples of police brutality in all people not complying why is the outrage not centered around these individuals' behavior that got them shot\nIf a cop breaks the law I'll convict him but if there's any doubt I'm siding with the police\nNeal what would you say to folks who said that police work is inherently difficult inherently dangerous potentially deadly and then we as a public also have a role to play in easing the tension that officers feel about just being able to get home at night\nSo I Believe it was Reggie that left a message yes um\nYou know that was such a brilliant comment because forcing the dialogue seat when you develop a relationship with those people you are serving the citizens who are serving\nAnd you get their support your job doesn't isn't as dangerous as it is today it you know going back to what the judge Cordell said [noise] um\nHow it used to be having relationships walking up and down the street talking with citizens talking with the neighbors\nWhen something happens they support you when you had those relationships but when you have this occupying force will you know none of the people who are very few of the people the ones that you do know there's conflict on the under ... on the other end of that relationship\nThat's a problem this goes to community control policing that I mentioned before\nWhere the community sets the philosophy where the community sets the budget for those in uniform where the community decides who the the leader is going to be whether you call them achieve for commissioner or whatever where the community decides what's important were the community decides you know what\nWe can handle these issues that the ground level\nWe just want you to pay attention to people hurting other people and this is how we want you to do that\nBut policing is very political it's political through the unions as political through the mayors and governors and we'll never get to that place into the community decides they come together and say we want control over our police departments and this is how we want to do it\nHaving that oversight at the beginning means that you don't need police review boards at the end when something goes horribly wrong\nIs speaking of which we got some ideas from some of you about what could be done with regards to policing and review boards were part of it including on a larger scale\nJamie asked shouldn't there be a national group or board who could provide oversight over individual police departments they could be an objective trusted advisory board who's judgments both sides would trust and accept and to whom and aggrieved local citizens group could appeal\nThis is Ninety point three WPN land Nashville public radio Ninety One point five WTO ... in Ninety One point seven WHM rats Cookeville get the latest stories from WPN ...

A. M. U. dot org speaking of the world of work there's been some breaking news this morning about a woman who is choosing a new job and has resigned from her current position\nNikki Haley America's ambassador to the United nations announced her resignation this morning\nHaley is formerly the governor of South Carolina has somewhat international reputation for being willing to take on her boss from time to time she told the New York times she doesn't agree with the president on anything but it's on everything but says there was a right and wrong way to address that will pick up the phone call them or meet with him in person\nShe'll also be remembered in part for striking back at White House adviser Larry Kudlow who suggested she might have been confused regarding Russian sanctions she told Fox News with all due respect I don't get refused to go get confused\nShe and the president met today at the White House she lavish praise on him and his family he was part of what ambassador Haley said\nCan't say enough good things about Jared an unarmed guy Garrett die a game you know one understands I mean to read and after the on the way he can on what I've done working with him on the middle east peace of mind it is unbelievable Ramadan\nThink spending what ... what do we spend about ... about a half of our adult lives at work I don't think spending half of our adult lives in armor\nIs something that most of us are willing to do I think the psychological emotional spiritual and physical costs are too high\nAnd we're not solving problems I Need you to bring all of you to work I Need the combination of all of your experience as all of who you are to address the problems\nFor reading your book and based on the research that fuel to book a lot of what you describe points to that kind of armor as an indicator of where something is wrong it's almost like a scar yeah your scars tough because the wind is tender right and so if there wasn't something tenders there'd be nothing to protect\nNo that's exactly it and I think one of the big ideas that came from the book that really\nIt was actually voided my hypothesis going in so where did you arrive puffy I yeah I just completely ... just shot out of the water and I and I'm usually pretty good at gassy what I'm going to find but not in this case\nSo we asked a hundred and fifty sea level leaders that it's a lot of data that we use so interviews with a hundred and fifty sea level global leaders\nThree years building a daring leader assessments that people can see where they are and these were MBA and NBA students at Wharton catalog Rice University and then\nTons of data evaluation data to I thought when when when it was clear that the future of leadership is about courage we need greater leaders and more courageous cultures I thought the barrier was going to be fear\nBut then we went and talked to several dairy leaders and said so you're not afraid very often and they were like\nWhat I'm afraid every day I'm afraid all day long and I was like so that blew my hypothesis at fear being the greatest barrier to dairy leadership the greatest barrier to daring leadership is\nArmor it's not the fear it's how we sell to protect when we're in the fear is the perfectionism that pleasing the defensiveness the anger that having to be the newer and get everything right instead of being the learner\nUm so really you know and it's interesting what she said about scars and tender places\nNot only does armor keep other people from seen us and sharing ourselves with other people armor protects the fear and less it faster and grow\nAnd metastasize so we need to create were cultures where armor is not rewarded or needed [noise]\nWe are some of you to call in and tell us about your workplaces here's what two of our listeners left in our inbox first let's hear from Adam\nRunning as Adam I'm calling from Nashville, Tennessee\nI'm a paramedic firefighter and that was such a definitely feel like I Need to do my job perfectly at all times because there are definitely times one lives and widely you're on a lot of jobs on the other hand I worked for department is very good about the blues\nAnd our co workers and I definitely do a good job of trying to share and better get stressed the job\nAdam thanks very much for calling and sharing your story where the snow contracts Adam's story which is the bill's story she works in a similarly strict workplace was a rather different take\nTo four seven dot com [noise]\n\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from his Cox insurance providing customized insurance for small and medium businesses so they can do more and be more learn more at H.

lead with regards to arm or Monday sold emailed can you address the differences between armor and establishing and maintaining healthy boundaries\nYeah I mean boundaries are actually a big part of this book because batteries are incredibly important um we find that very simply as what's OK and what's not OK and so armor is not about\nProfessional management of south it's not about four going boundaries armor is about defense in it is I Am going to put the protection of my ego\nBefore doing right by this business and the work that we're doing together I wanted to protect feeling good about myself\nOver movie and I work for it to the difference between\nSo there's a difference between say armor an image\nSuch as kind of self that you portrayed other people to kind of keep bad things and it's it's more it's on a deeper level now it's on a day\nBut I mean the one of the greatest examples that armor armored leadership versus airing leadership as one form of armor we see a lot and folks is that need to be right that it's that I've got to be the ... and I need to be right and that's more important to me than being the learner and getting that right we\nGot a number of comments from those of you about the way that race plays into workplaces and hope emailed can you speak about the ways in which racial power structures in broader society that manifest themselves in the workplace\nDisproportionately impact the contributions of people of color in their work and the extent to which they progress in their careers before you answer here's one example professor ... tweeted\nAs a woman of color an immigrant in an academic I've learned that showing vulnerabilities and even my own resilience can and will be used against me by those in power would love to hear professor brown talk about overcoming that distrust\nWell here's one of the biggest finance I think is that one of the greatest casualties of trauma\nIs the is the loss of vulnerability and when I talk about trauma I don't just mean a traumatic and said that I mean racism\nHomophobia poverty white supremacy I mean privilege\nDoes your does your everyday traumas and it is real that that that you know the armor that you need to survive this thing's Israel which is why it's leaders don't work to create a culture where when you're here you can take that off and be seen\nThan we can't I mean gender as another you know I I think the kind of Anita Hill\nCriticisms that happen after the for testimony where you know Ford was more compelling because she was more vulnerable\nAs opposed to Brett Kavanaugh who is just kind of fun during a way that we are more data all got\nYou know he was you know but absolutely vulnerability can be used against us um and I think that is a that is in itself a form of systemic racism\nBefore we keep going I Would like to talk a little bit about something else you mentioned in your book you talked about core values and I don't think any of us has worked at a company that doesn't have some kind\nOf mission statement or vision clarification or posters everywhere but for those who are supposed to\nBe and then it's really worth nothing more than the paper on which is printed I work at some companies wind been to some companies were the value statement was like Fifteen bullet points law\nYou suggest that we should limit our core values to to just to end the lifting the book I'm trying to find a because there's a lot on the list that I really struggled to narrow down their mind to why only two\nWell here's a big if you don't operation allies values into observable measurable behaviors that people can be held accountable for demonstrating then you just really do have a cat poster I mean it\nReally is [laughter] it's just really a poster so closely related to the point in my head but little do yeah [laughter]\nYeah yeah yeah I've got a Thirteen year old son I Know it [laughter] God [laughter] no and so what\nWas so you know operation allies values into behaviors fewer than ten percent of the organizations we've worked with had actually done that have taken the time to say you know what a some assumption of generosity is our value and hear the behaviors that we will hold each other accountable for endangered in\nAnd so the two is\nReally kind of backing into the data\nThe men and women\nWho had the capacity to be the most courageous could identify their values and they had two to three values and you know I have you know there's a long list in the book like we talked about and there's hardly Fifteen things on there that are important to me\nOh truism collaboration curiosity dignity diversity independents self discipline patriotism vulnerability wealth wisdom future generations harmony health recognition there's it's a long long list\nYes so I there's probably Fifteen or twenty things on that list that are super important to me but when it comes down to it my two Corvette my core values for me or faith encourage and I know there to core values because it's the place where every other things on that list is tested\nAnd so we really we have an we had a companion work buckets free it's downloadable it's on my website where you can do your own values exercise to figure out what your to our and an operational as an end to behaviors\nUm it has changed completely the way we all work together we all know each other's values we understand them we hold each other accountable for them\nAnd then we have our company values and that's actually how we assess you every quarter\nNumbers on the values that you were to do it\nLike for example one of our values is take the care taking care of each other ourselves and the community we serve and so one of the things that we measure is I don't talk about people I talked to people\nI mean you either do it or you dumped\nAnd so I think it goes back to something we haven't talked about yet that as a real core finding which is courage is one hundred percent teachable\nIt's for skill sets each of the skill sets are behavioral and can be taught it's learning how to rumble of phone ability living into your values which we're talking about right now\nIt's braiding trust understand how to talk about trust and breaking it down so we can talk about the anatomy of trust and and learning how to rise how to get back up on your feet after a fall or a setback\nDo you need to clear the values I mean I I Would be fascinated to know what you live near an outfit my to core values are because I Know what they are I went to the list and I finally figured out my too but I don't know that anyone would guess what my word based on who I Am the work I Do like\nI guess one sure cat try sure OK face no\nThere's not one of my two chords but its encompassed in one of my two calls but no free tell us what you two are maybe I should maybe I shouldn't and we're talking about vulnerability Joshua no but I'm the host I don't have to do and I'm just I'm In charge\nHere here we go people there were no no", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "09"}
