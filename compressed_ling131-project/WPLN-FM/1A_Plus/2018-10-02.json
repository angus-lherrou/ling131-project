W. A. M. U. dot org and we're taking your calls in voice mails at eight five five to three six one a one a speaking of calls let's get to one now from Florida David is on the line Hey David what's on your mind\nOr Joshua how are you\nGood what'd you think could be a hearing last week\nThe impact of the nation are you just said the impact on the nation match the ... actually what I Would\nComment on our video but uh I'm actually glad that the that the hearings were made public because it allows us as a nation to weigh in on what exactly is going on in Washington politicians and how they're ...\nUh with regard to these things so uh I think it was very important that we all uh chime in on what's going on your guard less of a political aspirations uh I myself have a they also at the alcoholism\nIn my past ah I found recovery in Nineteen eighty five I I understand the struggles of alcoholism but I also understood stand up uh in my youth when I struggled with alcohol as I grew into adulthood\nI uh was able to me I was able to hide or my drinking and to justify my drinking and it's a characteristic of alcoholics they\nAre very adamant about defending marriage ... and also at the same time admitting that they do not have a problem so um\nI think it's very interesting for us to see um individuals or come to terms with their past and how it affects their future and how that affects the\nFuture of all of us David how ... how do you think this is\nHow do you think this will affect the confirmation battle though I mean I hear you about these other conversations I Need to be had in terms of whether or not Brett Kavanaugh makes it to the Supreme Court or not what impact do you think the last few days might have\nA ... one particular clip I saw on CNN was when I'm One of the senators and the question him about er an FBI investigation and he refused to answer he fall silent he he he explained that he was\nHoping to what the committee or would a welcome however hit\nShe personally would not comment\nOn whether or not he would accept an FBI investigation and it was very interesting to watch his wife\nOr her response to him because when he was\nNot answering that question was staring at him very sternly and I always also wonder what exactly what she\nFaking when he refused to answer this question regarding and FBI investigations\nYeah you're you're right for you that your friend that I watched enough that Senator Durbin of Illinois to have enough and\nThere's nothing to hide we should be open to any possibilities\nYou know David I appreciate your calling in thanks very much and that was the question that Dick Durbin of Illinois put to Brett Kavanaugh and he paused for a long time and then Chuck Grassley who's the chairman of the committee a Republican chairman of the committee jumped back in and then after that Rachel Mitchell question or for the G O P basically lost her job and then the GOP senator started jumping back and\nLet me get to some more of your comments David thanks very much for talking to us Catherine emailed\nAs a woman listening to Kavanaugh defend himself last Thursday I didn't find his presentation appropriate\nIt smacks of bullying and intimidation aside from that conspiracy theories like revenge from the Clintons aired in Senate testimony is a major disqualify or in my eyes before we bring in our next guest professor fitzpatrick if I could ask you to respond\nTo Catherine particularly whether or not someone who began by making a partisan broadside can be trusted to sit on the Supreme Court and administer equal justice under law\nWell I'm you know I think we have to be realistic about all of this our Supreme Court justice has come from the political world they work for president of one party I'm oftentimes or they have other experience in politics they are\nTo some extent partisan or in their outlook but they try to put that to the side as best they can when they get on the court and focus on the statutes the constitution the administrative regulations and I think they do a pretty good job obviously people's world view in ...\nI think we'll find that if judge Kavanaugh's confirmed he is a successful justice well liked by his colleagues just like Clarence Thomas\nFrankly is today if you ask the justices if they like Clarence Thomas they they they will tell you I don't just like him I Love him so and so when you're ... came to Vanderbilt\nLast year and talk to her students and she said that I Love Clarence Thomas and so I think we'll get beyond this um but they're certainly going to be some awkward moments for a year or two\nLet's get another voice to our conversation joining us now in Studio is Elizabeth why drove the presidents of the constitutional accountability center of public interest law firm as think tank based here in D.C Elizabeth walk great to be with you let me start with the question that I began with for\nProfessors Rosen and fitzpatrick just your general sense of the hearing both the structure of it and the testimony as we heard from professor Ford and judge Kavanaugh but how well that might affect the ultimate decision about whether Brett Kavanaugh should become an associate justice of the United states\nWell I think you know harkening back to what the caller uh just uh your your um listener just mentioned about the\nPresentation that judge Kavanaugh I made and talking about revenge of the Clintons you know there's definitely been a divide between those who are centering Dr Ford and the other survivors of sexual assault and as we saw in judge Kavanaugh's opening centering the political\nTalking about the Democrats talking about uh whether or not they should have leaked her letter and disregarded her request for anonymity you know I think that uh whether or not you think Senator Feinstein should have\nTried to raise this another way earlier she was trying to respect that clear request for anonymity from this\nTraumatized survivor and maybe it's telling that Republicans would have just leaked it anyway and disregarded her request but Senator Feinstein was trying to give her the respect that she and her experience deserved and I think that trying to\nMake this part of a political gain gain like she\nCame up with this decades long con to try to stop judge Kavanaugh from getting to the Supreme Court is frankly offensive it's offensive to her and her experience and to the many many many many others who have experienced sexual assault\nAnd have not come forward because of fear because of shame because they worried frankly that what we might see in this case would be true for them that they would finally find their voice and the courage to come forward and it would not matter\nI Wonder Elizabeth if there was any way around the politicking of this if it was just bound to happen no matter what I mean we've got a lot of comments very critical of the Democrats alluding to what you just kind of reference there have emailed the Democrats are showing their ugly side and the people see right through their deception they should be ashamed\nBut that would require morals which they lack\nAnd Joe emailed I'm a moderate conservative as are most of my friends we've discussed the Kavanaugh hearings and Democratic senators behavior extensively if the Democrats think their behavior will go unanswered I'm afraid they're mistaken this entire process needs to be\nWell I think that most people would agree that the nominations process for the courts both the lower courts and the Supreme Court is broken and you know it it's it's certainly a problem but I think that that's kind of a dodge you know okay let's talk about that\nWell let's first talk about Dr Ford and are very credible testimony and allegations and what it means for judge Kavanaugh getting a job promotion to the Supreme Court\n\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the financial services firm of Raymond James offering personalized

Democrats are promising that if Kavanaugh is confirmed and they take the house they will hold impeachment hearings on the ledge misstatements in the confirmation hearings and they range not only from\nA his testimony involving Dr Ford and his college classmates insistence that he was a heavy drinker even though he says he wasn't and so forth but also about alleged misstatements and the first part of the hearings where he said he didn't know about a emails involving lower court confirmations of surveillance programs and the evidence suggests that he did\nSo regardless of whether the Senate chooses to decide that a small misstatement as evidence of a larger one the Democrats are determined to press these and they're not going to go way\nWho's your mind but tweeted sometimes the partisan lens is overrated I Am a moderate Republican women and so many women that I have known experience to solve like Dr Ford the ...\nFriend a cousin a neighbor we believe her because we have been her\nPamela tweeted this is an impossible situation I feel deeply sorry for Ford as she was obviously sexually assaulted by someone and they spent her life trying to get over it I also feel deeply for Kavanaugh as I have a father and brothers there was no way to prove his guilt or innocence\nI should also note that we've been getting a number of voice mail messages about this from across the country and even from around the world already in Hamburg, Germany left this note in our inbox the\nKavanaugh hearings have caught the attention of the German press beat to sue ... what do you decide the opinion though is uniform it's an absolute shock at the lack of respect being shown by the Republican Senate toward the Supreme Court and its own history as the world's greatest deliberative body\nThe shock is not at the partisan tones of hearing the right left battles are left right battles happen here too\nBut what's shocking is the tenor with which the Republicans have been speaking to the Democratic colleagues and the tenor with which the nominee himself used to address the Democratic senators Thursday\nAlready thanks very much for commenting to us in just by way of context to ... is a major paper in Germany if you remember\nOur conversations about the Panama Papers the big international investigative report about money hidden in offshore bank accounts to do which is I took was one of the major papers that helped drive that forward I Wonder a professor for Patrick what's your take is on what all of this means for just America's image around the world how the world is reflecting on us because of the way we're handling\nThis well after our last presidential election I'm not sure image can get any worse um but uh you know I I think that it it is a shame that the judicial nomination process has become so broken parties and\nUm and you know the Republicans are just as much to blame if the Democrats what they did to Merrick Garland after Justice Scalia passed away was unconscionable in my view and I frankly don't blame the Democrats\nFor retaliated with this nominee a and what's so uh I really think that in in order to make the system\nWork better we're going to have to come up with some major overhaul and and I think the one solution\nTo kind of restore the dignity to our judicial confirmation process is it's a big change but I think it's necessary change I think we have to ask do we think Supreme Court justices should have life tenure\nIf they didn't have served forty years it wouldn't be Armageddon every time someone retires and there's a replacement\nIf presidents had a knowledge that every two years they would get a Supreme Court nomination we've been normalized this process and it would become more I'm sane [laughter] um and you know a lot of professors have been proposing this Eighteen year term for Supreme Court justices\nYeah time you have her I've I've I've heard that Elizabeth I was just gonna ask you about that I've heard that suggested that if it was Eighteen years you know there are nine seats and you know every two years basically would come open kind of like clockwork\nThat this might not be quite so much like oh you're making this decision that will affect our children and our children's children it would still be a big deal but you know Eighteen is less than thirty or forty the question is whether or not that's politically viable I Wonder if that just depends on whether we American people are willing to\nPound the table and demand it until the law changes it's not impossible to change the law it's just different\nThat's probably going to be an unlikely a proposal for the particular Senate ah right now um but you know I think that this isn't just about the Supreme Court and life tenure because\nI think it's about this particular nominee I don't see the issues around Brett Kavanaugh's being a case of quote unquote retaliation from the Democrats you know there are a lot of issues with this particular nomination I'm In addition to the fact that he would be taking over Anthony Kennedy's\nThis is Ninety point three WPN National Public radio Ninety One point five W ...

unprecedented in terms of human vetoing something the Democrats would have wanted but what do you make of the veto\nWell a ... you know California of course is a very blue state of progressive state and already had um\nA a relatively speaking a pretty strong gun control laws in place so I'm In the Jerry Brown has a government as a a pragmatic a liberal and progressive and so um [noise]\nUh you know in this case he felt like it at perhaps you know with some of the concerns that ah Richard raise that uh it went a little too too far um and a return note it's a question of a balance but I Would add also I think it's interesting that generally speaking a that a lot of the debate um\nPost a Parkland tests focused on a these so called red flag laws or I'm\nA limiting the gun access to guns for people a domestic abusers you know the argument or the n._r._a. as argument for for such a long time was that a\nGuns don't kill people people kill people and it seems that now rather than trying to revive a for example on assault weapons ban uh the assault weapons ban from the nineties\nOr people who are in favor of more um uh safeguards gun control are pushing on red flag laws are they're pushing on background checks and it seems like that's a potential uh common ground between people who are\nA very strongly support their Second Amendment or what they view as their Second Amendment gun rights and and folks who would like a um some more ah controls and safeguards speaking\nOf the ... are a governor Larry Hogan of Maryland who's a Republican had an a minus rating from the national Rifle Association here he is endorsing a red flag law in this February five said for years um that we need\nOut of the hands of the mentally ill\nAnd people with criminal backgrounds that's why we will push for and support what is known as red flag legislation\nIn general this policy would allow family members for law enforcement to petition the court for a lethal violence protective order issued by a judge which were prohibited individual from having any firearms or ammunition\nIf the judge was clear evidence that the family member poses a animated and present danger um causing injury to themselves or to others [noise] individuals with a mental illness should not\nHave access to fire off very\nBad is Republican governor Larry Hogan of Maryland worth noting that he's a minus rating from the n._r._a. dropped to ... feet as a result of his support of these kinds of red floodwalls Chris I Wonder what impact do you think\nThat that kind of influence would have on more states passing these kinds of extreme risk laws\nI think it has a positive impact absolutely a and I think governor Hogan actually there is a he's doing the right thing and be you know he's a politician he has to be aware that that has an impact\nOn his NRA rating it has an impact on the rating that Brady Gibson as well and I think it relates back to the initial point\nThat I made that is part post Parkland really there is a groundswell of activism on this issue a huge new slate of polls that had been taken\nWhich show in every state across this country\nA vast majority well over fifty percent normally in the seventies or supporting exactly these kinds of measures\nThey're sensible measures they're pragmatic measures\nAnd they balance appropriately uh the you know the second Amendment rights says of gun owners with uh the idea that we all want to be safe in our communities one of the most heartbreaking components of my job\nIs getting polling data back and focus group information that really yields two different things and I think it's really important to think about these laws in this context first\nAmericans overall when they ask about their fear associated with being shot one of the most profound quotes I got back from a recent poll is well most people think I have not been shot yet\nAnd and that is a very concerning saying the second is many Americans are actually ashamed\nAbout the epidemic of gun violence in this country and they want pragmatic solutions so I certainly applaud governor Hogan for doing the right thing here but I think he like many politicians are looking at what their constituents want\nAnd moving forward knowing that these are popular and populist positions to take\nThrough your crews in terms of the pragmatic argument but you know when it comes to gun laws their constituents in their constituents I mean Vermont is a good example of that I mean ... was one of the states to ban bump stocks as part of a larger package of legislation on guns this year back in April promotes governor Phil Scott who's a Republican who had an a rating from the n._r._a.\nSigned these laws in these bills into law\nDo to Scott said he changed his mind about them after police\nFoiled and alleged shooter's plans to storm a local high school and basically kill as many people as possible now here is some of the sound from the signing ceremony as he was signing outside the Vermont state house he was being heckled by opponents to gun restrictions was I\nOur\nWay you curly hair anything we can make our kids in our community safe\n[noise]\nThey got a point where our kids are afraid to go to school and parents are afraid to put them on a bus [noise]\nOr police don't have the tools they need to protect victims of violence or families can step in that prevent a lot\nMore in their life [noise] and the way the economy [noise]\nPart of the signing ceremony on the steps of the Vermont state house with Vermont governor Phil Scott who is a Republican Richard Feldman Philbin when you hear that moment from the signing ceremony ... what does that tell you about the the nature of this debate in states across the country\nWell I think in many ways the pro gun community led by the national Rifle Association is somehow cornered itself by its own success\nOn the politics of this issue transcends the policy of this issue and therein lies so much of the problem in getting this today focused in a way that we can achieve\nResults that work for everyone and we can but not when we focus on the politics but only on the policy we really have to align those

or a few more different kinds of laws that we should touch on before our time is up\nWe should talk about the minimum age is to purchasing one guns and rifles four states California Hawaii Illinois and Florida passed new laws that would raise the minimum age from Eighteen to Twenty one uh Florida State representative who ... who was a Republican\nSponsored new legislation on new gun control after the shooting in Parkland, Florida he had an eighth grade from the n._r._a.\nSerious speaking on WFL our TV in Miami about why he agreed to raise the legal age this is an edited version of his interview\nA determining what age someone can do something is a judgment call and we do it and and many areas of our of our law making and so I think it was for that on was the fact that he had an Eighteen year old a who did purchased this weapon I think I did without that particular fact he probably wouldn't have seen that [noise]\nWhat about law abiding Floridians who are Eighteen Nineteen Twenty years old some of whom have gone and served our country and fought for our country overseas what are you say to those who feel like their Second Amendment rights are being friends\nWill particularly that group of people that you mentioned are covered in the law so if you have if you're a correctional officer if you're a parole officer if you're a law enforcement officer or or you served in the military\nSociety has already said that you're trained and can carry a firearm so this bill would not impair that even at those ages\nThat state rep ... in Florida Republican state rep speaking to us for TV in Miami Chris I Wonder how you think it will play out with this law particularly because the n._r._a. is challenging it in court\nYes than our as challenging and in part I think can Marion Hammer has done a very effective lobbyists there for the\nNRA for a long time and had as suit filed within twenty four hours of that measure passing I think that it will certainly less than judicial scrutiny from our interview 'em and the app held and I think it's a natural reaction to that a mass shooting\nOften um with schools individuals who are within that timeframe\nOf Eighteen to Twenty one uh and I will know that Florida passed a package of laws at the minimum age being one all of which were a really designed to address the that type of issues that we saw\nA from Parkland at the age of the shooter obviously the fact that this weapon was actually kept in a home where he stayed on secured\nAnd that's why the extreme risk laws so important so we're seeing these kinds of this package bells ah reviewed and introduced that the most notable point for me as it passed in the state of Florida has long been one of the strongest a sort of an incubator ...\nOf the ... legislative agenda and I think it's very telling on obviously the reactions of Parkland and that that activism that took place and mediate lay following a the Parkland shooting\nI Would like to come back to safe storage in a moment ... ... by the way we did a program when we visited Salt Lake city\nAbout guns in the mountain west states and and the nature of gun suicide in the mountain west in which\nA state representative who joined us showed us one of these safe storage lockers that does open with your fingerprints I tried it it it works it's it's pretty fascinating you can find that conversation online at our website the one a dot org before we move on to other kinds\nOf gun legislation Richard Feldman could I just get your sense in terms of\nThe in our raise real view on gun legislation ... has said that some measures like bump stock restrictions could be examined maybe through the administration's authority on a federal level rather than the state level\nOr we just kidding ourselves here should we just come out and just see the n._r._a. is not in favor of any new gun legislation that could be passed on a bipartisan basis are we trying to make the n._r._a. more ... and more collaborative than it really is\nWell first of all it's to find something I'm always a little bit of a loss to understand when people talk about the n._r._a.\nHarmon endowment number the n._r._a. there five million NRA members um there's the board of directors there's the senior leadership there that can psalms there on many and our race\nThere's my uncle was a card carrying life member of the IRA and we'll show you his card on demand if you ask with great pride\nAs so many will myself included um but I I I think we're talking about the senior leadership\nOf NRA here and um again when I said earlier an array finds itself institutionally boxed in a corner of if you're calling it gun control no matter what it is it could mandate\nThat uh when you turn Twenty one you're given a gun they're almost institutionally have to be against it because of the terminology and the political position of the terms gun control\nThey don't mean that we sometimes think they mean are they mean different things to different people at different times which\nYou know what I mean talking about Wayne LaPierre Oliver North of the leadership of the national Rifle Association what we hear you know from the big ... the main figures who speak with a national voice for the n._r._a. it's the\nYou know the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun it's those ads within the last that say you know they are coming for our freedom and they use their media and the n._r._a. as you know ... you know liberties last safe place that in our re that's who I'm Talking about\nThat's galvanizing the true believers\nThat's about membership that's about fundraising that's about a organizing for the next a political event both sides do it and there's nothing unusual about that whether we're talking firearms or the environment\nOr any other hot button issues in America\nEverybody does it that way perhaps we see it a little more distinctly in the firearm debate than others when we've been put on that side Scott Y. disorder sides I wanted to ah just ah to to add to that\nThat you've seen on some of those issues issues you just mentioned and perhaps uh we're going to begin to see it on gun control as well that in cases where state legislatures are gridlocked and the power of a\nUm the gun lobby is such that uh that lawmakers won't pass anything I'm a there is another outlet in many states and that's about initiative Washington state will have a ballot initiative in November that would raise the minimum age to buy a a\nSemi automatic rifle to Twenty one uh Oregon people in Oregon and supportive a similar measure came close to getting out on the ballot so we may see that I mean that's that was a pattern with the marijuana legalization for example so that that might be a that might be coming in the future\nLet me get to a few more of your calls and comments we did get a call about state gun legislation in Missouri from a person who was working for a

with the man I Love without seeing terrible scenes in my head\nAnother listener emailed I couldn't listen to Dr Ford's testimony I was raped when I was Fifteen and never shared it\nWith a lot of listening to the testimony was too difficult for me to handle I Am proud of the women who are speaking out but there are others all around us who are silently coping by the way we should note as we did at the top of the program a lot of what we are going to be discussing today\nHas to do with pretty Frank descriptions of sexual assault and harassment so if you'd like to listen to this program later on when you're more emotionally prepared for it away from the kids out of time maybe when you're ready to discuss it as a family you'll find the whole conversation on line at the one eight dot org that's the words are the number one letter a dot org [noise]\nWhat's that another voice to the discussion joining us from NPR in New York is Marvin Gaye a member of the New York times editorial board Mara welcome to the program\nThanks for having me now on Saturday you wrote in the times an account of your salt and its emotional aftermath in part you wrote quote I never felt compelled to share my story before because of this so unremarkable so common because so many women have been through worse unquote\nOn unremarkable what made you think of what you've been through as unremarkable and what changed your mind\n[noise] you know for years and my friends and I have ten\nAnd colleagues as well just sharing stories swapping stories and you know in bars and and trips abroad of of our sexual assaults of our sexual harassment\nAnd just knowing how many of my friends and have been through similar experiences somewhere on that spectrum I just you know as a journalist I never want to make it about me\nAnd so my instinct is to tell other people's stories\nOf my friends and colleagues during Dr Ford's testimony though I'm getting text messages about the kind of pain that they were in uh the pie TST it made me rethink my decision to just stay silent on my own experience can\nYou share with us to whatever extent you feel comfortable what happened to you\nSure so um it was over a decade ago I was in college and um you know I I was at a party with a boy at who I'd had a crush on I guess for a long time I think um we both had and an interesting one another and\nWhen you drink a lot I was Twenty years old at the time um and he drink more than I did ah one thing led to another and we uh ended up back in his place and and we were having sex and that sex was consensual although I Would say that um it was\nA rougher frankly than I Would have expected it kind of took me by surprise\nAnd um you know suddenly all of a sudden we were actually having anal sex which I had not consented to\n'em and it was very painful and I I'm often to stop and and he eventually did I mean it felt like a lot longer for me at the time but frankly I'm you know I think frankly it was probably too drunk to got to know what was going on is what what I thought the time\nAnd you know afterwards I dated him and I think\nNow I Know that that's a very common experience but\nYou know at the time there was no nationwide conversation about these things so you really didn't realize how common that is and so I think I felt so much shame um in what had happened that I I just you know stayed silent about it until a couple of years later when I started talking to some friends\nAnd you know kind of realizing owning that experience for what it was um which which is really what helped me move on\nLast week professor Conan\nDemocratic interrupt this program for weather warning the national weather service has issued a flash flood warnings Wilson trials bill in Smith counties beginning at nine six two you know you and this morning in\nYour twelve sixteen PM again that is a flash flood warnings for will soon trials bill in Smith counties recovers the next three hours\nAnd they're having fun\nAt my expense\nProfessor can you explain for us from a neurological perspective what it is that certain aspects of assault stand out in people's memories ... perhaps by way of explaining what the hippocampus foods and what adults\n[noise] um they hit the campus is a part of the brain involved in memory and um [noise]\nDoctor forward in her testimony talks about I'm being afraid she's gonna die or that he's going to kill her\nAnd the human brain has specific parts that are involved too in code fear and if you just think about it I'm I'm that's because fear especially in prehistoric times kept us alive um you don't want to see a lion and have to think oh is that dangerous or not should I run away\nYou when people who can encode that ... that fear that lion and immediately react well escape and survive so I'm\nSimilarly and fear memories I'm like the memory of an assault on the brain becomes hyper focused on specific details so it's really common to remember perhaps the color of the person's eyes or sound or the Muzak or like Dr Ford says the laughter because dot um even just hearing her talk about it really\nMakes my heart clutch you know it's really emotional\nUm but forget other details like uh the house you were\nUm that was aren't those are relevant in the moment the assault is happening um so I Hope that sort of helps explain it but it is their brain operate\nThey've kind of feels like when you're you know the way she describes the way he described it it feels like that experience you have when you're like watching a scary movie or you know you were walking drawn in house you forget all the decor but that's the thing that leaked out at you that kind of forced your adrenalin to rise that wouldn't codes that I Would have great example yes\nNo more you said that a moment oatmeal Lauren Lauren Taylor these moments that in code so intensely are there are ways to weaken the power of them in the mind or do you just\nKind of have to deal with those things kind of trigger those images that are super vivid how do you work through the ups or ten you there are many many ways to work through those I'm\nTalking about it and getting support whether that's a therapist or a community support group or an ... a an informal group of friends can be and getting validation talking to the right people can be incredibly helpful um what we do in our empowerment self defense classes\nAre is help people\nFind their voice and find their physical power a talk therapy can accomplish a certain amount but um as professor kind and will tell you\nThe trauma also lives in the cells of your body and um you need to have some kind of ...\nUm release of that and so mad at basically means so much is body so um we we do role plays of practicing standing up for yourself or asking for what you want and we also do hitting\nAnd um that can be that can really move the trauma through an out your body or not only reclaiming your power but you're also releasing whatever you've been through\nTo a few more of your stories Jennifer emailed my story involves a sexual predator who happened to be my boss ultimately I was raped on a business trip to get away I had to move to another

as I said here's one more that came into us\nMy name is Linda and I'm calling from central Virginia forty two years ago I was raped by my brother and it was only last year that I was able to knowledge that and begin dealing with the fallout from\nI keep hearing people say well why on earth would she weighs thirty six years and it really happened it must be alive and I can tell you exactly why it doesn't matter that we were victims when we are raped\nWe feel wrong we feel shame and humiliation and embarrassment and we don't want to admit it to ourselves\nLet alone to anyone else if it was not a violent rate that left obvious marks it's easy to pretend it never happened and emotionally it feels like the right thing to do\nBecause you're so scared and so hurt and so it shaped\nLupe thanks very much for sharing your story with a smart gate I'd love to get your reaction to that story particularly the shame the humiliation the embarrassment\nThe comes after an incident like that after an attack like that wow and it's powerful and you know [laughter]\nFairly certainly not just because of of my assault or it was one of the things of many that that I dealt with but I have been so struck by by the number as friends and colleagues and acquaintances who have reached out to me after I shared my story and you know sharing things they haven't told anyone before\nI was molested I was raped I you know it goes on and on and on and and I really am also a huge fan of brain brown due to social researcher reality shame and vulnerability right and I I and I have become a huge believer that shame needs secrecy to survive\nI'm and of huge part of the reason that I decided to share my story is selfish it's because I\nYou know I don't believe anymore or that the shame that I've been carrying around should have ever been my own shame\nAnd so in telling my story you know I I was I feel a huge sense of relief I was able to to discharge that I'm into the public arena where I Believe

H. M. U. dot org let me start\nWith the book this alliance between astrophysics and military give us a sense of what that is in a nutshell and why it is as the title of your book suggests\nSo so we already are familiar with the role that other scientists have played in warfare especially engineering you know somebody had to invent the catapult when that was first showed up on the battlefield was at a symmetric weapon that would have been a symmetric in the military sense where\nYour opponent has something that you don't have and you're in deep trouble because of that difference\nAnd so that they call that an asymmetric advantage so engineers definitely and if you look at the notebook of of Leonardo da Vinci where yeah he did art but he also was a mastermind that sort of military machines that could lay waste to your army\nSo and we know him as one of the greatest combinations of its scientist engineer and an artist but moving forward you think of the physicist as the person who builds the bomb right that was well known in the during the Cold War especially\nWe also know the camera is that you know wouldn't make chemicals like napalm and things like that going back to the first World War where they were you know flood the field with mustard gas\nAt the biologist might weaponize anthrax for example the astrophysicist ... ... you may know such association because we just humbly sit at mountaintops and wait for photons too arrived from across the galaxy and then we carefully takes a detector into the coffee lounges and debate what we saw\nSo that connection is not obvious and so when I say the unspoken alliance between astrophysics in the military it just never shows up but in fact astrophysicist and then the earlier days astronomers have been fundamental to the growth of empires and the Gemini of nations\nIn particular the the need to navigate with precision around the world ... my my professional ancestors no new the night sky\nAnd to to know the night sky and on any level is to give you better advantage for navigating earth's surface\nBecause the sky will just different depending on where you are on earth and things rise of different times and sat in different places and so if you knew this you can know where you're headed where you're coming from where we're the trade winds are where the hospitals are where the Friendly's are and all of this can be established and there's no end of examples\nWhere this kind of information was exploited for the game of the nation who had control over it\nI should know we didn't have the conversation on this program for those who are more interested in this connection between science and the military\nAbout the origins of chemical weapons during World War one that did bit of that heritage traces right back here to American University which is the institution that owns WAMC which produces one and you can find that conversation on line at the one eight doc board\nNew President Trump announced the creation of a space for the summer a six to branch of the military to focus on the militarization of space I guess it will be a fifth plant since the coast guard is technically part of the chess which is also the topic of your book\nGive us a sense of ... within there is a topic of the book give us a sense of what this space force would need to do have accomplish avoid to be in the best interest of the American people enough humanity\nSo first of all just to to the space for so not a new concept and ah it it surely been around even before I remembered mentioning it in two thousand and one in a commission I served on\nA authorized by the White House to study the future of the u._s. aerospace industry which at the time\nWas had fallen they've fallen on hard times I lost a half a million jobs that his consolidation in the industry there's competition from Europe with Airbus and other places that were rising up like in Brazil has embraced Air Canada was making\nConcern that well what happens if we lose this industry the what impact would that have on our security on our transportation on our commerce\nYou order something from Amazon it's on your steps the next morning some airplane delivered it there right that or at least to the nearest airport [laughter] ... doorstep delivery by a airborne craft is still to come but we would call them drones I guess but so so you you ... when you\nLook at this problem you say All right uh what are you going to do about it and I said well\nMight we separate the concerns of the air with the concerns or space because these are the same companies aerospace companies that that became a word right\nAnd if you separated out in the military you would then sort of tidy the budgeting for what the needs are and you wouldn't have to compete within under one umbrella for very different needs\nUm at the time on this commission there was a four star air force general\nAnd the air force then and now controls space activities of the military it's called the U.S air force base command and they said we think we got this we don't really need a space force separate from what's already happening so I wasn't going to second guess the general but I was intrigued by that confidence that he had\nFast forward to today on the Trump announcement as well as the pants follow on announcement\nIt if you just listened to it it sounded very very sort of macho look how big my biceps is as I speak\nThat was very we don't want to just be there we want to we don't want to just leave we want to dominate you know there's a lot of this kind of language and that spooked many people typically sort of peace next out there who say oh my gosh what will just mean\nDo you think of that ad thing though I mean if the U.S has supremacy had Gemini over space our aims you know as a western power might be a little more benevolent than seeing the aims of China or Russia or North Korea\nYeah sure I'm just saying one could have said exactly the same thing using slightly different words and it would have been less spooky to people who fear the future of what could happen if you quote militarized space as I was really represent rhetoric not reality reality is\nA space for us what would that mean you would just take all the space activities that are already happening under the air force\nAnd slide them out under one umbrella once with a coherent umbrella\nAnd if you're going to do that uh I I Would throw in you know asteroid defense right why don't you you know put that in your portfolio while you're at it\nThat could be quite devastating to any place on earth where a bad asteroids strikes and then the limit it could render is all extinct\nAs one did sixty five million years ago with the dinosaurs and Seventy percent of all species of life on earth at the time and that asteroid was only six miles across an earth is huge relative to that it's a matter of the energetic and what it does to the climate and the atmosphere\nAnd the long term survivor ability right of of of the by odor that requires the sunlight to feed it so so space force\nWould might include I by the way I Would also throw in on your clean up the debris it's up there while you're asked the space debris problem but so so here's the distinction I Want to make which ... which I don't I haven't seen the press or the public recognize\nSpace it's very hard and not

I think really matters they want to know that you you really care and you're ... you're in it and you're\nYou're you have spirit energy that is spilling out of you that all your whole body mind and soul is ready to be given onto this grand adventure\nThat we're all part taking in and the exploration of space so I think if you convey that uh I don't know if it's a slam dunk but at least it's a um\nIt's a shot from inside the paint [laughter] want to stay in basketball analogy\nJay tweeted which do you think will happen first transplanting a human brain into a machine chassis I eat a robot body transplanting a human consciousness into a computer\nAh so first the human mind is really messed up we have a lot of evolutionary baggage that prevents us from making rational decisions as also we do some very beautiful things are art and music and the sort of thing\nTo put a human brain into a robotic chassis um when you could program the robotic chassis to have almost anything you really care about I don't see that as as as a thing that people will do and the other option is what to put put to to put our consciousness I live in LA\nYeah well we don't really know what consciousness is\nEvidence of that is how many books are still written on it that evidence that usually you don't know what it is for example if you look on the shelf of of books on gravity is like three books we got grabbing\nFor not still writing books on it along to the law you obey gravity so um but it is sort of uploading all of your electro chemical impulses into some machine to mimic that\nTo mirror that maybe that comes along with consciousness we don't know but I see that happening long before we would take a brain and stick it in a in a machine by the way speaking you're translating brain what I really want\nIs if we can't if we can't cure Alzheimer's and we can't cure a O. S.\nAt least find a way to transplant the brain of an average patient into the body of I'm\nSorry the brain of an ale less patient into the body of an Alzheimer's patient and they get a full person out of that because one you you lose the body other you lose your your mind\nIs that this sounds very altered carbon even lost a lot of Netflix that was\nVery Frankenstein to really I I just said if you had goals if you can't otherwise I I bet we'll find tears for both of those before we learn how to transplant a brain but I think about that all the time\nCertainly helps them certainly helps though is on wants to know do you believe in aliens\nThat's not a matter of belief is this there's no evidence for life off the earth yet but we haven't looked very far or very much I'm Jill Tarter is one of my favorite quotes from hers is if you go to the ocean and you stick a class in and your scoop out some water and they analyze water really carefully insect\nThere no whales in the ocean [laughter] looking [laughter]\nBut you haven't looked so we've only taken a tiny scoop out of the galaxy and our search for life\nAre intelligent life uh for example uh um what we think of as intelligent life or any life at all in our backyard or or Mars and perhaps other places but anyone who study the problem is in no way doubts that\nIn the galaxy and the universe is possibly teeming with it\n[noise] Amy asked on our Facebook page will the human race cease to exist in the next thousand years based on the current environmental trends not considering a possible impact from an asteroid or other cosmic influence\nWe're pretty sure that nothing extinction level is headed our way that would take us out in the next thousand years and we know that because\nThe more dangerous an asteroid is the bigger it is typically and the bigger it as the easier it is to detect so so uh I I think we're good about that it's possible that a comic could come from out of nowhere because comments very long period comments\nThey sort of show up you know you don't have history for them and one could come in and take us out\nOr it would be really bad luck to you if that were the case but it I mean regardless you want to help the space program that can deflect these things and so I'm all for\nBuilding you know protecting having insurance plan that you put a little bit of money in for a to protect you against a devastating thing that it would be very rare\nSo but uh otherwise we could easily go a thousand years if we become wise shepherds of our power\nAnd over in nature and we have the warnings are scientists\nI Wonder how what what the over under is on that I tend to be\nFairly hopeful younger people seem to have a very different grasp of the value of the earth that this is the one home we have than many of their parents and and forebears and I kind of guilt today's generation gives me hope for dealing with some of the problems are climate faces but what about you\nYeah I'm hopeful realistically hopeful so but I'm I'm I'm ... I'm\nI'm cynically hopeful so here's how this works cynically hope yes so here so people don't act even when they're warned until it gets really bad and then they act\nSo all these this topic movies that show like look at Blade Runner right the woman ever get to that point this so this ... you know because we reach it or or or soil and green no because you reach a point where people say no this is to this is this I cannot tolerate any further out to eat people\nI don't want a people are so rare that a grid is too hot [laughter] right right so you so you so we have restoring forces in the world\nThat prevent swing too low in in this regard and these this topic story telling 'em it involves a trend that never stops and goes to rock bottom and I've ...
