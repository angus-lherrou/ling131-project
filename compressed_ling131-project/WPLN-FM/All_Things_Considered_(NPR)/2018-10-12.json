Chang and I'm\nMary Louise Kelly this is a war zone and that's how one resident of the Florida Panhandle described the aftermath of hurricane Michael to us today\nWe begin this hour taking stock of the devastation in two towns Appalachia cola and the neighboring town of East Point they're the heart of the Florida we stir industry and they are where NPR's Greg Allen has spent today he is with us now Hey Greg\nI'm Mary Louise so tell me what these two terms look like today\nWhere you know these are this area is somewhat east of where hurricane Michael made landfall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe so when we drove him today might bruise your buddies solving I we didn't see\nThose other communities you know the the trees they're mostly stayed standing which shows that they didn't receive the same high winds so there I think there was tropical storm force winds and the trees withstood it\nHere in Appalachian coal in East Point storm surge was the main ... along highway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed and these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry they're all kinds of businesses were just in rubble some it already taken a hit economically\nBut uh there's not as many there as a war there before the storm we also saw them people who live on highway Ninety eight who were flooded a but this is nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday I took him nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nRight it's it's gotten much better I think throughout the region in this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's affectionate runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns\nAnd it's been damaged in several places and it will be some time before that role will be reopened again because of the storm surge came up and basically just made the concrete buckle under washed them and they have turned out yeah yeah I've watched it ah\nThere's also in that area there's a causeway the links Appalachian coal in East Point together that was damaged now open just single lane but that said there is now a pathway through apple logical or going\nWest it would be toward places like port saint Joe which were really badly affected you have a steady stream of traffic going through with power company trucks your emergency crews and others and the people in a in a Appalachian coal watching these trucks go by saying hey we don't have power but\nThey they know that their neighbors in Mexico beach need even more help so I think they're willing to wait at this point but in the Appalachian coal no power no ... very limited cell service and no outside help yeah\nWell and and I mentioned these two towns are the harder to or Easter industry they've got fishing going on there a lot of fishing and they they were struggling before the storm how might this affect them\nRight I mean ... all the mainstay there but they've had hard times in recent years because of poor water quality and the Gulf\nBut also you know shrimping and fishing or big hear many people moved their boats upriver to a secluded area Heidi hold they call it to keep it out of harm's way and so most votes escaped major damage that's good but some of the seafood restaurants and and wholesalers worked with a lot of damage are working to

American pastor held for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made pastor Brunson case a priority and tweeted today that he will be home soon we don't know yet but it's possible he could be home as soon as tomorrow NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there Hi Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly had been convicted up\nWell he's passed or rent a small church in is mere in western turkey for years and years a but after a turkey had just failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected or enemies and brunch and was caught up in that basically\nHe's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for two Gulen turkey blamed for the coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were based list\nBut he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now and then today in court we had three witnesses who were justified against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge has basically suspended the rest of the sentence\nRemoved restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now\nWell in some ways brunch and was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean\nThere were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who'd been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey and of course turkey wanted the extradition of his clerk for to the Glenn who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you yours or this summer Trump spoke with her to one and reportedly Trump Saudi had an agreement to get brunch released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThen the U.S got tougher they love each sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nUs turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or a good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement to the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that's his that's his church that he was running and turkey\nYeah absolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nThey now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering it thirty five fighter jets to turkey will lay re raised this issue of extradite him declared for to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia hearing stumbles taking up a lot of attention at the moment\nThe Jamal ... case that we've been tracking all of us this week\nDid you mark a showcase right and I think turkey will be at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue off the table\nThanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from Istanbul\nWe can take the next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with ... reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine he\nWas brought to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley ts Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nAnd the trail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freaked does and I noticed that the bag of free throws had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new price of a buck and a half\nAnd I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why or corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one Fritos is owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns ... which makes read it in fact the vending machines got use it in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of their products in the machine got more expensive so we see they would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know\nA luckily there was a second clue a no less to the scene of the crime\nTo our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nAdjusted to offset increases we received in product costs from manufacturers so present with wholesale cost the Fritos have gone up when they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things that are free to there's there's corn\nHow naive to think that's all that kind of afraid of is Carolyn Dimitri isn't applied economist at NYU who specializes in suits daddy's she says the price of a processed food like free does\nHas almost nothing to do with well food prices kill is much bigger part of the cost of the food like free does is and things like labor and rent and transportation because trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers\nTo keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks in the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more we just\nWow and so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma ... capital markets and MIT analyzes food companies including Pepsi and another clue about why the price of free does might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about the soft drink companies a lot of them um because the parent has gone up as well\nBecause it like the aluminum cans yeah\nIf the U.S is not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer has to compete as much with overseas aluminum suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices\nAbove the company's Mitt looked at coke and Pepsi were a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs see maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset is more expensive can but they can't really do that right now still though to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what sex\nTracking is growing category unlike many of the other categories and bad allow companies that make that potentially more pricing power\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so there it is trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks at your best guess for why you're Fritos went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying\nIt's not as satisfying as the bag or Fritos I'm going to go get right now [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter] [noise] that's good for him [noise] [laughter]\nThat was NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley meeting with safety Danny Smith and Cardiff Garcia our co host of the pie catch the indicator from Planet Money\nMoney comes from transfer why a service that helps people send money internationally three million people and businesses used transfer wise to send or receive and convert currencies and more than Seventy countries\nMore transfer wise dot com or from their ass\nThis is all Fritos considered from NPR News\nBattleground academy a Williamson county independent private K. through twelve school is hosting open health events were guests can see why families gyms be Ga to ignite and nurture their child's curiosity intellect and character\nThe lower school open houses Wednesday October twenty fourth and the upper and middle school open houses something October twenty eight registration is available at battleground academy daughter word financial aid available [noise]\nAnd parents garden Ira thank you thank you turns out that the two Russian operatives behind the u._k. nerve agent attacks have their identities blown by a team of Internet researchers NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has the story of who they are and how they get it\nOkay so here's the one thing you need to know for this story everything is on the Internet\nA premise is that there is no to the conclusion of the the Russians face was ... some ...\nBack in September of British authorities held a press conference they released passport photo said names used by two men and they believe tried to kill a former Russian spy with nerve agent\nIs likely so they were traveling underwriters as the ...\nTo a guy like Eric told her that sounded like a challenge\nTowler works for a group called spelling kept\nHis job is so unusual even he doesn't know how to describe it something like digital researcher digital investigator digital something probably works tolerant as friends are very very good at finding all kinds of things on line\nThey've used commercial satellite images to track Chinese air bases watch security operations unfold on social media in Venezuela\nPinpointed the locations of chemical weapons attack in Syria the true identity of a Russian spy\nIt's tough because this guy's you know military intelligence officer so it's not going to be easy to find this guy just on Facebook but\nRemember everything is on the Internet these days including photos of a military academy that trains intelligence officers taken by Russian tourists [noise]\nWhen you look at these photos on there on our on our website and it's just a bunch of Russia and just random Russian guys going through and kind of fight saying at this like military academy\nThese tourists visit the academy and one thing they like photographing is it's wall of fame with pictures of notable graduates\nThis was a year before the poisoning some totally random innocuous normal Russian person up let a photo shows are boy ...

we're going to go to ESPN Nick DiPaolo who covers the athletic she industry he joined us from Portland, Oregon hey hey how's it going that good so why\nDon't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been what Twenty years since there last basketball she wouldn't\nYeah so they had it for a Ninety eight and it was very short lived they aren't just one clear and been quarter\nAnd yoga broker after two years and so they've been out to a game for about Twenty years now but when I think when you look at basketball basketball's always have the elements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really hasn't so I'll come with a big part of the appeal\nWith typing in with the players today that are young and trend setting and exciting and also\nI think for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark their basketball's really a big gateway in terms of being a global brand as well\nBut how to pull do they have now to get a big name behind him because I'm thinking like Nike and Adidas they were able to attract people like Michael Jordan and LeBron James is who may even in a position to be going after a name like that right now\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdle for any newcomer yeah\nUm you know I I did a lot of research last year and like you had about ... percent of the week wearing their shoes was loud oh okay step in and combat that is pretty common but okay [laughter] yeah you have they do have a huge budget allowing for corporate standpoint and they saw on\nThe top Fifteen draft picks this year along with it all started about ... cousin so you know in terms of offers they've been extremely aggressive and that's that's a big part of how they are looking to make

some ways how these players act off the court on social media when it comes to promoting issue brand name what they do on the court\nYeah that's a huge component of it I think you know as you look at all the stuff\nIn terms of high school kids are watching less and less of a ... through our game and they're really kind of emergency and more on what these guys are doing away from the game and listening to highlight butter ... things like that but I looked up the other day and out of the nine guys the coolest aren't\nThey have six and a half million combined followers on Instagram so that's wow this huge me as the brand just starting out you know I think the brand itself is only a couple of hundred thousand followers and so\nThey're really winning in on their players counts and ethical big part of their strategy with their news that\nThey don't want that look just like a standard basketball shoe they're trying to create stuff that maybe has a little more lifestyle to it that guys

from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I don't fit Chang early this morning there was news from the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl\nWorld has been under tremendous pressure to resign since a report this summer detailed the abuse of more than three hundred children in Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld was accused of mishandling several cases and obese well at the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades and in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that scathing horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro birds state lawmakers to eliminate\nI on sexual abuse prosecutions he's on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I'm gonna ask you about your reaction to liberals recognition what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWhat cardinal worlds resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse I actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church\nI think what's missing here though is an acknowledgement by the Vatican on the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania\nAnd then bishop ... role in it\nNow I'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their preference but I I Do not think that the people have Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up\nShould face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop world played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for a changing the current statute of limitations view you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living every\nSingle one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nWith his back to completely in eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the case becomes to prove witnesses pass away memories fade evidence credit stale does any of that concern you as a lawyer\nOf course but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when a number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred from bringing a case especially when the data clearly shows the children who are abused\nOften don't come forward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turned fifty\nTwo fifty two and yet the law here in Pennsylvania says that we couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty and so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take that much time for someone to come forward we shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nWhat your officers report laid bare is how a large institution in this instance the Catholic Church but there's so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up sexual abuse and to protect abusers\nDoes revising the statute of limitations get it that when it actually increase the accountability internally at these institutions\nYou hit the nail on the head so much of this is about an institution in this case the Catholic Church arguably the most powerful institution in the world constantly and consistently putting its own reputation above the needs of the people they were there to serve in this case children I think\nThere is our reckoning going on in this country right now about how we are going to or how much we are willing to\nWell and I think you're seeing across this country with all that's going on with the me too movement the Kavanaugh hearings and The Cosby trial is is you're seeing more and more people stepping up and being willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and law enforcement\nPlays a unique in critical role in that process that's what we're doing here in Pennsylvania\nJosh Shapiro is Pennsylvania state attorney general thank you very much for joining us\nThank you [noise] some of the last secrets from the Watergate scandal may soon

their lawyer is Larry ...\nIs relevant historians it's relevant to the intrinsic ongoing interest in Watergate that alone would be sufficient to justify releasing this material but there's real urgency in this instance to getting the road map on to the public\nRecord urgency because another special counsel is on the job now investigating the Trump campaign and one of the big questions about

situation NPR's Jackie Northam thanks so much things\nMatter with President Trump has stepped up his attacks on the Federal Reserve this week after stock prices plunged Trump ripped into the fed for raising interest rates which it's been doing for the last few years I think the fed has gone crazy\nI think the fed is out of control I think what they're doing is wrong\nAll right for some perspective on this we're joined by someone who worked at the fed for forty years until twenty ten Don ... was vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today thank you for having me here also\nSo how usual is it for a president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this\nBeen very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush the president and its ministry shouldn't often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy that maybe didn't call the fed crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it [noise] but\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve and for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known private lead to the chair and other members other decision makers\nBut not with this public pressure\nOkay so up until now fed officials had been defending the fed is from the president's attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fad Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes still does have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these re\nI think it's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing and a democratic society the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself\nOr with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always and the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing\nDo you think then at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed manages the economy could the president said how sway the fed to slow down the rate hikes\nUh no I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident that it will continue to do the right thing based on economic analysis using information\nUsing the institutions well insulated from the political wins the president's attacks could be sending or\nI think it's very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps up to this attacks and others drawing him and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation\nSo I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing but it is a deliberate\nNonpartisan institution that's acting in their best interests like you're a little concerned that maybe Trump's rhetoric could be affecting that trust among the man I think it could overtime German power she says has worn out the carpets on Capitol Hill\nTrying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve's oversight group why they're doing what they're doing and I think that's\nAs well as explaining to the American people and I think that's the basic insulation for the Federal Reserve from political pressure is understanding\nThat's Donald come the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve board of governors thank you so much for coming in today

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly today in Turkey a court ordered the release of an American pastor held for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made it pastor Brunson case a priority men Brunson is expected to be in Washington by tomorrow President Trump told reporters this afternoon that Brunson will visit the White House likely tomorrow as well NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there\nHi Mary Louise so where am I mean why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly he been convicted up\nWell he's pastor ran a small church in is mere in western turkey for years and years a but after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected or enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically\nHe's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for two Gulen turkey blames the coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses you would testify against him suddenly changing their earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that incensed a little over three years in jail but then the judge has basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now\nWell in some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean\nThere were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who'd been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey and of course turkey wanted the extradition of his clerk for two ... who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from point a sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you yours or this summer Trump spoke with her to one and reportedly Trump Saudi had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThan the u._s. got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement to the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that's his that's his church that he was running and turkey\nAbsolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation they now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering at thirty five fighter just to turkey\nThe clerics are to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things possible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia hearing the stumbles taking up a lot of attention at the moment\nThe ... case that we've been tracking all of us this week\nThe democracy Yogi case right and I think turkey will be at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue\nOff the table thanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from Istanbul\nWe can take the next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with ten rules reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine he\nWas brought to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley ts Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nAnd the trail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freak does\nAnd I noticed that the bag or free throws gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new price of a buck and a half and I had just written but corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why or corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one free does is owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns ... which makes ... in fact the vending machine Scott uses in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see they would not comment they declined to comment okay find\nOut things I Know a luckily there was a second clue a no less to the scene of the crime\nTo our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nAdjusted\nTo offset increases we received in product costs from manufacturers so there's always a wholesale cost of the free does have gone up and they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things that are free to there's there's corn\nAnd salt whoa how naive to think that's how ... is Carolyn Dimitri isn't applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies she says the price of a processed food like free does\nHas almost nothing to do with well food prices killed is a much bigger part of the cost of the food like Fritos is and things like labor and rent and transportation because trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers\nTo keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive

hunch we called him ... Sharma ... capital markets andme it analyzes food companies including Pepsi and he has another clue about why the price of free does might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about the soft drink companies a lot of them um because of the parent has gone up as well\nBecause of like the aluminum cans yeah\nIf the U.S is not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer have to compete as much with overseas aluminum suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices of all the companies Mitt looked at coke and Pepsi\nSee maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset is more expensive can but they can't really do that right now stale so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what snacks\nTracking is growing category unlike many of the author food categories and bad allow companies that make that potentially more pricing power\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so there it is trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks as a best guess for why you're free does went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying\nIt's not as satisfying as the bag or Fritos I'm gonna go get right now [laughter]\n[noise] [laughter] [noise] that's good for him [noise] that\nWas NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley meeting with Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia our co host of the pie catch the indicator from Planet Money\nFor Planet Money comes from the transfer why a service that helps people send money internationally three million people and businesses use transfer wise to send receive and convert currencies and more than Seventy countries\nMore transfer wise dot com or from their ass\nThis is all Fritos considered from NPR News for a man\nFacing prostate cancer the ideal approach takes into account not only has cancer but also his concerns about quality of life\nProstate cancer often grow slowly so most men have time to consider all their options carefully\nVanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center offers a full range of approaches from active surveillance to robotic surgery to targeted radiation therapy that for some patients can be done in as few as one to five days as a result ... team offers a personalized plan of action more information is that Vanderbilt prostate cancer dot com\nOkay so here's the one thing you need to know for this story everything is on the Internet\nA premise is that there is no ... and other than the Russians face was ... for the attempted murder\nBack in September of British authorities held a press conference they released passport photo said names used by two men and they believe tried to kill a former Russian spy with nerve agent\nIs likely so they would ... says ...\nTo a guy like Eric polar that sounded like a challenge towler works for a group called ballot and kept\nHis job is so unusual even he doesn't know how to describe it something like digital researcher digital investigator digital something probably works polar and his friends are very very good at finding all kinds of things on line\nThey've used commercial satellite images to track Chinese air bases watch security operations ... fold on social media in Venezuela\nPinpointed the locations of chemical weapons attacks in Syria the true identity of a Russian spy\nIt's tough because this guy's you know military intelligence officer so it's not going to be easy to find this guy just on Facebook but\nRemember everything is on the Internet these days including photos of a military academy the trains intelligence officers taken by Russian tourists [noise] when you look at\nThese photos on there on our on our website and it's just a bunch of Russia and just random Russian guys going through in kind of fight saying at this military academy\nThese tourists visit the academy and one thing they liked photographing is it's wall of fame with pictures of notable graduates\nThis was a year before the poisoning some totally random innocuous normal Russian person ... shows are boy ...

these researchers believe is on the Internet you just have to know how to look Geoff Brumfiel NPR News Washington rainy rainy goes\n[noise] something new to the imagination and you have your listening to all things considered from NPR News\nWhen they knew an NBA season ... next week a relatively new comer is going to be hitting the court\nNot a player as she is right the athletic Rand Paul Knight is stepping back into the basketball shoe business with an updated version of its Nineteen Seventy three classic Clyde\nAnd it was a shoo them meet famous by New York Knicks great walk Clyde Frasier and to hear all about this come back we're going to go to ESPN Nick DiPaolo who covers the athletics you industry he joined us from Portland, Oregon hey hey how's it going there good so why\nDon't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been what Twenty years since there last basketball she went him\nYeah so they had it for a in Ninety eight and it was very short lived they sign just one clear and been quarter\nAnd yoga broker after two years and so they've been out the game for about Twenty years now but when I think when you look at basketball basketball's always had these\nElements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really has been so ... that's a big part of the appeal what's happening in with the players are today that are young and trend setting and exciting and also it's a complex thing for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark their\nBasketball's really a big gateway in terms of being a global brand as well\nBut how do they have now to get a big name behind him because I'm thinking like Nike and Adidas they were able to attract people like Michael Jordan and LeBron James is who may even in a position to be going after a name like that right now\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdle for any newcomer yeah um you know I I did a lot of research last year like you had about sixty percent of the week wearing their shoes lassie loud oh okay step in and combat that is pretty tough but okay [laughter] yeah you have they do have a huge budget an allowance for corporate standpoint and they signed\nSix of the talk Fifteen draft picks this year along with a darn what end workers cousin so you know in terms of offers they've been extremely aggressive and that's that's a big part of how they are looking to make their imprint back\nHow big of a gamble is this for a company like ... like you said the markets already pretty saturated is is a long shot to get back into the basketball she business\nIt's incredibly aggressive um the bigger the bigger hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been not as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have\nIt's really tough to say how these guys will pan out man there's so many cases of guys that were drafted high that\nYou know we're bus that didn't pan out and so I think one thing they're really doing is is relying on social media she's gotten a chance to check out hoops on Instagram they are unlike any other brand and it's kind of wild wild west and they'll post whatever then it's very on corporate life but I think people if they could do that and MIT's meta kind of fun\nYou see the wild wild west is it more important in some ways how these players act off the court on social media when it comes to promoting issue brand name what they do on the court yeah that's\nIn terms of high school kids they're watching less and less of an old through our game and they're really cut immersed in more than what these guys are doing away from the game and and there's the highlights on everything like that but I looked up the other day and out of the nine guys up 'til the sun\nThey have six and a half million combined followers on Instagram so that's wow this huge me as the brand is starting out you know I think the brand itself is only about a couple of hundred thousand followers and so\nThey're really winning in on their players counts in a big part of their strategy with their news that they don't want that look just like a standard basketball shoe they're trying to create stuff that maybe has a little more lifestyle to it that guys can be showcasing in different ways on their own pages and so that's going to be a huge push for sure\n... covers the athletic she industry for ESPN takes so much Nick start this\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News you're listening to Ninety point three WPN

Reserve this week after stock prices plunged Trump ripped into the fed for raising interest rates which it's been doing for the last few years I think the fed and it's gone crazy I think\nThe fed is out of control what they're doing is wrong\nAll right for some perspective on this we're joined by someone who worked at the fed for forty years until twenty ten ... was vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today thank you for having me here also\nSo how usual is it for the president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this it's\nBeen very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush to president and its ministry shouldn't often for his displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy but maybe didn't call the fed crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like who's rhetoric does it [noise] but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve on for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known private lead to the chair and other members other decision makers but not with this public pressure\nOkay so up until now fed officials had been defending the fed from the president's attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fad Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes so does Evans have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these rate I\nIt's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve\nHas to be able to defend itself or with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always and the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing\nDo you think then at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed manages the economy could the president and how sway the fed to slow down the rate hikes [noise]\nUh no I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident\nThat it will continue to do the right thing based on economic analysis using them for ... you think the institutions well insulated from the political wins the president's attacks could be sending where I think it's very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps up says attacks\nAnd others drawing him and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation\nSo I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing but it is a deliberate\nNonpartisan institution that's acting in their best interests like you're a little concerned that maybe Trump's rhetoric could be affecting that trust among the man I think it could overtime German power she says has worn out the carpets on Capitol Hill\nTrying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve's oversight group why they're doing what they're doing and I think that's\nAs well as explaining to the American people and I think that's the basic insulation\nFor the Federal Reserve from political pressure is understanding\nThat's Donald come the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve board of governors thank you so much for coming in today You're welcome also thank you for having me on [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nMad Men creator Matthew Weiner is
