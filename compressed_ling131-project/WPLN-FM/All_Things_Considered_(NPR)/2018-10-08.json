boost\nAll over the country of rallies and people are loving that man and loving that George\nWill have more on how the political battle over canonize affecting the mid term elections in a bit but first let's go to NPR's Scott Horsley have got to get a picture of how Kavanaugh's presence on the ...\nFew decades potentially\nHe will certainly shift according to the right remember he was chosen from a list of judicial candidates drawn up by the federalist society and the Heritage Foundation a list of reliable conservative and that's something you couldn't always say about the justice she'll be replacing Anthony Kennedy\nKennedy of course was a Reagan appointee and generally conservative but he occasionally did side with the liberal wing of the court\nMost famously on a string of gay rights cases but also for example in reaffirming the right to abortion\nKavanaugh is expected to be much more conservative than Kennedy and that leaves chief justice John Roberts now as the pivot point on the court to yeah that's right [laughter] it'll be up to Robert to decide how much judicial restraint to exercise and then that will determine whether this\nShift is a gradual series of right words steps or one big leap\nDo you think the very bitter confirmation fight we saw over the last several weeks has damaged the course reputation as a political body\nIt it certainly has the possibility to do that now we're going to have five conservative justices all appointed by Republican presidents four liberal justices all appointed by Democrats and\nTo the extent their decisions divvy up along those partisan lines the court runs the risk of being seen as just another political branch of government staffed by partisans in robes rather than a an impartial body that somehow above politics\nAnd it certainly doesn't help the Kavanaugh is confirmed by that extremely narrow vote with just one Republican one Democrat breaking ranks and the Senate also listen to how President Trump described the campaign against Kavanaugh today was a disgraceful situation\nBrought about by people that are evils any toughed it out we'll tufted out together and I have to think the\nRepublican senators that fought so hard for this because it was an easy so you have the president they're talking about this in very partisan terms his press secretary Sarah Sanders also tweeted over the weekend that instead of six three liberal Supreme Court under Hillary Clinton we now have a five for conservative court under President Trump that's\nCertainly true enough but it doesn't

about always winning the November election could be the first time he's a loser or not Mara Liasson NPR News\nWe may not know what's gonna happen in the November midterms but we do know one thing Taylor Swift is voting Democrat\nIn a lengthy social media posts on Sunday the pop superstar explained why she would be supporting Democrats filled bread is in for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house she also slammed Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn for her record on women's and algae beach he writes\nAnd all this from an artist who has famously refused to talk politics in the past\nWe reached Emily ... of the Washington Post who's been following all of this welcome Hi so how earth shattering is is that the Taylor Swift makes them political endorsement\n[noise] honestly in an area where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore it really is to tell me why to shock yeah so I think it surprised me and a lot of people because after the last two years there has kind of ban\nIt steady drumbeat to get Taylor Swift to sort of say anything political anything about the current environment and she never has and then all of a sudden Sunday she drops his Instagram posted that really lengthy almost like a scorched earth a post about how she really feels about the upcoming\nMid terms and I was just not expecting that what's the response been like from her fans [noise]\nI've seen a lot of support from people who've are honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people yeah really look up to her so there's a lot of support there's also of course\nThere's kind of this movement that has always thought maybe she was secretly a conservative just because she never said anything so\nThey kind of had to read into a lot of things she had never even said that there is some disappointment on that side today well\nYou tell us with did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now still does have a broader fan base kind of free her to take more left leaning political positions now I think it\nIn some ways because when she made the break from Nashville in kind of declared herself going to the pop world she didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drives so much of the country\nRadio and she'd have this broader audience I feel like it may have trapped her a little bit in the way that because she still has this country than she did still want you to appeal to them but I think she probably didn't feel more free overalls to share opinions you\nKnow she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to cure eating her image so what do you think why jumped into politics now what do you think is going on with her\nAnd since I've been trained as the mystery of the day\nAnd I always had denied her mind for me to read\nBack Taylor Swift always seems to be like twenty steps ahead of everyone else no matter what she does everything kind of had like a double or triple meaning when you really look at it\nI think in this case the timing probably was pretty strategic she just wrapped up her stadium tour in the United states you know she's done with their concert she doesn't need to think about the backlash for any of that so she\nPosted her message after this she kind of alluded in her statement to events that have happened to her in the last couple of years and that's why she was speaking out\nAnd like she didn't say with those were um I think a big one that's impacted her the most with her sexual assault trial when a country music DJ sued her after he lost his job because she said he groped her in a meet and greet line\nWhen she counters sued him for assault and battery and she ended up winning and I think that experience really really left a mark on her\n[noise] Emily yard is an entertainment reporter for the Washington Post thanks very much for

launch the silk called supervised injection sites as Bobby Allyn of member station WHYY reports Trump ... officials are watching and promising crackdown\nEarlier this year officials in Philadelphia have been studying the idea of the supervised injection site where those struggling with addiction bring their own drugs and use under the watch of medical professionals the creation of the nonprofit called safe house is the most\nOne of the most prominent board members of the group is former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell\nTwelve hundred and Seventy Philadelphians of overdoses most of them die alone in your twenties Seventy so highest rate per capita of any big city in America we've got to do something to stop in\nOther cities grappling with the opioid crisis including New York Seattle in San Francisco are considering opening a supervised injection sites but I haven't done so yet California Governor Jerry Brown recently vetoed a law that would help open one saying it would enable illegal drug use\nIts opposition shared by deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein who told NPR in August that the Justice Department will not tolerate the opening of a supervised injection site in Philadelphia\nRemains illegal under federal law and people who engage in that activity remains vulnerable to civil and criminal enforcement\nMeasurements Rosenstein um incorporate or of the safe injection site nonprofit an incumbent arrest me first\nRun del says his brazen position takes him back in time to the early Nineteen nineties when he was mayor and welcome Philadelphia's first clean needle exchange during the AIDS crisis but offering clean needles to drug users is one thing inviting them into a building to use illegal opioids is a different matter entirely\nRound the gold find with the AIDS project of Pennsylvania is another board member of safe house the new nonprofit she agrees that it's a controversial idea but the model has saved lives in Canada in Europe\nThe idea is if today we can prevent that fatal overdoses and we can build that relationship of trust then maybe tomorrow or even later today we can encourage that person to get into treatment\nAlthough city officials are not directly involved with the nonprofit Philadelphia's mayor and district attorney support putting the site in Kensington the heart of the city's opioid problem the nonprofit has already raised two hundred thousand dollars but the city council woman whose district includes Kensington Maria Keanu Sanchez\nIs still on the fence\nTo reform via tire treatment service component

next to a stop it in our way back yard and [noise] anywhere or safe house officials won't say yet when they hope to open their doors but one thing is clear they say is getting people like ray\nOff the

use of this software\nYes there has been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system\nWhereas older technology would do really quite well with well controlled facial images when illumination is good and the viewpoint is frontal\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy facial expression or that you know change in age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better at the task you know one recurring\nIssue though we keep seeing is facial recognition technology that miss identifies people of color much more frequently than it missed identifies white people uh there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as ...\nI'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistakes like that\nHappen [noise] yeah this is a really excellent point the current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically\nMany many images of a particular person and an accurate label and so you get what's out there and what's out there may not be equally representative of different races\nSo you're saying there are just a lot more photos of white people in the databases these pieces of software read that's exactly right so how do you solve this problem technologically how do you make the Web I guess less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people of color yes oh\nThe answer to the question technologically is quite simple if you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make the Web on race bias that's a harder question\nSo even when facial recognition software does work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could use this technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters\nAs someone who really understands where this science is today how do you think about\nThis um is face recognition technology abused um that's certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse whether or not the potential for abuse of this technology outweighs its utility\nIs something that has to be decided by societies and carefully looking at how it works and making decisions about what the right ways to use the technology are\nAlice O'Toole is head of the face perception research lab at the University of
