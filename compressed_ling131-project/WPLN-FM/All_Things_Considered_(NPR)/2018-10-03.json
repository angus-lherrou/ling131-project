response has been relatively restraint\nThat changed completely last night when President Trump mocked Ford at a rally in Mississippi\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get or don't remember where was the place I don't remember how many years ago\nAnd today in the White House\nRoom press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the president's comments NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has been following the president's response to all of this controversy and she joins us now Hey Daniel hello so as we noted the president's tone it shifted dramatically lasts\nHow his comments last night compared to how he's been talking about Ford up until last night\nSure so late last week after Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary committee Trump had taken a much softer tone towards Christine Blasey Ford\nI vote or just a moment is very good for you\nKnow he seemed to be sort of ... to the line that congressional Republicans seem to be healing to which was something to the effect of Christine Blasey Ford seems credible but you know maybe she's mistaken or I Wish we had more corroborating evidence but a lot of them use that key word credible\nThen last night he got up in front of the crowd and he he was mimicking her and the fact that you know she can't remember every single thing that happened that night so he was really divergent from that line and he was playing it to last and cheers from that audience yeah you can hear the tape yet and so that has people really upset today\nSome how the response has been in the Senate because to get Kavanaugh through Senate Republicans are focusing on two key senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine how either of those two women responded to Trump's comments from last night\nRight well they're not happy or Lisa Murkowski has said her words were that it's inappropriate and unacceptable and that Trump's comments could sway her vote now Susan Collins likewise she told CNN that it was quote just plain wrong what Trump said and she wouldn't say if it would affect her vote\nYou know one thing that has been swirling in the middle of all of this is the fact that Trump has talked about how he actually emphasizes with Kavanaugh because he himself has been accused of sexual assault of sexual misconduct\nAbsolutely he has more than a dozen accusations of misconduct against him and like Brett Kavanaugh Trump is denying all of the allegations against him but that's not the only echo here I mean let's look at how Trump has responded to those allegations likewise\nAnd one of those allegations against Trump Jessica leads that woman who said he had groped her on an airplane decades ago he also mocked her after that allegation came out the quote that he said was she wouldn't be my first choice he likewise said that to a crowd the crowd likewise laughter cheered\nAnd animal emergency Nashville veterinary specialists open twenty four hours a day seven

deal between the U.S Mexico and Canada and months of uncertainty if it's approved by Congress it will spare carmakers from some of the terrorists that they had feared\nAnd we'll send a senior vice president of the motor and equipment Manufacturers Association which represents more than a thousand companies that make auto parts you're in the U.S thanks for joining us here on all things considered thank you very glad to be with you to begin with well you just described for listeners what you remember companies making and where you are in the auto making supply chain\nSo our members make the vast majority of the content for new vehicles and we also manufacture parts and components for maintenance and repair\nAnd how much was on the line for you in this trade agreement where you're holding your breath to see what the details would be\nWell our industry has actually done quite well entered after we've actually been able to grow our supply chain in North America we've been able to grow manufacturing jobs in the United states but it counts in all three countries being part of the agreement\nSo we are very pleased relieved to that all three parties were able to come to an agreement this weekend we're cautiously optimistic that the terms of the agreement will work for the industry and for the American public\nWhen you look at the details of the agreement can you tell how it compares to NAFTA for you\nWell there's going to be an increase in the amount of North American content that will be required\nFor parts to travel through the three countries are going to have to call it the U.S Mexico Canada agreement that traveled through North America without having to pay tariffs there's going to be a requirement for more North American steel and aluminum a so all of that will impact our members\nAnd an education there's going to be some new administrative costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have though are there some new tariffs out there right now on steel and aluminum and we'd like to see Canada and the United states address that before they finalize disagreement in the end of November\nSo on the one hand there won't be terrorists for\nThe other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of concern to your industry have not gone away\nNo they have and I think one of the things we have to mind is ... particular burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S\nAnd some of our members have seen the cost of their steel purchases rise almost fifty percent\nSo this is a significant increase it typically is concerned between Canada and the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up their sleeves used his fame energy they use to conclude this this new NAFTA and be able to come to some kind of agreement on steel and aluminum tariffs\nI Know that there's a lot of relief from the auto industry now that the uncertainty is gone but how does this compare to the old rules under NAFTA isn't an improvement is worse well\nI think for the United states perspective when the things in the United states said little pool through was an increase in the U.S content and for some of our suppliers and some component manufacturers this is going to be a challenge there is no doubt about that\nI Do think that we're going to see more steel moral woman that's from North America and our vehicles\nThe biggest concern our members are going to have the the administrative cost and we're going to have to work really hard with all three parties can minimize those costs because consumers are going to get any value out of it and that's going to be our next a real challenge for as we look for that Greenland\nAnd Wilson is senior vice president of the ... on equipment

New Hampshire a top CDC official bill ... tried to clarify\nThis is not a ... we're not saying that exposures estimated minimal risk levels to be associated with health effects\nHe says the CDC focuses on public health not regulations so it's research could play into new state and federal standards and the future in Julian lanes wealth to pee fast level is lower even than what the CDC says

federal government was so unprepared to carry out the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant families earlier this year that it wasn't even ready to has the children and where did it even had a plan to reunite them with their parents\nThat is from a scathing report from the homeland security department internal watchdog this week\nThe administration has abandoned its policy of separating families to deter illegal immigration but only after widespread outrage and after more than twenty six hundred children were already separated from their parents\nTo talk more about the d._a. chess inspector general's findings were joined by NPR's Joel Rose angel\nHey also said you know we've been hearing all year about the problems with this policy of separating families but what is new in this report that contradicts what we've been hearing from the administration\nWell it contradicts some early assurances that we got from federal officials as this policy was being rolled out here's ... chest secretary cures to Nielsen\nIt is important is that these miners are very well taken care of don't believe that perhaps they are very well taken care\nBut this report paints and much less rosy picture the inspector general found that da jazz held hundreds of migrant children in border patrol facilities well beyond the legal limit of Seventy two hours in fact federal officials held more than eight hundred migrant children for longer than that including one child who was held for twenty five days\nAnd many of these children were held in metal cages in border patrol facilities near the border until the government was able to find space in shelters that are equipped to have children\nAnd as we mentioned many parents and children had trouble finding each other in the system after they were separated\nWell again at the time officials denied that that was a problem remember here's Alex aides are the secretary of health and Human Services speaking it back in June before Congress\nThere is no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located I could with with just basic keystrokes within seconds would find any child in our care for any parent\nH H s by the way cared for children after they were separated while da Jess had custody of their parents and at the time da chest said there was a central database of the locations of parents and their children\nAt Central database did the inspector general find that central database\nThe inspector general found no evidence that there was such a central database the two agencies actually had computer systems that could not communicate with each other and the inspector general found that when distraught parents tried to track down their children the government sometimes gave them inconsistent or just wrong information in some cases parents couldn't communicate with their kids at all\nThen what happened to those families\nThe government was ordered to reunify them by a federal judge and it has reconnect\nBut the inspector general's report says that this lack of communication made that reunification process slower\nAnd the process was especially hard for children who are so young that they couldn't speak immigration authorities according to this report made no effort to identify those young children it anyway no wristbands and no photographs of them were taken so it was only through communication with the parents that that authorities were able to find these children and reunite them\nStill have federal officials responded to the inspector general's report in any way\nWell as the administration often does is blaming quote immigration laws that are broken and poorly written unquote\nPh as does say that it deserves some credit for working quote exhaustively to reunite these families although again they were ordered to do so by a judge but the H. S. also acknowledge that the government's computer system still do not communicate across these agencies ...\nAre there any children still haven't been reunited with their parents\n[noise] oh yeah more than a hundred and thirty remain in us custody apart from their parents mostly because those parents have already been deported without them back to Central America\nAll right That's NPR's Joel Rose thanks very much Joe you're walking [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News [noise] Montana has become a popular campaign stop for President Trump and vice president Pence so popular that each of them has been there twice in recent months\nBecause Republicans are trying to unseat two term democratic Senator Jon tester during ... second visit there yesterday he fired up a rally talking about Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court Montana Public Radio's Eric Whitney reports\nRunning in a state that President Trump won by more than twenty points tester emphasizes that he can work with Trump he's run an ad listing Nineteen bills he supported the Trump is sign so when vice president Pence spoke in Bozeman yesterday he painted tester as a reliable and reflexes member of the Democratic resistance\nThe all the latest allegations of fully investigated Senator Joseph is already a now is voting no unjust fell off just lay voted no one knows where he ...\nHe didn't take a position on Kavanaugh's confirmation until after last week's hearings were over and then came out against Kavanaugh citing first his record on privacy issues and support for the Patriot act\nFor those reasons and all of the reasons that were brought up last week um I made a decision to vote no on judge Kavanaugh I don't think he has the merits nor the a background to\nUh meet the needs of Supreme Court\nRepublican challenger Matt Rosendale says he'd be a more reliable ally for President Trump and cited the Supreme Court vote as an example\nMyself and a lot of people are closest nation or very disturbed with the way this entire process that handled there is a man who has a commendable record and he should be serving on the bench an absolutely I Would vote for him\nOn paper standing firmly with President Trump would appear to be a winning strategy in Montana the population here skews older and wider than the U.S in general Montana also has the second highest population of veterans per capita of any state guys like Jim hunting felt [noise]\nTired after Twenty years in the navy ending felt now volunteers at the airport in Missouri\nFor President Trump is going to mess around with this country we're going to do so then there's no crosses the line I read Laurie we're gonna do it\nWhile heading failed says the hell no didn't vote for President Obama like many Montana voters he isn't easy to pigeon hole he says he's voted for tester before and for Democratic governors Steve bullock in twenty sixteen\nAnd he says a candidate support for the president or testers vote on Kavanaugh's nomination won't sway his choice\nNo because I don't use that as a platform to make my decision\nStill plenty of voters do see their vote as a sign of support for President Trump Bozeman retirees Suzie Burton was at a senior community center yesterday near where vice president Pence was holding his campaign rally\nWell I think a precedent during marvelously actually he keeps his promises and not many of them do\nWhile President Trump is front and center in the Senate race here identity and\nLocal issues also matter for example tester has put Rosendale on the defensive about whether national forest in Montana could be privatized Rosendale initially opposed federal land ownership but says he's now convinced that that's not what people want\nAnd test her leans hard on his image as a third generation farmer Rosendale moved to the state in two thousand two after a career as a Maryland real estate developer voters will be watching closely Saturday as the to debate one last time before early voting starts later this month\nFor NPR News I'm Eric Whitney in Missoula, Montana\nBird\nThis is all things considered from NPR News you're listening to Ninety point three WPN Atlanta three forty eight\nThis traffic report is made possible by the law firm of ...

that I spoke with Monica ... about it earlier today\nLike a lot of journalists probably today had been getting a lot of\nSurvivors wanting to share their stories that sexual assault and what was notable to me is how many of them had a common thread of the one person I've never told if my dad I don't think he could handle this and ...\nSome women said\nI'm afraid to tell my father because I I Know he would kill the men who attacked me and I'm worried he would go to jail some women said I've never seen my father cry and I know that if I told him this would make him cry the someone and did say I'm afraid my father wouldn't believe me and that's that's a whole different strain\nBut a lot of them were really more I think he would believe me but I'm afraid it would just destroy him he thinks it's his job to protect me and he would feel like he failed\nIs it only fathers or are people concerned about telling their mothers as well\n[noise] I did get responses from people concerned about telling their mothers but\nI think often survivors are putting their parents in different categories a lot of when and said I told my mother and learns that she had been a victim to or I told my mother because I thought she would understand what it's like to walk through the world\nAs a young woman and so they they were really afraid that their fathers in particular wouldn't understand on the same level or might feel squeamish or embarrassed to be talking about these kinds of things\nYou write that a lot of ... exist because women don't want to make men on comfortable with lady pain explain what you mean by that\nYou know it just just think about tropes in sitcoms where\nThe dad is sent to buy a pack of ... for his daughters or his wife and it's presented as the most humiliating embarrassing journey to the grocery store that he can never make we do that with ... we do that with breast feeding\nAll of these things that happen on a woman's body are seen as being really embarrassing and inappropriate to talk about and I think that that exist on the spectrum where we're afraid to talk about sexual assault because it falls on this spectrum of gross or uncomfortable things that happen to women [noise]\nCan you tell us about some of the responses that you've had to this call them since it was published this week\n[noise] yeah I've received more than five hundred emails in the past twenty four hours but if you don't mind I'll just I'll read you my my favorite response yup ...\nDeer Monica thank you for sharing these stories I was very moved by them because I'd never even thought of asking those questions\nI shared your call in with my wife for forty years and asked her head this ever happened to her\nAnd she told me a story of herself at ten I just listened and inside I broiled I asked her should I ask my daughters and she said do you think you're ready\nI didn't answer but I'll do it soon not today but the next time I see them right now though I'll have a couple of drinks and I'll think\nI Hope I can be of some comfort semper fi\nWell so I've gotten a lot of emails like that a lot of emails from dads who are good dads they're just really trying to think about what it means to be a good dad\nI've gotten a lot of emails from men who say\nI always told my daughter if anyone tries to hurt you on murder them and now I'm rethinking was that the right message to send because what if that kept her silence because she didn't want me to go to jail for for murdering someone\nUm so I think that these are conversations that have just been happening in secret for really long time\nAnd good men are trying to figure out how to be a part of those conversations and how to be of comfort in them\nAs part of your argument also that it's important for daughters to tell their fathers about this so that they have a better understanding of what women go through\nI think so I really do and a lot of the feedback that I've been getting are women who are talking to their dads for the first\nHearing and that they have enough for hearings because their fathers had said something like I'm really moved by her testimony but I just don't believe it because if it had really happened she would have told her parents when it happened\nAnd it's causing women to say that it happened to me it happened to me three years ago five years ago Twenty years ago and I didn't tell you and here's why I didn't tell you so if you were a father and you have a Simpsons of how a victim should behave\nOr whether someone would or would not have told someone I think it's really meaningful to hear from women in your life that you're close to who have said\nI grew up in your house you love me more than anyone and I never told you and this is why\nMonica ...

information about those buildings and that the appraiser grossly undervalued some of the properties\n... is an investigative reporter for the New York\nIn New York Times story you just heard about says the trumps were able to get away with tax dodging for decades and there's no evidence that state or federal officials ever did much about it\nAs NPR's Jim Zarroli reports regulators were either unwilling to take the trumps on or simply lacked the resources to do so\nReal estate companies such as the Trump families are famous for finding ways to pare down their tax bills and some of them skirt the law they can understate the value of a property they've acquired for instance\nBut NYU law school professor Daniel Shapiro says the sheer scope of the Trump family's tax avoidance puts it in a whole other realm\nI don't think this is just like oh this is tax bonding as usual is one thing to have kind of self serving valuations that are on the ... side this seems to go beyond it\nYet much of what the Trump did apparently went under the radar for years\nThat doesn't surprise pace law school professor Bridget Crawford she says the Internal Revenue service for decades has simply lack the

that gift tax doesn't raise a lot of revenue also to the extent the IRS has resources they are not going to be allocating ... tax enforcement\nThe same is true at the state and local level although New York state officials are now investigating the Trump families taxes Crawford says it's taken them far too long to do so\nThat cares to me that the state department of finance has been utterly asleep at the wheel for decades when it comes to a transactions allowing the Trump family\nCrawford notes that questions have been raised about the Trump families taxes for years pro public eye has reported that President Trump sold to Manhattan condos to his son Eric for much less than they were worth twenty sixteen\nBut because Trump hasn't released his tax returns it's impossible to say whether Eric Trump paid federal gift taxes as he was required to do but the extent of the activity alleged in yesterday's times story is harder to ignore\nThe question is what regulators can do about it and why use Dan Shapiro says if fraud was committed it's probably too late for the government to pursue a criminal case because of the statute of limitations\nBut severe says the IRS can always decided to take another look at the Trump returns\nFraud on or turn means that it's never too late to revisit it\nIf the IRS find evidence of wrongdoing severe as it can retroactively force Fred

talking about Ford up until last night\nSure so late last week after Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary committee Trump had taken a much softer tone towards Christine Blasey Ford\nVoter testimony was very compelling and she was like a woman\nNow he seemed to be sort of ... to the line that congressional Republicans seemed to be healing to which was something to the effect of Christine Blasey Ford seems credible you know maybe she's mistaken or I Wish we had more corroborating evidence but a lot of them use that key word credible\nThen last night he got up in front of the crowd and he he was mimicking her and the fact that you know she can't remember every single thing that happened that night so he was really ...\nTo laugh and cheers from that audience yeah you can hear the tape and so that has people really upset today\nSome how the response has been in the Senate because to get Kavanaugh through Senate Republicans are focusing on two key senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine how either of those two women responded to Trump's comments from last night\nRight well they're not happy or Lisa Murkowski has said her words were that it's inappropriate and unacceptable and that Trump's comments could sway her vote now Susan Collins likewise she told CNN that it was quote just plain wrong what Trump said and she wouldn't say if it would affect her vote\nYou know one thing that has been swirling in the middle of all of this is the fact that Trump has talked about how he actually emphasizes with Kavanaugh because he himself has been accused of sexual assault of sexual misconduct\nAbsolutely he has more than a dozen accusations of misconduct against him and\nLike Brett Kavanaugh Trump is denying all of the allegations against him\nBut that's not the only echo here I mean let's look at how Trump has responded to those allegations likewise and one of those allegations against Trump

would be\nWell our industry has actually done quite well under NAFTA we've actually been able to grow our supply chain in North America we've been able to grow manufacturing jobs in the United states but it counts and all three countries being part of the agreement\nSo we are very pleased relieved to that all three parties were able to come to an agreement this weekend we're cautiously optimistic that the terms of the agreement will work for the industry and for the American public\nWhen you look at the details of the agreement can you tell how it compares to NAFTA for you\nWell there's going to be an increase in the amount of North American content that will be required\nFor parts to travel through the three countries can act to call it the U.S Mexico Canada agreement but traveled through North America without having to pay tariffs there's going to be a requirement for more North American steel and aluminum a so all of that will impact our members\nAnd then the Jewish and there's going to be some new administrative costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have though are there some new tariffs out there right now on steel and aluminum and we'd like to see Canada and the United states address that before they finalized disagreement in the end of November\nSo on the one hand there won't be terrorists for material crossing Canada U.S Mexico border is on the other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of concern to your industry they're not going away\nNo they have and I think one of the things we have to keep the mind as ... particular burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S\nAnd some of our members just seen the cost of their steel purchases rise almost fifty percent so this is ... ... increase it's typically of concern between Canada and the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up their sleeves used his fame energy they use to conclude this this new NAFTA\nAnd be able to come to some kind of agreement on steel and aluminum tariffs\nI Know that there's a lot of relief from the auto industry now that the uncertainty is gone but how does this compare to the old rules under ...\nI think for the United states perspective one of the things in the United states said little pool through was that increase in the U.S content and for some of our suppliers or some component manufacturers this is going to be a challenge there is no doubt about that\nI Do think that we're going to see more steel moral woman that's from North America in our vehicles\nThe biggest concern our members are going to have the the administrators cost and we're gonna have to work really hard with all three parties can minimize those costs because consumers are going to get any value

S.\nStill do not communicate across these agencies ... are there any children still haven't been reunited with their parents [noise] oh yeah more than a hundred and thirty remain in us custody apart

Kavanaugh's confirmation until after last week's hearings were over and then came out against Kavanaugh citing first his record on privacy issues in support for the Patriot act\nFor those reasons and all of the reasons that were brought up last week um I made a decision to vote no on judge Kavanaugh I don't think he has the merits nor the background to\nUh meet the needs of Supreme

by attacking the New York times and saying that the IRS looked at these arrangements as they were happening and found nothing improper how do you respond to that well\nWe think that's not true um we know there are cases where there was no audit done like all county building that we spoke about another transaction Trump Palace and then the cases where there were audits there's evidence that the trumps didn't give the IRS all the pertinent information about those buildings and that the appraiser\nGrossly undervalued some of the properties\n... is an investigative reporter for the New York times thanks for joining us today\nThanks for having me Ari in New York Times story you just heard it said that Trump's were able to get away with tax dodging for decades and there's no evidence that state or federal officials ever did much about it\nAnd then the ice Jim Zarroli reports regulators where either unwilling to take the Trump on orders lacked the resources to do sell\nReal estate companies such as the Trump families are famous for finding ways to pare down their tax bills and some of them skirt the law they can understate the value of a property they've acquired for instance\nBut NYU law school professor Daniel Shapiro says the sheer scope of the Trump family's tax avoidance puts it in a whole\nOther realm I don't think this is just\nTo have kind of self serving valuations that are on the global side but it seems to go beyond it\nYet much of what the Trump did apparently went under the radar for years\nThat doesn't surprise pace law school professor Bridget

cases\nWhere there's a will there's a way and there has been no\nOnly one in a hundred tax returns is now audited and Crawford says it's especially easy to do what Fred Trump is alleged to have done

enforcement\nThe same is true at the state and local level although New York state officials are now investigating the Trump families taxes Crawford says it's taken them far too long to do so\nThat appears to me that the state department of finance has been utterly asleep at the wheel for decades [laughter] when it comes to a transaction some on the Trump family\nCrawford notes that questions have been raised about the Trump families taxes for years for public eye has reported that President Trump sold to Manhattan condos to his son Eric for much less than they were worth twenty sixteen\nBut because Trump hasn't released his tax returns it's impossible to say whether Trump paid federal gift taxes as he was required to do but the extent of the activity alleged in yesterday's times story is harder to ignore\nThe question is what regulators can do about it and why use Dan Shapiro says if fraud was committed it's probably too late for the government to pursue a criminal case because of the statute of limitations\nBut severe says the IRS can always decided to take another look at the Trump returns\nFraud on her return means that it's never too late to revisit it\nIf the
