F. A. S. and they're linked to a number of illnesses including cancer the Trump Administration is working on a plane to regulate them some in Congress are pressing for it to move faster NPR's Jeff Brady has been looking into this and joins us now Hi Jeff Hi Ari first of all what are these chemicals\nA pie fast it's an entire group of several thousand manmade chemicals in some of them had been around for decades these chemicals are good at ... oil and water and that makes them really useful for all sorts of products like nonstop cookware coating on fast food rappers pizza boxes\nAnd the places where Pete passes are used in manufacturing those are generally the places that are the most polluted or there's some sites in New York North Carolina Michigan just to name a few places\n... also are in firefighting phone used at airports and military bases in some cases around the country the chemicals have migrated into local drinking water and the estimates on exactly how many people are affected very but it's safe to say that the numbers in the millions\nHow harmful to people can these chemicals be what kinds of problems that cause\nThe research is limited so it's hard to pin down exactly how harmful these chemicals are a scientist will say he passes are linked to certain illnesses here's Laurel ... she's a research scientist with an advocacy group called the Silent Spring Institute\nPiece chemicals have been linked to a wide range of health effects including cancer\nLow birth weight\nThyroid disease elevated cholesterol and effects\nOn the immune system\nManufacturers have agreed to stop using two forms of pee fast in the U.

requires most water utilities to test for a list of ... passes in and twenty sixteen agency lowered a non binding health advisory limit for some ... chemicals it's now Seventy parts per trillion I'm told that it's about Seventy grains of sand and an Olympic size swimming pool\nAnd some environmental advocates argue level should be even lower than that\nBut all this uncertainty it creates confusion especially for water companies like aqua America it's based in suburban Philadelphia Christopher Crockett is the chief environmental officer there and he says companies like his needs clearer direction from the EPA and from policymakers\nTo be able to explain to the public and my above or below sea level here and do we need to put treatment on in this community and how soon and that still needs to be determined and that and he's\nIs working on a plan to manage pee fast chemicals the agency just wrapped up a series of public meetings around the country the plan is expected by the end of the year\nThe Trump Administration has been so staunchly anti regulation especially rolling back protections meant to keep people safe from environmental contaminants why are they responding differently to this\nAn issue like this it really fits in with the way the Trump Administration has tried to narrow the focus of the EPA away from things like climate change and toward issues such as clean air and clean water\nAlso we should keep in mind that the EPA still working on his plan to manage pretty fast chemicals and we don't know what that plan is going to look like until it's out some time in the next few months\nSo what could people do to protect themselves today\nWell the water utility aqua that we heard from just a minute ago they've installed these big carbon filters to bring the levels down and that works the utility says the water is safe to drink\nIf you're still worried about it those filters that you get in a refrigerator or water pitchers

empty warehouse blindfolded and he's assembling an A R Fifteen style rifle and the while he's doing he's talking about gun rights and he says he supports gun supports gun rights but he also support background checks\nHe says to keep terrorists from getting one of these and then the gun is assembled and he takes off the blindfold and he says\nI'd like to see something to do this\nAnd the ad got in national attention he later had a best selling book about lessons from politics and the military he was even mentioned as a possible democratic presidential candidate in twenty twenty so really it seemed like a rising politician of the Democratic party\nAnd his decision today to part of the race came as a surprise and I came with a very honest and emotional letter message a tell us about it\nRight it was just hours ago candor posted a statement that he was tired of denying that he had a problem that he'd been ... that he had symptoms of PATS de had nightmares and you've been suffering from depression and he'd felt changed ever since he came back from Afghanistan eleven years ago um\nHe said that when he should have been celebrating for example a having a raised a record amount of funds in his mayoral campaign he was actually in a in crisis and he was on the veterans crisis line the Vietnam veterans crisis line in tears saying that yes he had been having suicidal thoughts\nUm so he decided that he should take a step back from the campaign and from the organization who started something called the let America vote which is a anti gerrymandering an anti voter suppression organization or he says he's getting VIP treatment and that he's not permanently retiring from politics he's expecting to be back\nEven with all of a conversation about and support for people who have ... how much stigma is there still today\nWell I mean there's a lot of stigma and and it can also depend for example on what stage are out in the military career if you're active duty military and you raise your hand and get treatment it can make you under deployable so a lot a lot of people will hide it because they want to be able to stay in the fight\n'em and uh I mean I Can't think of a politician who's disclosed is sort of thing except usually on the you know on the tail of a scandal that's going to come out involving some uh misbehavior\nBut uh I mean this is a serious crisis just last week the VA release statistics saying that suicide has increased especially among cancers generation of veterans and candor said he wanted to do this in part to help others confront this in public that it isn't a sign of weakness\nBut some parents Quil Lawrence thanks ... thank you are\nNow we turn to Amazon which has become the largest company to commit to the minimum wage of Fifteen dollars an hour\nThe retail giant which is where it's almost a trillion dollars faced a lot of criticism after disclosing earlier this here that the median salary at Amazon was less than one to nine thousand dollars that's just a little over the federal poverty level for a family for NPR's Alina Selyukh reports\nAnd Amazon corporate executives stood today before more than\nSeven hundred workers any California warehouses and told them they are getting array\nIs Dave Clark he told me this was one of his best days at work in the Twenty years has been at Amazon I should note that Amazon is one of NPR sponsors I reached Clark adds that California warehouse\nWhile we're announcing now is a Fifteen dollar minimum made before any other adult\nThe Fifteen dollar minimum kicks in on November first for all Amazon workers in the U.S fulltime part-time temps in seasonal\nThousand employees total I ask Clark how much a warehouse temp job might pay at Amazon\nNow are lower in a facility was just to underline in dollars and it ranges over Fifteen dollars\nThis already far above the federal minimum wage of seven dollars and twenty five cent but still Amazon's bay has been facing a lot of criticism as a company ballooned into a global giant with half a million employees many of whom are drivers and warehouse workers\nAmazon is the second most valuable American Company it's run by the wealthiest men in the world CEO Jeff Fager [noise]\n\nTwo weeks ago a group demonstrated outside of base of speech and Washington protesting the wide gap between basis as well and the wages for his lowest paid employees\nInside basis spoke to several hundred Washington Power brokers and he was asked about the growing intention that Amazon was getting from critics who think it's become too big and too powerful they just said scrutiny like that is good for society\nAll big institutions of any kind or going to be and should be examined scrutinized inspected\nToday in his statement about the Fifteen dollar minimum wage ... said the company listened to its critics one of the most high profile ones has been Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders\nFor her to give credit where credit's motives are made to derive\nSanders has long been campaigning for better conditions and pay for minimum wage workers including at retail and fast food restaurants\nHe has introduced a bill called the ... act which stands for stop bad employers by zeroing out subsidies the bill would tax large corporations whose workers rely on federal benefits like food stamps\nAnd our hope and believe but I'm a ... will cause other companies like Wal Mart of food into something rather than what you wrote those are good for American workers\nAmazon is not the first big retailer to make a public show of raising the minimum wage target plans to get to Fifteen dollars an hour by twenty twenty Costco hit fourteen dollars this summer but Amazon is now the country's second largest private employer\nI thought it was great news and see how could be other than good news\nIs the author is an economist at MIT and he says there are several ways to view Amazon's move skeptically won the unemployment rate is low and there is high demand for workers\nOne interpretation is look it was going to have to raise wages any way to labor market is tightening uh so it just you know decide to get a good publicity out of that\nAutor says no matter the reason it's important to remember that raises are good for the workers who get them tender local economies lower wage workers are so that they do tend to spend extra earnings\nAnd there's another kind of surprising way that Amazon made waste today it's saying that it will lobby Congress for an increase in the federal minimum wage\nHowever Amazon's Dave Clark told me the company does not plan to Bush for a federal minimum all the way up to Fifteen dollars\nWe think is the right number for relieving for Congress but\nSenator Sanders says he hopes the ... those stamp of approval convinces the rest of the country that Fifteen dollars an hour is right Alina Selyukh NPR News\n\nWith all the news happening every day it can be hard to keep up so check out our

Supreme Court where today the justices grappled with a difficult death penalty question does it violates the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment to execute a convicted murderer who has such severe dementia that he doesn't remember the crime he committed NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports\nBurned in Madison committed a terrible crime in Nineteen eighty five after leaving his girlfriend's house he returned and shot and killed a police officer who had remained outside in his car to provide protection twice Madison was sentenced to death but the convictions were overturned because of prosecutorial misconduct\nThe third time he was convicted the jury recommended life in prison but Alabama has a unique law that allows a trial judge to override a jury's recommendation and the judge did just that\nMadison has been on death row in solitary confinement in Alabama now for more than Thirty years in that time he suffered multiple severe strokes an MRI shows part of his brain is dead and there is no dispute that he suffers from severe vascular dimension\nHis lawyer Bryan Stevenson says that Madison is so disoriented that he doesn't know what day a month or a year it is he's legally blind has difficulty walking and slurs his speech\nBut most critically has no memory of the circumstances of this crime\nExecuted inform inside the Supreme Court today lawyer Stevenson told the justices that executing man so incompetent would be unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment\nIn the past two decades in cases like this barring the death penalty for juveniles and the mentally challenged the justice who provided the fifth and deciding boat was Anthony Kennedy and he has just retired\nInside the courtroom today the justices appeared closely divided chief justice John Roberts asked whether for the purposes of the death penalty dementia is the same as someone who becomes psychotic while in prison\nLawyer Stevenson there would have to be a memory loss plus something else Justice Ginsburg what would the plus B answer brain damage that is the result of an injury so that the brain is incapable of producing memories are creating the kind of rational understanding that this court has required in the past Justice Sotomayor\nSo you're not talking about just amnesia answer no Mr Madison's dementia it's so comprehensive that he can explain to you that he has a toilet in itself for his use\nBut he can't hold that memory and he routinely your innate signing self and asked the guards to take him to the toilet\nThe problem in this case Stephenson said is that the lower courts have said that since Madison is not delusional or psychotic it's All right to execute him\nThe eighth amendment he said is not like the constitutions other amendment it's a mirror of our norms and our values and what we have argued in this case is that Mr Madison's dementia renders him so frail but we'll dirt and vulnerable that executing him cannot be reconciled with the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment\nArguing for executing Madison was Alabama deputy attorney general Thomas ... junior justice prior a frequent critic of the death penalty asked this question I\nThink if a person in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's what's the purpose of executing that person if you wouldn't executed person who's schizophrenia are delusional lawyer Govan replied that the state in this case still has an interest in seeking retribution for a horrible crime\nAnd he said that Madison does understand that he's in prison because of a murder\nAfter the argument Alabama State attorney general Steve Marshall had this to say\nThis involved the little execution of a police officer would this murder and at some point in time to stay looks forward to being able to obtain the punishment that the trial judge Lee was appropriate in this case\nA decision and the case is expected later in the term Nina Totenberg NPR News Washington

convicted murderer who has such severe dementia that he doesn't remember the crime he committed NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports\nVernon Madison committed a terrible crime in Nineteen eighty five after leaving his girlfriend's house he returned and shot and killed a police officer who had remained outside in his car to provide protection twice Madison was sentenced to death but the convictions were overturned because of prosecutorial misconduct\nThe third time he was convicted the jury recommended life in prison but Alabama has a unique law that allows a trial judge to override a jury's recommendation and the judge did just that\nMadison has been on death row in solitary confinement in Alabama now for more than Thirty years in that time he suffered multiple severe strokes an MRI shows part of his brain is dead and there is no dispute that he suffers from severe vascular dimension\nHis lawyer Bryan Stevenson says that Madison is so disoriented that he doesn't know what day a month or a year it is he's legally blind has difficulty walking and slurs his speech\nBut most critically has no memory of the circumstances of this prime things of that the state to execute him for\nInside the Supreme Court today lawyer Stevenson told the justices that executing man so incompetent would be unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment\nIn the past two decades in cases like this barring the death penalty for juveniles and the mentally challenged the justice who provided the fifth and deciding vote was Anthony Kennedy and he has just retired\nInside the courtroom today the justices appeared closely divided chief justice John Roberts asked whether for the purposes of the death penalty dementia is the same as someone who becomes psychotic while in prison lawyer Stevenson there would have to be a memory loss\nWould the plus B answer brain damage that is the results of an injury so that the brain is incapable of producing memories are creating the kind of rational understanding that this court has required in the past Justice Sotomayor\nSo you're not talking about just amnesia answer no Mr Madison's dementia it's so comprehensive that he can explain to you that he has a toilet in itself or his use\nBut he can't hold that memory and he routinely your innate sign himself and asked the guards to take him to the toilet\nThe problem in this case Stephenson said is that the lower courts have said that since Madison is not delusional or psychotic it's All right to execute him\nThe eighth amendment he said it's not like the constitutions other amendment it's a mirror of our norms and our values and what we have argued in this case is that Mr Madison's dementia renders him so frail but we'll dirt and vulnerable that executing him cannot be reconciled with the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment\nArguing for executing Madison was Alabama deputy attorney general Thomas ... junior justice prior a frequent critic of the death penalty asked this question I think if a person in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's what's the purpose of executing that person if you wouldn't executed person who's skits frantic word delusional\nLawyer Govan replied that the state in this case still has an interest in seeking retribution for a horrible crime and he said that Madison does understand that he's in prison because of a murder\nAfter the argument Alabama State attorney general Steve Marshall had this to say\nThis involved the little execution of a police officer with this murder and at some point in time to say look forward to being able to obtain the punishment that the trial judge Lee was appropriate in this case\nA decision in the case is expected later in the term Nina Totenberg NPR News
