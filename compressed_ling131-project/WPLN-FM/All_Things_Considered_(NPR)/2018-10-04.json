crack and HIV epidemics there was a part of Brownsville that was totally abandoned the other side of do mocked\nThe New York city governments sold over sixteen square blocks of Brownsville to the east Brooklyn congregations for one dollar\nThose blocks were dilapidated run down the city agreed to build infrastructure and provide cash subsidies for over a thousand affordable homes they would start

Kevin I'll throw a drink and a man's face prompting a bar fight\nAnd that he believes Kavanaugh may have lied under oath Chad letting and joins me now Hi there how are you ready to die I'm All right thank you for your account has been widely reported since you came forward and released her statement this past Sunday I've just summarized it they're so let me straight to what\nYou did with this information you ended your statements saying you would go to the FBI and tell them what you did\nYou uh yes I did um I ah eventually did reach them by phone from the did than tell me what exactly to do first and button tailed sending your request for a form to fill out\nAnd then I filled out the form in fact the former run this had been pre filled by the uh presumably the Asian I spoke to a with my testimony unit that took up most of the three thousand the character spaces of bailout\nSo you filled out this form did you ever than sit down with or have a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it\nAllowed so I did not I was never called buck a way to buy my food by my computer ah hoping to get an email ... nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI what do they need to question yeah\nI think it's relevant because first of all it was like one should learn from the view so usually a committee\nOne is also trying out in this case a it's a job interview to become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you were saying you thought he lied and testimony this was in regard to the extent of his drinking\n... is the basic law was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrases black you know I think Britain me confused that was passing out but the black man freeze means doing things that you don't know you have done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the state of who talks occasion on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to the condition how can one new\n[laughter] let me let me ask you this a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered this additional supplemental report is does that represent a complete thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nNo I don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened in the last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I can speak to a what I Know about new three maybe four to eighty five that you know college\nAnd then how that was spoken about in two thousand and Eighteen so I don't think they're going to very thorough job in that sense at all\nThat's Chad Chad letting ... classmate of Brett Kavanaugh's he's now an associate professor at North Carolina State University and you heard him here on all things considered\nFrom NPR News the Labor Department comes out with the latest jobs report tomorrow and economists expect to see more new jobs being created that a healthy pace\nBut there aren't just more jobs Cardiff Garcia of our planet money team says people are also changing jobs more often and he's here to tell us more about this hike artist hey Ari what shows you that people are changing jobs moving around more\nWell my favorite indicator dynamism is probably the quit straight that's just a share of people who quit to voluntarily leave their jobs each month it's now its highest point in Seventeen years so it shows you that people are confident letting go of their place of work a and looking for something else\nSo you're saying that when people quit their jobs at a high rate that's actually a good sign economically\nI mean individually usually we associate quitting your job with like being fed up you know you've had it\nUh but actually if you look at it from the standpoint of the macro economy it's a great sign when a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have better options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit\nAnd when you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is there\nActually a lot more uh in fact there are now more job openings than there are unemployed people this is the first year that that's been the case in the government started tracking these records back in the year two thousand\nAnd that doesn't mean that everyone who wants to work will just slide into those open jobs the jobs might be in different parts of the country from where the unemployed people are they might not be a perfect match in terms of the skill sets that are required versus the skills that people have but it does tell you that there is a lot of work out there if you're looking for it\nAnd is that across the border in certain sectors are the more job openings and others\nAnd you know it's it's consistent geographically across the U.S and it's also consistent across the entire US Economy but there are some sectors that are more impressive than others and if you look at\nThe health care sector food and accommodations restaurants hotels and then there's this category called professional in business services those are like high end services things like design accounting law advertising and all of those sectors are you really see a lot of job opportunities if employers\n[noise] you're listening to all things

things considered\nWhen they said talk today I understand you've seen the report can you give a shit\nWas really frustrated and disappointed by the report that we were given a clearly a the FBI was told to very narrow the scope of people that they talk to I Can't tell you what is in the report but I can tell you that a credible number of\nPeople that both I'm Dr Ford and Mr ... gave to the FBI or that could corroborate their stories were not interviewed\nYou say you should be a fair was clearly told to narrow the report the White House and Republicans in the Senate have said the FBI was given no restrictions\nWhen I Know from the FBI is that they are when they're told debate and allowed to be very thorough following leads wherever they are to take them to conclusions and from what I saw today in the narrow scope that they've given um that that could not have been accomplished particularly because we know\nThat the names of people that both ... and Dr Ford gave them were not followed up nor were a number of tips that came into the FBI\nSo Republicans have said today that there is nothing in the report corroborating the allegation of get a Gallup allegations against Kavanaugh sounds as though you're saying true but only because they didn't look for them well\nI mean that's part of it and um and what we do know about um situations like this where someone has a victim of sexual assault\nThat they often do not tell anybody in the room I've talked to so many people say it has absolutely no surprise that Dr Ford didn't tell anybody at the time in fact she told us that\nHow traumatized she wasn't it wasn't really until years later or where she told a therapist or her husband and he talked about it I've had so many women tell me their stories in the airport

the defendants are also charged with wire fraud or identity theft\nCourt papers say some of the cyber activity here started in twenty fourteen when allegations about Russia cheating to avoid drug tests for the Olympics first came to light\nBut some of the behavior extended up till this summer in twenty Eighteen oh so it's just a very current yeah when the hackers were in touch with reporters who wanted access to documents these hackers got their hands on now I gather all\nOf these seven Russian officers are in Russia a and there is no us extradition treaty in place so\nWhy bother charging them well FBI officials point out sometimes they get lucky these guys traveled to European countries where there are extradition treaty is in place but even if that doesn't happen that the OJ says its practice of naming and shaming does make a difference because it shows the hackers\nAmerica knows how to find them and describe what they did in sometimes other parts of the government impose sanctions on individual hackers or the people who fund them\nThe assistant attorney general for national security John ... told reporters that Russia launched the cyber effort because it was embarrassed by allegations than it's athletes\nWere invading drug test embarrassed\nBy that truth Russia fought back by retaliating against the truth tellers and against the truth itself\nNow Mary Louise the Justice Department says it's exposing those activities and that this indictment tells the real story I was asking you\nAnd along those lines the U.S announced these charges just hours after Britain and the Netherlands announced their own accusations against Russian is that coincidence or coordinated\nVery much coordinated the Justice Department actually think it's international law enforcement partners for their help\nAt the press conference here in D.C today they highlighted how the Dutch were actually able to disrupt the hacking plot in April where for Russian men carrying diplomatic passport traveled to the Hague and rented a car and then fill it with electronic equipment they parked that car next to the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons\nThe goal was to penetrate the wife find networks there but\nThe Dutch we're on to them so the men abandon the car and left the country and this was at the same time this organization the O P cw was examining a substance use to poison a former Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter in the u._k. this year the Sergei Skripal ... exactly I mean\nHere's here's my big question which is what these charges tell us if anything about the ongoing effort to protect us elections I mean this is all you know something we're talking about still because of twenty sixteen and attacks against democratic servers and institutions\nAre we any closer to knowing about efforts to protect the upcoming midterms from further Russian interference\nVideotape wouldn't touch that question today but there is something worth pointing out here the new indictment does include three of the same people accused earlier this year of hacking the twenty sixteen presidential election which makes the question or they added again if so the U.S government is just single them out all over again\nIn one unusual things stood out this morning the DOT actually have warning for news media both here and around the world be careful they said about using material that comes from these hacks it can be false are misleading or the hackers can have a sinister motive as the Russian government allegedly did in this case\nNPR's Carrie Johnson thank you my pleasure\nBrett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court could come down to the votes of just a handful of senators they are weighing that decision after

about where the moon came from\nIt was hard to imagine that things could be so different and it was a mental roadblock to realize that giant impacts transformed the planet into an entirely new type of

a regional company suddenly lost sales to Canada that's because candidates dairy industry implemented a new pricing policy it called class seven\nThe goal was to boost domestic sales and that hurt

not Ford or Kavanaugh or some of the others from the judges past who have step forward to share thoughts on his nomination\n... went to Yale with Kavanaugh he says that used to drink together\nThat would Kevin I'll drink he got belligerent\nI'll throw a drink and a man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believes Kevin ... may have lied under oath I\nAsked ... did he offered this information to the FBI\nOr yes I did um I ah eventually did reach them by phone they did then tell me what exactly to do first and that entailed sending a request for a form to fill out\nAnd then I filled out the form in fact when the former arrived it had been pre filled by the uh presumably the Asian I spoke to a with my testimony in it that took up most of the three thousand a character spaces that they allowed\nSo you felt that this form did you ever than sit down with or have a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it\nUh last I did not I was never called back I waited by my food by my computer ah hoping to get an email nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI why do they need to question yeah\nBut I think it's relevant because first of all I don't think once you live in front of the ... committee or whether it's taken an oath and one is also trying out in this case a it's a job interview to become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you're saying you thought he lied and testimony this was in regard to the extent of his drinking\nYes it is the basic lie was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrases black yeah I think Britain me confused that was passing out but the black phrase means doing things that you don't know you have done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the state of his intoxication on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to the condition how can one new\nLet me let me ask you this a central question today in Washington now that the FBI hasn't delivered to this additional supplemental report is does that represent a complete thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nNo I don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened in the last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I can speak to a what I Know about like new three maybe four eighty five at college\nAnd then how that was spoken about in two thousand and Eighteen so I don't think they're going to very thorough job in that sense at all\n... classmate of Brett Kavanaugh says he's now an associate professor at North Carolina State University and you heard him here on all things considered from NPR\n[noise]\n\n[noise] you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe Labor Department comes out with the latest jobs report tomorrow and economists expect to see more new jobs being created at a healthy pace but there aren't just more jobs Cardiff Garcia of our planet money team says people are also changing jobs more often and he's here to tell us more about this like artist hey Ari\nShows you that people are changing jobs moving around more well\nMy favorite indicator dynamism is probably the quit straight that's just a share of people who quit to voluntarily leave their jobs each month it's now its highest point in Seventeen years so it shows you that people are confident letting go of their place of work\nWeb streaming of Ninety point three W. P. L. N. F. them is made possible by listeners support learn how you can support this service at Nashville public radio dot org\nIf you look at it from the standpoint of the macro economy it's a great sign when a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have better options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit\nAnd when you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is there\nActually a lot more uh in fact there are now more job openings than there are unemployed people this is the first year that that's been the case in the government started tracking these records back in the year two thousand\nAnd that doesn't mean that everyone who wants to work will just slide into those open jobs the jobs might be in different parts of the country from where the unemployed people are they might not be a perfect match in terms of the skill sets that are required versus the skills that people have but it does tell you that there is a lot of work out there if you're looking for it\nAnd is that across the border in certain sectors are the more job openings and others\nYou know it's it's consistent geographically across the U.S and it's also consistent across the entire US Economy are but there are some sectors that are more impressive than others and if you look at the health care sector food and accommodations restaurants hotels\nAnd then there's this category called professional and business services that are like high end services things like design accounting law advertising and all of those sectors are you really see a lot of job opportunities\nIf employers have to compete so much for talent and why aren't wages going up faster than they are\nYou know this is been puzzling economist for quite some time uh but what could be the case is that\nThere are more people than economists realize who are willing to take work in part because a lot of the people who are taking jobs now\nSaid that they weren't even looking for jobs in the month before they actually took them and so it suggests is that actually there are more people willing to take work and so companies are having to look for workers yeah but there are also more workers available to be found\nWhat does all this mean for the economy as a whole\nYou know when the economy's more dynamic it tends to give people more bargaining power so wage growth has been kind of sluggish\nIn the last few years very disappointing it could be about to get better it also makes the economy a bit more efficient more productive\nBecause if people are finding jobs that are a good match for their skill set it makes them better at their jobs and it also means that companies will be more likely to invest in the kinds of tools and equipment that will make them more efficient so it's good all the way around both for the workers and for the economy\nThat's Cardiff Garcia co

vapor\nWhat does rock vapor and and what does it have to do with our moon\nRock paper is taking the rocks that we stand on end heating it up to the point where it becomes the gas\nAnd when that occurs the earth becomes much larger because vapor is much less dense ... and it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the earth today and we proposed that our moon grows within the rock vapor of the earth after a giant impact\nOn the moon actually came from the earth\nThe moon grows within the rock vapor of the earth and that gives the moon the same chemistry as the earth\nHow much of a revolution was that I mean how different was that from what scientists used to think about where the moon came from\nIt was hard to imagine that things could be so different and it was a mental road blocks to realize that giant impacts transformed a planet into an entirely new type of object and that could explain one of the biggest mysteries in the solar system\nDid you have to overcome some mental road blocks of your own given what you would have been taught coming through academia\nAbsolutely and this is when we had a bona fide eureka moment to my graduate student and I are sitting in front of a computer looking at the calculations that we had done and realizing that all the assumptions are actually violated by what we're looking at\nI think in any field there's a degree to which people have to be taught to trust themselves and maybe women even more than men are taught not to trust themselves was it difficult for you to have confidence that yeah well I've demonstrated here actually\nIs real scientists are terrified of being wrong [laughter] of course I didn't want to put something out there that was really a crazy idea and so we did have to convince ourselves first\nHow long did it take you to convince yourself\nWell [laughter] from the eureka moment to the published paper with for years so I think we had a lot of internal debates a amongst the co authors and a lot of debates at conferences on the origin of the moon\nSo do you expect if ten years from now I pick up a high school textbook it's going to have the results of your research there in the chapter on how earth's moon was formed\n[noise] I certainly hope so I Am very excited about this idea and I hope that it leads to test where we can prove whether or not the moon actually formed in the earth vapor\nWhy are these kinds of questions relevant to ordinary people who are not scientists why does it matter where the moon came from for example\nThe creation of the men was the last major event and the creation of the earth and it was such a violent act it left the earth and the state very different from today\nUnderstanding how earth became the habitable planet that it is is directly linked to this final event and its creation\nYou're saying it's part of our story absolutely how did you get interested in planetary collisions\nI wanted to study planet formation and in the process I learned that collisions were the major physical process to grow\nThem in the lab and I've been doing it ever since\nWe've kind of kid who was always going in the backyard staring at the stars\n[noise] I had my nose in books imagining space travel I very much enjoyed science fiction\nSo for you is studying plan up to fall back to actually traveling through space\nI might be too

the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement could help us farmers do marginally\nLast year in Wisconsin dozens of farmers were left without a milk buyer when a regional company suddenly lost sales to Canada that's because candidates dairy industry implemented a new pricing policy it called class seven\nThe goal was to boost domestic sales and that hurt competition from us imports\nWell do sales only represented about one percent of Wisconsin's enroll milk production the shock of seeing farmers lose their buyers overnight sparked national efforts to oppose candidates move by the time the Trump Administration open NAFTA negotiations\nFixing the dairy market was a top priority and it wasn't until Canada agreed to end the controversial policy the new trade agreement was reached\nMark Stevens
