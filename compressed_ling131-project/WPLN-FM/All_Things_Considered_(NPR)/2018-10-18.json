on how the Democratic party is shifting to the left nationally if Democrats take control of the house it may be because of moderate Democrats winning in Republican districts take Utah's fourth congressional district\nIt is deeper ed and according to a recent poll Republican congresswoman Mia Love and Democrat Ben McAdams or in a dead heat NPR's Scott Detrow reports\nIn this year of deep partisan splits it's almost jarring to hear democratic Ben McAdams answer this question about President Trump how do you view of the Trump Administration is doing right now [noise] you know I think mixed reviews the mayor of Salt Lake county Utah criticizes Trump for sure on immigration policy health care and other friends\nBut he is a lot more measured and cautious about it and most Democrats running for Congress this year\nNear where many in the party are talking about impeachment and single payer health care he likes to talk about burdensome regulations\nI Will work with the Trump Administration when I think it's good for the country and when it's good for you time I'll be there you know I think we do need an infrastructure package to invest in in local roads and bridges and I'm going to be a part of that\nThat's all no accident the county official and former state senator knows that well other Democrats debate the tactics of exciting the party base versus appealing to Republican voters to switch sides he's got no choice Republicans have a Thirteen point advantage in this district\nThe votes I Need to win this election I've gotten twice before to see to reassure those people that are that you know I'm not going to change I'm going to be the same person or as a member of Congress that I've been as mayor\nHe's also got to convince them to dump Mia Love a two

herself as a pragmatist going into Washington I Know exactly why I'm working with I build\n... relationship on both sides of the aisle love is aggressive about defending the Republican tax overhaul and the ultimately failed Bush to repeal the Affordable CARE Act\nShe was also quick to point out that in several high profile moments she's criticized Trump most notably on immigration where she helped force a floor vote on a fix for the deferred action for childhood arrivals program\nAnd when she publicly scolded him for using a slur to describe predominantly black countries during the White House meeting on immigration as a matter of fact I'm the only one in this\nWhen he has done something wrong and it worked with him when he has done something right Republicans occasionally chiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years and it's something McAdams keeps pointing out saying that voters should look at loves votes in actions not her occasional statements\nDon't get credit for what I Try to do or what I say I want to do I'm judged based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress\nAs the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing of vote for McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi that's despite the fact macadam says he would not vote for ... to be speaker\nNow my opponent may be naive and say he's not going to vote for Nancy Pelosi but if you watch what's going on there if she if this turns over and they win the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house\nMcAdams insists he keep his independence and Washington\nWhen I see is if the Democrats do take back the house is because a lot of people like me who in their elections and these are people from party does not come first solutions comes first\nAs Democrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates like McAdams that many of the candidates in swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit in with Democrats national leftward shift\nThey aren't calling for single payer health care or impeachment so if election night goes well for the party the next big question is how the return a more moderate shifts party dynamics especially if they're the ones responsible for Democrats winning back power got Detrow NPR

our Code Switch team tells us it's complicated\nPresident Trump has been mocking Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren sister she that she has Native American ancestry since twenty sixteen\nOh God

Ninth Circuit because the state denied them a minority business certification for a program designed to help minorities get transportation industry contracts\nTaylor according to the Seattle Times began describing himself as multi racial after taking a consumer ancestry test\nThe test indicated Taylor had four percent sub Saharan African ancestry and six percent indigenous American he says that's enough for him to qualify as minority so what is a minority then\nThe question really you're asking is does the DNA test tell him what his identity as or tell us what our identities are\nColumbia University sociologist Alondra Nelson is the author of the social life of DNA in a recent op ed in the New York times Nelson said DNA markers can't tell us who we truly are because we're comparing apples and oranges genetic data is technical identity is social\nAnd social science we think about the identity as being how human groups or individuals are defined by themselves and how others perceive them\nNielsen says home DNA test or find something to indulge your curiosity but consumers shouldn't think the results or definitive the companies didn't designed them for that\nYou know the sort of gold standard genetic science is not exactly what they're after entirely right um they are also um profit making entities\nAnd she hopes the courts will be able to tell the difference so programs designed to level the playing field for people who have historically been shut out of these opportunities can continue to do that I Would hope that\nUh the court is able to take serious way on the fact that these sorts of programs were meant to start with a counterpoint to discrimination\nBecause the lived experience of minorities can be learned by swapping a cheek for speeding into

partisan splits it's almost jarring to hear Democrat Ben McAdams answer this question about President Trump\nHave you have the Trump Administration is doing right now [noise] you know it's a mixed reviews\nThe mayor of Salt Lake county Utah criticizes Trump pressure on immigration policy health care and other friends but he is a lot more measured and cautious about it and most Democrats running for Congress this year near where many in the party are talking about impeachment and single payer health care he likes to talk about burdensome regulations\nI Will work with the Trump Administration when I think it's good for this country and when it's good for you time I'll be there you know I think we do need an infrastructure package to invest in in local roads and bridges and I'm going to be a part of that\nThat's all no accident the county official and former state senator knows that well other Democrats debate the tactics of exciting the party base versus appealing to Republican voters to switch sides he's got no choice Republicans have a Thirteen point advantage in this district\nThe votes I Need to win this election I've gotten twice before to see to reassure those people that are that you know I'm not going to change I'm going to be the same person or as a member of Congress and I've been as mayor\nHe's also got to convince them to dump Mia Love a two term congresswoman who got immediate national attention by being the first ever black woman elected to Congress as a Republican\nLove is conservative but running in a tight race she repeatedly frames herself as a pragmatist going into Washington I Know exactly what I'm working with I build\n... relationship on both sides of the aisle love as aggressive about defending the Republican tax overhaul and the ultimately failed push to repeal the Affordable CARE Act she was also quick to point out that in several high profile moments she's criticized Trump\nMost notably on immigration where she helped force a floor vote on a fix for the deferred action for childhood arrivals program\nAnd when she publicly scolded him for using a slur to describe predominantly black countries during the White House meeting on immigration as a matter of fact I'm the only one in this delegation\nThat stood up to the president when he has done something wrong and it worked with him when he has done something right Republicans occasionally chiding Trump's statements than backing him on policy has been a major theme of the past two years\nThat something McAdams keeps pointing out seeing that voters should look at loves votes in actions not her occasional statements\nDon't get credit for what I Try to do or what I say I want to do I'm judged based on what I accomplished and we need to hold the same standard to our representatives in Congress\nAs the race has tightened love has done what many other Republicans are doing framing of vote for McAdams as a vote for Nancy Pelosi and that's despite the fact McAdams says he would not vote for ... to be speaker now my opponent maybe not even\nWhat's going on there she is fifty times over and they went in the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house McAdams insists he keeps his independence in Washington\nWhen I see is if the Democrats do take back the houses because a lot of people like me who in their elections and these are people for whom party does not come first solutions comes first\nAs Democrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates like the Adams that many of the candidates in swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit in with Democrats national leftward shift\nThey are calling for single payer health care or impeachment so if election night goes well for the party the next big question is how the return of more moderate shifts party dynamics especially if they're the ones responsible for Democrats winning back power guy Detrow NPR News Salt Lake city\n[noise]\nAnd
