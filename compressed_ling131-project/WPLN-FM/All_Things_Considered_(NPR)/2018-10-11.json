for something that feels a little unsavory it's going to be virtually impossible to claw back the information that you've put out into the world and more importantly you've made a decision not just for yourself but for your siblings for your distant cousins for people you don't even know you're related to for your children for your children's children\nSo Murphy and others think better ways are

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly President Trump and rapper Kanye West met for lunch today\nOne topic on their agenda was gun violence in Chicago and what to do about it the president's ideas on this are very different from what reformers and local leaders are trying to do it different that was on full display this week as NPR's Martin Kaste reports Chicago's had a rough\nYears in twenty sixteen murders jumped to the highest rate in two decades something Trump talked about a lot during his campaign to bend the murder rate there has fallen some but gun crime remains a stubborn problem and this week the president said he wants to help\nTo immediately go to the great city of Chicago to help straighten out the terrible shooting wave to straighten it out on to straighten it out fest there's no reason for what's going on there [noise]\nBut what that means it turns out opposition\nThe administration is filing a brief for the federal court saying it opposes a package of police reforms in Chicago that's known as a consent decree the decree aims to improve police training and rebuild trust between cops and the public Trump does not like consent decrees he says the real cure for Chicago is more intense of policing\nStop and frisk it works and it was meant for problems like\nChicago [noise] it was meant for stop and frisk Trump says the widespread\nStop and frisk getting a potential criminals reduce crime that conclusion contentious though and stop and frisk can also turn into racial profiling under twenty Fifteen court settlement Chicago police have had to fill out extensive forms justifying their stopped which has led to fewer stops\nThe administration believes this sort of court ordered limitation on policing can make crime worse and that this new consent decree is more of the same\nBut Lisa Madigan says it's a little late for them to be weighing in really\nHadn't had any keep from them and count now\nMadigan is the Illinois attorney general last year in an unusual move she sued the city for a consent decree doing the job that the Trump Administration would not\nOr if they wanted to have a role or they had that opportunity they decided that they are getting out and therefore Charles kicking nothing\nShe regards that consent decree as necessary reform but that word is not reassuring to former cop Peter Moskos\nYou know reform as a word is just to remind them of stop and frisk\nHe's a professor at the John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and host of a podcast called quality policing\nIt galls him to agree with the Trump Administration on something but he says the evidence from places such as Baltimore is that federal consent decrees can sometimes make crime worse by limiting the intensity of policing in the places where young men carry guns and shoot each other\nIf we're going to reduce murders we have to go to places where murders happen there's going to be racial disparity but that is separate from racial bias and racial bias has to be attacked but certain neighborhoods need more police and\nMany policing experts these days lament what they see as a false choice between the strictures of Obama era consent decrees and Trump's unquestioning support for tens of policing\nIn Chicago's city leaders are digging in against Trump's rhetoric asked about it yesterday Mayor Rahm Emanuel lashed out at reporters for taking the administration's opposition seriously\nYou guys even in the stories acknowledge it has only symbolic value you guys got to stop acting like ab loving little mice chasing every time Donald Trump said something it doesn't have any value\nTrump's opposition to Chicago's consent decree probably is symbolic the administration's brief is not likely to stop its approval in court but on Monday when Trump called for stop and frisk the applause from the police audience was very real\nHighlighting the ongoing tension between them and the reformers Martin ... NPR News\nThank God the crew in a life and those were the words from it in for Russian President Vladimir ... after a Russian ... rocket carrying two astronaut to the international space station failed during ... today\nAt liftoff had proceeded with me for about two minutes then came in real life drama\nAll right on up here and it's like five times\nWas [noise] the crew\nAmerican the tank and Russian Alexei approaching our space after an emergency landing in context on three other astronauts are currently on board the space station and now they're returned home might be delayed\nFor more on on us and we're joined by Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield he served as commander of the international space station in twenty Thirteen and flew up there and back any Russian Soyuz capsule welcome\nThank you nice to be talking with you also\nStill this was going to the American cakes first time into these seconds for like ... ... what kind of training with they had had to handle a situation like that\nBoth of them and training for decades Alexei as a cause but not for quite a while as you say with space flight experience\nNick prior to being an astronaut was a test pilot in the U.S air force so that's an extremely risky complex job so they've been getting ready for this for many many years and then specifically for this launched working together for a couple of years we wring out every last thing that could possibly go wrong and\nThe way the crew behave there was so Chris and professional right on top of their game you would never know that the vehicle was behaving so badly if you listen to al Alexei ... which dealing with things bringing them both safely after\nWhen would be the next chance you could go on a mission like again I mean I Can't imagine a psychological blow\nYeah you're you're right you know the crew at first will be super focused and professional and doing their job but afterwards they're just going to be kind of mad because they didn't get to go to the base today you know kind of\nGosh all that preparation would have done that but neither of them got hurt and there are back in the game and they'll have a chance to fly again by and I don't know who will fly next it's way too soon to tell it's going to be a a long time to figure out what went wrong\nAnd then we'll have to start thinking about who should fly next what's skill sets should we need one is that going to be all of the repercussions that come from an event like today\nTell me what it will take what kind of conversations are going to have to happen to figure out how to move forward the\nFirst thing we need to do is find out what went wrong what failed in this rocket there's a lot of\nInformation people be able to sift through video of it but also the sensors on board then we need to see how can we fix it was it a design problem a manufacturing problem who knows that and once you know that you can fix it then you can set a timeline if that in three months from now then no big deal but if it's going to take a year or two years\nThen we need other plans Boeing is building a rocket that could take people to the space station or ... or a spaceship\nSpaceX is building a ship that can take people to the space station maybe they could be accelerated maybe they could fly before the Russians are going to be ready to fly again and window we bring the crew back from the space station all of those questions need to be analyzed\nThe ... and they were expecting to return home and now that return could be delayed correct\nThey flew up in a different ... to the space station it's sort of like a lifeboat or their their their ride home if they're they can come home anytime they want but if they ... to come home\nThan they are basically abandoning ship the space station would be empty and it's a big enough and complicated enough shift that after a little wild things start to go wrong and there'd be nobody there to fix them so it really causes a lot of risk for the space station to leave it on man\nSo people will be looking really hard at all of the limits and have to decide what the right trade offs are we don't know the answers yet but but it's going to be a really complicated decision making process coming up\nChris Hadfield went the first Canadian commander at the international space station thank you very much for

NPR News the state department [noise]\n[laughter]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nScientists think they have answered a critical question about how our eyes develop the ability to see colors involved the process that usually takes place in the womb and out of sight\nBut as NPR's Jon Hamilton reports researchers got around that optical by growing human retinas ... cash\nA human right and that requires a lot of patients it takes between seven months in a year or Eldridge should know she's a graduate student mental lab at Johns Hopkins university and for the past few years it's been her job to keep dishes of immature retinal cells alive for the first week\nAnd then after about Fifteen days I can change the media on then every other day [laughter] so they're a little bit more independent\nElders boss Bob Johnston says these clusters of cells develop into a three D. structure known as a retinal org annoyed it\nReally looks an acts like a developing retina that you would see in a baby\nSo it's able to detect both light colored Johnston is an assistant professor in the biology department and until a few years ago his lab had been studying vision in flies but Johnson an Eldridge shot chance to try something much more ambitious\nWe discuss this crazy idea of could we use these human retinal org annoyed to study how we get the different colors and things cells in our eyes\nJohnston says using human cells was key because you can't study human color vision in a fly or even a mouse\nMice don't sense read they don't have these red detecting cells and so\nWe really have to study this in developing human tissue to get any insight into how it works\nJohnston ... knew that in the human fetus cells that detect blue light up here first then come cells that respond to red and green light and research on animals suggested that five ride hormone was involved in the development of these colors and things so called home so he had Eldridge do an experiment\nI added fire right harm onto the dash during their development and we got more red green con developing and organize and so we got really excited\nIt would take years and many more experiments to confirm that side right hormone was actually triggering the emergence of color vision and the teams still hasn't figured out what causes some cones to go on to become even more specialized by detecting only read or only green but Johnston says his lab is ready to take on two new goals\nWanted to restore color vision to people that are colorblind but perhaps just as important there is a disorder called macular degeneration that's the leading cause of vision loss\nMacular degeneration affects the macular an area of the retina that provides high resolution vision\nThat condition has been hard to study though because mice don't have a macular so Johnson hopes to learn more by having his lab create macular organized\nSteven backer of the national eye Institute says that he was like the one at Johns Hopkins are helping to resolve doubts about whether retinas grown in a dish can truly mimic those in the human eye\nThese studies show that the similarity is quite high\nEnd Becker says the eye Institute is trying to encourage the creation of more retinal org annoyed by sponsoring a scientific competition with a million dollars in prize money\nIt's important that we understand how nature controls the development of the retina so that we can understand better why things go wrong and\nDisease and how to develop better treatments the new research appears in
