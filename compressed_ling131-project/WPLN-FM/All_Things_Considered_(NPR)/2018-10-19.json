campaigning in Arizona tonight the trick is part of a western swing to rally Republican voters and in the mid term elections which are now just over two weeks away last night in Montana he distilled the Republican closing argument heading into the mid term elections to this [noise]\nI Know a lot [noise] of job and all\nThe caravan law and order and common sense that's what it's gonna be\nThe caravan he's talking about is a group of migrants trying to reach the U.S border it's now a big feature\nAbout all this is NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith ... high so why I'm Talking about another caravan at a political rally think\nWell this is not the first time he has talked about caravans he talked about a different caravan back in April a this is a new one um and it's getting a lot of attention on cable news\nAnd so he is talking about it again he suggested at that rally without offering any evidence um it made a claim that Democrats were somehow behind the caravan\nWhat they want is a jar of him and there are those the caravan didn't just shop and it didn't just happen [noise] a lot of reasons Jarvis four thousand people but I just want to the Mexican government because they're so good hopefully be bored every [noise]\nWe should underscore that there's really no evidence to back up this conspiracy theory that that he's been able to offer but you know the reason that he is talking about this and talking about illegal immigration is that it's something that gets his supporters animated\nYou know they are still at these rallies chanting build the wall almost every ... every time he's out there so basically this is just an effort to rally the Republican base to get out and vote yeah and the evidence is that it's a winning issue there are two new polls from ... that are out\nA defined that illegal immigration is an incredibly salient issue among those who plan to vote Republican in the upcoming elections they asked about twenty different issues facing the country and those supporting Republicans\nIntimate terms uh Seventy five percent of them say that they consider illegal immigration to be a very big issue Jocelyn Kiley is associate director of research at the Pew Research center you can see the\nUh there's energy among Republican voters around the issue of immigration and that energy is most pronounced within the set of Republican voters who are really focused on border security and law enforcement\nAnd so how do we know this is a base play illegal immigration in the way that President Trump talks about it is simply not a priority issue in the same way for Democrats or independent voters as it is for Republican voter voters and for Republican voters or she says it it can be a powerful motivator\nAnd the University of Tennessee

I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I now said\nChang much of what we know about what may have happened to journalist ... has been leaked by Turkish investigators and more information continues to emerge painting a fuller picture of what may have happened to him in Saudi conflict in Istanbul\nAnd yet I'm usually turkey is carrying out its probe in full cooperation with the Saudis NPR's Peter Kenyon has more on what the sensational alleged murder means for turkey the Saudis and the U.S\nThe latest leak say Saudi vehicles were attractive they left the consulate after ... entered on October second

consulate the consul general's residence and diplomatic vehicles citing audio and video recordings the leaks suggested ... he was tortured killed and cut to pieces\nPossibly by a Fifteen minute Saudi team that arrived at the consulate just ahead of the show ... president Donald Trump says he requested a copy of Turkey's audio evidence\nAdding quote if it exists but Turkey's foreign minister of Joe ... says neither secretary of state Mike Pompeo who is just in turkey nor any other American official has been given any recordings he's heard through an interpreter\nAre given says guy that we did read the news about Trump asking for the audio recording from turkey but we didn't give any audio recordings to pump pale or any other American officials were waiting for the outcome of the investigation that was launched by our stumbled prosecutors' offices\nCritics say from the beginning Turkey's attempt to present this as a straightforward criminal investigation was undermined by its invitation to the Saudis to join in\nSaudi investigators have been in on every major search so far sometimes you're writing well ahead of the Turkish team us based turkey analyst Soner trapped I told the al Jazeera networks English Channel the Turkish president Recep Tayyip everyone needs to see this late at the doorstep of someone very senior in Riyadh\nThink at this stage a Turkish president Erdogan can take nothing less than not just a complete apology but ah someone pretty significant and important uh thrown under the bus\nSuggesting an effort is underway to shield crown prince Mohammed

happened took place in Turkey despite the diplomatic status afforded the Saudi consulate\nIt doesn't have diplomatic speak to us in order to torture and cause a a visiting citizens\nBut ... says the question of what turkey wants is likely to be overshadowed by what could play out between ... in Washington the US's counted on the house is out as a key Gulf ally especially with Trump about to

or increased again and the premise is that Saudi Arabia makes up the difference continuing stability in the world oil market about two at the moment that question might be being reopened\nThe Saudi ability to drive up world oil prices is just one factor that makes ... showed Deasy said something more than an ordinary criminal case Peter Kenyon NPR News Istanbul\nWe're going to speak next to someone that skeptical of those Saudi and Turkish efforts to investigate ... death skeptical that the Saudis are likely to carry out a thorough and transparent investigation of themselves\nHe is David Cay he's the United nations special ... on freedom of opinion and expression\nWhich means he's tasked with protecting those rights around the world David Cay wants the UN to launch an independent international investigation and he joins me now to talk about it David Cay welcome thank you it's good to be her\nWalk me through how this would work court kind of team would you need to pull together to investigate ... disappearance and perhaps murder\nYou know it's possible to look back at different examples of how the un has done this before\nWe've seen in the past the U.N Security council or the human rights council essentially appoint a small group of experts maybe led by a former prosecutor and they could evaluate the evidence they should get access to the consulate they should get access to whatever\nTurkey has then they would conduct an evaluation they could do it pretty quickly\nI think and we're talking a team of what size roughly theoretically\nTheoretically maximum five people [noise]\nI'm curious about some of the practicalities of how this would work could show she disappeared and allegedly was murdered Seventeen Days ago he said the reported crime scene is in Turkey it's at the Saudi consulate are you confident you would get access to the places you need to go the people you need to talk to to do a credible investigation\nIt's I mean it's a great question of course with you know the two weeks plus that if passed getting access to the consulate or to the um the consul general the Saudi consul general's\nHouse getting access to those places would be very difficult and even with the time passed it might not even be as relevant but getting access\nTo the material that the Turks have collected I think that would all make it kind of investigative report that would not be based simply on leaking to the press or on the information from intelligence agencies\nYou're talking about getting direct access to the tapes that Turkish authorities say they have yes absolutely do you have authority to compel the Turks to hand over everything they say they have\nWell if the Security Council authorized this kind of investigation that kind of power could be brought to bear I don't expect that will happen and then what happens\nAt the end of such an investigation is it binding could Saudi Arabia\nOf course they could ignore it I think that would be um something that you might even expect to happen certainly from the Saudis are there would be no binding quality to an investigative report what it would be I think\nIs a credible independent investigation something that the Saudis can't do because they can't investigate themselves the U.S evidently can't do because it's been a resisting and in a way protecting or the Saudi Saudi officials so if you would have this kind of\nA report it would be credible you'd be independent and then it would be up to states and to international organizations to decide what to do with the information but as it stands right now we're left with are simply reports in the press and ideas of\nThe Saudis blaming somebody and and the government and it seems that\nThe U.S would be willing to just go along with that and that's not that's not a credible investigation\n[laughter] so you say you can do this you say you want to do this why isn't happening\nWell that's a that's a very good question I mean it should happen there's a lot of politics around this the human rights council earlier this month adopted a resolution\nThat was advocating for the safety of journalists and it was advocating for holding people accountable when journalists are attacked it was sponsored by a number of states those included states like France um those are the states that I Would look to first uh to to move this kind of thing forward\nDavid Cay he is un special ... on freedom of opinion and expression and thanks very much thank you [noise]\n[noise]\nThis is NPR News in Nineteen Ninety then President George H W. Bush told world amount of lifelong enemy\nI Do not like broccoli and I haven't liked it since I was a little kid\nHow our taste in food preferences in music even our pets can really not politics\nAnd I'm president of the United states and I'm not going to eat any more broccoli\nMatch this week hidden brain from NPR Saturday afternoon [noise]\nFrom the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around with their district se knock on doors [noise]\nI'm only going to take some of the time I was on the river on the Republican running for realize I'm I'm here to answer any questions they may have topics including our budget education immigration is a hot topic\nYeah that is a ... I feel that people focus too much on the people coming from Mexicali\nSeparating families isn't the way to do on paper it doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\nOne you know I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised a tour immigrants from Mexico\nAnd um this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country and the opportunity I Know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans are smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask her narrow if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security one that legalized who the people who are here who want to work hard we're looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThis sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration is pushing\nI'm a I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is but I just mentioned\nIndependence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate like you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of or soda I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI asked you see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the reelection a stubborn you see on the ballot and its Doug ... agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters\nA guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry it wouldn't be as you approach do see for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support certain language doesn't support certain policies\nThe national Republican mood and may make calls for he is not suggests\nStop them we need to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that no I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juice\nBut under that logic if Republicans want to appeal party why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigrations the deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way he does\nThis was going to see how they treated us\nSo much you if you got to vote you got to go to ... vote and they said that we were ready to go over\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party state may already be field for generations to come and as a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republicans to separate themselves from the broader party governor juicy will be appearing on stage at a campaign rally in Phoenix tonight with President\nTrump [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News build it\nAnd they will come in this case a little wooden box on a post demand credited with building the first little library died yesterday Todd Bowles was sixty two men had pancreatic cancer\nNine ... years ago he used words from his old garage door to build the first little library at his home in Hudson, Wisconsin now there are tens of thousands of little libraries in eighty five countries\nAuthor Miranda Paul got to note Todd bowl and has written a children's book due out next year called little libraries big heroes she joins me now from her home in Green Bay welcome thank you gave Todd Bowles this idea to build a little library in the first place\nWell Todd mother passed away and his mother had been a schoolteacher and when he was growing up as a student who very much struggled\nHis mother had always been encouraging so he built the first little free library as a one room schoolhouse to honor her and was it a hit right from the start actually know very passed by that he talked with his friend Rick Brooks\nAnd so they built a whole bunch of them sort of planting unlike seeds from Minneapolis to Madison to Chicago and it was only after that that it started to catch on\nWe had him on this program six years ago and he was talking about the effect of the little libraries once people did start catching on and start using them\nOne of the things that always is amazes me the only people hugged them when we actually put the myth we constantly get emails that I've met more people that have been Twenty years people are always happy my favorite thing to do is sit on my porch and read a book and watch people open the library\nWhat do you think it was about the little libraries that attracted people when all of us have libraries big libraries that we could go to\nTodd really looked out reading and sharing stories as a doorway conforming relationship you know when I spoke with Todd in person or on the phone he expressed how energized wise about projects especially those that had to do with the news for people who didn't normally read getting reading tell me about it\nNow our tuition to the wild or places where I Would not expect to find a little library\nIn some places where there has been either violence or disaster these little free library has come out that sort of a little spring of hope\nAlong the U.S Mexico border there is a hundred and fifty of them on increasing in Wisconsin and other states and they came along refugee settlement in western Uganda at a hospital in Ireland near ... and South Sudan these little free libraries have popped up and brought communities together\nPeople of course take books for the little libraries but you also get to leave them I have to say that's what I Love about it I Love if I've got a book and I really loved it\nSometimes going and sticking it in there and then I'll you know when I'm Out jogging ... the next day seeing if somebody's taken it and if they have I feel this little sense of pleasure that somebody else is going to get to read this book that I just love\nI Love that idea to I'm constantly having a few bucks in my car so that when I'm going somewhere if I see a little free library and I want to put a book in there you can share that love of reading with another community whether it's your own or somewhere else\nYou were in touch with Todd bowl when he was in hospice does he feel like he'd done what he set out to do\nWell I mean there's so much more to what he's doing and being a champion from books or for reading he was being a champion for community new friendships new ideas new projects bringing to life as a result of an idea back when he won it\nWell ... thank you for talking to us thank you for having me she's author of the forthcoming book little

these migrants well let's bring in reporter James Frederick who is there in Guatemala hide James or lose so just yesterday you were describing to me a relatively calls\nWho were amassed a few minutes away from the border what what happened today\nOr this group of migrants to is now grown to ... and we don't know exactly how many uh but thousands of migrants now\nDecided they were going to march through this bridge that connects Guatemala and Mexico and they said they were going to try to enter Mexico today it was a very chaotic scene but uh you know for him just try to summarize it as quickly as possible [noise]\nAh they were at the fence blocking them from leaving Guatemala that got through that fence thousands of people started walking across this bridge into Mexico Mexico has closed up big metal gate to them it had dozens of federal police officers in riot gear rating for this caravan\nThen I wasn't close enough to see what happened but then the Mexican gate open briefly we heard shots that turned out mostly to be here or gas or that they were using against the migrants and then the gate shut again\nUm it was a really chaotic scene and let's hear from his father who was near the front of the caravan with his two young kids\nAs I said okay I'm up for it why they don't care what am I going to [noise]\nSo what he said was that she went to the front what his children because they thought they were going to let families and children cross first then there's chaos broke out she had to pour water in his children's eyes they got here that it was just really chaotic or

cross the border and across this bridge or\nA lot of people I talked to said we aren't going to leave this bridge what they are requesting is from Mexico to let them in as asylum seekers and so they are many of them say we are not going to be best friends who are going to block the bridge into Mexico\nLactose and given the clashes today Mexico has totally closed the border or you know I tried to get back into Mexico and was not able to close to every one\nA show it's it's really up in the air what they're going to do but everyone I talked to said no we're not turning around we are not going home\nIn ... seconds we have left teams I mentioned that President Trump is threatening to close the U.S border if this caravan does manage to make it across Mexico and man getting to the U.S is if the goal of these people are they aware of the president's position\n[noise] they they are aware that a Trump does not want to let them into their country but what they say over and over again as we

he's talking about is a group of migrants trying to reach the U.S border it's now a big feature in his stump speech and joining us now to talk about all this is NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith hate him high so why I'm Talking about another caravan at a political rally think\nWell this is not the first time he has talked about caravans he talked about a different caravan back in\nApril a this is a new one um and it's getting a lot of attention on cable news and so he is talking about it again he suggested at that rally without offering any evidence um it made a claim that Democrats\nWere somehow behind the caravan\nThey wanted a jar of it and there are those who say the caravan didn't just happens happens [noise]\nPeople but\nI just want to say the Mexican government because they're so good hopefully before it ever [noise]\nWe should underscore that there's really no evidence to back up this conspiracy theory that that he's been able to offer but you know the reason that he is talking about this and talking about illegal immigration is that it's something that gets his supporters animated\nYou know they are still at these rallies chanting build the wall almost every ... every time he's out there so basically this is just an effort to rally the Republican base to get out and vote yeah and the evidence is that it's a winning issue a there are two new polls from Pew that are out\nA defined that illegal immigration is an incredibly salient issue among those who plan to vote Republican in the upcoming elections asked about twenty different issues facing the country and those supporting Republicans intimate terms\nUh Seventy five percent of them say that they consider illegal immigration to be a very big issue Jocelyn Kiley is associate director of research at the Pew Research center you can see that\nUh there's energy among Republican voters around the issue of immigration and that energy is most pronounced within the set of Republican voters who are really focused on border security and law enforcement\nAnd so how do we know this is a base play illegal immigration in the way that President Trump talks about it is simply not a priority issue in the same way for Democrats or independent voters as it is for Republican voter voters and for Republican voters and she says it it can be a powerful motivator\nLearn more at

all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly in Washington and I melted Chang in Phoenix, Arizona President Trump is campaigning here tonight Arizona is a state where the G O P dominates politics right now both US Senators the governor most state lawmakers they're all Republican\nBut that could change because waves of Latinos will become eligible to vote in the coming years and they tend to vote democratic which means Arizona could flip from red to blue\nUnless the Republican Party can win over the growing number of Latino voters in this state and to get a sense of that challenge I traveled to a town just west of Phoenix called policy it's about eighty percent Latino\n\nI'm In a restaurant serving port those out got as and tacos and I bumped into a guy who could give the Republican

within seconds you'll run into people who beat him mentally just agree with parents like evil Hernandez a truck driver who says immigration is the deal breaker the reason most Latinos will never vote Republican\nYou heard of the news they're coming up with all these laws that make it more difficult for people for any country in the world to a regular status you seem to accuse been separated from the families of the water I think all that reflects pretty bad on the Republican Party if you ask me\nMeans who's ordering all that or you know Trump and his agenda\nThere is reason Hernandez view may not be worrying Republicans right now\nRepublicans are banking on two things\nJews have Garcia hits the Latino public policy center at Arizona State university\nAre banking on that there's enough white voters to do when the election today and their banking that there's going to be short memory for Latino voters tomorrow\nGarcia says data don't lie Latinos will turn Arizona majority minority by twenty thirty and a whole lot of them are going to be us citizens twenty eight\nThat Republicans can win without also winning the Latino vote so the\nQuestion for Republicans is how will they persuade those Latino voters to join Thirteen [noise]\n\nI'm not a baseball diamond in a small park in northern feeding and the district state representative Tony Rivera\nHas any of your friends or or any other members of the Latino community giving you a hard time for becoming a Republican\nI'm people have given me a hard time like well what do they say they'll say um how could you be a Republican and when the Republicans don't support 'em Hispanics they don't support immigration reform\nAnd his response to them is take a look at all of the other values of the Republican Party they mesh perfectly with Latino face the traditional family small business entrepreneurship but it's not easy to get away\nFrom the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around with their district as he knocked on doors [noise]\nI'm only going to take some of the time I was on the river almost be a Republican running for real and I'm I'm here to answer any questions they may have legs including our budget education immigration is a hot topic\nYeah that is how I feel that people focus too much on the people coming from Mexicali\nSeparating families isn't the way to do a paper it doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\nWhen you know I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised in ... parents are from Mexico\nAnd um this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country and the opportunity I Know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans up smarter and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask Rivero if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security one that legalize as people who are here who want to work hard who are looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThis sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration switching\nI'm a I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is that I just mentioned\nThat independence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate let you hear it from Republican governor ... who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI asked to see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the reelection a stubborn you see on the ballot and its Doug ... agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters\nA guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry it wouldn't be as you approach do see for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's\nDone a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support\nCertain language doesn't support certain policies that the national Republican\nMood and may may call for he is not suggesting on border security that we need to stop them we need to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that no I cannot\nBut under that logic give Republicans want to appeal\nHearty why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him the

raised a when they decided to investigate this jointly with the Saudis they've been in their research but we'll have to wait and see what the reaction is\nAll right and that is Peter Kenyon getting us up to speed from a stumble thank you very much Peter\nThanks very Lewis and we're going to hear now from someone who says this Saudi investigation is compromised with Saudi Arabia has in effect been investigating itself\nHis name is David ... he has the United nations special repertory on freedom of opinion and expression which means he's tasked with protecting those very rights around the world\nCave has been arguing that the UN should launch an independent international investigation and he's on the line now David Cay welcome\nThanks for having me now that Saudi Arabia has come out and confirmed or the death of\nJamal ... G and given a little tiny bit of detail on what happened do you still believe for un investigation would be worthwhile would be necessary\nAbsolutely I mean I think we're in a position right now where we have\nAll of these competing narratives right we have a the drip drip drip of leaks from the Turkish a law enforcement authorities that have given some really brutal detail of\nA of a of ... killing and those same really quite at odds with what a what the Saudis are announcing today the idea of a of a fistfight seems\nReally um counter to what to what the Turks have suggested so I think the only way right now to get to the bottom of this\nIs to have a credible investigation and that means something that would be authorized by by the un or the secretary general or some other international body\nWhat would that investigation look like how big are we talking how long would it take\nI think we are talking about something small you know we're talking about as in past cases like this maybe five individuals could be led by a high profile former prosecutor investigators who have experience with international crimes and criminal investigation\nAnd um you know at the very minimum it can involve\nAnalyzing what the what the Turkish authorities have been giving to the news media over the last a week or two or it could involve on site visits a interviews of of officials and so forth but but I think it's something that could be done fairly quickly four to six weeks once it's authorized\nUm who has to call for this I mean what what would it take to put this in motion Mm\n[noise] yeah I mean there's really a bunch of different models that would be available for something like this\nThe Security Council has authorized investigations for for heinous crimes are and comprehensive systematic crimes like crimes against humanity and genocide or they did it in the context of dark for in Sudan several years ago and they've done it and many other places the human rights council\nCould do it the human rights council benefit is that it's not subject to ah to the veto of any of the five\nPermanent members gonna okay so if the U.S decided they didn't think this investigation was necessary that could block the Security Council investigation but not the human rights council\nAbsolutely ... and there's there's a third option to which uh several human rights organizations have been calling for and that's for the secretary\nAuthorizes an investigation and set one up\n[noise] um what would happen once this investigation is complete it would it be binding in any way could the Saudis just decide we have our version of events we don't buy it\n[noise] yeah no this is a this would be something where it would be an investigation because of its credibility because it would be international law as it would be something that from you know from that point states could take a look at it and make a decision as to how to proceed and there would be any number of options available to them whether its\nDiplomatic penalties penalties and international organizations or or other kinds of outcomes but but there's nothing by day and I'm not talking about it I Do know that we're talking about a credible international investigation that's David Cay thank you\nThank you use the un special representative and this is NPR News\n\nBuild it and they will come in this case a little wooden box on a post the man credited with building the first little library died yesterday Todd bowl was sixty two and had pancreatic cancer\nNine years ago he used words from his old garage door to build the first little library at his home in Hudson, Wisconsin\nNow there are tens of thousands of little libraries in eighty five countries\nAuthor Miranda Paul got to note Todd bowl and has written a children's book due out next year called little libraries big heroes she joins me now from her home in Green Bay welcome thank you gave Todd Bowles this idea to build a little library and the first place\nWell ... mother passed away and his mother had been a schoolteacher and when he was growing up as a student who very much struggled\nHis mother had always been encouraging so he built the first little free library as a one room schoolhouse to honor her and was it a hit right from the start actually know very little passed by\nThat he talked with his friend Rick truck and so they built a whole bunch of them sort of planting unlike seeds from Minneapolis to Madison to Chicago and it was only after that that it started to catch on\nWe had him on this program six years ago and he was talking about the effect shift a little libraries once people did start catching on and start using them\nOne of the things that always amazes me to Sony people hugged them when we actually put them in we constantly get emails that I've met more people have in Twenty years people are always happy my favorite thing to do is sit on my porch and read a book and watch people ...\nWhat do you think it was about the little libraries that attracted people when all of us have libraries big libraries that we could go to\nTodd really looked out reading and sharing stories as a doorway conforming relationship usually when I spoke with Todd in person or on the phone he expressed how energize the wise about projects especially those that had to do with news for people who didn't normally read getting reading\nTell me about some of the places where these libraries now our tuition to the wild or places where I Would not expect to find a little library\nIn some places where there has been either violence or disaster these little free libraries has come up this sort of a little spring of hope\nAlong the U.S Mexico border there is a hundred and fifty of them in prisons in Wisconsin and other states and they came along a refugee settlement in western Uganda at a hospital in Ireland near a schoolyard and South Sudan these little free libraries have popped up and brought communities together\nPeople of course take books for the little libraries but you also get to leave them I have to say that's what I Love about it I Love if I've got a book and I really loved it sometimes going and sticking it in there and then I'll you know what\nTaken it and if they have I feel this little sense of pleasure that somebody else is going to get to read this book that I just love\nI Love that idea to I'm constantly having a few bucks in my car so that when I'm going somewhere I feel a little free library and I want to put a book in there and you can share that limit reading with another community whether it's your own or somewhere else\nYou were in touch with Todd bowl when he was in hospice does he feel like he'd done what he set out to do\nWell I mean there's so much more can what he's doing and being a champion from books or for reading he was being a champion for community new friendships new ideas new projects bringing to life as a result of idea back when he won it\nWell ... thank you for talking to us thank you for having me she's author of the forthcoming book little libraries big heroes and we were talking about little libraries
