lottery tickets he waits until the jackpot is twenty five million or above to make sure that he's still turn a profit even if there's a split pot\nThe biggest problem with buying all the tickets though isn't money it's logistics filling out millions of tickets each one different keeping track of where they are so you can find the winning tickets and then turning them all in so\nHis secret was get the tickets ready ahead of time back then it was legal to print your own tickets already filled out so we set up printers going for over a month making the millions of tickets\nThen negotiated with stores across the state to let him turn in stacks of ten thousand tickets at a time and waited\nI knew that would leave one through six second Brian I'm going to go to an hour ... mind\nHe says he couldn't do it again lotteries have now added extra numbers and there are just too many combinations so the great lottery play of Nineteen Ninety two will likely state the last great lottery

years\n[noise]\nI\nDo not\nWon the amount of the tonight\nShow in Las Angeles Dodgers take on the Boston Red Sox any game one of the twenty Eighteen World Series to talk about this historic match up we reached ESPN baseball analyst Jessica Mendoza hate that's again\nBut also today [laughter]\nOkay so like just lay off the stage where this battle of the he misspoke teams have these huge histories to the biggest fan bases how ethic is this face off\nWith the ... these teams have not met in the world series and clean sticks and guess who pitched game show that game for the Boston Red Sox who they even ... even without ... you might have heard of him and he's a hitter but he was pitching for the Boston Red Sox not the Yankees are back\n... they go okay well yeah\nAnd they matched up so it's it's also even though it's it's a historic match up it's something that in the modern day of two very big baseball teams somehow they miss each other when they fall in the world series it was never against each other so I Love the fact that it goes back and starkly but also it brings them she she thousand Eighteen\nSo was it was back in the world series after a pretty brutal last last year I mean how how this team going to be different\nI got one word and its redemption I mean we've all had a little bit of that in life right you get your heart broken in this case the Dodgers got it torn out and there is something about that World Series last year wasn't just the fact that when seven games that went back and forth changing lanes\nSpring training I was with them pretty much throughout the season and there is a fire\nTo get back in when the world series but really when you look at the same is different because they went and got many Machado I mean this is Ben they're often said or eat or he's at shortstop they last course speaker during the season so now they have a child and then really is there a I don't you know Clinton crushed shah\nIt's Walker dealer who adding Walker bealer to be able to be honest they one of the best picture that we've seen in the national league they have this redemption that they've had all season long they want to get back and they want to when\nThey're burning to prove themselves now okay what about the red Sox what did they have going into this\nThey want a hundred and eight games I mean the pressure is on them and even though the Dodgers haven't won a World Series and Thirty years you know the red Sox have had really positive that a lot of reason to celebrate between the patriots and the red Sox but this is the argument when the bats\nRegular season teams we have ever seen okay so they went and it was without a doubt they were the best thing that baseball so when you were the best team in baseball it's like okay well then when at all no one cares about hey you want to hide your mate games yeah you get an award you get a crowd\nYou don't get anything oh you get if you want a hundred and ... yeah they were the ... they are so good out of it as well you know and the post season the vaccines and always when you got to go out and play\n[noise] All right I Want your crystal ball Jessica how do you see the world series playing out who do you think is going to win gutters\nAnd that's going to shock a lot of people because the Boston Red Sox are the best team on paper there is no buddy better or to love about the postseason transcend all of that talent pitching hitting I don't care for all the numbers out yet is redemption\nPassion it prior to the Dodgers have because they lost in game seven last year and I believe that's going to kill them to victory this year\nThat was ESPN baseball analyst Jessica Mendoza she'll be on sports center covering the world series thanks so much that the guy thank you out

an update on migrant children who were separated from their families at the U.S Mexico border\nTwo hundred and forty five children remain in federal custody that's according to government data analyzed by the American civil liberties union\nThe ACLU has been tracking these children and it was the ACLU lawsuit against the Trump Administration that led to a federal court order to reunite these families we're joined now by ACLU attorney leak learnt welcome thanks for having me\nSo we should first said that the vast majority of these children who were separated at the border more than two thousand of them have been reunited with their family but it has been for months since the court order why are two hundred and forty five children still in custody\nYeah that's the question right or you know obviously the should've never happened to begin with and it should never have taken this long for the reunification Z\nLike one of the reasons is because the government deported hundreds of parents without their children and the reunification process for those parents didn't really even start 'til about six weeks after the court order\nAnd where these children being held right now these two hundred forty five children that are still in custody\nThey're being held in governor ... all across the country often thousands of miles from where the parents are ... I Would say of the two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made the agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life was over ... killed 'em killed and this was a father who seem to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life shouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said to us was I cannot bring wild child back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite but right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents that you have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum\nOr bring them back to Central America\nWe have heard at various points that some of the families are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents have criminal backgrounds what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have said all along that if a parent has a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand her child welfare law state law they would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but we're also seeing\nOf disorderly conduct do you ours allegations that they may be part of a gathering and that is extremely troubling because we are talking about [noise]\nFour year old kids three year old kids were not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with\nThe ACLU has reported that five children have parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government has no idea what happened to the parents we\nAre the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given us phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are far that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice in motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we're not giving up on the farm we will find the one way or the other we believe\nLegal learnt is deputy director of the ACLU immigrants' Rights Project thank you very much for joining us for for having me\n\n\n\nYou are listening to all things considered from NPR

Chang and I'm Audie Cornish strict voting laws are putting some states in the headlines this election year\nIn Georgia fifty three thousand voter applications were placed on hold because the names didn't exactly match names on IDs and North Dakota law requiring voter id is to include street addresses has also gotten attention\nManner pres considers these examples of policies that can suppress voter turnout especially in minority communities\nShe's the head of then why use Brennan centers voting rights in elections project I asked her about how voting laws have changed over the last decade\nOf expanding the right to vote but we saw in\nRight after the ... election was efforts across the country to make it harder to vote we saw bills being introduced from coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty times\nAll right so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states a mess around with their polling locations closed polling locations and move them we say states imposing strict photo identification laws uh meaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of id in order to be able to cast a ballot\nThat will count we're seeing states not providing equal access to commonsense things like a polling location near them or around them a twenty Eighteen is going to be a challenging time for a number of voters but they should not be deterred\nAnother issue I've been reading a lot about is this idea of purging what do these laws look like how are they justified\nPerjury is a practice of removing voters from the rolls um some of that is set forth through law but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business\nUm what we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting perch from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are\nOn the ... cases when they're doing this are they saying look this person hasn't voted and two and three cycles or look we're not sure if this person's still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a administrative\nEffort [noise] um we want\nElection and administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls\nThe problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators use sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late um critically we're also seeing that purging is happening in states that used to\nBe required under the voting rights act and be able to demonstrate that there are election process as we're not going to be discriminatory and we're saying that those areas are having an even higher increasing the number of people that are being perch from the rolls\n[noise] um even calling this voter suppression um do the courts agree with so many laws in place it seems like maybe there is an open door to all these kinds of laws around voting\nUp many of the strictest\nLaws have been a blunted by courts overtime to London but not overturned or an hour it's aren't seeing it as suppression yet I I think I Would push back a little bit on that I think we are talking about a matter of degree so for example the photo id law in Texas that\nWas a enacted in two thousand eleven looks really really different than the photo id law\nThat is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota so some courts are stepping in and saying some of these policies are are too much um but they're not going all the way and saying that these policies can't exist in any form\nA many Americans especially Americans that have traditionally had their rights to vote suppressed are very very resilient and very determined to overcome it but having said that these laws are going to depress turn out in a way or that we wouldn't have seen if these laws hadn't existed in the first
