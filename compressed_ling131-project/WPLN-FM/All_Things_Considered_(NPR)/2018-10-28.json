show his congregation support for the Jewish community and their time of need\nAre intent was to express our solidarity with our Jewish brothers and sisters to remember those who were killed a lot to offer prayers\nUm but as I mentioned in my my Sherman to also find our boys\nYou know we often shoe that we offer our prayers in bunch and that is funny but we must do more we much put those prayers into action we must give them all age and with her boys with our actions we can ensure that this hatred is not\nThe new American way you can not be\nDo you have a sense that there were some people who might have been afraid to come out today goes\nYeah because we are and open and affirming congregation\nPut your target on her back ...\nOpen and affirming you mean other than every once in a while because everyone is welcome to actually write in every one is welcome and and knowing welcome but to be celebrated what was the attendance like today was it more than you expected we had a couple of\nAh folks from the Jewish community come at the beginning and to offer the words of Thanksgiving they do not stay to worship but they do to come in to say thank you for doing this so that makes a difference\nIf I ask you don't see him rattled by this maybe you are on the inside but you know this community is not that far from here and I didn't have to wonder you I mean you hear you\nMy daughter my youngest daughter turned into four roses and on\nPolice officers that were injured her husband is a police officer and was directly involved in yesterday's events or because he's a police officer in white hall ... where the ... a perpetrator lives\nSo it was very frightening pros personally um but I I Try to uh luggage the urge to give me the ... that I Need\nI I Do not fear for my

close to home\nWell the church has recently kind of been coming up with plans what to do in case of the situation like that and of course is the nursery attendant that has always been something that's been on my mind to start here because I'm responsible\nFor keeping eight or nine children at a time and how I Would evacuating from the building or hide them in a situation if it were to come down to it\nSo I just was running through my head tenants plans that I've come up for years\nReally and is that what occurred to you yesterday when you heard about what happened were you thinking okay what would I Do in that situation\nYeah I grew up post Columbine so I had a child um even in first grade we had drills even back then of what to do if there was an active shooter in the school and my whole life I grew up in public school constantly hearing about stuff like that Sandy Hook happened when I was in high school\nOr things like that just always kind of was in the back of my mind is kind of a shadow that I guess a lot of American Kids are growing up with these days\nI don't know whether to be happy or sad you know that you have that somehow it hurts me to think that you have to think about that instead of thinking about what fun games to play\nYeah it's not it's not a plan anyone wants to have but it's become a reality that you to be in that situation not have thought of something or to be in that situation and to have you know you you are the last protection for those children and that is what you have to be thinking about\nWe also met a father and son oldest and Matthew ... who

E. S. A. in Pittsburgh and not far from here thousands are gathering to remember the eleventh people who were shot to death at a local synagogue\nThe Jewish community center is leading the community gathering held at soldiers and sailors memorial hall and open Pennsylvania faith leaders and politicians from ... from throughout Pennsylvania and beyond have gathered in a packed auditorium\nNPR's Quil Lawrence of outside of the community service now and he's been talking to members of the Pittsburgh community all day Quinn welcome thank you so much for talking to us\nThank you it sounds like a huge gathering there today what is it like at this event\nYeah there's a beautiful hall and saw the auditorium and in the backdrop is Abraham Lincoln's entire Gettysburg Address\nUm I I just stepped away at the beginning there was a a Baptist choir and African American Baptist choir singing I mean this is an event hosted by the Jewish community but it was a clear symbol of the\nOf the whole Pittsburgh community standing in solidarity and the music was beautiful and really soothing to many in the crowd there were people weeping including reporters\nUm I'd say they're maybe three thousand people inside and as I left to come out and speak with you I had to pass through another three thousand people sitting outside in what's now very chilly rain listening to the same service over over speakers\n... sounds lovely now you also spent some time in squirrel hill the neighborhood with this attack occurred what was the mood there [noise]\nYeah I mean people were out and scroll hill trying to kind of have their normal life in a way of farmers markets are people going to Sunday services and you can see the diversity of the community it's notably Jewish but it's really a bit of everything\nThey were trying to be normal but they're also trying to explain this I spoke to a woman coming out of the six president Presbyterian Church Brittany story and she's in eighth grade English teacher she just friday took her students to the Holocaust museum in Washington DC\nHere's what she said\nI came today that\nWaiting patients and now that they I think I'm going to let them read the articles and news articles that I Want us to sit and talk of the class and just give them a space [noise] kind of\nProcess that happened and what they thought they were really moved by the family even saying the Holocaust for weeks\nAnd people were saying that you know in a little town like this you'd never think can happen but in today's America they realized it can happen anywhere\nAnd and to that point this is a a a a smallish city and the victims of the shooting were identified this morning and people are probably just finding out that they may known someone who was affected how are people absorbing this\nYeah it's another wave of shocked to hear the names I rented to Dan Franco's he's the he's the state represented Pennsylvania state representative from this district he went to Hebrew school at the tree of life when he was eleven years old and he knew a two the two brothers who were killed\nWe're ... we learned a are known for many years whenever I go to a tree of life for a more mature wedding shortcoming to two of them are always for\nYour research where\nHe talked about you know centuries of anti Semitism but more recently an object of hate speech in this country ...\nAnd now finally Quil what what is next what what are people saying if next\nI felt like people run this ... this sort of cycle of sorrow and then pride in this area of the community showing and then there's rage that a man could come here with an assault rifle and massacre eleven people in twenty minutes while they were praying most of these people were old enough to be grandparents\nThe community is trying to take action they say they want to do something they say they talk about guns they talk about trying to tone down their rhetoric in this country and many of them talked about upcoming elections in wanting to be active\nThat is NPR's Quil Lawrence called thank you\nThank you\nAnd as you just heard we've been talking quite a bit today about how people are mourning and how they're trying to make sense of this tragedy but it's not just adults who are trying to make sense of yesterday's shooting and tragedies like this that are unfortunately all too common a lot of people are thinking about their children\nAnd how to talk to them about tragedies like this NPR's Sarah McCammon has been reporting on that story and she's back with us in Studio ... thanks so much for coming back and doing this sort of thing and I understand that you actually covered a lot of these shootings and this is something that is really on people's\nMinds and fortunately I've covered several of these now in my career as a journalist and you know anytime there's an a senseless act of violence especially especially these mass shootings it's it's hard to explain it to children especially for people in the area and the community affected\nI it's impossible though for kids not to hear about it right in the news and their their friends and neighbors are talking about it even if they're not directly involved in the tragedy I found a lot of people struggle with how to talk to their children how to explain things and not terrified that\nSo you did we mentioned earlier that you went to the synagogue neighborhood outside the synagogue he also went to other places tell us about that\nYeah I actually went over to the children's museum here in Pittsburgh it's a pretty famous really really great one actually and\nUh they have opened it up to the public for free this week Monday through friday or they want to place for families to to go and feel safe and comfortable they say and today was a pretty normal busy day at the museum and\nAnd uh staffers were thinking about ways to to reach out to families today too I met a woman named Jesse live and she was hanging out with her family and she said something I've been hearing repeatedly and talking to people in Pittsburgh today\nJust so you hear it happening everywhere but you never really think it's happening here\nShe says she's not sure how to broach the subject with her two kids ages for insects we're from Canada so\nIt was very new sweat living here for the last year to start getting more regularly\nAlarming across the room Alisa\nHoffman was also ensure what to tell her two kids ages six and three about what they're seeing in the news\nIt's hard to [noise]\nPut it into a contract where they understand\nThat we haven't really talked about it yeah I have\nHow we well Hofmann grew up in the Pittsburgh area and with back here to visit family and like so many here she\nHas ties to send a lot of my\nFriends had by a bar mitzvah that tree of life I hadn't\nAttendance Sunday school because my best friend growing up was Jewish and that's where she went though it was just really [noise]\nPricing upsetting disappointing that that people get these sons and their head and and do it [noise]\nYou know and I think that they [noise]\nThat makes shop a play and craft area for the kids she says the museum staff has been grappling with how to help children and their parents during this scary time\nToday it's hard to be at work\nKnow that we are the helpers here and we are the ones offering support for those families and children while we are also struggling with our own feeling [noise]\nBut the way that I'm looking at it is\nYou know we are part of a community together as\nAnd I'm seeing\nWith the community right now deals are important and powerful for me to still says today's plant originally focused on Halloween\nBut after the shooting she switched things up and encourage the kids to build models that houses and buildings and other familiar places they care about places that make Pittsburgh home Sarah McCammon NPR News Pittsburgh", "year": "2018",
