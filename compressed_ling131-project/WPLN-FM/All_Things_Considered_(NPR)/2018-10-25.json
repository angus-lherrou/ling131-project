pledge we'd love for you to do that right now become a sustaining member it six one five seven six zero twenty ten or pledge a WPN ... dot org thank you\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Audie Cornish and I'm Mary Louise Kelly the search is on for the person or persons who sent at least ten suspicious packages to prominent Trump critics this week\nHere in Washington attorney general has condemned the bomber and said he is determined to ensure justice is done in New York police and elected officials are briefing the media here's police commissioner James O'Neill\nThat can say with certainty that we will identify interested person or people responsible for these acts\nOK NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson is here Hi Kerry hey Mary Louise so many moving parts it seems like today catches up on where the investigation stands the FBI has confirmed it's investigating Kansas\nContained in manila envelopes and sent to a who's who of well known critics of President Trump\nMay include former president Brock Obama former vice president Joe Biden\nFormer attorney general Eric Holder former CIA director John Brennan\nFormer secretary of State Hillary Clinton and congresswoman Maxine Waters and this morning we learned that actor and prominent Trump critic Robert De Niro had received one of the packages at an address link to him in New York another common denominator is that these all our people that President Trump himself has called out and campaign stops in speeches and tweets\nAbout the packages themselves and the fact that none of them actually exploded or hurt anybody which is great news of course but does that tell us anything about the investigation authorities are tight lipped about whether any of these devices may have exploded\nA air had the potential to explode and serials are at the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia for review they're an FBI official says part of that review was already under way\nThey're going to be looking for things like fingerprints or DNA for insights into how these devices were made\nAnd the FBI's assistant director William Sweeney says the powder and at least some of these on bulbs does not appear to pose a biological threat important clue they're a former official at the ATF the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives who was reviewed some images of these devices say they don't appear to work\nThere is some hazardous material there he says but the images that he's seen seemed to lack a second power source that would produce an actual explosion and there's also a really big underlying question about the motive here if these devices were not meant to explode did the bomber just want to scare people in intimidate them and did that was that\nHappening for political or personal reasons all of that is a big focus this investigation All right so if we don't know the motive do we have any clue as to who we are talking about who the who the suspect is at this briefing in New York investigators we're not talking about individual suspects here's what we do know\nInvestigators are focusing some resources on New York and some others in Florida\nRemember these packages had a return address and Florida specifically to the office of democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz shelters not actually linked to these packages she didn't send them but whoever did made her part of the story\nTo do it before seven o'clock tonight you'll be entered in a drawing for now playing Nashville ticket package tickets to a whole bunch of stuff that I don't have time to get into right now are valued at nearly a thousand dollars tomorrow night we're giving away a seven night trip for two to Costa Rica let us hear from you make sure you've got a shot at those ...

and I'm Audie Cornish eight hundred US troops are headed to the U.S Mexico border the demonstration and sending them to assist with immigration and Customs Enforcement this as a caravan of about a thousand migrants tries to make its way to that border\nThat caravan and how the u._s. should respond have become a central issue in the quickly approaching midterms were going to dig into this with Wisconsin\nRepublican Ron Johnson who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee and we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you well Marilyn how are you doing I'm All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border\nWhich as you know President Trump is calling a national emergency in your mind is it\nIs certainly troubling that we have created incentives in our immigration system and insurance partly because we really reward illegal immigration we really need to have is the legal immigration system that works and where there are there are consequences for illegal immigration I Want\nTo get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding\nIn Mexico as the so called caravan makes its way north Mexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president says it is\nA A R nobody'd called her national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the most ... year flood of individuals coming from\nCentral America is unaccompanied children and I was traveling units incentivized by laws were passed by legal precedent and loopholes that again reward people coming into this country illegally because once they get your our legal system allows them to stay\nIn the interest of sorting fact from fiction or a couple of questions to your knowledge senator are unknown middle Easterners part of this caravan and marching toward the U.S border\nI don't know about this caravan but I Know when I toured the northern Arab countries with Ben sewing command general\nLike a special interest aliens when was there that were that that was back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen\nAnd I'd never heard the term special interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners or you know other than Mexican other than\nCentral American immigrants and we've been tracking that now truth boy it's a relatively low number it's it's in the hundreds it was a poster we're dealing with tens of thousands of people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nYou would not disagree though that it's important to deal with the facts as they are in twenty times so I I\nI'm definitely a very fact based individual apps\nWho of course yes or no any evidence of middle Easterners in this\nAre and that's how I got I I Do not have any specific evidence in this chair bad but it it wouldn't surprise me if there were some\nEffect check up a second claim with you as President Trump has suggested that Democrats are somehow involved with instigating this caravan might let me tell you what he said\nDemocrats want caravans they liked the care of it is a lot of people say I wonder what started the caravan [noise]\nAs President Trump speaking five days ago senator is there evidence to support that Democrats somehow started this caravan\nWell they certainly are are not helping us change laws so we can and these incentives I mean let's face it some of them their solution is supporting sanctuary cities which is another incentive for people in this country legally and a lot of them want to abolish ice which would be completely counter productive\nI Do want to get to the policy changes that you feel are needed but but let me just before we move on from the ask you the direct question that has on some people's minds that this so called caravan is a manufacturing controversy drummed up to energize Republican voters before them in terms\nI have no evidence of that whatsoever again to what I've read about is this occurred in Honduras or people opposed to a prison grand is down there and in some way shape or form that's how this all got started but that's just what I've heard read news reports\n[noise] let me ask you about Congress's role in trying to fix this are you optimistic that something will happen in this next term when Congress wasn't able to get it done these last two years\nWell part of my proudest river homeland security most of these\nLaws aren't under my major's diction we've gotta do to my Comey's jurisdiction because that is this year I was able to move forward and and working with my colleagues I got there agree with that I could start handling the so I tried to go through this\nAs a business person would a problem solver gather the information find the areas of agreement in our community we you know we all agree one of the border that we have to have\nReasonable silence standards that are maintained we won't enforce our laws and then we don't separate families so try to go through a problem solving process very transparent very open very detailed and see if we just can't fix one aspect to this and then maybe successful breeds success\nSenator thanks so much for your time everyday Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin\nMany of the migrants now traveling north originated in Honduras than journeys like that happen every year that this group is far larger than most and it feels competing narratives about how it was organized\nNPR's Carrie Kahn reports many of the migrants said they heard about it on TV and social media and jumped at the chance to flee and the safety of numbers\nAnd what thirty

together all these different pieces that they've collected from these packages there either all center on their way to FBI's lab in Quantico, Virginia and they're trying to really look at the details here trying to figure out what they can figure out including looking at the powder that was found in a package that was sent to CNN the New York office\nUh uh the eyes William Sweeney talked about that really today let's listen to what he said\nThe powder in those particular ... did not present a biological for other analysis is only ... however it is worth repeating that any device could be considered potentially dangerous and treated as such until proven otherwise\nYou know at this point law enforcement are being very tight lipped about details of what they found out so far you know they're characterizing these devices as quote suspected explosive devices or else imbedded away any questions that possibly any of these\nYou know explosive devices could be hoaxes and said they're not getting into the intent there they're focusing and investigation or asking for tips from the public\nAre there specific threads law enforcement officials are pursuing right now\nWell one big question is where these packages sent through the postal system or some of them because they've been delivered by your ear\nAnd also what were the materials used for these explosive devices I spoke with a former ATF agents out from the bureau of alcohol um [noise] uh firearms a division and he said that really they're looking at trying to find signatures that may be able to identify who who was the individual or individuals behind this\nAnd also they're looking at a closed circuit TV footage to see if they have any indication of who may be involved and you really can't rule out that there may be more packages out there and so that's something that a postal workers and law enforcement or on the lookout for\nIn the meantime what more is known about the packages that were found today in Delaware and New York well the baggage\nOr Seventy five nights a deadline for now playing Nashville tickets are and then tomorrow night we give away a seven night trip for two to Costa Rica\nOr it

hired away from Fox News and twenty Seventeen with much fanfare and a big paycheck\nHit her time at the network has seen some controversy including comments she made about black face justice week yesterday and emotional Kelly apologized\nAnd I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry now NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting her employment by NBC appears to be over David joins us from our studios in New York City hey there David pay Audie\nKelly said that caused this latest controversy\nWell Kelly a obviously a host of the nine AM our stage show she's had was having a chat a couple of days ago with several panelists about Halloween costumes and talks about how she is not PC and then started to talk about what it was to dress up as somebody of a different race here's what she had to say\n[laughter] you'll get in trouble if you are a white person who signed up for a black person if white kid that was okay as long as you address character\nAnd that of course that tapping into a rich vein of pain or in terms of the course of American history depiction of African Americans by whites\nHow did her fell NBC colleagues react to all this\nPretty sharply a is a notable in two ways one which was the significant coverage that was given to the story or both by a on the NBC nightly news\nUh obviously it's anchored by Lester Holt the only African American anchor among the big three broadcast to American networks I and also on the today show in the hour proceeding her own show a tour for African American colleagues really way to end up first let's hear from El Roku or a he noted that she'd apologized colleagues but said she needed to do more\nShe owes a bigger apology to folks and color around the country because this is a history going back to the Eighteen thirties minstrel shows to do to me and denigrate uh a race wasn't right\nAnd then also uh Craig Melvin to perhaps the newest co host of today show he weighed in as well\nThere was some criticism yesterday on line but this was political correctness run among um that's the way it is nice and junior ... is just as ignorant and racist statements himself\nA NBC News Germany Andy lack at a a meeting with staffers this week on the subject I refuse to defenders well\nThis isn't the first time making Kelly is his criticism while at NBC um why do people think this was the last straw [noise]\nWell I think there are a couple of things going on a first off it kept in as well to our own history in terms of remarks on race or from her days as a Fox News host much sharper edge parks and he's hosted she insisted that both Santa Claus and Jesus quite Christ wore white\n... back in twenty Thirteen she said she regretted that last year when she was at NBC but also her show is been\nAiling a it's a guide rather tempted 'em a ratings\nAre and she had her relationship it cooled with executives that she had really embraced at times me too movement including accusations of sexual harassment against some of NBC's biggest stars not only Matt Lauer who was fired but uh the former ah NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw much blood figure who were teens his ties to the network\nWhat have you learned about what's next for her\nI Want to be very clear about this a source would direct knowledge of the matter says ah it's clear she won't be returning it seems impossible to imagine but these things aren't quite concrete yet you know Andrew lack has been a her biggest champion a despite the fact that she had a fairly a\nCool and conflicted reaction and and a welcome from a employees that NBC she displaced a couple of popular figures in that town hall\nAnd a ... a at that nine AM our and her ratings didn't do a heck of a lot for it in a dish and she was paid an extraordinary amount of money or for a uh for the thing and she really took on a lot of fires a figure who brought on ideological baggage who brought Fox News baggage and it turned out didn't bring a whole lot of success at the box office\nThat's NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik thank you you bet\nKelly's comments on black face or not the only reason she may be on the way out at NBC but they're definitely a big contributing factor they're also not the only reason we're talking about black face right now the subject seems to come up year after year Halloween after Halloween now I'm joined now by NPR's Gene Demby from our Code Switch team hate ...\nYear after year and um we do every year unquote which in fact we joke\nThat October is blackface Avon and not allowing Advil Halloween is is Christmas at all companies and this one day of the year when all the races costuming comes out maybe these annual conversations should be less about whether blackface is bad but why so many of us have so much historical illiteracy about as bad as\nWell walk us through some of the history as best when did we first started saying black face in America\nWe first start saying black face in the early Eighteen hundreds or may become central to Mr all shows on which why people would dress up like black people by talking in this game with polish and with court\nAnd of course these missile shows depicted black people was lazy as animal is to play on caricature played the caricatures of course in that sits next to obviously this broad humidity shouldn't allow slavery to happen at the time um and so these caricatures linger and the American consciousness for a long time in fact by the twenty century ... Olsen\nIs the most popular entertainer in America and he's performing exclusively and black face [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nSo there's a whole history of you know read the paper trail the Native Americans and yellow face portrayals of Asian American pie or anything of Mickey Rooney is character in breakfast at Tiffany's um but it's those mocking depictions of people of color that these Halloween controversy ... against us\nAnd to be clear which blackface always seen as offensive by the people who were being caricatured\nWhere the people who are caffeine caricatured ... often not in a position to push back showing some historians point to the fact that there were black performers who performed a black face but that was in part because white audiences did not want to see black people and mental shows who are not wearing black face because that was so much of the visual language of the minstrel show\n... to ... back to this week in her apology Megan Kelly said she didn't know about this history [noise] what do you make of that [noise]\n[noise] I mean she can claim ignorance but employers often say ignorance without a defense\nNone of this history is particularly deeply hidden and Kelly when she was talking about this and this panel is all white Pena which is important\nShe seemed to be primarily concerned with defending the innocence of people who may dress up in blackface and that happens all the time of these conversations about race in history and power they always become conversations about intent and not about sort of broader context we always start in a store called vacuum\nDoes intent matter since you raise it more is this something we should just degree it's like the N word it's offensive and we're just not going to argue about it\nSo I'm Glad you bring up the N. word because there was a good example of the ways in which the context of things change depending on who it delivering something and who are receiving it so when he's controversies tend to happen it's usually when a person you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party\nDressed in blackface usually there is not a black person and attendance and no one at that party made bad an eyelash\nBut then a video from that party or picture from that party slips out into the broader world somebody posted on Facebook exactly and then that video has to contend\nWith a different conflicts with an audience of people who have a different relationship to that imagery a different relationship to the consequences of that imagery as well maybe these conversations\nWill be better served if we spent less time parsing out what's going on A People's souls and whether they're good people are not when they put on black face\nAnd more time thinking about why so many social circles continue to insulate people including apparently prominent talk show host from understanding this history and its consequences\nNPR's Gene Demby of our Code Switch team ...\nThank you so much Mary Louise the silver [laughter] I Hope not [noise]\n\nThis is NPR News\nAt St Andrew's ...\nWatershed research field geology and landscape painting get students exploring the school's mountaintop campus the S.

Web dot org ... support for national\nRelations and shouldn't do Neal you argue that cutting aid to the region as Trump was threatening to do will result in more care events which of course was precisely the thing he says he wants to stop why what what's your argument\nThis is actually the United states over the last couple of years has been sending seven hundred and fifty million dollars to primarily these three northern triangle nations\nThis goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs helping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violence or difficult neighborhoods\nSure if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cuts foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want\nTo leave yes so if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground in many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternative is to head north\nAbout the problems at home here in the U.S and what I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at the radios right now\nIn Central America violence prevention programs in Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why should the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here you know each country\nIn the end should be responsible for their problems and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want things to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problems of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day\nThat we need to be active around the world and these are places in our\nHemisphere nearby and with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars in other places around the world to try to stabilize those places to make them safer and so we should be looking here near to home\nFor places that do affect us day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking several hundred million dollars not billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point we should've knowledge I guess which is to the U.S has some responsibility for the problems in these countries I'm thinking of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S Russia and gang members were deported back\nTo Central America United States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not justice aids the United states was a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contras were there and we were big supporters of of those groups\nAnd then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now trans national and nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here in our prisons and in our communities and so those linkages\nAre not just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nations\nSo if you could wave a magic wand until the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would you tell them\nYou know I Would tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to\nReduce violence improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity but I Would also ask him to hold these governments accountable in Central America make those governments actually work for their people and invest alongside the United states because it in the end\nIt is the responsibility of the Central American governments to\nProtect their people ... of the council on Foreign Relations function much my pleasure

Mary Louise Kelly the search is on for the person or persons who sent at least ten suspicious packages to prominent Trump critics this week\nHere in Washington the attorney general has condemned the bomber and said he is determined to ensure justice is done in New York police and elected officials are briefing the media here's police commissioner James O'Neill\nI can say with certainty that we will identify interested person or people responsible for these acts\nOK NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson is here Hi Kerry hey Mary Louise so many moving parts that seems like today it catches up on where the investigation stands\nThe FBI has confirmed it's investigating ten suspicious packages these are bomb like devices contained in manila envelopes and sent to a who's who of well known critics of President Trump\nMay include former president Brock Obama former vice president Joe Biden former attorney general Eric Holder former CIA director John Brennan former secretary of State Hillary Clinton and congresswoman Maxine Waters and this morning we learned that actor\nAnd prominent Trump critic Robert Deniro had received one of the packages at an address linked to him in New York another common denominator is that these all our people that President Trump himself has called out and campaign stops in speeches and tweets\nAbout the packages themselves and the fact that none of them actually exploded or hurt anybody which is great news of course but does that tell us anything uh\nAre tight lipped about whether any of these devices may have exploded a air had the potential to explode ... are at the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia for review they're an FBI official says part of that review was already under way they're going to be looking for things like fingerprints or DNA for insights into how these devices were made\nAnd the FBI assistant director William Sweeney says\nThat powder and at least some of these aren't the lumps does not appear to pose a biological threat important clue they're a former official at the ATF the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives who is reviewed some images of these devices say they don't appear to work\nThere is some hazardous material there he says but the images that he's seen seemed to lack a second power source that would produce an actual explosion and there's also a really big underlying question about the motive here if these devices were not meant to explode did the bomber just want to scare people and intimidate them and did that without happening\nFor political or personal reasons all of a big focus of this investigation All right so if we don't know the motive do we have any clue as to who we are talking about who the who the suspect is at this briefing in New York investigators we're not talking about individual suspects here's what we do know\nInvestigators are focusing some resources on New York and some others in Florida\nRemember these packages had to return address in Florida specifically to the office of democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz shelters not actually linked to these packages she didn't send them but whoever did made her part of the story\nUm and and uh what we need to get from you though is your tickets at we have a friend who who their their kid colds dollars tickets which I just thought it was great and we need

Wisconsin\nRepublican Ron Johnson who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee and we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you well Marilyn how are you doing I'm All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border\nWhich as you know President Trump is calling a national emergency in your mind is it\nIs certainly troubling that uh we have created incentives in our immigration system and then she was probably because we really reward illegal immigration we really need to have is the legal immigration system that works and where there are there are consequences for illegal immigration\nI Want to get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding\nIn Mexico as the so called caravan makes its way north Mexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president says it is\n[noise] well I I Know what I'd call it a national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the multi year flood of individuals coming from\nCentral America is on a couple of children and I was traveling units set of eyes by laws were passed by legal precedent and loopholes that again reward people coming into this country

I'd never heard before SRAs special interest aliens when was that were that that was back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen\nI'd never heard the term Russian interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners or you know other than Mexican and\nCentral American immigrants and we've been tracking that no true for you it's a relatively low number it's it's in the hundreds it was a poster we're dealing with tens of thousands of people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nYou would not disagree though that it's important to deal with the facts as they are in twenty times so I I\nI'm definitely a very fact based individual acts\nOf course yes or no any evidence of middle Easterners in this are and that's how I got to it\nCaravan but it it wouldn't surprise me if there were some\nEffect check up a second claim with you a President Trump has suggested that Democrats are somehow involved with instigating this caravan might let me put you already said\nDemocrats want caravans they liked the care of it it's a lot of people say I wonder who started the caravan [noise]\nAs President Trump speaking five days ago senator is there evidence to support the Democrats somehow started this caravan\nWell they certainly are are not helping us change laws so we can MDs incentives I mean let's face it some of them there's version is supporting sanctuary cities which is another incentive for people in this country legally and a lot of them want to abolish ice which would be completely counter productive\nI Do want to get to the policy changes that you feel are needed but but let me just before we move on from the ask you the direct question that is on some people's minds that this so called caravan is a manufactured controversy drummed up to energize Republican voters before them in terms\nOf no evidence of that whatsoever again to what I've read about is this a curtain Honduras or people opposed to a prison grand is down there and in some way shape or form that's how this all got started but that's just what I've heard read news reports\n[noise] let me ask you about Congress's role in trying to fix this are you optimistic that something will happen in this next term when Congress wasn't able to get it done these last two years\nWell part of why I brought a strip of homeland security most of these\nLaws are under my major's diction we've gotta do to my Comey's jurisdiction because that is this year I was able to move forward and and working with my colleagues I got there agree with that I can start handling this so I Try to go through this\nAs a business person would be a problem solver gather the information find beers or agreement in our community we you know we all want to secure the border that we have to have\nReasonable silence standards that are maintained we want to force their laws and then we don't separate families so try to go through problem solving process\nVery transparent very open very detailed and see if we just can't fix one aspect to this and then maybe successful breeds success\nSenator thanks so much for your time everyday Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson we

region as Trump was threatening to do will result in more care events which of course was precisely the thing he says he wants to stop why what what's your argument\nThis is actually the United states over the last couple of years has been sending seven hundred and fifty million dollars to primarily these three northern triangle nations\nThis goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs helping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violence or difficult neighborhoods\nSure if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cuts foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want to leave yes\nSo if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternatives is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S and what I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at the radios right now wants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs and Central America violence prevention programs in Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why\nShould the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here\nKnow each country in the end should be responsible for their problems and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want things to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problems of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day that we need to be active around the world and these are places\nAnd with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars in other places around the world to try to stabilize those places to make them safer and so we should be looking here near to a home\nFor places that do affect us day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking several hundred million dollars not billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point we should acknowledge I guess which is to the U.S has some responsibility for the problems in these countries and thinking of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported back\nTo Central America United States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not justice aids the United states was a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contras were there and we were big supporters of of those groups\nAnd then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now trans national and nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras in Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here in our prisons and in our communities and so those linkages\nAre not just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nations\nSo if you could wave a magic wand until the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would you told her to\nTell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to\nReduce violence improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity\nBut I Would also ask him to hold these governments accountable in Central America make those governments actually work for their people and invest alongside the United states because in the end it is the responsibility of the Central American governments to\nProtect their people ... of the council on Foreign Relations much my pleasure [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nWe're getting a little loopy
