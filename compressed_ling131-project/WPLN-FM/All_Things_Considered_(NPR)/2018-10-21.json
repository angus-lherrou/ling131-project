Ford testify about what she says that now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh did to her when they were both in high school is that what made you want to write this piece after all these years\nYes that's what motivated me I watched her testimony and I thought it was genuine you know I felt she was really telling the truth plus ah the things that she forgot wore the same things I forgot you know so I said well I'm going to just write something that but my experience which was very similar\nI did something bad I sit in the article I committed a crime and I did\n[noise] you know what you wrote is hard to read and you know for some people it's going to be hard to hear about this so this is where again I'm going to say that for some people if this is too much to listen to them you know take a minute and step away from it but I'm going to ask you to recount for me what it is that you said that you saw and you were at a party right\nYeah let me start by saying this was an unusual event for me because I never went to parties never and so I I don't even know why I went\nI I didn't know anybody that all of a sudden a kid came upstairs and said hey go outside and look through the basement window so about ten of us went out there and I happened to be right in front of the window and I'm watching and as soon as I look through the window I see a a girl just lying on a sofa\nShe looked like she was passed out and so the kid went down and he looks up to us any waves to us and he starts smiling and then he starts to take her genes off and then he he he took her panties off and then he he pulled honest than\nAny one on top of her and as soon as he did that he was starting to have sex with her she kind of came to and started hitting him on the shoulders he jumps up right away\nAnd all of us at ... at that window was outside we all just started to run\n... you also write that you and other parts of the party started touching another young woman who\nWas also passed out on the on a bad but then you you left\nYet this was later maybe twenty minutes to thirty minutes\nLater a she was laying on the bed and uh what one kid was doing was\nWhen the lights were out everybody was touching her he would turn the lights on and everybody would pretend like they weren't touching her and they probably did this four or five times I touched her leg at one point and and that was all I did but uh it was enough\nYou know you wrote about why you think the girls would never have said anything about this they would have been blamed and shame they would have been told the chips fall [noise] but you never said anything either why do you think that is\nA you know I I think I wanted to forget about it and plus later on it was just just plain guilt you when you're guilty about something and I was guilty and I admitted in in any article ah you you don't want to tell anyone\nOne of the things about your piece a sink struck a lot of us was that you said I wanted to tell the story because I Believe it's time for men to tell the truth about the ways they've abused women and what role has been in creating a culture that tolerates this we've all seen things we've all heard other men\nTalk and you wrote about a couple of examples where you just heard people say these crazy things and you know nobody did anything and why do you have a sense like why do you think that is that why do you think this has been tolerated so long\nI I don't know I I don't know why we've kept quiet I had a quote from somebody some man who said that it would be easier to admit that you committed a murder instead of admitting\nAnd uh I I Can't answer that I don't\nKnow I I I really don't know why men have been silent on this issue but I think men should be part of the me too movement I think we should come forward and uh talk about what we've seen what we've done I think that should be part of it how did your family take it when you told them\n[noise] well [laughter]\nLet let me tell you when I originally told my wife I told her just the rate part that I witnessed I did not tell her my\nParticipation she didn't know that to this article came out ... let me just say it's a it was tough for her to say let me tell you but everything's okay now everything's good and how did\nYou explain that to your boys [noise] well\nJust I was truthful with him and uh they were very receptive\nOn their dad you know dad can you know we we kinda can't do too much wrong in the in the eyes of our\nKids are they both told me that my two older boys they don't think would happen now they said everybody at that window would have had their phones al videotaping it\nThat's what they told but that doesn't mean it wouldn't have had what are they saying they\nYeah I mean but in that sense that she wouldn't have done it because you wouldn't have wanted to be\nOn film you say well we film everything you know what they would kind of alluding to well how do you feel now that you got it off your chest you know kind of have\nMixed feelings I'll be honest there are there are days when I regret it\nAnd then there are days that I'm Glad I did\nYou know my kids showed me some comments on Twitter from people some women have said it's about time some ... ... it's almost as if I was the first guy to admit this\nAnd a lot of women ah said ah they were glad I did it and they felt better about themselves a few women who have been actually a\nAssaulted who wrote notes to me\nSaid that they made them feel better and so that made me feel kind of good you know\nYour piece was very moving and I one of the things I think I was like every paragraph of it I could call it but the fact that you think about these women I mean now and you wonder\nWhat happened to them like how this affected their lives I mean if if you could say anything to them if by some miracle they were listening [laughter] what would you what would you say\nThe only thing I can say is I'm Sorry I didn't help uh you know few women had called me a hero but no I wasn't I Would have been a hero to help these women then but I didn't do it dump hammering thank you so much for talking with us thank you\nIn recent years
