Michelle Martin police violence and misconduct is in the news again after former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was convicted of multiple charges late last week in connection with the killing of a teenager at local McDonalds\nBut recent events have also brought the issue of violence against police to the spotlight also last week seven police officers were shot and Florence South Carolina as they tried to\nIssue a search warrant one of the officers parents carry weight died a week earlier to Mississippi police officers were killed during a shootout with a suspect\nIn a violent crime has fallen over the last few decades but according to the FBI killings of police officers is up slightly over the past year and policing remains one of his country's most dangerous jobs we wanted to hear more about this but we've contacted Maria haven't felt she is a professor police science\nAt John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and she's with us now professor thanks so much for talking with us\nThank you for having me yeah what can you tell us about the numbers I mean we know that policing is safer than it was Thirty years ago but we saw that there's been this slight uptick in the killings of police officers do you have any sense of what's going on\nUh from my perspective it's really what we should be looking at it it's not so much the number switch statistically you know you see when when you say twenty percent significant the ... percent but then when you look at the numbers are we talking about for the something off his says investors sent this something of says\nSo from my perspective it's suddenly what drives they'll send a winds of police officers were killed in the line of duty you know we don't know exactly what that I ... and and therefore we don't necessarily always know\nWhether it's some turns that we as saying that is dangerous and disturbing\nI Want to hear more about that but I wanted to ask you about that South Carolina case is that an outlier some of the data suggests that actually most on duty police officer deaths happened because of car accidents and not shootings so is this kind of a violent encounter is that an outlier [noise]\nNot necessarily just to be that most police officers were killed in traffic accidents um but today it's not the case\nIf you look at the most recent yes we're looking more at the embassy is a police officer in meditation and we're looking at an investigative activity um whereas the handling and all persons with mental illness so it's not the traffic violations and ... no longer than\nThe most frequent reasons I'm for this [noise] I mean you're saying\nThat they're premeditated by what kind of of ... as it as it were\nNow people who for simple police officers and I'm of the government which of course they are and then motivated by the\nPolitical beliefs that you know the police found that to press the police are biased racist and and um with Senate things the last two years in general the climate on in the last few years is that on that policing and I think so\nThey too violent behavior as an outcome of mental illness plus that triggering event then you have to cut us off without them\nSo if somebody's looking at let's take yesterday event and in the sea and the steps of the Supreme Court you think police officers pushing back the demonstrators so somebody looking at police officers\nIdentify them as part of this ... this thought that the government that are demonstrating against so it doesn't take much to take your anger out of the police officer because it kind of take your anger out to get on a given politics and instead you you're doing it against a preventative for the government was a police officer\nBefore we conclude here both in cases of police violence against citizens in the cases of\nPolice officers being harmed by civilians off and the question of training comes up now that is one of your areas of expertise or their training issues that you think we should be talking about here in connection with us\n... when we looking both on the investigative enforcement um deaths and the ones that are part of the ... the active it if it is definitely\nA training in your office so frequently a sit in the car and a police car and and feel comfortable and feel safe and secure and this is not something that ah\nIt's always a reasonable thing to do given that particular environment and given that said ... political development that might be putting their lives and then ... so this tactical issue is how you approach and the ... and how you go to the house or well you know that it's a fast but who is armed and dangerous\nBut I mean we have Eighteen thousand police agencies and when you have a thing south ... police agencies you cannot Institute standards for recruitment standards for training which would help us make gay the negative perception of of policing because the profession\nBut more broadly do do you feel that there was also an issue of violence directed at police officers that needs more public attention\nAbsolutely I mean to me it's absolutely on the festival\nThat nine officers in one year aren't killed in that line of duty of an outcome most premeditated activities that was directed against them explicitly another democratic society should accept a nine police officers in the one young separate incidents killed by members of the topic this is absolutely cannot accept\nThat is Maria haven't felt she is a professor in the department of la police science at criminal justice administration at
