Supreme court\nThis afternoon the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh on a vote a fifty two forty eight one of the closest margins ever\nMinutes later the White House announced that he would be sworn in during a private ceremony later today NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow was in the Senate for the final vote and he's with us now from Capitol Hill Scott welcome thanks for joining us same show so first of all set the scene for us for people who are not able to watch it\nYou know these votes are one of the most formal moments that ever happened in the Senate Senator sit at their desk and vote one by one while the vice president presides so ads that what's happening person after person in the gallery interrupted with visceral personal protests stir mansion\n[noise]\nCircles who spent [noise]\nCharging it arms will restore order in the gallery\nSo that's that's a woman yelling at Joe mansion that she was an assault or survivor that he's putting his personal politics ahead of her experience that happened over and over again another man yelled at Jeff Flake that he was a coward and all Thirteen people were removed from the gallery during the vote\nAnd I think that sums up this whole story in one scene descended struggling with its formal responsibilities mean hyper partisanship an emotional set of circumstances and both parties retreating to their tribal basis\nThis has all been so partisan and divisive but even accounting for the theatrics county that people sometimes bring to politics gets you have a sense of this anger will linger in the Senate\nI think so uh senators from both parties are incredibly angry for very different reasons and just listen to some of today's concluding speeches Mazie Hirono Democrat from Hawaii says this is another case of a woman being ignored\nThat's what I Am left with Mr President anger Harry discuss and a process that could not see the truth of what Dr for I Try to tell us\nAnd Republicans feel like this has been character assassination from day one here's John Cornyn\nI Am disappointed more than I can say those who of unleashed these unjustified attacks on the judge and his family\nAnd\nDisappointed than their lack of any empathy for remorse for what they have put them through\nWhat let's talk about that for a minute let's talk about the Republican view for him and his got because because many senators have said all along that they've found Christine fuzzy forward sincere incredible and yet they effectively discounted their testimony that they talk about\nThat they did Republican after Republican was making that same argument often in in strikingly similar wording almost the exact same phrasing bet Ford was sincere that's a word that kept coming up\nThey said they believe that something happened to her but either that they didn't believe that Brett Kavanaugh was the one who assaulted her or did they just didn't see any evidence backing for it up on that claim that was the final view from Susan Collins of Maine when she made that speech yesterday and\nAnd Pope Francis is ordering a thorough study a Vatican archives regarding former U.S archbishop cardinal Theodore ... who resigned and mixed

from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin as you've probably heard by now the Senate has voted to confirm DC circuit court judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court\nAs you likely also know this has been a trying period for all involved earlier this hour we heard from someone who knows and supports judge Kavanaugh now we're going to hear from Lisa Banks she is one of the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford the woman who told a Senate Judiciary committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her years ago\nWhen I spoke with Lisa Banks yesterday I asked whether for it a psychology professor was aware of all of the women who say they have been inspired to share their own stories of sexual\nThe impact that she has had on this country is tremendous I'm not certain she has a a sense of that yet this the full impact\nAnd I'm not sure we've seen the full impact but but certainly what she has done a has unleashed something that is going to move the country in a better direction and women across the country across the world for that matter a have found their voice to come forward to have the courage\nTo come forward and say I'm a survivor to or to tell their story\n... what does professor Ford want to happen now with the banks you told my colleague Rachel Martin when you spoke with her shortly after her name became public that her goal has been and and is now that the information be provided to the people making the decision so that those making this decision could make an informed decision with all the facts\nThat's happened so what what does she want to happen now\nWell I think she didn't want the senators casting a vote to be fully informed and what would I Would say is that they're not fully informed\nBecause what we did not get was an FBI investigation\nAs FBI investigations are typically conducted they did not interview many many many witnesses who were identified both by Dr Ford buttons Ramirez and by others who would have had important critical information and even corroborating information\nAnd so the senators frankly are not fully informed and casting their vote\nThere there is some evidence that this is having a galvanizing effect on both parties I made it there is some evidence that\nRepublicans are now much more interested in the midterms and they had been previously Democrats or showing similar things that there's there's some evidence that it is kind of energizing both sides if that's the case what do you or what is Dr Ford think about that\nI think what she has done is in credibly important in that she has given a voice to hundreds of thousands of women across the country and throughout the world and so I think that that can't be underestimated and\nThis is going to be an important moment we're going to look back on it and we may be looking back on it in November it may have an impact on November and it it may not I don't know I think it will because it has\nRaised a lot of passions and concerns among the American people and it's a debate we're going to continue to have beyond this weekend and beyond November\nThat was Lisa Banks one of the attorneys for Christine Blasey Ford I spoke with her yesterday before the final confirmation vote\nMm Mm\nThis week Amazon announced a minimum wage increase for upwards of three hundred and fifty thousand workers starting on November first the pay will start at Fifteen dollars an hour\nIt's a bold move for the nation's second largest private employer but as the new cells in some Amazon employees have started to consider the other side of the equation the loss of monthly bonuses and some stock benefits\nWe just have to check in with some Amazon workers from across the country to find out their thoughts\nName is Emily buyers I'm forty three years old\nI work at Jefferson ville Indiana at at Amazon so on a day to day basis I Will work on a computer and just to make sure that our bends match up physically and virtually so I've been at this a film at center since it opened\nUp about six years ago and I am making fourteen forty but after the pay raise goes into effect I'll be making her out roughly sixteen\nAnd I have a son who does travel ball and for me this means more sports equipment more opportunities to go to tournaments that kind of thing so for myself and my family\nI Would rather have the money on my paycheck now then the weight that to you\nName but I'm a Packer at us a film that center on the west coast and I've been doing it for about a year iron Thirteen Seventy five an hour and I will be earning Fifteen or five\nAn hour all it is concerning us mainly is were given a monthly bonus and when our holiday season comes around that bonus essentially doubles and we're worried about not getting our pay out and making less\nLemmings falls to emerging as Andy ... promotional for the last three weeks I wars in the ... I started working in a store is approaching the gun from him very you received a merchandise [noise] to bring the immigrants were\nOn his farm regions and others for hours and no injuries were going to be with me [laughter] and got us in hours after November first\nField there to try to about her during the ... circuit writer now I can do to my farm and better quality or short hairs for which I was my father because they don't have to be looking for sugar full time job you're going to change my life\nSo we wanted to hear more about this we called NPR's Alina Selyukh for more information about Elena welcome thank you so much for joining us thinking who tell us a little bit more about how this Fifteen dollar an hour wage will actually work out which Amazon employees are affected\nAmazon says that about two hundred and fifty thousand of their existing fulltime part-time temporary and seasonal workers who are hourly will get this race to Fifteen dollars an hour\nIn addition they are expecting to hire another hundred thousand employees for the holiday season and those folks will also start at Fifteen dollars an hour\nMost of the employees that we're talking about our warehouse workers\nWho are doing a raise some of the points that were raised by the workers that we spoke with you could hear that some were very excited about it but others were concerned about their bonuses particularly during the holiday season that you've been speaking with Amazon executives what does the company say about how the wage increase is a better deal right\nSo there have been a few reports in a number of anonymous employees who have stepped up and said we're really upset about the law specifically about the monthly bonuses and the stock options are a little bit more complicated essentially used to be that some employees would get vested into the company and they would get\nThis big massive bumped from stocks two years later two years is a long time for somebody who works in a warehouse so the company on that front of the company says\nPretty much majority of the of our workers told us they would rather get the money now than wait for two years for the stock options on the monthly bonuses it's a little bit more complicated\nThe company's response was pretty adamant they're saying it should not be the case that you are making less money with this Fifteen dollar minimum wage then you were before\nSo I think part of the confusion might arise from the fact that this wage increase and the other changes to compensation were announced very suddenly a lot of the employees didn't know that it was coming any idea why why why did they announce the so suddenly and\nNo one is kind of known for making really big announcements kind of out of the blue they keep a lot of really big things close to the vest up at the top of the company on Amazon executives that I've spoken with did tell me that this conversation at the top level was happening for quite some time and they just decided it wasn't worth waiting for anything they might as well just roll with it\nBut one really big thing to keep in mind is that Amazon has been under pressure for quite some time to show that they do treat their workers well there have been a state of stories are highlighting some of the more um questionable activities at some specific warehouses around the country and overseas\nThere was that big a criticism that Amazon got when the company released their median income\nReleased as twenty eight thousand four hundred and forty six dollars this is just above poverty level for family of four\nNow that in a worldwide number as what the company will point out that said this is the second most valuable company it is run by the world's wealthiest man so the contrast has been putting quite a bit of pressure for Amazon to to do something\nSupport for National Public radio comes from life nation announcing ... live in concert that breached don't arena with special

Michelle Martin there's been a verdict in the trial of former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke he was found guilty last evening on second degree murder and other charges for killing Seventeen year old Laquan McDonald back in October two thousand fourteen\nMore than a year later dash cam video sparked large protest when it showed the officer shooting Donald sixteen times Van Dyke testified that he felt threatened by McDonald\nA podcast called sixteen shots from member station WBFO easy in Chicago and the Chicago Tribune have been following the trial it's included riveting conversations with people from all walks of life were connected to the story including with officer Van Dyke and there was tape from the courtroom when the jury returned to\nFor the way you're fine [laughter] guilty of that we find of aggravated\nFor the fire [noise] first WB\nEasiest Gen Y as host of the podcast sixteen shots we spoke with her at the start of the trial a month ago and she's with us once again tonight welcome thank you so much for talking with us once again thank you so let's start with the current state of things and then we'll talk more broadly how would you describe the reaction when the verdict came in and what's the mood of the city now\nThe reaction was one I think of overwhelming relief um there was some disappointment among people who have been following the trials especially activists who believed Jason Van Dyke should have been found guilty of first degree murder\nBut there's also this sense that this is just one case you know in in the seven years leading up to Van Dyke shooting with climate Donald fatally CPT shut nearly four hundred people and all of those shootings were found to be justified and so there's this sense\nThat this is one officer one case but this is not indicative of reform\nWhat are the police saying about this and other people who continue to support officer Van Dyke\nWe heard from the head of the F O P the fraternal order of police who said that really this was a problem of of a lack of officers on the street that officers didn't have access to enough tasers but that Jason Van Dyke was essentially responding to the training he'd been given so that's the overwhelming sentiment\nUm but there has been a stronger response as well from some circles people saying you know officers are going to stop policing act differently if this is how they're going to be judged when they're on the street doing their jobs [noise] what\nWould you tell some of the riveting moments of the trial\nThink the big moment of course when when Jason Van Dyke took the stand and testified chew you know how that they started for him waking up and spending time with his wife and children and starting his day not with an expectation that he was going to have to fire his weapon that day but also hearing from the psychologist\nThe defense team put on the stand um who brought actually pieces of evidence that was damaging for it\nWith band I ah the officers said that driving into the situation he said to his partner something to the effect that we're gonna have to shoot this guy or why are they not firing on this guy is not responding to command\nThe jury took that to heart and and to them it said when Jason Van Dyke arrived on the scene he had the intention of pulling his weapon of firing a shot and and that was a bit of damaging testimony\nNow you've mentioned in ... park has this report it on the fact that this opened up some you know strong feelings in the city about policing and a number of other issues do you have a sense that this is going to bring closure to some of these refs or does it just to keep them kind of laid open\nIt it certainly doesn't bring closure we're looking at decades' worth of history of abusive\nPolicing practices or after the video was released in the shooting\nThe department of justice came in and investigate it CPT thoroughly and and came away saying listen there is a policy and practice when it comes to especially black and brown communities in Chicago where police are over policing where there are abusive practices\nAnd so and talking to activists who are pushing for police perform again they say this is one case that we think to some degree of justice was done but when we look at the police department as a whole you know what his reform looked like\nYou know what is it going to look like moving forward is this consent decree in the city is in the process of\nEnacting a consent decree to reform the police department but is it going to be effective because there have been promises in the past that the police department was going to be reformed there have been different panels for him to try to hold police accountable for their actions and none of that has worked so what's going to happen from here [noise]\n... she's the host of sixteen shots at a podcast from WB easy in Chicago and the Chicago Tribune that's been following the trial of officer Jason Van Dyke

all across the political spectrum but I understand that you were actually telling us what the comments are falling neatly along the usual partisan lines tell us a little bit more\nExactly right or in the show that you're playing the comments from\nMy question to the audience was is what's going on with Brett Kavanaugh and the confirmation hearings motivating you as a vote or is it influencing the
