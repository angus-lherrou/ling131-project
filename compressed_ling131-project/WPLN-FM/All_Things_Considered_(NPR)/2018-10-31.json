NPR's Frank Langfitt is covering the joint military exercises and joins us from Trump time in Norway Hi Frank hey or how you doing I'm good I Know you've been with US Marines and on a warship today tell us about what you saw\n[noise] yeah I was as that are on the U.S has a ... if they have to be a shit as a big flight deck and the U.S Marines were actually launching heavy trucks or huge Hubbard craft 'em and wish it was really striking Ari\nIt was in the middle of a fjord snow capped mountains or they were what they were trying to do is to get vehicles on shore to support thousands of troops in war games of south of here tomorrow\nNow yesterday we saw jets ship's tanks from Germany the U.S Britain and Norway all and lots of other countries all coordinating a mock assault on the shoreline you\nWhy is NATO mobilizing in such a big way right now\nCan't ignore the context NATO spent many years is is we all know focused on counter insurgency in Afghanistan but after Russia invaded primary in two thousand and fourteen NATO seems to be refocusing more than its roots back you're in Europe\nNow the war games that they are staging right now has a NATO forces defend the country that's been attacked by an unnamed invader\nWas it really trying to emphasize here is a pillar of NATO which is if one country as a tactic seen as as an attack on all NATO members now a most assume this fictitious invaders Russia or early\nIt seems to NATO stir these huge military maneuvers by NATO and the Russians makes it sound like we're returning to something like the Cold War is there talk of that they're in Norway where you are\nActually already they're very careful to say this is not a new Cold War but they also admit you know the global landscape has changed and NATO's showing strength I was on the ship today speaking with us Admiral James ... he's head of NATO joint forces command in Naples, Italy and he said this is one of the messages\nWe can no longer expect to operate in the area of the north Atlantic with impunity so we may be challenged they're so ah if we're challenged or we will respond to that challenge\nSo whatever all photo saying is you know if anybody's thinking of challenging NATO they need they frankly they need to think twice\nAnd of course President Trump has not been for him about the U.S commitment to NATO as some of his predecessors I mean he's publicly berated some NATO member countries for not spending enough on defense is that tension playing out as these exercises unfold\nNo certainly not on the surface and there's a real emphasis on unity here in the United states heavy commitment we have Seventy five hundred Marines here I was talking to you and Stoltenberg he's the NATO secretary general he says there's a difference between the political rhetoric you here and actually the troops on the ground\nWhat we see is stunts or they're not just states is increasing its presence military presence in uh Europe would more forces more exercises more pre positioned equipment for the first time they're also US Marines in Norway\nIs with the message here is the United states is still very very engaged in NATO\nThat's NPR's Frank

after another shooting injured congresswoman Gabby Giffords in twenty eleven the incident killed six and wounded Thirteen I have\nTo say to him I've been surprised at the number of times we're we're in we're holding a discussion were holding a conversation across differences\nAnd some of them will actually say that they believe we could come to a civil war again in the United states but then she said many people back off from their initial conclusions they do say no I don't I don't really believe that will have a civil war but I find some of what I see happening\nFrightening enough to think of it that way modern civil conflicts don't have to involve marching armies are Pickett's Charge\nConflicts emerge one episode of political violence become more sustained\nSo could it happen in our era here's ... again I came of age\nDuring the Vietnam War so I came of age in a time in which differences on policy issues did lead to violence civil protest that didn't lead to blood in the streets\nSo I Do I Believe this is possible it's part of my own life experience and the concept of a civil war is seeping out into the open especially on the right\nThe civil war and America's horizon reads a headline in last month's the American conservative and on town hall dot com a Trump supporter imagine how a civil war would turn out in why Democrats would lose the second civil war to\nThe extreme fringe has also picked up on this notion here's how one anonymous person framed a threat earlier this year to the New York times is chemical will will save the voicemail and shared it on

capacity to deal with one another and and to focus on one of the prevailing identity the sense that you can't necessarily interact or all work together with someone from a different identity group\nThat's something we see here uh you know in the U.S as we look at some of the partisan political divisions\nThe way to prevent disagreements from becoming violence according to experts in civil conflict is to be more open to those with whom we disagree\nThe biggest challenge that many people have been in their own lives is really taking the first step to not when you disagree with someone to listen first that job and again I think as you look at the U.S today we're entering a period of of conflict but you know even if conflict is inevitable violence is not vote the way we\nTalk about

S. Chinese scores use financial information\nBut China's system also considers information like what you buy\nAnd how you treat your neighbors if you fail to pay your debt you might find yourself on a sort of blacklist Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia from the indicator podcast brings us this story about life on China's list as untrustworthy people\nLoved one is forty two he lives in ... province in China in one day he went on line to book a high speed train ticket to Beijing he put down his name and payment but right away this page popped up saying he could not complete the purchase\nOf it and they voted on our needs says and the press and it sounded a unprecedented list from the cart\nWas confused why couldn't keep up the street to get you started looking into the situation and he quickly realized why this was happening loud one had landed himself on something known as the blacklist\nLast on customers they live on that uh you're fired from high end consumption which means that you can't take a speed train you can fly\nChina started the block with about five years ago as a way to infuse more trust in banking and financial system and part of this has involved cracking down on debtors creating consequences for people who did not pay back their loans\nLoud one ended up on the blacklist because he was working in the coal industry that was his business he would take out loans by huge amounts of coal and store them but then one day the Chinese government changed its energy policy and the market for coal just collapse\nSuddenly all the whole loud one had wasn't worth anywhere near what it had been and he had all these loans he couldn't pay back and the Chinese court ruled loud one would go on the blacklist\nAnd soon after when loud one went to his bank he found out that all of his account and credit cards had been frozen and one morning when loud one was driving through the center of town he discovered another aspect of being on the on trustworthy list on one of the electronic billboards by the side of the road was his face\nLike up on a big billboard\nAnd none of them are your um\nBe electric ... by the side of the plaza there are like huge screens and they're very eye catching you can't really say them from afar and I saw my my pictures and that's why it's like a picture of on my ID card and my ID card number and my name\nThe billboard said this man is untrustworthy ... says these billboards are all over town\nShe says whenever he went out whenever he to the billboard she would just stop and kind of watch it for awhile scrolling through the untrustworthy waiting to see his face would come up but one day when he was doing that you saw the face of someone he knew\nOr on every ... oh my God this Orson we ... and the same industry as I did all know about their\nLoved ones started to notice a bunch of his former colleagues from the coal industry were also on the blacklist he started calling them saying hey I'm On the list\nTo he started getting people together meeting up for dinner he says these are the only people that he can really be relaxed around what I thought what does\nIt does actually friday the widespread attitude toward the U.S is very resistant people to think why are you you're being happy why do you still have time to be happy or why do you not to go out and make money to pay back\nYour loan so far large ones says you've paid back about three hundred thousand of the one and a half million dollars that he originally owed so still about\nOne point two million to go but even when loud one does manage to pay off his debts getting off the blacklist could be hard we talked to ... and trying to deal with this and by all accounts getting off the blacklist even if you've paid your debt\nWell it's technically possible but it just never seems to happen we reached out to China's Supreme Court about this issue but they didn't respond to requests for comment\nLoud one says he will
