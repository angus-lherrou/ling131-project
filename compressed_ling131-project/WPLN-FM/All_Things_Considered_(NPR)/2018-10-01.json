Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell promises that the Senate will vote this week on Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court\nIt's not clear which day that depends on when the FBI concludes its investigation into claims that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford decades ago when they were both teenagers Kavanaugh ... denies the claims\nThe scope of the investigation is unclear and has been the subject of political haggling ever since the inquiry was announced on friday\nNPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow is here in the studio to walk us through the latest ... a good afternoon let's start at the White House President Trump held another one of those extended unfiltered press conferences today what did he say about having on this investigation stands he said a lot about\nThe investigation and Kavanaugh we had been hearing a lot of reports that the White House had been ordering the FBI to keep the focus very narrow President Trump today insisted that is not the case\nI Want them to do a very comprehensive\nInvestigation whatever that means according to the senators and the Republicans and the Republican majority I Want them to do that\nAnd we do know there's been a lot of conversation between the White House and Senate Republicans about this Jeff Flake is the Arizona senator who forced this week long investigation on friday he said today he has been having a lot of talks with the White House app had the other key Republican holdouts here\nThe Judiciary Committee asked the White House to have the FBI investigate current and credible allegations President Trump seems to be referring to Senate Republicans on this so what's our best understanding of how the Senate Republicans define current incredible\nLindsey Graham gave a definition of this over the weekend to ABC News he said that would involve all the witnesses that Christine Blasey Ford said we're at the party\nAnd it also includes Deborah Ramirez who made that second claim that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a college party\nHere's the thing that's unclear it's whether the FBI could or would broaden and talk to college classmates who have come forward saying that cabinet wasn't telling the truth when he testified about his drinking habits and other things like that a flight was in Boston today here's what he said about what he wants the scope to be\nThat does no good to have an investigation that just gives us more cover for example we actually need to find out where we can find out\nAt the same time though a Senate Republican leaders are moving forward you've seen them and the White House stepped up their efforts to play up the evidence\nThat undermines what what Ford said and backs what Kavanaugh said and that includes a memo from that prosecutor who did the Republican questioning last week Rachel Mitchell saying that based on the lack of hard evidence a reasonable profit prosecutor would not bring this case against Kavanaugh\nAt this point how much control does the White House and Senate Republican leaders actually have over this process\nWell here's what we know we know that they didn't want to be in this position they didn't want to even have a hearing and they want it to have a vote as soon as today or tomorrow on Kavanaugh's confirmation they didn't do either of those things because a flake and the other Republicans who are on the fence said we're just not comfortable moving forward with this\n[noise]\n\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the alliance for a

net neutrality rules created under the Obama administration and repealed under President Trump\nThese are seen as the strongest net neutrality protections in the country\nAnd within hours the Justice Department sued to block the California law NPR's Alina Selyukh is here to walk us through what this means for Internet users like us Hayley not high remind us what net neutrality is and what impact this California law if implemented would have on ordinary people going online\nRight the overarching question of net neutrality is how much power your Internet providers should have over your Internet experience\nSo typically when people talk about and neutrality they mean regulations like\nNo blocking of whatever let's say you went to visit that Internet providers should not be able to slow down an app that you're visiting other elements them times include things like zero rating which is a deal\nWherever I might give you streaming of Hulu that doesn't count toward your a data restrictions but then count Netflix store data restrictions and these are all rules that California put into place they they banned all these things\nBefore the Trump Administration repealed the net neutrality rules there was a really vocal campaign by activists trying to get the FCC not to take this step now that California has gone through what has the reaction been\nWell California was indeed sort of reacting to the massive liberal wave of activism in online activism that prompted\nThe writing of these rules um you know the battle lines have been drawn for a while on the net neutrality debate and then there's still the same on the one hand you've got Internet companies especially the smaller ones like at sea or a video streaming video saying that these rules are critical for them to be able to compete against the bigger companies\nOn the other side you've got the telecom providers you're Eighteen to your arise in your Comcast\nThat have been pushing California to not putting that neutrality rules into place\nAnd are expected to sue California as well\nAnd the Justice Department has already sued California explain why they're doing that\nSo many things actually so it's ...\nI think state it is the largest economy in the United states\nUm it has the power to sort of set the bar for a lot of regulations and they have used that power and they're currently in legal disputes with the department of justice over a variety of policies\nAre including immigration emission standards and often when California sets a standard many companies look around and and I think to themselves that it is a lot easier to just abide by the California standard and sort of how goes California so goes the rest of the\nNation out of the world the Texas play during the Obama administration a economic

they're shocked there when the day after election no one shows up and they're shocked when the guy who was in charge of the nuclear weapons packs up as boxes and goes home and nobody says anything and there's nobody to replace him eventually kind of a month after the election\nThat Trump people send in one guy who was a fossil fuels industry kind of a lobbyist who was they're mainly to root out any interest in the department of energy and climate change and in developing alternative energies ... he comes for an hour\nListens politely and leaves and and so the the whole conversation that might have happened about ... how we manage the nuclear stockpile didn't really happen and then\nA little while later an odd assortment of young people who are kind of personally connected to the trumps are friends of the Trump's sons for example start to turn up inside of the department but they the people the outgoing people\nGenerally had the impression that\nHey ... trumpet especially didn't any idea what they did and be weren't terribly curious to know\nWhy should it matter to most Americans if an agency that they rarely think about is run by people who either have a benign disinterest in the agency or or an active opposition to what the agency was supposed to be doing\nI mean let's take an example or inside the department commerce there's the national weather service the national weather service has\nOver the past few decades got extraordinarily good at predicting the weather I mean it's just gotten it's gotten better and better and it saves lives lots of lives every year with hurricane in tornado forecasts\nThe person that the Trump Administration has appointed to run this operation is the CEO of accuweather whose\nCampaign for the last couple of decades to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the American public so that accuweather can make more money doing it this is a catastrophe for anybody who is in the path\nOf dangerous weather so it matters it matters a lot who's in these places and it's a problem when the person knows nothing it's an even bigger problem and the person as an incentive to screw it up\nAt one point in his book you right there is an upside to ignorance and the downside to knowledge ... what is that upside to ignorance\nSo if you want to do things like eliminate\nShe to generate short term benefits for the fossil fuel industry if you want to eliminate the national weather service ability to communicate with people to make profits for accuweather\nIt really helps not to think too much or know too much about the long term cost of what you're doing because you can just focus on the short term gains and I think that's like a big theme in his administration and the way it's running the government that\nIt's looking for a loss of short term wins at the expense of the long term and assuming we all will just not pay very much attention to the long term and I think they'd be able to do with their conscious is easier to do because they just don't understand about the long term [noise]\nOr these problems that a new administration would be able to easily fix after four or eight years by putting experienced professionals in these jobs\nYou know we have an interesting problem right now because in the first year of the Trump Administration twenty percent of the senior civil service quit or\nSo and those are people who have made a career out a lot of people who really know really know\nThe jobs and the importance of the jobs and on top of that Trump's still hasn't filled half\nOf the top seven hundred jobs in his own government so there's been a draining of expertise out of the federal government and the question is how hard would it be to put back together I don't really know the answer a harder every day\nYou ended his book in ... City Oklahoma with a woman named miss Finley and she says for the last\nTen years I prayed for a tornado to come and take that bar and I didn't\nThink it would take the house to explain why you ended on that note well\nFirst let's explain why mistakenly wanted airborne going ah her husband killed himself in Oregon and she imagined this act of destruction would come and kind of ease or paying she wouldn't have to stare at the barn any longer\nAnd what she doesn't imagine is that with the same tornado that's going to come take her bart is going to destroy your house and she didn't want that\nAnd I thought it was a kind of a lovely metaphor for what Trump voters imagine or how their imaginations worker how the human imagination works ... imagines the destruction it wants it imagines the destruction it wants Trump to inflict on the things that doesn't like about the government\nIt doesn't imagine all the collateral damage he doesn't imagine the damage it will actually do and I think this failure of the imagination is somewhere near the center of what we're going through right now [noise]\nMichael Lewis his new book is the fifth risk thanks for joining us today\nTomorrow on

to see judge Kavanaugh in time for the new term of course that did not happen NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg was that the court today and has this report\nThat they played out like a Hollywood movie with the action moving back and forth between the three branches of government\nAt the White House today the president held a Sunday apple press conference to talk about his new trade deals but inevitably he faced Kevin questions\nAmong them given how partisan Kavanaugh's performance was last week could the president a sure the American people that Kavanaugh would deliver impartial decisions if he's confirmed the court\nThe president never really answered the question well you'll have to ask him that question but I can tell you he's been treated horribly meanwhile behind the scenes at the capital of the Republican leadership was trying to limit the FBI investigation\nThat was forced upon them last week when three key Republicans said they would not support Kavanaugh unless the FBI background investigation was reopened but what that investigation into\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell stressing the limited nature of the investigation and President Trump saying he wants a comprehensive but short investigation\nWell all these machinations for taking place the Supreme Court opened a new term and began hearing arguments once again as in twenty sixteen the court has only eight justices back then Senate Republican leader McConnell blocked any hearing for President Obama's nominee to the court for almost a year\nBut back then Justice Anthony Kennedy a conservative who sometimes sided with the court's liberals was still on the court\nNow he has a retired so today for the first time in well over Thirty years there was no justice like Kennedy or Sandra Day O'Connor both appointed by President Reagan\nWho sits ideologically at the center of the court and today the liberal conservative split was a parent in the first case to be argued a challenge to a regulation under the endangered species act\nThe central player in the case is the ... go for a frog which sounds a bit like this [noise]\n\nThis species lived in only one place in Mississippi and is in danger of becoming extinct when the ephemeral pond that it lives and breathes in is gone after a little ponds dry out periodically and have no fish so the frogs legs don't get eaten\nAt issue in the ... case is whether the fish and Wildlife Service can designate an area in Louisiana where the frogs once lived as a critical habitat so that\nAt some point in the future the frogs maybe move back to this area where there are more ephemeral puns\nWarehouse or the timber company which leases land has challenged the designation as a potential threat to any future development plans after the argument on the steps of the court Noah Greenwald the endangered species director at the center for biological diversity\nExplained why Congress enacted the endangered species act in the first place\nThe Web of life that we ourselves depend on if built of species you know you'd go systems are made of species we all depend on species for food for medicines for clean air for clean water\nWarehouses lawyer did not come to the microphones\nBut inside the court the four liberal justices pointed to language and the endangered species act that allows reasonable actions like this one and the courts for conservatives complained that the fish and Wildlife Service doesn't say what reasonable is\nA four to four tie would mean the lower court ruling stays in place meaning warehouse or

for Internet users like us Hayley in a high remind us what net neutrality is and what impact this California law if implemented would have on ordinary people going online\nRight the over arching question of net neutrality is how much power your Internet providers should have over your Internet experience\nSo typically when people talk about net neutrality they mean regulations like no blocking of whatever what say you want to visit that Internet providers should not be able to slow down an app that you're visiting other elements sometimes include things like zero rating which is a
