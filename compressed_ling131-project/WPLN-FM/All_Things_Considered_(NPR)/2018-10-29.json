Mary Louise Kelly the defense department is sending fifty two hundred active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border\nThis fall as an order from President Trump last week when he said the group of migrants from Central America moving toward that border posts as a national security threat here's air force general parents are ... who's in charge of northern command\nReno border security as national security and the U.S military will advance you'd be these capability to harden the border\nNPR's Tom Bowman is at the Pentagon and he joins me now Hey Tom hey Mary Louise\nTrips to play to the border rate is this fifty two hundred active duty on top of those exist in two thousand\n[noise] uh this goes beyond the two thousand and those guard troops are providing support duty such as transportation aerial surveillance that kind of thing\nAnd the guard is not taking part in any law enforcement activities and these additional five thousand or so active duty army troops will also be in a support role again no law enforcement activity no interacting with migrants we're told\nBut this new group of soldiers will provide more support to border patrol of first sill they'll do what's called hardening border entry points in California Arizona and Texas creating more car bear a barrier is more razor wire fencing of crossing points\nAnd they'll also transport border agencies to more remote locations by cargo aircraft and helicopter there's also a surge by the way of hundreds of additional border agents so\nThese soldiers were also builds camps provide housing medical assistance camp kitchens for these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all week old there's a law called ... which prohibits military forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders of the U.S this is this is all legit\nAt well that that's what the officials say they made clear these troops will not take part in any law enforcement duties or their own leaders support role again and the policy come a time this law dates for the post civil war era in the Eighteen Seventy isn't that was a reaction\nTo federal troops being used in former Confederate States in that law prohibits the military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not going to have contact with migrants will they be armed\nWell some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly military police would be carrying arms uh as far as which others would be carrying arms or of any others are we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay what's the precedent for this time for sending five thousand active duty trips to the U.S Mexico border\nI don't recall the president for sending active duty troops have been some sits in the past and again in a support role\nIn this case uh you know it's pretty large number it's called operation faithful patriot\nThese troops who is doing everything again from constructing camps flying border patrol agents Soviet engineers planners military police pilots medical personnel cooks\nEven lawyers in public affairs staff and uh again general showed us he was asked well wait a minute why is this being done you're talking about the same number of troops now in Iraq and right maybe not as many as in Syria and he basically brushed that all aside and again he said a border security is national security\n[noise] All right That's

NPR News by\nMost accounts Federal Reserve policymakers have been very successful in recent years the evidence low inflation and extremely low unemployment\nBut the fed successes also undermine one of the basic theory that has relied on to understand the economy and health inflation and unemployment are related it's called the Phillips curve NPR's John Ydstie explains\nFor many years the Philips curve accurately predicted that when the unemployment rate was low inflation heated up but these days jobs are very plentiful yet inflation remains very low ...\nGr if you put it in a murder mystery framework or who killed the Philips curve it was the fed up with some ...\nSome Federal Reserve Schumer from James Bullard president of the St Louis Federal Reserve bank who we spoke to about a week ago and what was the murder weapon well Bullard says it was the ... wrong persistent focus on keeping inflation low and stable\nThe fed has been much more mindful about targeting inflation in the last Twenty years and because of that we have lower inflation and more stable inflation and so there isn't much of a relationship anymore between labor market performance and inflation\nSo ... says the Philips curve isn't working\nBut rumors of its death maybe exaggerated it certainly still invoked during the debates within the fed about whether to raise interest rates some policymakers argue that with unemployment so low right now the fed should be raising interest rates are much more rapidly to head off inflation\nFederal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell is taking a gradual approach here he is earlier this month in an interview on the PBS NewsHour\nRetail to fill up the car\nI wouldn't say that it might be arresting\nA little more central bank humor this time in apparent reference to a classic Monty Python sketch a man walks into a pet shop with what appears to be a dead parrot in a cage\nTo complain about such as so often to do this but he blew the whistle they ought to do was thrilled with this was\nWhen I was looking at what\nIs not that interested me\nThe filters curve could just be resting but with the help of his sleeping pill and the form of slow wage growth says former fed economist and one\nTo two different way in which low rate of unemployment lead to inflation is by increasing wages\nAnd wage growth in the U.S has been sluggish which is part of the reason inflation is staying low\nWhat is the Philips curve is dead or just resting its long slumber has been useful for the fed says on who's now a professor at Hamilton College\nUs economies extended period of stable inflation and falling unemployment has allowed the fed to raise interest rates gradually and to pause after every rate hike to see how the economy response thinks fed officials are fine with that situation\nIf you ask the fed do you want low and stable inflation or do you want really rapid inflation because that was confirmed your belief about how the economy works I'd have to believe that most of the people at the fed would say gives me relevance table inflation\nEven if it means that Philips curve is dead John Ydstie NPR News Washington [noise]\n\n\n...

widening divisions even as the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd here's our usual Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey there hello so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blame the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media beers responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents uh and and against the media\nUh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on this rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week oh what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent this was who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known

happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy\nUh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using this belittling nickname for her\nJob [noise] I guess she doesn't know that is what I Am more than she does and I know\nAnd since that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price as the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling him a thief without evidence\nIn many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics will argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're bad on taxes or something like that is that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences beyond the metro what difference might the president's rhetoric\nPeople's views the Trump or as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so it ... you really don't know whether this is going to change any boats or the risk of courses that

extremely low unemployment\nBut the fed success has also undermine one of the basic theories that has relied on to understand the economy and how inflation and unemployment are related it's called the Phillips curve NPR's John Ydstie explains\nFor many years the Phillips curve accurately predicted that when the unemployment rate was low inflation heated up but these days jobs are very plentiful yet inflation remains very low that's got some people writing the obituary for the Philips gr if you put it in a murder mystery framework\nOr who killed the Philips curve it was the fed the kid was so screwed\nSome Federal Reserve Schumer from James Bullard president of the St Louis Federal Reserve bank who we spoke to about a week ago and what was the murder weapon well Bullard says it was the feds long persistent focus on keeping inflation low and stable\nThe fed has been much more mindful about targeting inflation in the last Twenty years and because of that we have lower inflation and more stable inflation and so there isn't much of a relationship anymore between labor market performance and inflation\nIsn't working but rumors of its death maybe exaggerated it's certainly still invoked during the debates within the fed about whether to raise interest rates some policymakers argue that with unemployment so low right now the fed should be raising interest rates are much more rapidly to head off inflation federal\nReserve chairman Jerome Powell is taking a gradual approach here he is earlier this month in an interview on the PBS NewsHour\nSo he was ... to fill up the car\nI wouldn't say that it might be arresting\nA little more central bank humor this time and a pair of reference to a classic Monty Python sketch a man walks into a pet shop with what appears to be a dead parrot in a cage\nI Wish to complain about such as all off it out to do for this but I think that's what's wrong with it I'll tell you what's wrong with this what's really\nThat when I see what I'm looking at what you know\nIt's not that interested me\nThe filters curve could just be arresting but with the help of his sleeping pill and the form of slow wage growth says former fed economist and going\nTo take a different way in which low rates of unemployment lead to inflation is by increasing wages\nAnd wage growth in the U.S has been sluggish which is part of the reason inflation is staying low\nWhat is the Philips curve is dead or just resting its long slumber has been useful for the fed says on who's now a professor at Hamilton College\nUs economies extended period of stable inflation and falling unemployment has allowed the fed to raise interest rates gradually and to pause after every rate hike to see how the economy response owing thinks fed officials are fine with that situation\nIf you ask the fed do you want low and stable inflation or do you want really rapid inflation because that were confirmed your beliefs about how the economy works I have to believe that most of the people at the fed would say gives me Rowan stable inflation\nEven if it means that Philips curve is dead John Ydstie NPR News Washington [noise]\n\n...
