Washington\nAnd I'm Ari Shapiro hosting today from Michigan Radio in Ann Arbor the national unemployment rate is lower than it's been in half a century three point seven percent\nThat's a huge turn around here in Michigan the rate was close to Fifteen Percent during the crash a decade ago the auto industry imploded company's declared bankruptcy we wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry about their paths\nThrough this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside of Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest plant under one roof it was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM shut it down in two thousand ten it's odd standing here\nShe ... yeah I'm sure it is it's crazy what is the phrase will run mean to you at this point when you hear it today\nA sick I get sick sick me just order to see it on a freeway on the way there was a lot it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed down Skidmore was president of a local union chapter and that made him one of the last people to leave\nIt was a December twenty third it was Christmas but uh yeah it was a dark and scary and\nYou know crying all the way which are\nLike Asian somebody\nLike losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and steps on the ... that each of them have taken since then reflect larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don Skidmore wasn't quite ready to retire he went to a different GM plant in Toledo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the writing on the wall\nA buyout [noise]\nNow at age sixty helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in the suburbs it's easier to fall here yeah very elevated you rise a lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen holes and that gives them time it's\nThe days are over and I'm good old days are over\nBetween the golf course and his GM pension he makes less money than he did it the auto plant but he says it's enough\nAre not happy still not happy still miss the people still miss my job representing the oil and all these great and then General Motors just bam you know they shut the door and now we all go our separate ways\nBack then Don Skidmore was married to dawn green they both worked at the plant and I went to meet her neck workplace\nPolicies that eighty so you're good\nToday Don green is a nurse an urgent care clinic she's wearing Halloween themed scribes\nA little bit of everything a little bit of everything from stitches X rays step is a big thing this time of year than\nAfter she left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back to school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and that reflects a bigger shift in this economy as auto industry jobs went away the health care field\nGroup and was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and on about\nYes very much so I noticed once I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really can be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to dawn when the plant close did the thing about marriage have anything to do with all the upheaval that was going on in your professional life\nYeah I Would say because um I at that point was used to being independent\nHe used to being able to to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and wants doesn't that wasn't there anymore I felt like I had to depend on him I think I was searching for that independence again and just couldn't handle it\nSo when you think about the work family that you had\nA willow run how many of them would you say are in the kind of position urine today we're ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled and on their feet [noise]\nI'm not going to say that percentage of them\nIn and it gets kind of emotional Indiana's I guess I always assumed that when you retired he retired and you enjoyed your life after that\nBut I Do see around town people that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and stuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago like Don green son Nick Payton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was hitting and many of them have never found their foot Peyton started working as a clean or on the midnight shift\nAt willow run when he was Eighteen you have that job for about three years\nIt was like AT T's really you know that's how I can kind of like tease me it's like oh hey here's a good job Gail you're going to be set you don't have to worry about getting thousands of dollars in debt for student loans and doing all this you can just work hard here and you know twenty five thirty years retire and just live a normal life but that was not the case\nAs you say when it went down the drain a little bit and\nPeyton has struggled since he left willow run he's been in and out of school and service industry jobs he moved to Florida and came back he just got offered a job with a rental car company at the airport until he starts there he's doing seasonal Halloween were far\nAre running\nAre fireworks going off overhead wired nights terror haunted thrill heart Peyton runs around in a full body costume all night with seaweed dripping off a snack all to face\nKatie to after the economic crash each of these three family members has a job they're all making less money than they did at willow run\nAnd what about the plant itself of seems like a fantasy world or something in an area the current owners invited us to take a tour along with Don Skidmore who was one of the last people to leave when it closed down this is his first time inside the gate since that\nDay he drove him six hurting the freeway was entering\nOur tour guide is Jeff ... is chief technical officer at the American Center for mobility the state formerly known as willow run is now a place where people test autonomous vehicles driverless cars Don Skidmore seems shaken revisiting his past\nI don't know if you remember this this little circle Dr ... office buildings right there yeah so we\nWe left that\nAre like the trees like the leaves on the street scam it cool it's kind of eerie [laughter]\nYou know I remember when it was real it's like two worlds overlapping past and present we pull up to what used to be the front entrance to the plant it's now cut off from the public Skidmore gets out of the car he stands on the ground where he used to lead union members picketing\nTraffic jams fog in our in\nOur cars are driving by themselves and breathing room\nA big sign like a billboard looms over his head the GM logo is long gone but on the cross

in New York and South Florida in particular\nAnd this morning authorities arrested say I'll get an auto zone store north of Miami there was TV footage showing FBI officials and other law enforcement officers are taking custody of a white van that was plastered with pro Trump stickers ah near an auto zone store their family attorney says that the van is say ox\nAre now a criminal complaint has been filed against him in federal court in New York\nHe faces five counts and all including illegally male and explosives and threatening former presidents as well as others can\nCan you tell us a little bit about the clues and the evidence that led the FBI to him\nIt was actually a clue from one of the packages FBI Director Christopher Wray says to the FBI was able to pull a fingerprint off of one of those bubble a manila envelope so we talked about a lot over the past week that fingerprint match say ox a race says there's also a possible DNA connection from some of the homemade pipe bombs that were sent in two separate packages\nAuthorities have also identified a identified a Twitter account that they said belong to him and the clue there was some of the words that were misspelled on the packages match the misspelling on a Twitter account\nWell I Know that you are librarians others that NPR has been looking into his background today tell us what you've learned about um [noise]\nWell he's fifty six years old he is a resident of South Florida are you registered as a Republican in March of twenty sixteen he has a pretty lengthy criminal history in Florida that includes

in custody is that what happens next well\nThe FBI but wants to know whether it's say I was working alone whether there was somebody who was helping him with this the last one to know whether there

News I'm Audie Cornish in Washington\nAnd I'm Ari Shapiro hosting today from Michigan Radio in Ann Arbor the national unemployment rate is lower than it's been in half a century three point seven percent\nThat's a huge turned around here in Michigan the rate was close to a Fifteen Percent during the crash a decade ago the auto industry imploded company's declared bankruptcy\nWe wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry about their paths through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest plant under one roof there was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM's shut it down in two thousand ten\nIt's odd standing here she ... yeah I'm sure it is it's crazy what is the phrase willow run mean to you at this point when you hear it today\nA sick I get sick sick man just the word or to see it on a freeway on the way here yeah it was a lot it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed down Skidmore was president of a local union chapter and that made him one of the last people to leave\nIt was a December twenty third it was Christmas but ah yeah it was a\nDark and scary and\nYou know crying all the way that are\nLikely to somebody\nLike losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and steps on the ... that each of them have taken since then reflect the larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don Skidmore wasn't quite ready to retire he went to a different GM plant in Toledo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the writing on the wall\nAnd took a buyout [noise] now at age sixty he helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in the summer and fall here yeah very elevated you rise a lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to think often about the auto industry and days are over and I'm good old days are over\n... between the golf course and his GM pension he makes less money than he did it the auto plant but he says it's enough\nAre not happy still not happy still miss the people still miss my job representing people and all these great and then General Motors just bam you know they shut the door and now we all go our separate ways\nBack then Don Skidmore was married to dawn green they both worked at the plant and I went to meet her neck workplace policies at eighty see you again today Don green is a nurse an urgent care clinic she's wearing a Halloween themed scribes little\nOf everything a little bit of everything from stitches X ray\nThe ... after she left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back to school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and that reflects a bigger shift in this economy\nAs auto industry jobs went away the health care field group and was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and on about\nYes very much so I noticed once I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really can it be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to ... when the plant close did the thing about marriage have anything to do with all the people that was going on in your professional life\n[noise] yeah I Would say because um I at that point was used to being independent\nHe used to being able to to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and wants doesn't that wasn't there anymore I felt like I had to depend on him I think I was searching for that independence again and just couldn't handle it so\nWhen you think about the work family that you had a willow run how many of them would you say are in the kind of position urine today we're ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled and on their feet\n[noise] I'm not going to say that percentage of them\nIn and it gets any kind of emotional to be honest I guess I always assumed that when you retired he retired and you enjoyed your life after that\nBut I Do see around town people that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and stuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago like John Green son Nick Payton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as
