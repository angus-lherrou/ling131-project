hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Herrera which is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the ...\nAnd a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from a sea floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of a total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar minerals structures in Greenland\nThat was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland where even more ancient two hundred million years older and they've been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should fall on that [laughter]\nHer wits and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures are really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our lack of a better word that kind of look like ... bars they're stretched out ridges that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would is an astrobiologist at NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they used a proto type of an instrument that NASA is planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life\nShe says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks did not support the idea that microbes had left their mark\nIt pointing at at that point from the perspective of\nIt means a lot a lot\nShe says if life could have gained a foothold so soon after the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arise and take cold quickly anywhere it's given half\nA chance now the researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis they still maintain that they have found the world's oldest fossils so far relatively few scientists have studied\nThese rocks that means it's a pretty sure bet that this won't be the last word Nell Greenfieldboyce NPR\nNews [noise] and you're listening to NPR

where\nEverybody ended up throwing places each other in person left to you in very bad don't you and indeed then you could see some very serious impacts of the border so you would have\nA immediately you'd have to check some old goods coming in and out to the u._k. which doesn't have the moment that will quickly to huge queues or the ports coming into person and very quickly the companies in person which rely on seamless flow of goods across borders in Europe they would run out parts factories were closed down\nOn the bank of England is focused this could be actually a very chaotic and

fresh food road could run out very quickly there are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool that will be quite bad and the pursuit company will take a very big his\nSo you're saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicines and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been some sort of stockpiling some certain types of medicines once you introduce border checks the place where there are ... you can have she's\nRunning for miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile cues things just wouldn't be coming through so so there are concerns that they will be shortages something even more distant from the poor so\nPretty serious sets us in our series of being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasury has made an estimate of what was happening in the medium to miss Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock of post you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy in red type ... and that without to business costs\nYou will make it ... percent less attractive place to invest because of a you have less access to the European market the potential for terrorists as well\nSo the Treasury's estimated that within about Fifteen Years UK economy would be about eight percent smaller than otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big hit ... sort of an aircraft\nCrunchy losing hide you wouldn't necessarily know to me that he but over time person will be a poor place and otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe UK leaves with how to deal\nWith the rest of your this has always been something that you're a skeptic some person of clung to the idea that Europe wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because a person as a major destination for European ... so they will be an effect on all manner of\nProducers in France cop produces in Germany\nUm you name it they ... they will be effective because UK off to fix it will become the biggest single export destination for all the all the European Union countries but the point is an asymmetric shock waltz it's true that the other European countries would suffer as a result of new deal the biggest losers will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from a deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or is this is sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\n[noise] ... to be honest I I mean we all ... of the Y. yes I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there is another couple of months ago the differences between the two sides of not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nThere was another potential problem which is that if the reason why the British prime minister doesn't deal in Brussels she then has to sell it to a very divided policy bucking London and I think actually negotiating a deal inside the British Government could actually be positive and negotiating a deal with our European partners so\nAnything could happen but I think my ... and still despite all the negative noises around as the common sense will prevail on that will be a deal at the end of the day\nGeorge Parker is a political editor of the Financial Times

Vassar about why saying sorry is not as easy as it might seem\nYou just like really really interesting study as a way to study apologies\nSo the study was partnered with Hoover so we look we focus on the Ninety five percent of late night so the most extreme ... most late rides there's about a five percent chance that you never come back to her again\nAnd the question is how can we repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between Wilbur and its rider we tested different kinds of apologies and we found that the right kind of apology could basically increase revenues but one to two percent\nBut the wrong kind of apology could decreased revenue I went to two percent which we accepted apologies and involved with the commitments to do better or or not what we saw is that a commitment to do better in the future it it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology and we found that basically two or three months later these commitments to do better in the future\nActually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to do about the future and then the right if he didn't do better cars than maybe maybe for some of them had another bad experience and I as a result those those people punished but more than than the control group that got no apology at all\nDid they ever had a good effect I'm\nNot in our data so [laughter] I think they think they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect or or or a negative effect\nIt is interesting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet it seems like we still want the same level of trust and accountability\nI think part of it is that our brain sort of works on script singer ethics and so you know enter in a relationship with a company we sort of like the same sort of scripted respects trigger in our brain and so because we expect remorse in real life we sort of expect it from a company\nSo what were the what would the apologies that really worked for ... like what was that magic\n[laughter] yeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um\nThat we talked with apologies with or without a coupon and we we ... which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones who sort of increased revenues was uh just with a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or was there are certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were hoping to figure out the the best language but we found that there is no statistical difference between the different languages his mind it seemed to be just money and in fact the message that she might may have backfired a bit what the message was sort of committed to be more in the future\nDo you think this like carry over into personal relationships being that I'm so sorry that I like whatever was late meeting for ten years ten bucks [laughter]\nYou know here's a box of chocolates right or you're the you're the flowers\nFlowers and candy to take on a whole new significance um does it hasn't changed the way like you apologize [laughter]\nPeople thought always wanted to ask you this question how do I was curious I think the main ways changes I because all my friends and my family know that I study apologies and they always are might be skeptical whenever I apologized so I have to like go an

Kelly and as of today marijuana is legal throughout Canada which raises a\nQuestion what happens when Canadians want to enter the U.S given that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters who had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint had smoked in the past\nYes admission of illegal drug use are around you found in the midst of all and to the United states so yes that's possible reporters post\nWere largely the same that border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis I reached out to link Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use when founders welcome to the program thank you for having me on\nSo you listen to that whole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally and Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be a huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about it and trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the matrix based upon that\nSo just to parse this out there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was ... there would be questions potentially being asked if they have\nEver used marijuana and that can be grounds for burn somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister because right now he is a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where are you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable\nYou know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law at the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation less chaotic going forward\nWell I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which is take a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admits that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\n... he's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legalization of marijuana today in Canada and what problems that might cause at the U.S Canada border Mr ... thanks for your time thank you very much\nState of Florida has some of the nation's toughest building codes at least most of the state\nThe rules are less stringent in the panhandle that's where Mexico beach is and that's where hurricane Michael made landfall with one hundred fifty five mile an hour wins a week ago entire blocks were flattened NPR's Greg Allen reports many are now calling for revised stricter\nBeach Lance Irwin is one of the lucky ones his house is still standing he rode out the storm in his home several blocks from the beach\nThat arrived or say come as somebody is trying to get in and the inside door was shaking I knew the rough had gone at that point because everything was shaking I thought just hang in there and I said everything was going to be okay for when last\nDoors windows part of his roof but his home is largely intact the same can't be said for many other residents Mexico beaches Mayer says Seventy five percent of the town is gone\nThe storm surge washed houses on the beach off their foundations to the other side of the coastal road high winds lifted off roofs and knocked down walls quite few gate is the former head of FEMA and a long time in Britain see management official in Florida he points to one reason for the extreme destruction in Mexico beach and other communities in the panhandle\nIn many cases it's old construction that predates the building code\nThey just as a part of Florida that's what I call the Florida it's not a bunch of high rises is not a lot of construction this is all the generational of Florida families many of them were just said that Trump folks that fish the area's\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South Florida Miami Dade in Broward County is adopted strict standards requiring storm shutters and reinforced concrete block construction for all buildings structures must be able to withstand winds up to one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour\nSeveral years later Florida revised its statewide building code John ... a structural engineer in Miami says officials decided not to require South Florida is one hundred and Seventy five miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on the probability of storms in the past and all of that is sort of a those down as you go further north and Florida\nHistorically there have been fewer intense hurricanes in the panhandle but elsewhere in the state in some north Florida communities new construction need only stand when speeds one hundred and thirty miles per hour or less far below the one hundred and fifty five mile per hour winds scene in hurricane Michael\nIn the aftermath of the storm has local state and federal officials assess the damage a consensus is emerging that building codes along Florida's panhandle need to be stricter\nDavid provide

types of construction all types of materials and all types of housing what was not damaged houses that will well engineered\nFormer FEMA ahead Craig Fugate has long believed the wind speeds standards along Florida's panhandle were too low he says when policymakers develop them they left out information about a powerful hurricanes that hit the area in the nineteenth century before accurate record keeping\nAnd it yeah that store back in and out particularly yet Michael back in is going to force a much higher load climate or the coast well in land based on those two storms\nFlorida's building commission is now in the process of revising the state code and his awaiting recommendations from the University of Florida team led by David provide provide says understanding how to build resilience

discriminates against Asian American applicants the case could go to the Supreme Court with broad implications for affirmative action in schools\nYesterday we spoke with an Asian American student who believes Harvard should consider factors including race ... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she is a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered\nKate thanks for having me\nWhy do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think ... diversity and I'd love to see ... policies change not to have faith in it\nNow Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors and that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from the list of factors that Harvard is considering when it assesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think ... when it comes down to that race is sort of something that is becoming not just\nThe factory that a decision is based on I think Harvard as saying that they don't do that but what's in for fair admissions has been showing in court the past few days and has really brought to light is that oftentimes it is the single race factor that comes down to someone's rejection\nStudents learn machines as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of did this with Jewish applicants as well and sort of use the personal ratings artificially keep their numbers lower although they were going higher on everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in this case of allege that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans\nAlmost as a front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups and that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think about argument\nI don't think that that should all clearly affirmative action has failed in at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how affirmative action policies are impacting different communities\n[noise] I'd like you to respond to something the Harvard senior Sally ... said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial he was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead merit means nothing without context what do you think of that idea\nSo I think that a lot of admissions process there should be based on just married but I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that marriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources and opportunities people have available to them is really important but\nI think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at met in the context of race but again like I said married in the context of economic status or something that speaks more to someone's opportunities and resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application that cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that all of us sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever the sort of benefits that are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to ... admissions and instead focus on something like poverty\nBecause when we focus on something like race I think it creates a sort of division and sort of diversity for the sake of diversity and I think chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race\nWhat type of all thank you so much for talking with us today Thanks for having me she's a junior at Harvard and you are listening to all things considered from NPR

up with if it was a totally chaotic an acrimonious no deal where\nEverybody ended up throwing plates that each other in person left to you in very bad judge and indeed then you could see some very

agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool that will be quite bad and the pursuit told me will take a very big his\nSo you're saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicines and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been some sort of stockpiling some certain types of medicines\nOnce you ... the place where there are ... you can have she's running for miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile cues things just wouldn't be coming through so so there are concerns that they will be shortages certainly in more distant parts from the pool so\nPretty serious sets us in our ears are being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasuries made an estimate says what would happen in the medium term if Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock of cost you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy in red type or the board is not without to business costs\nYou will make it ... percent less attractive place to invest because of a you have less access to the European

skeptics in person of clung to the idea that Europe wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because a person as a major destination for European expos so they were the ... effect on all manner of European produces whether it's um and they won produces in France cop she says in Germany\nOr you name it they they will be affected because you pay off the breaks it will become the biggest single export destinations for all the all the European Union countries but the point is asymmetric shock waltz it's true that's the other European countries would suffer as a result of new deal the biggest losers will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from the deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or this is sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\n[noise] I think it's a lot to be honest I I mean we all quite the way\nJust before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago the differences between the two sides of not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nThere was another potential problem which is that if the reason why the British prime minister doesn't deal in Brussels she has to sell it to a very divided policy bucking London and I think how she negotiating a deal inside the

things considered from NPR News\nWhen most people make a mistake they say\nI'm Sorry but what should accompany do when it makes a mistake a recent study looked at the economics of apologies Stacey Vanek Smith host of the podcast the indicator from Planet Money spoke with Benjamin whoa he's an economics professor at Vassar about why saying sorry is not as easy as it might seem\nYou just like really really interesting study as a way to study apologies\nSo the study was partnered with Hoover so we look we focus on the Ninety five percent of lightness all the most extreme ... mostly rides there's about five percent chance that you never come back to her again\nAnd the question is how can we repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between ... and its rider we tested different kinds of apologies and we found that the right kind of apology could basically increase revenues by one to two percent\nOf the wrong kind of apology could decrease Uber's revenues by one to two percent which we tested apologies in of all sort of commitments to be better or or not what we saw is that a commitment to do better in the future it's it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology\nAnd we found that basically two or three months later these commitments to do better in the future actually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to do about the future and then the ... vote lead into better cars than maybe maybe for some of them had another bad experience and I as a result those those people punished uber more than than the control group that got no apology at all\nDid they ever have a good effect I'm not in our data so [laughter] I think they they they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect or or or a negative effect\nIt is interesting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet still seems like we still want the same level of trust and accountability\nI think part of it is that our brain sort of works on script singer ethics and so you know enter in a relationship with a company we sort of like the same sort of scripts and respects trigger on our brain and so because we expect remorse in real life we sort of expect it from a company\nSo what were the what would the apologies that really worked for ... like what was the magic\nThe magic was money [laughter]\nYeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um\nThat we tested apologies with or without a coupon and which we which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones that sort of increased revenues was a just a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or was there are certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were hoping to figure out the the best language but we found that there is no statistical difference between the different languages money it seemed to be just money and in fact the message that she might may have backfired a bit wasn't message just sort of committed to do more in the future\nDo you think this like carries over into personal relationships being that I'm so sorry that I like whatever was late meeting for ten bucks [laughter]\nEr here that you're there are some flowers flowers and candy because it takes on\nA whole new significance um did it hasn't changed the way like you apologize\n[laughter] people don't always wanted to ask you this question how they do I was curious I think the main way changes I because all my friends and my family to do that I study apologies than they would always I I might be skeptical whenever I apologized so I have to like go an extra mile to sort of sound like Ernest insincere remorseful because people are always like oh

the school discriminates against Asian American applicants the case could go to the Supreme Court with broad implications for affirmative action in schools\nYesterday we spoke with an Asian American student who believes Harvard should consider factors including race Kelly ... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she is a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered\nKate thanks for having me why do you believe Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think race nearly treats and illusion and the diversity and I'd love to see and missions policies change not to have race in it\nNow Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors and that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from the list of factors that Harvard is considering when it assesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to that race is sort of something that is becoming not just nearly a factor but oftentimes the fact that a decision is based on\nI think Harvard saying that they don't do that but let's see ... missions has been showing in the past few days and has brought to light is that oftentimes is the single race factor that kind of stand someone's action\nStudents missions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties however it's sort of get this ... as well and say if you use the personal rating tired officially keep fan base lower now than they were going higher and everything else in light of what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in this case have alleged

failed in at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how affirmative action policies are impacting different communities\n[noise] I'd like you to respond to something that Harvard senior Sally Chen said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial he was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of the ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important to how we're thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead merit means nothing without context what do you think of that idea\n[noise] so I think that a lot of admissions process there should be based on just married but I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that marriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources and opportunities people have available to them is really important but\nI think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at net in the context of race but again like I said married in the context as economic status or something that speaks more to someone who's opportunities and resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application that cannot be quantified in grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that all of us sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever the ... benefits that are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to ... admissions 'em and instead focus on something like poverty because when we focus on something like race I think it\nCreates a sort of division in sort of diversity for the sake of diversity and I think chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race\nWon't tell me about ... thank you so much for talking with us today Thanks for having me
