for over a century and the children were born to non citizens should not be granted automatic citizenship\nThey argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system\nI

I've been debating looks like it's more than a decade and now they got a president in office who apparently as fixated on this as well\nIf President Trump does follow through on this proposal there

Tuesday that's a real problem for the Democratic party our co host Audie Cornish has more on the effort to get and keep black women\nAt our jobs that we recently visited a voter meeting organized by

think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past especially with um\nEverything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama with its black women who deliver that W that day and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that\nPower this idea of being taken\nThis year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focus on people of color and twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote\nAnd what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty to Michelle nearly it's underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters\nWhat is counted as you can see he's ... he's the entire labor family we show what is\nWhere the wife of

man in the ...\nBut these women also talked about education and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything reveal Berkes resented the implication that it's a zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and then and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all the your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara early right now she's making her own ... to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem they take us for granted\nAnd over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this boat or block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races and so black women have decided that\nYou know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nWell black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion and right now especially as it relates to education\nDrugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as a relief to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party while we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite\nAnd so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat I'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle was on a Presley in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus his own pack\nWith the CBC the island is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire walls there are several organizations that are not a CB seeds are directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions about who to back and not to back\nBut I on a is a very smart brilliant black woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that she could take on the establishment and when and that's what black women are doing all around the country\nThis is a new day that the old way

is all things considered I'm Ari Shapiro and I melted shank let's turn now to the latest news from the special counsel investigating connections between President Trump associates and Russia\nThe latest is a bizarre sequence of events that raises as many if not more questions than answers the office of special counsel Robert Mueller has asked the FBI to investigate in a legit scheme intended to make Muller look bad\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here to walk us through all of this Hey Ryan either\nRight first what has the special counsel's office at exactly\nWell a spokesman for the office Peter cars says that day\nOh it involves a woman who says she was offered money to make false claims about Robert Mueller cart does not specify the nature of those claims of the specials ... special counsel's office was you know is usually very tight lipped but I did decide to speak about this\nAnd it says it immediately refer the matter to the FBI for investigation the bureau for its part is not competent at this point\nOkay but do we know anything about this purporting plots\nYes but it bears repeating that this is a very very fishy sequence of events up earlier this month in email account that purportedly belongs to a woman in Fort Myers reached out to several journalists and media outlets including NPR\nThis individual allege that she had been offered tens of thousands of dollars in exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct allegations against Muller allegations that would date back to a time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Mueller a at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four\nThe individual sending these emails said she refused she refused the money and any part in this game do we know anything about this woman\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of details in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny\nShe said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track down and individual with a name she provided in Fort Myers and perhaps most importantly the law firm where she says she worked with Mueller in Nineteen Seventy four told me that it has no record of this individual working\nAt the OK so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections what do you make the interesting dining here\nThe timing is indeed curious ... midterms are around the corner as you said and certainly this could be part of an effort to muddy Muller head of the vote a but there's another curious twist here at the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme to pay a woman to make these claims against smaller\nBerkman is a conservative lobbyist to host a talk show on Newsmax Newsmax TV ah which is owned by Trump confidant Chris Ruddy\nBerkman is probably best known as one of the people who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that you may remember or around the killing of a Democratic National committee staffer and twenty six I mean a a theory that has since been dumped some of the news organizations that covered it have actually retracted their stories\nAre no Berkman tweeted this afternoon that later this week he was going to reveal what he alleges is the first of Mueller's a sexual assault victims\nIt's unclear whether that news conference that he's talking about will still go ahead right he's also accused the left of attacking him to deflect attention from Miller\nThe bottom line here in this whole regular regular moral is this the special counsel's office says it has asked the FBI to look into this alleged scheme to pay a woman to make what they say are false allegations against smaller\nVery weird story NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas thank you thank you\nEbola has been spreading

start throwing\nOut yeah and his team did manage to drive off in time but the ... government reports that health workers are being threatened like this three or four times a week\nPartly is because

for years now multiple armed rebel groups have room to the area and not of the central government nor a United Nations peacekeeping force that is thousands strong has offered much protection\nJust ten days ago one of these groups reportedly killed Fifteen civilians and kidnapped a dozen children\nAnd so says put on when an authority figure be from the government or a foreign health worker shows up

Trump insisted he can change that\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nThe full interview airs this weekend on Axios on HBO joining us now is NPR's Joel Rose has all hey our first just fact checked forest can the president do this\nMost constitutional scholars would say he can't do it alone and they would argue actually the Congress couldn't do it alone either they say it would require a constitutional amendment because right now here's what the fourteenth amendment says quote\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states\nIs that seems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a constitutional amendment\nThe president is relying basically on a small but very vocal group of conservative legal scholars who say that the entire country basically has been reading the fourteenth amendment wrong for over a century\nAnd the children were born to non citizens should not be granted automatic citizenship they argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to

and they overwhelmingly voted for Democrats Doug Jones is now senator Doug Jones because of black women they turned out and help to eke out a win for the Democrats during the Alabama special election late last year\nSo if black women don't vote if they decided to just stay home next Tuesday that's a real problem for the Democratic party our co host Audie Cornish has more on the effort to get and keep black women\nEnergized we recently visited a voter meeting organized by higher heights that's a political action group focused on black women voters and candidates and more than a hundred of

political organizers and healthcare analysts are sipping wine munching on tacos and commiserate about politics\nThey actually did not know each other very well once they got settled and they found they had a lot in common first they shared a sense of exhaustion marches and fuzzy hat that followed the presidential election\nThink that the trust was gone by the women's march I have actually went to court [laughter]\nEither ... or this is Michelle nearly she works and communications white women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did in favor of Donald Trump so\nWhite women activism post twenty sixteen too little too late in nearly opinion now in twenty Eighteen it's time for the midterms Kesha Willis believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nI think our vote has been taken for granted um I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past especially with um\nEverything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama with its black women who deliver that W that gay and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focused on people of color and twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote and what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty\nTo Michelle nearly it's under scored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters what is\nIt ... me as far away from family we show what is\nWhat is the wife oh well you\nKnow\nAnd that list of issues important to black women voters isn't that like\n... brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice\nEvery election cycle no one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to I\nThink their chances of being real and that ... we had a stronger voice would actually be an urgent issue and that's what it's actually missing urgency there's nothing ...\nI asked you Williams added racial profiling by law

Brooks resented the implication that it's a zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and then and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all the here dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara late right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this boat or block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races\nAnd sort of black women have decided that you know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we had just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nWell black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that of insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as it relates to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party while we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite and so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat I'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive\nThat will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle was on a Presley in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus is on pack\nWe'll just leave me saying to and is a separate
