California when\nHe allegedly assaulted the deputy and then he was taser several times Mr Kobe later died at a hospital and it might not have reached public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella Coby is Facebook's public policy director for Africa and she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story\nAnd she's with us now from London Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss thank you so much for having me\nNow I have to ask do you think that race was a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this\nIt absolutely was I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother is he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds and it fits the general reporting on these kinds of things when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think that it has been shown that police officers\nAre able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed I mean I think of the classic example is\nUm Dylann Roof who who murdered and who went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to to arrest him without harming him um it it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests from black men in particular versus arrest for white men that very clear racial disparity\nYou know to do that he had been described as six foot three and three hundred pounds of Tony those those are factual details though aren't they I mean if you were to someone you wouldn't you described those things you\nMight not have sampled do you know how tall Dylann Roof is you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as others so as deeply as Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\n... it's been reported that your brother's struggled with some mental health issues is that is that accurate yes that's absolutely accurate do you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to\nSupport the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police or they are often just proportionately the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police to to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that his mental health issues or a factor in this as well\nAbsolutely and I think here you see the impact of intersection nowadays so he is at the intersection of being a person of color a black man at the intersection of having a mental health disability and I think statistics and I think I Know statistics show academy between police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worse\nIf the person as a black man so I definitely think mental health has something to do with and I think there's a huge question about what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who is clearly no mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who's just committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this has come to the fore is that Silicon Valley is often seen as sort of a bubble and I wonder how the tech community has responded to this\nWhenever you have areas where ... privilege in power intersect in the United states they do tend to be bubbles and they do tend to be bubbles that aren't as connected um to issues of poverty that aren't as connected as she does mental health in certain areas and connect it she says race\nIn terms of how people reacted I have been overwhelmed with ... with the port and even the fact that then I have the opportunity to talk about our story and tell her story is a direct result of colleagues at Facebook who thought this was an important story and who um shouted voted ... story that needed to be told\nThat's about a Kobe she's the sister of she naidoo oh Kobe who died earlier this month after being chased by the San Mateo county sheriff's deputy um she's the public policy director of Africa at Facebook\nWith us and I put these to your family once again\nThank you so much for having me\nAs we said earlier police conduct towards civilians particularly when someone dies has become a flashpoint in American Life this happened in Texas last month when an off duty police officer shot and killed an unarmed man in his own home claiming she mistook it for her home and of course apple assigned this is that the officer is white and the deceased man was black\nBut according to research by the Washington Post that had been at least sixty eight police killings in Texas this year alone at Texas state center is trying to address this with education he drafted a law that's just gone into effect requiring that high school students in the state watch a video about how to deal appropriately with police traffic stops\nMe you know my family\nWhy and how you know\nRice West is a state senator from Dallas who sponsored the legislation requiring the video and he is with us now senator west thank you so much for talking with us\nMy pleasure how did you come up with this idea\nFrankly we have an over epicenters of African Americans and Latinos that ended up in a volatile confrontations with law enforcement traffic stops and I guess for land ... is kind of tipping iceberg for me\nIt's still end up steel is an African American man who shot by police officer in Minnesota\nYes and I wanted to see whether I could do something about it in order to at least to fire the\nRight traditions of citizens and police officers and what's lost here\nIs that people are taking the legislation shifts focus on citizens well it doesn't it doesn't just focus on the video is really a kind of sets the stage for additional course contact for both the so to some and also police and police academies\nWhat will be expected of the police officers at the academy what we've done is to find the objectives\nOf a what we want police officers to get while they're in the academy and the fact that the glut of courses at a minimum of two hours the video is just a part of it's sort of a primer\nThe video that we saw at least the video aimed at the students to text to what appeared to be two white teenage girls and they're pulled over by two African American police officers that is not the demographic that we're talking about here and in fact nationally about Seventy nine percent of police officers are white\nUh let me just say this the purpose of the video\nIs as a primer you'll have we need to go back and mix mix it up that's fine we can do that but the purpose is to make certain we define behavior expectations police officers and citizens and the citizens\nKnow what their rights are\nWhen you have a traffic stop if someone wants to get down and picket who was cast in yoga tried I Can't\nForgive me why is that irrelevant when this very issue that use that spark your concern here is an African American man and not get an encounter with a person who doesn't look like him if that's the source of the tension why would you measure let me ask us\nQuestions you can pick out and that's fine because anything that uh do should be able to withstand scrutiny and if I Need to improve on that I Will but the objective was to find a mechanism by which we could have ... behavior content\nFor everyone and I thought getting a driver's license was a perfect place to put their behavior expectations are citizens and make certain citizens\nKnow what their rights or I thought\nIt tore it was a great place to put it also ... driver's license courses and also to police department Michigan and by doing that you're a great deal repetition of ... that repetition will ultimately save lives\nWell but the question I think some people might have is the question the conduct of the drivers or is the question the unconscious bias of the officers\nSupport for National Public radio comes from Muslims optical service family owned for Ninety years providing fashion frames and prescription lenses from there in town labs and customers

courts as a candidate Donald Trump promised to do it as president it's been one of his most touted successes\nAnd why you've probably heard about the federalist society is Roland doing that that's the conservative legal group who's lists of potential judicial nominees has produced two Supreme Court justices another group has also played a key role and the project\nAnd that groups tactics are now raising ethical questions which I knew about the Heritage Foundation that's a conservative think tank based here in Washington DC\nThis week the New York times wrote about a secret training program being launched by the group targeting recent law school graduates who had secured clerk ships for federal judges\nIn exchange for participation and they all expense paid program these clerks which you keep the training secrets and signed something of a loyalty oath [laughter]\nNew York times reporter Adam ... wrote about this program earlier this week which the Heritage Foundation says it has now suspended after his piece was published Adam's with us now Adam thanks so much for joining us is going to be here so what what's the stated purpose of this program how is it advertised\nSo the program was a three day kind of seminar they called it a training academy in which they would teach these potential law clerks about legal concepts seemingly tilted in a conservative direction\nBut you spoke with some legal scholars who said that this raised ethical concerns what were the concerns\nWell they said there may be nothing wrong with a seminar there may even be nothing wrong with an all expenses paid seminar\nBut there was something problematic about requiring the people who attended to keep what they learned secrets probably even from the judges that they were going to serve and something deeply problematic about having to make a promise\nThat whatever they learn will be used for and they're going to quote now from their materials for any purpose contrary to the mission or interest of the Heritage Foundation\nAnd just dig into that like the the ethical concern here is what do you take it to the ethical specific ethical question here\nSo if it looks like in the words of some legal experts are kind of indoctrination a law clerk is an employee of the federal government and the judicial system door clerks loyalties or to run to the judicial system into their judges\nAnd not to a private organization that describes itself as a bastion of the American conservative legal movement\nThat is a concern here that they were indoctrinated and people are just sort of placing an ideology above their commitment to do justice\nThere yeah that that's exactly right so it's it's probably an affirmative good things for law clerks and others to learn as much as they can about all different kinds of legal concepts including ones that come from a particular ideological direction but not a good thing to promise to keep it secret\nFact in a direction different from what the Heritage Foundation wants them to attack and\nSo there are all kinds of groups that exist to create fellowship among the like minded as well as to create pipeline for half of the purpose of think tanks in Washington DC is to create\nPipelines fraternities sororities they all kind of create pipelines um Heritage Foundation has been particularly successful at this they've been particularly intentional at this\nUm creating a shadow government if you will and frightened people on the other side of the I'll do the same thing it does this represent kind of a new strategy for heritage\nI think it's a it's a next step in a program that's been very successful as you say\nIn cultivating in identifying young conservative lawyers who can then be placed on the bench\nAnd heritage will say and there'll be right about this that they're counteracting the American legal academy worth the fancy law schools the professors and students are overwhelmingly liberal\nSo they're trying to counteract that but legal experts say they may have taken a step too far in trying to get into the world of law clerks who have obligations to the justice system\nAnd two judges and to not only expose them to ideas which is probably find but also to make to make these pledges of secrecy and loyalty which legal experts say is not fun\nAnd what his heritage say about this I Do know that when you're a piece published on the on line Thursday that heritage put out a statement said that they were actually suspending this program what else did they say\nThey had been very close melts about it a try them repeatedly before and after the article was published they said it was a private program they didn't want to see\nWho was paying for it you know their materials say the generous donors were making a significant financial investment in each and every attendee they wouldn't say who their donors were they said sitting federal appeals court judges were among the faculty they wouldn't say who those judges where\nAnd when they decided to suspend the program which was supposed to happen in February the just issued a brief bland statement saying they were reevaluating\n... which suggests that perhaps they may try to reconstituted in a different form\nIt's entirely possible years that's Adam attack he covers the Supreme Court and legal affairs for the New York times Adam ... thanks so much for talking to us it was great to be her\nFinally today we are going to head into the barber shop that's where we talked to interesting people about what's in the news and what's on their minds today we want to talk about how Hollywood is putting the opioid crisis front and center in the networks plus the shows\nAnd let me just say that we realized that the tens of thousands of families who are dealing with this every day cannot stop thinking about it\nBut for others the issue was brought forward in a rare way as the subject of the premier episode of the Roseanne ... this week\nThat you might remember the ABC canceled the ... of the popular nineties show after start Roseanne Barr tweeted racist comments then the network decided to try a spin off called the Connors which mere this week and and it we learned that spoiler alert the Roseanne character die by way of an opioid overdose\nI just got a call from a friend in the coroner's office the autopsy found that it wasn't a heart attack Roseanne oh deed on opioids\nPossible we knew she had a problem she was only on pain pills for two days after surgery and it was just I'd be pro [noise] it's got to be wrong\nWe when I could

that provide the inside right and the case or one of the things that was really strange to me is that one of the excuses Roseanne gave when she did that sort of\nRacist tweets that got her fired was
