more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican our state tomatoes live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone\nAmerican society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run Amelia ... what do you think\nYeah this is Gina I think that frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continued to apply right if you're not at the table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an algae woman being a first generation American being a veteran\nI think you know in in so many of those identities I think we just had to stop making assumptions that people are going to carry water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not yeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue\nOur skin wants to try and play mind games at the end of the day I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time Montanans are definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of our government

this is Gina I mean most certainly um I served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that it got you know some wonderful fellow than and turned on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I say don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come in so and so little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you ... and you know I I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan pave the way of says he and twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world looked like Thirty years ago for someone that's my eggs inside a [laughter]\nI I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana I mean just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard the murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable but as a young person I recognize how much ground has been\nMade altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting it was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance\nAnd we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but when you consider where we were back then\nAnd how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long term\nProcess the Trump Administration has rolled back algae beauty cue writes in some areas vice president Pence addressed the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that anti LGBT hate group do think that in the Trump era it is more challenging to gain Republican than it was\nNo I don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans\nHe's asked for our advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents of say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there um were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to watch\nOf color into their political scene I'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we have all the overall national landscape for future LTV tiki candidates as well Gina\nYet I mean I can tell you a you won't believe that I Know that there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what it merely a discussed which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and none of that can I ask ever ask anybody what party they will with so\nIt at the end of the day I think is less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nIs one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just want to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having on young people is more significant and deeper\nThan we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure gene and a male you do as well to those young people that are falling behind us [noise] I Want to thank\nAll three of you for joining us today Dan ... is

information at color guard test dot com and from the listeners who support this NPR station\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Ari Shapiro women in prison are far more likely than men to get punished for lesser violations of prison rolls\nNPR's investigative team has been digging into this disparity this week today NPR's Joseph Shapiro takes us to a state that is rewriting the rules for discipline and women's prisons here's this sound we associate with prison [noise]\nIt'll doors shut\nThese are the doors of the answers to the Iowa correctional institution for women but once visitors like us walk through these doors and get inside the prison that's it there are no more heavy steel door\nBecause this prison is new and it's different inside the razor wire this place looks kind of like a college campus with red brick buildings there knew just a few years old connected by concrete pathways lots of open space and landscape gardens with flowers and picnic benches for the inmates\nThey set out here from John and tell them to ask depending on what level there and that's the warning shows on showing us around and do what we do that and the community as when I was fired her outside and our yard and I guess it's still a\nPrison the Warren is the first to point that out and prisons are still harsh places\nIn some ways women's prisons are especially harsh because across the country women get disciplined that higher rates than men for smaller violations of prison rules they're often two to three times more likely to get in trouble for things like insolence disobedience talking back to a corrections officer\nMatch with NPR and middle school of journalism at Northwestern university found when we collected data from women's and men's prisons in Fifteen states even small infraction is going to have big consequences women get time added to the prison stay go to solitary confinement or lose visitation or phone privileges\nThat matters because more than half of women in prison or the mothers of children Eighteen or younger\nThis prison than Iowa is notable it's trying to make change but it's not easy partly because there are so many rules\nEven today they could get tickets about wearing their sweat shirt and tie down and we're like why is that a security issue that's really not a security issue maybe she had to ... ... um\nThat's the word and show dom in two thousand sixteen our data found women at this prison compared demanded other Iowa prisons where three times more likely to get punished for the violation of being disruptive\nNow dom tells her corrections officers to give out fewer tickets like for breaking the rules about a prisoner can alter their uniform\nIt was written for a men's prison were assured inside out or squeeze rolled up might signal a gang affiliation\nThat that's the thing gang related it's just women\nWant to have some control over how they look about how they present themselves\nNominate putting in place of practice called gender response of corrections it's the idea that there are important differences between men and women in prison\nEvery corrections officers being trained that women take different past the person they're less likely than men to commit violent crimes in prison are less likely to be violent and that women do better when prison is less punitive\nSo Thomas changing the rules so especially about clothing and tone corrections officers to listen to the women more and to demand compliance west [noise]\nTell me that if that were there [laughter]\nOn the mental health ward Stacey runner is in charge of Bella a therapy dog a towering great Dane with a slate gray coat wonders an inmate she came to this prison twenty two years ago\nHe was really hard not to get in trouble back then you had to be careful of everything you did it felt like everything was [noise]\nIt's just meant to be punished\nOnce she was sick and stayed in herself through breakfast another prisoner brought up and down of from the dining hall and put the fire pillow asleep when this crime happened [laughter]\n... got punished for that banana\nIs that she has stolen item [noise] so yeah that was pretty rough\nWouldn't be a violation today but back then wonder says she lost good conduct credits those are days taken off are sentenced for good behavior\nThings from the commissary grinder is serving time per second degree murder now she says the change in the way women are treated here help to grow she works on the mental health ward as a mentor to the other women\nI'm trying to contribute as much say his institution so I mean I saw a shame [noise] you know and it helped me with my own my own shame them I don't regret\nThe psychiatric unit and the newly built prison was designed to be different women are free to walk about large common room with ... therapy animals there are large TV's a carton and lots of natural light there are still solitary confinement cells although fewer women end up in them now\nDr Jerome Greenfield has come to help show us around\nToo so they're they're still here and then\nHe runs health services for all of Iowa's presidents several years ago he quit his psychiatry practice to work at this prison\nThrough the years in my practice I thought I was the fees and psychiatrist I thought I'd seen it all\nBut he wasn't prepared for the level of trauma and the women who come to prison\nI mean I saw patients that had been chain for months at a time in a basement sold his property\nVictims is to panic rituals\nBut it goes even beyond that\nBecause then in their homes many of them were beaten to the point of having traumatic brain injuries\nMen in prison have long histories of being victims of violence too but research in gender response of corrections finds that women before they get to prison for the victims of even more trauma Seventy find the Ninety percent were victims of sexual or physical violence\nSo one thing that's changed here the end of the usual strip search now women can take off one piece of clothing at a time and then put it back on the show dumb the warden\nMainly the correctional officer and really it's a Human Services worker at a customer service\nSome prison staff welcome the change in discipline policies others say there are bigger problems here like not having enough corrections officers I talked to one staffer who didn't want to go on tape for fear of getting in trouble she complained that the warns new approach meant that in her words the inmates are running the prison\nThe warden has heard that before recently from a newly hired corrections officer\nAnd she brought forward some concerns and what she said as you know ordinary sounds people saying that the inmates are running the prison and I'm like well they do there's one at it and Ninety six women so let's talk about how that looks and how do we get a Ninety six cannot cash problems\nDom wanted to show me one other place in the prison the old mental health ward is the one building from the old prison that wasn't torn down [noise]\nAnd it's the one other place in the prison with heavy metal doors the building is dark and deserted now is closed four years ago there are ... sells a guard would watch separated from a station above\nWhen women with mental illness lived here they would often yell into the night this is what prison cells today across the country you really look like for women or men\nIn the human eye people and we put people that\nLive in a bread like us into a room that\nStripped them of all\nTheir senses are dignity\nThat gets back to white giving up fewer disciplinary tickets matters because those tickets even for western fractions often lead the ending up in a cell block like this one Joseph\nShapiro NPR News\nLaura how women running prisoners are making a difference in the way they're up you're listening to all things

bin Salman has developed a close relationship with Jared Kushner President Trump's close advisor ... son in law during pushing her time with the White House that relationship now faces more scrutiny after ... disappearance\nAnd pure White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe chair to tell us more about Cushing has role in shaping U.S foreign policy including port Saudi Arabia Ayesha hello so what can you tell us about Jared Kushner's relationship with my ...\nWe know that they've had at least five meetings in person\nOr since Trump took office their first meeting at the White House was in March twenty Seventeen and they seem to have hit it off they're both in their thirties and there I was obviously in both both in very powerful positions it was Christian or who reportedly convince Trump to go to Saudi Saudi Arabia as his first\nForeign trip that's unheard of presidents usually go to\nAh Canada or Mexico first\nA cushion he doesn't talk much in public but in a speech to celebrate the opening of the U.S embassy in Jerusalem this year he named check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle East that is looking for reform\nIsrael to Jordan to Egypt\nLeaders are fighting to modernize\nTheir countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so this was a relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to the point person first Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\n... it's a bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this but President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide uh this large pool of diplomats on his team and during the campaign he really relied on Kushner a and that continued as president\nAnd so a big part of Christmas portfolio is Middle East peace peace in the middle east and coming up coming up with this deal in Saudi Arabia could play a big role in that\nA U.S ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley was in the oval office recently and she talked about ... role in working on that peace plan and other trade deals\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared in America there is such a genius that no one understand\nSo Haley had nice things to say about ... about Trump or but there have been reports that former secretary of state former secretary of state Rex Tillerson was not\nHappy with questionnaires a influence on foreign policy and both ... and ... they really approach international relations and a different way they focus on personal chemistry personality pretty much above all\nFor now with this controversy where the White House is getting daily questions about it and for secretary of state has flown to Saudi Arabia where do things stand today with Christian or on the crowd for us\nWe don't really know it's not clear at this moment a cushion there was one of the White House official who was reaching out to uh Mohammed bin some on a\nAfter ... show gee went ... went missing the White House said he and other officials are pressed Saudi Arabia to make sure their investigation is open and transparent a but right now the crown prince is denying knowledge of this disappearance\nUh one of the criticisms of cushion there has been from an experienced diplomat\nIs that because he lacks experience that it may be easy to manipulate him a and for foreign leaders to manipulate him I talked to Brett brewing who was a director of\nGlobal engagement for the Obama White house and he said he worries that Christian or could act as a back channel ah to Trump for kind of outside leaders and go outside the national security change\nAnd then there's the question of financial ties between the Christian or family Trump and the Saudis\nYes and a lot of that is not clear because we don't have a President Trump's tax returns and some of that's not clear as some of these dealings are are not transparent\nBut we do know that President Trump said on the campaign trail that he liked the Saudis because they had bought forty and fifty million dollars and apartments from him and there have been reports that\nCushion or a Christian or a backed are associated of firms may have been trying to get money from Saudi backed a fun\nNPR's Ayesha Rascoe thanks a

you and Dan ... is a Republican and New Hampshire running for reelection he's the only openly gay member of the New Hampshire state Senate\nThanks for being with us pleasure to be here well you each first just tell me why you think this year has attracted a record number of algae be teaching people to run for office\nYou know I think what we're seeing is that is we have broader acceptance candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican are states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone\nAmerican society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run a meal your genome what do you think\nYeah this is Gina I think that frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continued to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an algae woman being a first generation American being a veteran\nI think you know in in so many of those identities I think we just had to stop making assumptions that people were going to carry on water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of this race wants to try and get under our skin wants to try and play my games at the end of the day I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time Montanans\nAre definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of our government um we actually had a ballot initiative on our primary ballots that would've uh regulated we're trans individuals could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities um and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nYou get the three of you not only represent different parties and different parts of the United states you also represent different generations Dan you're fifty five Gina you're thirty seven Amelia you're twenty four given how much the country has changed in the last few decades in the way it relates to\nYour experience\nYeah this is Gina I mean most certainly um I served in the air force intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that and I got you know some wonderful fellow than and turned on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I say don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come in so and so little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan pave the way of says he I'm twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world looked like Thirty years ago for someone that's my age and tell you I'm [laughter] and I I mean if\nIt wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana I mean just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard to murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable\nBut as a young person I recognize how much ground has been made altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting\nIt was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance and we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but when you consider where we were back then\nAnd how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long\nTerm process the Trump Administration has rolled back algae beauty he writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that anti LGBT hate group do you think that in the Trump era it is more challenging to gain Republican that it was\nNo I don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans\nHe's asked for our advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there um were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially a trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side is definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we have all the overall national landscape for future algae BP keeps candidates as well Gina\nYet I mean I can tell you a you won't believe it I Know but there is some folks in Washington and Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what ... discuss which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national\nI asked ever ask anybody what party they will with so it at the end of the day I think it's less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nYou know one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just wanted to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having a young people is more significant and deeper than we

wins control of Congress NPR's Scott Horsley reports on what's at stake for health care in the midterms\nRepublican strategist Karl Rove recently wrote an op ed about health care that was headlined the sleeper issue of twenty Eighteen the alarm clock is about to go off voters like Lou Hendricks in Kansas City are telling pollsters healthcare is a defining issue as they get ready to cast their midterm votes\nOr the big concerns that we have as a family is making sure that there continues to be coverage for previous conditions\nDemocratic Senator Claire McCaskill who's in a tough battle for re election in Missouri is trying to tap into that concern McCaskill describes her own struggle with breast cancer in a new campaign\nAd I don't talk about it much but does he face cancer and many other illnesses have a pre existing condition when it comes to health coverage\nMcCaskill blast her Republican opponent Josh Hawley for joining a lawsuit that seeks to overturn Obamacare and as a requirement that insurance companies offer coverage regardless of a person's medical history Republicans insist they will protect patients with preexisting medical conditions though they've been vegan saying how\nDemocrats around the country have seized on this issue Erika Franklin Fowler who directs the Media Project at Wesleyan University says healthcare dominates congressional campaign at out pacing jobs taxes and immigration\nDemocrats had been laser focused on health care that here\nIs the mirror image of what we saw in past election cycles when Fowler says Republicans ran a blitzkrieg of ads attacking Obamacare while Democrats stayed largely quiet\nRegard that said how Americans feel about the cat hair provisions that are very popular once it became clear that those conditions are in trouble I think that has sort of changed the landscape of how politicians will talk about it and ...\nDemocrats are determined to protect those popular provisions if they win one or both houses of Congress in November on the other hand if Republicans keep control they could take another run at repealing Obamacare\nVice president Jessica Anderson of the conservative group heritage action says that could happen during the lame duck session even Republicans lose in November\nMany Republicans won the the LA to finish the job that they've campaigned on this for over eight years\nNo matter which party controls Congress next year Anderson says the Trump Administration will likely keep trying to chip away that Obamacare for example the administration has already relax regulations allowing stripped down insurance policies with reduced coverage\nThe president will still be in office and his administration will still be active in trying to find places to roll back harmful ragged\nBut Democrats might be able to put the brakes on some of those efforts if they win a majority in November Drew Altman has the Kaiser Family foundation and healthcare research organization\nYou're likely to see is much greater and even fears over side of the administration's efforts to change and then he would say undermined\nVoter we heard from earlier calls himself a fan of the Affordable CARE Act even though he's a Republican Hendricks who's retired used to get insurance through his employer but more and more he's leaning towards a single payer insurance system which progressive advocates like to call Medicare for all\nIt makes it easier and simpler for every body with the exception of at no Blue Cross Blue Shield entering the medical insurance company here\nEven if they win a sweeping mid term victory Democrats won't have the power to pass Medicare for all but they might jump start the conversation I had to the next election in two years\nScott Horsley NPR News Washington

has role in shaping U.S foreign policy including port Saudi Arabia Ayesha hello so what can you tell us about Jared Kushner's relationship with ...\nWe know that they've had at least five meetings and person uh since Trump took office their first meeting at the White House was in March twenty Seventeen and they seem to have hit it off they're both in their thirties\nAnd there I was obviously in both both in very powerful positions it was Christian or who reportedly convince Trump to go to Saudi Saudi Arabia as his first\nForeign trip that's unheard of presidents usually go to\nAh Canada or Mexico first\nUh and he doesn't talk much in public but in a speech to celebrate the opening of the U.S embassy in Jerusalem this year he named check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle East that is looking for reform\nFrom Israel to Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond many leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so this was a relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\nIt it's a bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this but President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide uh this large pool of diplomats on his team and during the campaign he really relied on Kushner a and that continued as president\nAnd so a big part of ... portfolio is Middle East\nComing up with this deal in Saudi Arabia could play a big role in that a U.S ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley was in the oval office

manipulate him I talked to Brett brewing who was a director of\nGlobal engagement for the Obama White house and he said he worries that Christian or could act as a back channel ah to Trump for kind of outside leaders and\nGo outside the national security change\nAnd then there's the question of financial ties between the Christian or family Trump and the Saudis\nYes and a lot of that is not clear because we don't have a President Trump's tax returns and some of that's not clear as some of these dealings are are not transparent\nBut we do know that President Trump said on the campaign trail that he liked the Saudis because they had bought forty and fifty million dollars and apartments from him and there have been reports\nThat Kushner a cushion or a backed or associate it a firms may
