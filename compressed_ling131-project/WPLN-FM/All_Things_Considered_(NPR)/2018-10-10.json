the end of the day which took the Dow down from around five hundred points to a eight hundred and thirty points down was due to machine trading uh driven by algorithms that reached levels that called for selling\nGiven the strength to the U.S economy and the likelihood of continued high levels of profit it's it's difficult to believe that the market will continue to melt down\nBut there are a are

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly a team of Fifteen\nSaudis flew into ... last week drove to the Saudi conflict and then deported that same day on private planes headed to Cairo and Dubai\nAnd this is according to the Washington Post which has been tracking the disappearance of Saudi journalist ...\n... has not been heard from or seen since he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second it's not known whether he's alive or dead Shane Harris is one of the reporters working this story for the post and I asked him Fifteen Saudi sounds like a lot to do we know what their alleged operation\nKnow the intent and I think you're right that fate is Fifteen people is a lot to to kill an individual and a a former U.S official I spoke to about this said it actually bears a lot of the hallmarks of rendition or a kidnapping operation but we still\nDon't know but what we are understanding is that the U.S government was picking up intelligence that the Saudis wanted for some time to capture could show you not clear whether they wanted to capture\nAnd prosecute him or whether they want to interrogate him or kill him but that there was some high level interest on the part of the government of getting him in some way\nOkay let's let's unravel that a little bit this is U.S intelligence that allegedly picked up communications of what Saudi officials discussing ... correct\nThis is us intelligent picking up the conversations of Saudis discussing a plan to to lay hands aka she'll get to capture him at the initial plan as we understand that was to try to find a way to lure him back to Saudi Arabia\nAnd capture him there I think probably to show you felt that that was not a safe option to go home to Saudi Arabia and it's possible that this what you're seeing here happening is stumble could be sort of plan B\nOr for that to send these teams to go out there there was one group laying and wait for him we believe at the consulate and then another group that came in after a he may have been captured or are met with his faith there at the consulate\nBut it shows that Saudi officials were very keen on getting him and going to we assume you know whatever lengths necessary to do that\nDo we know what U.S intelligence gained it with these intercepts I ate it they warn ...\nWhat my sources of told me is that this information was circulated in intelligence reports what's not clear at this point is whether anyone from the U. S. government warn ... and there is a standing policy on what's called the duty to warn\nIf the U.S government believes that someone is about to meet with harm or whether that person as a U.S citizen or not there can be an obligation to reach out until that person we don't know if that happened and we don't know whether the U.S government or the White House called the Saudis and effectively said we know which are up to back off ...\nWhy do you think Shane Harris your source want you to know about this in my experience U.S intelligence officials tend to have a reason when they talked to reporters like you were I I think there's a real\nConcern on two fronts one that this was a journalist and a prominent critic of the regime in Saudi Arabia who now has gone missing possibly some harmless come to him and there's a real concern about that but more to the point I think there is a concern within the U.S intelligence community that this administration in particular\nHas become very close to the ruling groups and Saudi Arabia particularly the crown prince Mohammed bin so I'm On a who to be Frank is not really viewed as a trusted figure with in many parts of the U.S intelligence community there is an affection for the old guard and they he replaced that he's sort of ousted\nAnd I think people have a lot of concerns about the the closeness between people in the White House in the current leadership in Saudi Arabia\nWhen you talk about closeness between the U.S in Saudi Arabia you're talking in part about the relationship between Trump's son in law Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman\nAbsolutely jerk ... NBS says he sometimes known in the intelligence community have developed a very close personal relationship and that I think is very much at the heart of us Saudi relations right now they've met with each other in a number of occasions and there's a personal bond there that is translating into policy\n[noise] that's the Washington Post Shane Harris updating us on a couple of the many moving threads of the investigation into what happened to Saudi journalist Jamal ... chain thank you my pleasure thanks Brett\nKavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court has given abortion rights opponents an opportunity that they belong hope for the weekend or overturn roe v weight that's Nineteen Seventy three decision that legalized\nParenthood is announcing a new strategy to protect abortion rights and pure Sarah McCammon reports the Supreme\nCourt can't just get up one morning and overturn roe v Wade the justices would first have to take out the case that would give them a chance to reconsider that landmark decision but abortion rights opponents hope that will happen soon penny Nance a CEO of the conservative group concerned women for America which supported Kavanaugh\nWe're taking a moment here to rejoice and the fact that he was actually confirmed in a very quickly even after the swearing in we were talking about starting to get together and think about you know the the best cases to move forward to sit in front of the court\nSeveral state laws severely restricting abortion are already making their way through the court system including one from Iowa that would ban the procedure as soon as a fetal heartbeat can be detected often before a woman do she's pregnant\nKavanaugh is replacing Justice Anthony Kennedy who was often the swing vote on abortion and other contentious issues\nSo advocates on both sides are watching to see how much the new court is willing to restrict abortion Planned Parenthood executive vice president Don McGahn said in some ways the last several years have been a training ground for what could be coming she says many states have passed laws that force women to go to great lengths to get abortions\nAlready women across this country half to access funding they have to access transportation they have to access housing that have to access support networks that is going to be a greater need\nIf they're further restrictions when row is attacked by this\nCourt those efforts will now be supersized ... says she says Planned Parenthood will lobbies state legislatures to strengthen protections for abortion rights and expand services in states with more liberal laws\nDr any Whittaker is medical director at Planned Parenthood of Illinois she's expecting to see more women coming from more restrictive states across the Midwest\nWe know that we're going to need an ironclad network that states and providers across the country and we're ... and we'll still be legal and accessible no matter what happens on the Supreme Court\nIn the past two years the organization has expanded surgical abortion services from two to five locations in Illinois nationwide Planned Parenthood also will work to increase access to medication abortion and use technology to connect women with information about where they can get the procedure\nBoth sides are also preparing for the mid term elections next month the abortion rights group ... pro Choice America has launched a million dollar ad by telling supporters to vote out Republican candidates this November this that opens with an image of Kavanaugh's face\nRight now women are monitoring\nNamed Raul is also launching a separate campaign to educate suburban women in eight key cities around the country about the impending threats to row for abortion rights opponents Mallory Quigley of the Susan B.

requirements small buses have different safety rules here's where the limousine loophole comes in if you take a car and modify it stretching it out to fit as many people as a bus you don't have to prove it meets either set of standards\nLimousines are treated almost uniquely or we think about motor vehicles\nJason levine is the executive director of the center for auto safety he says the limos should have their own standards because they're neither ... nor buses\nRegulars who started the gym in between the two of them have come up with nothing\nLimos are regulated by a patchwork of state and local rules for instance a law just came into effect in California it requires additional rear exits on stretch limousines a few years ago a bride and four of her friends died when they were trapped in the back of a limo that caught on fire\nThe local limo industry fought hard against the bill crews and find has the c._e._o. of dread unlocks a limo company in Southern California he says the cost of the new law was difficult for operators especially those using older Lincoln town car stretches\nThe ritual of these modified machines at the ... can be anywhere from a few thousand dollars up to ten twelve thousand dollars by them out sometimes I'm the value of some of those Lindsey\nButtons on ... also says he personally would support more safety regulation\nThere should be a nationwide term jumper regulations that make sure that these vehicles are up to be in a certain point\nSome stretch when those are safer than others he says companies can do hold tests were a powerful

not every company does those tests there are other risks safety experts say Leno's often lack side impact reinforcement and they don't always have to have enough seatbelts for every passenger you can look for a safe or a limo and find tastes as\nSome of the public not care about the ... they seem to care about the price\nRosemary Shanahan is the president of consumers for auto reliability and safety she says the onus shouldn't be on customers to figure out if a limo is safe\nI think it's this really grossly unfair people of course they always care about safety I think most people assume that if they're in the business that the minimum requirements that they have to be\nOn the federal level there's never been a major push\nTwenty Fifteen there was a deadly Leno crash on Long Island afterward Senator Chuck Schumer of New York issue to call for a federal agency to investigate such crashes the agency came up with recommendations but the national limousine association says it never

rates rates on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks that's made the market nervous\nAnd in fact uh this is the fifth straight day of losses for the S. and P. five hundred\nA rising interest rates make stocks less valuable and there's concern in the market about just how high rates will go the Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates gradually and it has suggested it will stop raising benchmark rage between three and three and a half percent so it still has a way to go to get\nThere so the way I understand it said usually raises rates to stave off inflation rate right or their fears and inflation right now well\nFederal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said recently he doesn't see inflation accelerating however the economy is clearly very strong and the unemployment rate is at a fifty year low so\nThere's concern in the markets that wages will begin to rise more rapidly and that could create inflation pressure so you're saying the
