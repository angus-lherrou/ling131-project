finally searched the consulate\nNPR's Jackie Northam is here to talk more about all the latest developments hijacking I made all the way to start with the U.S stands here over the weekend President Trump was warning Saudi Arabia about severe punishment his words if it were discovered that the kingdom had anything\nKnow today the president was using somewhat different words what's the latest\nWell yes you're right today um Trump said that he spoke to ... on any firmly denied any knowledge about what happened to ... I Trump suggested that it could have been a work of what he called rogue killers and make it easier for the king in crown prince Mohammed bin some on\nTo stick to their denials um this despite the fact that ... was last seen going into the Saudi consulate\nAnd if you say the president of the dispatch secretary Pompeo to react to talk with Saudi leaders and the search the consulate today and it may be too soon to conclude this but these may be the kinds of movies you see when countries are trying to find a way out of this increasingly explosive situation\nWhen I ask you about swimming CNN is reporting today they are reporting Saudi Arabia is preparing to report the show was killed during an ... that went wrong in other words that the Saudis might be willing to admit that he was killed a CNN citing unnamed sources do we know anymore\nI I've heard the report certainly but I I cannot confirm them at this time\nOkay so that's something to keep an eye on it to the question of of the U.S in Saudi Arabia and the relationship and whether President Trump has opened a door for Saturday to try to ... when we go out in some way I mean this is very awkward with two countries that are very strong allies\nRight here I Am name this very strong relationship between the two countries that cooperate on things like counter terrorism and there was a U.S political element to this as well certainly Trump has been leaning on Saudi Arabia to keep gas prices low particularly ahead of the mid term elections\nAnd there's a multibillion dollar arms sale on the table as well which goes back to you know creating jobs here in America\nSo they may look at things like whatever happened was not ordered by Saudi leaders or perhaps it was an attempt to detain and interrogate because she'll gee that went terribly wrong um but that would contradict the Saudis clients that the journalists had left the consulate safely\nYou mentioned President Trump today said maybe this was the work of rogue killers um I mean so many people are saying this all the evidence points to Saudi Arabia having had a chance here where is that coming from what kind of reaction is getting\nAnd German town cafe

Louise Kelly Senator Elizabeth Warren has released the results of a DNA test that says there is quote\nStrong evidence she has Native American ancestry dating back six to ten generations this was an attempt to quiet a controversy it'd be a controversy that has dogged Warren for years\nAnd it comes as the Massachusetts Democrat moles a run for president in twenty twenty NPR's Asma Khalid is on the story and she is in the studio now either pay [noise]\nStart with exactly ... what did Elizabeth Warren released today\nShould she released the results of a DNA Analysis conducted by the Stanford University researcher his name is Carlos ... day and he found that a vast majority of warns lineage is of European ancestry\nBut he also wrote that her results strongly support the existence of a Native American ancestry\nYou know in addition to this DNA Analysis Warren also released a campaign style video clips of President Trump mocking heart mocking her at claims of Native American ancestry and sending yet from her family history she had this one scene in particular where she calls ... their DNA researcher and puts them on the line\nYou did five five segments of Native American ancestry with very high confidence where we believe the error rate is less than one of 'em\nNow the president wants to call my mom a liar\nWhat are the facts saying we have a Native American ancestry you're better\nSo you you know you can hear that she's also again pressing the point that this is part of her\nFamily's history is at the history that she says has been passed down for generations and can also here or at least who one of members of the intended audience of that video is the president himself a lady responded to although he has and no one really made it kind of\nA point that he had to respond to she tweeted at him about a promise that he made a sort of\nDaycare at a rally this summer he suggested that if he were to bait to debate her in twenty twenty he would give her one of these take home DNA kits and then he said\nGive you a million dollars for your favorite charity\nTests are the shows your it is you know [noise] [noise]\nSo merely this morning we're in the ass that he'd pay up the million dollars he or she wants this money to go she says to the national indigenous women's resource center that's at charity ever choice\nYou know Trump was asked by reporters about this challenge he denied making that promise even though as you all heard we just heard or the late ... and the war in with after him again on Twitter saying you know asking him if he had memory problems and if they should all call for a doctor and and really you know she's kind of been poking him all day on Twitter\nAnd my cynical to ask you about the timing of this does it have anything to do with ah the aspirations we mentioned that she is eyeing a run for president herself in twenty twenty I think that's a really realistic\nI did this point I mean you know this isn't a campaign ad for the midterms Warren is expected to easily win a second term as a senator this November this is really about what's next right and she has talked about potentially taking a hard look at what's next after the midterms\nAnd she really does want to kind of quiet these these questions they had been trailing her ever since she first ran for the Senate in Massachusetts and twenty twelve\nAt that time her Republican opponent accused her of being dishonest about her her past and you know President Trump of course had\nHis taken to calling her Pocahontas so this is really an attempt to to try to kind of quiet all of this because the twenty funny races going to kick off pretty much just in his mid\nTerm thanks very briefly has quieted all of those ...\n... no not at all I mean I can tell you real quick the Republican National committee said that the test revealed only a miniscule percentage of Native American ancestry that still leaves a lot of unanswered questions All right so that is NPR's

was to mind day and he found that a vast majority of warns lineage is of European ancestry\nBut he also wrote that her results strongly support the existence of a Native American ancestry\n... you know in addition to this DNA Analysis Warren also released a campaign style video clips of President Trump mocking her mocking her claims of Native American ancestry and some vignettes from her family history she had this one scene in particular where she calls ... their DNA researcher and puts him on the line\n... five five segments with Native American ancestry with very high confidence where we believe the error rate is less than one of them\nNow the president wants to call my mom a liar\nWhat are the facts and even though we have a new to murder ancestor you're better\nSo ... you know you

should all call for a doctor and and really you know she's kind of been poking him all day on Twitter\nAnd my cynical to ask about the timing of this does it have anything to do with a B aspirations we mentioned that she is eyeing a run for president herself in twenty twenty I think that's a really realistic\nI did this point I mean you know this isn't a campaign ad for the midterms Warren is expected to easily win a second term as a senator this November this is really about what's next right and she has talked about potentially taking a hard look at what's next after the midterms\nAnd she really does want to kind of quiet these these questions they had been trailing\nMassachusetts and twenty twelve at that time her Republican opponent accused her of being dishonest about her her past and you know President Trump of course had\nHas taken a calling her Pocahontas\nSo this is really an attempt to to try to kind of quiet all of this because the twenty twenty races going to kick off pretty much just in his mid term so very briefly has quieted all of those ... ... no not at all I mean I just couldn't tell you real quick the Republican National committee said that the test
