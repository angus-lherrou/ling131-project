was from start to finish it was pretty clear how she was wanting to vote\nYet she basically used her speeches it kind of closing argument did was as much of that a closing argument for Kavanaugh as anything else\nUm she basically was saying that he is not the extreme partisan that Democrats have been saying he is and she walked through all of the ways that he's more moderate than he's been portrayed and that she did that for more than forty minutes\nAnd she made it pretty tough case there she said that she didn't like that this had become what she called gutter level political campaign instead of a solemn confirmation process\nEarlier today she had lunch with I'm Senator Mitch McConnell and I was in the room there well she was making that speech and he sat in just a few seats away from her and turned his seat so he could walk her well she spoke\nAnd it was it was a it was ... it was clear that he was prepared and ready and kind of knew what was coming to me a little bit more

former Supreme Court justice\nWho weighed in last night and said she no longer believe ... should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens\nIs is that the judge and they should have been in for a when he was nominated but I think that is his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nTo Americans so these are not he said she quit she said questions there that are being raised these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think sure well\nWe don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to Florida\nKnow him well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week will testifying\nWell that that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught\nAgainst him and his reputation and his family that he would have acted like and what time is on I had\nBy the way he acted like Tom and Tom\nI think the response what had been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if he did and damned if he did it the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred up his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as the Supreme Court justices well\nPeople weighing in continuing to weigh in on both sides of it is absolutely right let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice while I forward\nSure one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not based release based on any political or personal beliefs and he is not about the sacrifice that well deserved reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court\nI wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter Ginsburg had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the ... you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut to that specific remarks and he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence\nInvolving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question that he found the tactics\nOf some of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate but when it comes to rolling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respect in the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because she's mad that Cory Booker had his party moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal and he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he and he said there are some things I shouldn't have said what things get what you do not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break he apologized to center ... ah for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the colic but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's strengths and Katie gang rape\nIf that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will\nEnd very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics should have said that\nYou know he I think there is no question that the Democrats you know when you you'd be some of them engaged and the timing of this for a maximum advantage and had a political tinge to it and I I not fault him for responding to that it will not affect what kind of a justice he will be not one iota\nJohn Malcolm thank you it's good to be with

things considered from NPR News\nThe U.S unemployment rate reached an important milestone in September it dropped to its lowest level in nearly fifty years it's now three point seven percent according to the government's monthly employment report today's news is a big positive for many workers a challenge for businesses NPR's John Ydstie has the story\nSarah houses senior economist at Wells Fargo says it's hard to overstate the significance of this super low unemployment rate\nI had a huge deal\nAnd house says the lowest unemployment rate in half a century has businesses scrambling\nThat top concern right here in front of employer if they can't find work hurry that\nCould limit their ability to grow their companies and put a drag on the overall economy but how says that's historically low jobless rate is a positive for many workers\nIt off of course handsome Connecticut implications for wages there\nAre signs that wage growth is finally picking up as employers are being forced to boost paid to attract and keep workers\nEconomist Dean Baker says low wage workers are among those benefiting partly because many cities and states have raised minimum wages to September ... jobs data showed average wages growing at just to point eight percent over the past\nYear but lower income workers experienced much bigger gains\nFour point ... percent over last year so some of the minimum wage was but I think some of that is the tightening labor market\nAnd Baker says the super low unemployment rate is helping those at the bottom of the economic ladder finally get a toehold in the first wrong\nWhen you start to get the unemployment rate down to slow the people who benefited disproportionately those bottom so you're seeing people that historically not been able to get jobs at least recently not get jobs the markets opening up to them\nBlack teenagers are a good example the black teen unemployment rate hit a record low in September that's the good news bad news is that it's still above Nineteen percent\nAnd that's why Baker believes the Federal Reserve should not panic and start raising interest rates more rapidly to keep the economy from overheating [noise] so\nLow unemployment rate the White House took some credit today touting president trumps policies on deregulation tax cuts and trade former President Obama also get some credit for reducing the unemployment rate buy more than half during his administration\nBaker who's senior economist ... the center for economic research and policy says both administrations have case but\nThere's really a\nBakery says remember that just four years ago the consensus among fed policy makers was that once the unemployment rate fell below five and a half percent inflation pressures were built\nA lot of them wanted to raise interest rates you said you know look I'm getting too old to have a problem with inflation\nBut former fed chairman Janet yell and said let's wait and see what happens and that's what the fed did finally began raising rates gradually and has continued that pace under the feds current leader Jerome pile\nYou followed the view many people on the bed and many other economists they would start to slam on the brakes got around five percent and they never would've allowed to get the slow\nAnd Baker says that would have meant millions of people might not have gotten the jobs they now have John

they had the fifty one the fifth wheel and people who voted yes before\nTomorrow when the final confirmation vote comes up now that's not to say that some crazy thing couldn't happen but now I'm not going to happen you know we have to keep those catty outgoing but this means that the support it that that we saw earlier today it seems to stand and it means that vice president Mike Pence did not

saying he is\nAnd she walks through all of the ways that he's more moderate than he's been portrayed and that she did that for more than forty minutes and she made it pretty tough case there she said

Shannon hello this guilty verdict is a huge deal for the city of Chicago what is the reaction\nLove that because I've been able to speak to so far has said that while they were hoping for a first degree murder charge they're satisfied with a second degree murder charge this is something we haven't seen it happen in Chicago for decades so I think for those activists feeling like a moment of celebration\nWe've also heard from representative for police like the police union there of course\nI'm happy with this verdict and concern for what it will mean for policing going forward\nThe convicted police officer Jason Van Dyke actually\nTook the stand this week in his defense during the trial what did he say\nWell he described ... chronic Donald as somebody to be a feta he described his face as a frightening described his eyes as blank um he said that ah\nThat that was ... raised and life up to his shoulder um which is not something you can see looking at the dashcam video of this and said act so the prosecutors really push too hard on why his version of events didn't match with video\nWhat kind of an impact you expect this for to have on the relationship between the Chicago police department and the African American community well\nI think that's hard to say that because I think that the tension here had been more about more than just look on\nMcDonald's you'll have to remember that in addition to this trial there's another trial later this shooting there are three officers charged with conspiracy for exaggerating the threat of aquatic Donald a preventive at night and there were reports and I think that there's this feeling that the shooting was\nA a problem that the community feels but also that feeling that officers covered it up so I think\nWe'll be watching closely what happens in that trial in how the sea reacts to that\nAs we've reported on so many police involved shootings and in so many cases the officers are acquitted this conviction is ... exception what do you think made a different well\nI think the number of shots sixties loon made a big difference in this case I also think the fact that farewell multiple other officers on fame that

Stevens the former Supreme Court justice\nWho weighed in last night and said he no longer believes Kavanaugh should be confirmed here's Justice Stevens\nIs the thing to do and they should have been in for a when he was nominated but I think that his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nJoe Malcolm so these are not he said she said questions that are being raised these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think\nSure well we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's a temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to bar who know him\nWell say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week will testifying\nWell that that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught\nAgainst him his reputation as family that he would have acted like and what time is on I had\nBy the way he acted like in ...\nI think the response would had been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if he did and damned if you did it the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as the Supreme Court justices well\nPeople coming in and continuing to weigh in on both sides of this absolutely right let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nAt that this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice\nForward sure one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not based release based on any political or personal beliefs and he is not about the sacrifice that well deserved reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court\nI wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter Ginsburg had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the all you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut to that specific remarketing or he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question that she found the tactics\nOf the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate but when controlling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respect in the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because she's mad that Cory Booker headed Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal um he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he and he said there are some things I shouldn't have said what thanks get what you do not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing\nHe apologized to center ... uh for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the collar but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's strengths and silver Katie gang rape if that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will\nEnd very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics city is it\nThat you know he I think there is no question that the Democrats you know when you you'd be some of them engaged in the timing of this for a maximum advantage and had a political tinge to it and I I not fault and for responding to that it will not affect what kind of a justice he will be not one iota\nJohn Malcolm thank you it's good to be with you at the Heritage

attract and keep workers\nEconomist Dean Baker says low wage workers are among those benefiting partly because many cities and states have raised minimum wages to September jobs data showed average wages growing at just to point eight percent over the past year but lower income workers experienced much bigger gains\nFour point ... percent over last year so some of the minimum wage law but I think some of that is the tightening labor market\nAnd Baker says the super low unemployment rate is helping those at the bottom of the economic ladder finally get a toehold in the first wrong\nWhen you start to get the unemployment rate down this load people benefit disproportionately those at the bottom so you're seeing people that historically not been able to get jobs at least recently not been able to get jobs the markets opening up to them\nBlack teenagers are a good example the black teen unemployment rate hit a record low in September that's the good news bad news is that it's still above Nineteen percent\nAnd that's why Baker believes the Federal Reserve should not panic and start raising interest rates more rapidly to keep the economy from overheating\nSo who should get the credit for engineering this low unemployment rate\nThe White House took some credit today touting President Trump's policies on deregulation tax cuts in trade former President Obama also get some credit for reducing the unemployment rate by more than half during his administration\nBaker who is senior economist at the center for economic research and policy says both administrations have a case but\nThe fed is really a hero\nBaker says remember that just four years ago the consensus among fed policymakers was that once the unemployment rate fell below five and a half percent inflation pressures were built\nLot of them wanted to raise interest rates\nProblem with inflation but former fed chair Janet Yellen said let's wait and see what happens and that's what the fed did finally it began raising rates gradually and has continued that tastes under the Fed's current leader Jerome Powell\nIf you followed the view of many people on the fed and many other economists they would start to slam on the brakes the unemployment got around five percent and they never would have allowed it to get this low\nAnd Baker says that would have meant millions of people might not have gotten the jobs they now have John Ydstie NPR News Washington\n[noise]\nMm [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News you're listening to Ninety point three WPN land sigh forty eight
