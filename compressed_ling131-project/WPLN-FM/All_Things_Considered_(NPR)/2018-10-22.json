Chang and I'm Audie Cornish\nTurkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan says he'll make a big reveal tomorrow he'll give a speech detailing what happened to Jamal ... and the Saudi consulate and in in ... on October second now all along turkey has accused Saudi Arabia of killing the journalist the Saudis acknowledged it only Friday after denying it for weeks\nThey say the country's rulers knew nothing about the operation claim viewed with skepticism outside the kingdom\nNow to understand the aims of the Turkish government we are joined by a man to slow she's a senior foreign policy fellow at Brookings she just got back from stumble welcome to the program\nThank you so as a point of contacts there has been a rift between these two countries right that predates this murder\nGoes back to the Arab Spring of twenty ten when Turkish president then prime minister air to want assumed that like minded governments led by some of these Islamist parties\nWould come to power this fell apart for him in twenty Thirteen in Egypt when the Muslim Brotherhood elected leader Morsi who was an ally of turkey was overthrown in a coup by cc who was seen as a foe by turkey and backed by the Saudis\nSo essentially a turkey has uh some enemies in the region now right including Saudi Arabia so uh what are they trying to gain in exerting basically pressure on the Saudi Government\nI think there certainly has always been a challenge in a a struggle for a balance of power there in the region I think what we're seeing with air to one right now is particularly directed against Mohammed bin saw him on a known as as MBBS and this was an eye on friends right now\nAbsolutely absolutely of who can ... designated as the air and twenty Seventeen or the one I think never has really trusted him I think he thought that the west was buying into his reformist image while he was engaging and crackdowns\nUh he's thirty three which means he's likely to be in power for a number of decades and I think everyone always saw him as being particularly ah unfavorable to Turkish regional interests and so I think what we're likely to see from air to one in his speech tomorrow is continued efforts to try and impose maximum damage on M. B. S.\nMeaning he wants to replace the new air called\nIdeally I think he would like NBS removed or at least weekend in terms of removing his de facto powers on on the foreign policy side\nSo is this speech directed really at President Trump the U.S is that the the nation that could bring this pressure to bear\nA air to one certainly recognizes that turkey doesn't have the potential to do this on its own and so it really is going to be as you say the United states that is going to have to do this\nOr to one has been quite quiet over the last week and a half and a lot of the information that we've seen coming out has been leaked from Turkish government sources and I think it's not a Turkey's interest to have a complete rift with the Saudis but I think this weekend when there was a very weak admission from the Saudis about what happened and as you noted some\nThan just national programs because we're also creating now our own podcast and we are up to I Believe six or seven I'm actually losing count 'em on that is made possible by your contributions\nYou can make those contributions at six one five seven six zero twenty ten or by going to W.

those at high risk for overdose so some schools aren't taking chances NPR's Tovia Smith reports on the new effort to keep students safe\nOne of the first things colleges are doing is teaching students to recognize an opioid overdose\nAnd what to do leaving them you know Ohio University is using this video dramatization you have to show how ... can that drug known generically as a lock sound can reverse in overdose Ohio\nUniversity as one of many schools that make nor can available through health services and campus police several other schools are starting to distribute the drugs\nMore

boxes on campus that are now also stocked with little bottles of ... nose spray all clearly labeled and read as opioid overdose kits and all free for the taking\nWe felt that it was on the university to provide these because it's a life saving drugs and we're in the midst of an epidemic that affects everybody\nShortly after a student died of an overdose in two thousand sixteen police putting our canon every norm in parking lot and trained more than a thousand people to administer it\nAll you would do you feel those facts you can hold it like this put the tip into the\nPatients natural about regarding down if the nasal passage way once ray ... and then you're done that's in junior ... one of the resident advisors who've been trained\nYeah man I'm reading and I think personally I feel like it's my moral obligation to help someone who was overdosed good positive another person's life\nI think it's good to make and arcane available but it's really tricky situation\nThis student from a different university says he spent about ten years battling addiction he asked not to be identified do avoid harming future job prospects\nDuring his college years he says he overdosed twice and kept failing classes but he says that was before schools were set up to recognize or support students with drug addictions\nThey didn't want to acknowledge the problem like everything's fine at our school but I mean it was probably blatantly obvious on his way of it was pretty bad\nNow one and a half years sober he's back in a new school and works in a campus recovery center the likes of which barely existed even a few years ago his school is also just started giving free nor can to students but only if they ask for it he worries many users or their friends would be too afraid to do that\nBut he says he also sees the downside to just leaving it out for people to take anonymously\nThe con to that is you have no way of offering them further help the only way that we can help them as if we know who it is\nAs colleges struggle to workout best practices some say parents can't afford to just stand by in weight\nUnfortunately our colleges haven't really caught up and I think parents need to get into their own hands\nJillian Bauer reached teaches at Temple University where two students died of overdoses last year she says when kids head off to college parents should send them with nor can as well as fentanyl testing strips\nJust like they were and I'm I'm with condom\nUm they can create like a fee for drug use can for them and tear\nShe dismisses concerns that it may actually encourage more drug use\nLike I don't think that if you're in our student was planning on studying for their exam that having an old strips and their drawer is going to be calling their name to go out and buy drugs and try them\nBut others question such broad based strategies especially for schools with scarce resources even with school discounts narcan runs about Seventy five dollars for two doses emergency kits contain to just in case at Bridgewater State University none of the kids put out last year had been taken yet\nAnd then the two years since the University of Texas at Austin launched a similar initiatives several kids placed off campus have been successfully used the program director Lucas hill says all those on campus remain untouched\nThis is at least one data point that says that may not be cost effective and so we'll see maybe on campus is not the hot spot\nHills now considering placing kits instead at convenience stores in bars\nBut he cautions no locks on alone is not the answer colleges also need to beef up treatment in recovery programs preventing overdose deaths he says is not the same thing as curing addiction Tovia Smith NPR News [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] oh you

auctioned by such a prestigious art house now that is new art appraiser aired Murray Wallace has been following the buzz around the upcoming sale\nAnd she joins us now to talk about how the art world is taking all this and welcome you a pleasure to be here I'll say\nHow controversial is this in the art world for a painting to be painted by a non human and then auctioned off like fine art well I think every\nCouple of generations you have something that happened that begins to redefine what we consider art you can go back to the early twentieth century and you can look at the urine or by Marcel disarmed\nOn a wall right and this completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what aren't actually is for the twenty\nFirst century so I don't think that it is I'm a once in a lifetime moment I think these things happen again and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical contacts\nThat is so fascinating but it does raise the question of how do you\nPrice a painting that is not the product of the human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand that things like technique and the uniqueness of the piece of work those are the factors that drive the price and art so how do you price art where those things don't really apply\nWell they still apply but let's add to that let's add to that the market ability of a painting let's add to it hype that's created around a painting or anywhere 'cause I really\nI tend to think that the whole thing is orchestrated from go they knew exactly where they wanted to price that in comparison with where they wanted to sell it via Christi is\nAll are within the same wheel house in terms of number\nAnd does that or just ration deplete the integrity of the artistic process the rollout\nMy opinion is no because I don't think it is up to any person to define what art is or what art is valued at I feel that art is valued at what people are willing to pay for it\nSo who is the artist in this case is it the code hers who wrote the algorithm is it the algorithm or is it the machine\nOh the artist has to be a little bit of all of those original artists ownership I Do believe is split between the programming the color is the collective and maybe even a little bit of a nod to Christie's for helping to create the frenzy around it and\nGiven that there has been some deliberate frenzied built around this if this painting were created by human do you think it would have the same attractiveness would it garnered the same price\nNo I don't think so I really don't think so I think in terms of are the things that matter the most are the first and this is the first time and a I generated art work hasn't gone to a major auction house to be auctioned off and so this is the first is the absolute first time this has ever happened\nBecause this is a Kansas print\nIt is absolutely possible that the collective could decide to release it in a smaller limited in numbered edition after the sale\nI don't believe that those will be valued as high as this particular one because this is the first\nAaron Murray Wallace is the c._e._o. of rare era appraisals just

Rembrandt but it's actually the work of artificial intelligence is called a portrait of Edmund Bellamy the work was created using an algorithm and it might fetch around ten thousand dollars\nComputer's making art is nothing new but a computer creating a portrait that's being auctioned by such a prestigious art house\nNow that is new art appraiser Aaron Murray Wallace has been following the bugs around the upcoming sale\nAnd she joins us now to talk about how the art world is taking all this in welcome thank you a pleasure to be here Elsa how controversial is this in the art world for a painting to be painted by a non human and then auctioned off like fine art\nWell I think every couple of generations you have something that happens that begins to redefine what we consider art you can go back to the early twentieth century and you can look at the urine or by Marcel disarm where he literally took and then you're in on hanging on a wall right\nAnd this completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what aren't actually is for the twenty first century so I don't think that it is um I once in a lifetime moment I think these things happen\nAgain and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical context\nThat is so fascinating but it does raise the question of how do you\nPrice a painting that is not the product of the human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand if things like technique and the uniqueness of the piece of work those are the factors that drive the price in art so how do you price art where those things don't really apply well they still apply\nBut let's add to that let's add to that the market ability of a painting let's add to it the hype that's created around a painting or anywhere 'cause I really I tend to think\nHad from go they knew exactly where they wanted to price it in comparison with where they wanted to sell it via Christi is all are within the saying we'll house in terms of number\nAnd does that or just ration deplete the integrity of the artistic process the rollout\nMy opinion is no because I don't think it is up to any person to define what art is or what art is valued at I feel that art is valued at what people are willing to pay for it\nSo who is the artist in this case is it the ... who wrote the algorithm is it the algorithm or is it the machine\nOh the artist has to be a little bit of all of those original artist ownership I Do believe is split between the programming the color is the collective\nAnd maybe even a little bit of a nod to Christie's for helping to create the frenzy around it and\nGiven that there has been some deliberate frenzied built around this if this painting were created by human ... think it would have the same attractiveness would it garnered the same price\nNo I don't think so I really don't think so I think in terms of art the things that matter than most are the first and this is the first time and a I generated artwork hasn't gone to a major auction house to be auctioned off and so this is a first it is the absolute first time this has ever happened\nBecause this is a Kansas print\nIt is absolutely possible that the collective could decide to release it at a smaller limited in numbered edition after the sale\nI don't believe that those will be valued as high as this particular one because this is the first\nAaron Murray Wallace is the c._e._o. of rare era appraisals just outside Washington DC thank you very much thank you so much pleasure alpha\n[noise]
