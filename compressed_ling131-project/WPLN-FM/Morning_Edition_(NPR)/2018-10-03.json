department in ... in Texas outside Dallas he's done a lot of sex crime investigations but he's glad that he's not doing the cabin our case\nWe wouldn't want to have any part of that given the the nature of how public that investigation is because anybody with any social me or who's watched it on TV has turned the song so any potential witness for victim is um let's say ten\nIf Cooper did have this case he'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing\nThat's because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing Rebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State who's helped to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nTrauma informed interviewing a saying just because they might have difficulty answering the question\nIt doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in the case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or compromise door hiding something\nThe FBI is just gathering information for prospective employer and the standard of proof is lower still Tom ... says you could do an actual criminal investigation into case such as Kavanaugh's assuming the state statute of limitations allowed it\nThere are clearly hurdles to delayed reporting but that doesn't mean

America there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and an are America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court\nFor Robert Bork the Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination adventure Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat\nThat as being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about our politics of the government work hike okay Hi fi here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process has ended how does it affect their legacy or not well out of a hundred and\nSixty three nominations residents of sense of the Senate a hundred and twenty five and been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\nSo what do you mean that is not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen they've been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington was when the Senate refused to move Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice Abe Fortas after chief also failed and the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWhile the other part of her question is interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like this\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resign from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches then demand President Reagan named after work a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because he had to legally smoke marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until he took senior status a few years back\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee cars that caused him to be removed\nIt would be highly unlikely uh the way you remove the Supreme Court justices through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate that was Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for Thomas Jefferson wanted them off to quit because he disagreed with him politically he accused him of partisan rhetoric\nJohn Randall off in the house representatives had hit wiped the floor with chase a so\nBut then the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the idea of removing adjusted for political reasons and that leads to another question\nHi this is Kelly my heard from ... Connecticut I'm just wondering two other comparable countries have lifetime appointments and have there been any other nominees similar to what is going on now if so what was the result\nOf what is it with these lifetime appointments well lots of judicial plans in various countries most do have either a term limit or a mandatory retirement age summit boats are there been talk of the Eighteen year term limits Supreme Court justices here not likely to go anywhere\nThat would require a change in the law or the constitution OK Cokie thanks very much thank yous commentator Cokie Roberts and you can ask Cokie your questions about our politics and the government work by tweeting us with the hashtag askcokie\nThis is Ninety point three WPN Len Nashville public radio Ninety One point five W T amount of Houma and Ninety One point seven W.

a national presidential alert from FEMA\nRuin red letter is director of the national Center for disaster preparedness at Columbia University says testing system makes sense\nI think having a testing of this new wireless emergency alert system is a good idea that you can think about a variety of scenarios where it would be good for the president can be able to speak directly to the war\nBut this is where Dr Read lender has some qualms especially says when it comes to this president\nWe share of the fact that the president might be using such a shift though for political purposes or get Craig version of the presidency without a threat\nFor whatever reason so I think there are real sure you're right it would be so what about it but these are not ours that many Americans would want to give to Donald Trump\nRed letter is not alone last week three people filed suit in New York to block the testing of the system known as wireless emergency alerts George W E s\nThe suit states the plaintiffs are Americans who do not wish to receive text messages of any kind on any topic or subject from President Trump\nThey say the government is violating their privacy and the sanctity of their homes and that wants to turn people cell phones it's a government loudspeakers that compel listening\nFamous says that accusation is baseless in a background briefing for reporters a senior FEMA

others to let you go and go on the D.C shouldn't be\nNPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce is here to tell us about the winners presumably you're not gonna do it verbatim translate to ask\nKnow who won so half of the award went to France is Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California\nAnd the other half of the award is shared by George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the ... the laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them this on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution\nAnd so basically the idea is they took the principles of Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test to basically you know developing new types of chemicals in the enzymes by inserting an element of randomness to the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by using logic and trying to design right that ends\nArnold uh called that a quotes somewhat arrogant approach and so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness and in the early Nineteen nineties she started trying to improve their performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme\nUp putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzymes and then you could screen those to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the other is who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display it uses a virus to infect bacteria\nAnd it can be used to evolve new proteins and including antibodies that is what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and applied it to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create antibodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness into important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world\nWell you know by using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process\nI mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you can you know develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved I'm In two thousand and two and it targets are rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease\nSo you know other anti bodies urban development that could do things like fight cancer\nWe heard yesterday from a NPR science editor Geoff Brumfiel that the Nobel Z or ... or actually struggling to stay relevant I mean is is that something that a good discussion you've heard around this particular price to\nYeah there's a question about whether it's keeping up with modern times I mean Francis Arnold is only a fifth woman to win this chemistry Nobel in over a hundred years\nUm the prize can only go to three people can't go to

at camouflage they moved only at night um they never used roads they were a foot army but then intelligence did begin to trickle in crystal clear and MacArthur didn't want to believe this because\nHe

America there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and and our America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court for Robert Bork\nThe Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination adventure Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat that it's being battle over now so let's ask\nCokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about our politics of the government work high Cokie Hi Steve here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process has ended how does that affect their legacy or not well\nOut of a hundred and sixty three nominations that residents who sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five and been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\nSo we don't have the means that's not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen they've been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington was when the Senate refused to remove Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice ... forge us up to achieve also found in the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWhile the other part of our question was interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like those\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resigned from his ship and went on to write books and make speeches then demand President Reagan named after Bork a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because he had to legally smoked marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until he took senior status a few years back\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee because that caused them to be removed\nIt would be highly unlikely uh the way you remove the Supreme Court justices through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate that was Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for Thomas Jefferson wanted them off the court because he disagreed with him politically he accused him of\nPartisan rhetoric John Randall off in the house of representatives said hidden wiped the floor with chase\nA so this nastiness is hardly knew 'em dead then the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the idea of removing adjusted for political reasons\nAnd that leads to another question\nHi this is Kelly my her from birth or Connecticut I was wondering do other comparable countries have lifetime appointments and have there been any other nominees similar to what is going on now\nIs so what was the result is that what is it with these lifetime appointments well lots\nOf judicial plans and various countries most do have either a term limit or a mandatory retirement age some at both uh they've been talk of an Eighteen year term limits for Supreme Court justices here not likely to go anywhere and\nThat would require a change in the law or the constitution OK Cokie thanks very much\nCokie your questions about our politics and the government work by tweeting us with the hashtag askcokie [noise]\nWPN National Public radio Ninety One point five WPN outcome of Houma and Ninety One point seven WHM rats can get the latest stories from WPN\nI knew throughout the day and connect with National Public radio via Twitter and Facebook WPN land or you can also find scheduled for all of our program channel and listen to a live stream of any of our programming on line\nLearned more about connecting with National Public radio at W.

scopes I've got to be and how to do this dumped out due to let you go on go on the sea shouldn't be\nNPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce is here to tell us about the winners presumably you're not gonna do it for bait 'em translate oh no I don't know who won\nSo half of the award went to France is Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California and the other half of the award\nUniversity of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the end Marcy laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them is on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution and so basically the idea is they took the principles\nOf Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test tube basically you know developing new types of chemicals in enzymes by inserting an element of randomness to the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by you know using logic and trying to design right the enzyme to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quotes somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties\nShe started trying to improve their performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme up putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzyme and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the other is who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display it uses a virus to infect bacteria and it can be used to evolve new proteins and including antibodies that is what Gregory Winter did took\nPhage display and applied it to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create anti bodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness into important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world\nWell you know by using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process\nI mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you can you know develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved in two thousand and two and it targets are rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease\nSo you know other anti bodies urban development that could do things like fight cancer we heard yesterday from of NPR science editor Geoff Brumfiel ... the Nobel Z\nOr ... or actually struggling to stay relevant I mean is is that something that a good discussion you've heard around this particular price sale yeah there's a question about whether it's keeping up with modern times I mean Francis Arnold is only the fifth woman to win this chemistry Nobel in over a hundred years\nUm the prize can only go to three people can't go to anybody who's dead um some people say that you know ... it's a little bit um archaic in this day and age but I think

America there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and then our America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court for Robert Bork\nThe Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination at the Ventura Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat that as being battle over now so let's ask\nCokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about our politics and government work hike okay I see here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process has ended how does it affect their legacy or not well\nOut of a hundred and sixty three nominations residents of center the Senate a hundred and twenty five uh been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on so what do\nYou mean that is not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen had been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington while when the Senate refused removed Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice aid for deceptive chief also found in the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWhile the other part of her question was interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like those\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resigned from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches then the man President Reagan named after work a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because either legally smoke marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until they took senior status if you use Mac\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee cars that caused him to be removed\nIt would be highly unlikely the way you remove the Supreme Court justices through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate\nThat was Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for Thomas Jefferson wanted them off the court because he disagreed with them politically he accused him of partisan rhetoric John Rand off in the house of representatives had hit wiped the floor with chase\nAnd then the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the idea of removing a justice for political reasons\nAnd that leads to another question\nHi this is Kelly my hair from first Connecticut and I was wondering two other comparable countries have lifetime appointments and have there been any other nominees similar to what is going on now if so what was the result\nThat what is it what these lifetime appointment\nSo lots of judicial plans in various countries most do have either a term limit or a mandatory retirement age them both and they have been talk of the Eighteen year term limits ...
