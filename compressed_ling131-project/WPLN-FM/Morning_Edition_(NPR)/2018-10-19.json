Inskeep in Nineteen sixty five when President Lyndon Johnson went to Congress to propose the voting rights act he outlined some of the bill's provisions\nFinally this legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are not prohibited from voting\nBut even now when it comes to voter registration laws there is a good deal of confusion and in some cases controversy here's Noel King with commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions about how politics and government work\nAhead of this year's election some states have already closed voter registration while other states allow people to register at their polling places on election day what is the deal with this patchwork system what is the deal is Dale All right here's our first listener question\nThis is claiming a heart from San Francisco California I'd like to ask Cokie whether voter registration laws were controversial before the voting rights act in Nineteen sixty five how are the laws changed since the Supreme Court granted black citizens great develop have white citizen ... barriers to voter registration\nThe basic answer is yes voter registration laws were controversial uh at first people staffing the polls were just expected to know everybody didn't in their neighborhood but then in Eighteen hundred Massachusetts instituted the first voter registration and\nAs the century moved on it became more widespread partly in a move to make sure that non citizen immigrants didn't vote by the late Nineteen the early ... centuries a rural dominated state legislatures impose registration on city voters again it was named immigrants and at fraud by big city political machines\nWhat about the the rest of her question there what about the effects on black citizens versus white citizens'\nWell of course black men were given the right to vote and the fifteenth amendment in Eighteen Seventy but the Jim Crow laws and the south effectively\nStripped African Americans of their voting rights in terms of light of course white women and black women couldn't vote nationally until the nineties amendment in Nineteen twenty but you know before the sixty five bill a lot of whites in the south couldn't vote either just because the registration frozen the roles they didn't want anybody new voting\nAll right we have a couple of questions about current controversies\nMy name is Rachel ... from Shaker Heights Ohio why as a candidate for governor allowed to purge voter rolls shouldn't he recused himself a secretary of state law he's a candidate\nBut I assume this is in reference to Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp who is the current secretary of state and isn't thinking about using him so he's provoked a lawsuit by buddy more than fifty thousand new voter applications on hold for minor inconsistencies\nThe lawsuit charges discrimination saying eighty percent of those applicants are members of racial minority groups\nDo they can't vote early or by mail they can still vote if they show up the right polling place with the proper ID\nOkay that that idea of proper ID\nMy name is Amy pigment chart and I live in a lot of ... when I heard about the Supreme Court ruling the ideas for voting would need to have a street address it didn't faze me and I heard that a lot of Native Americans on reservations only have a post office addressed how is that going to affect their ability to vote\nWell they're complaining about it this has to do with the recent Supreme Court decision upholding in North Dakota voter id law which does require a\nResidential street address Native American groups say that off and on reservations they don't have those and plenty Ninety irony that the nation to original residents are being questioned about their residency\nAnd very

I'm Steve Inskeep we're hearing all morning about elections in the United states let's take a moment to check on democracy in Afghanistan the country has been planning parliamentary elections this week up\nMost of the voting will proceed but in a very large populous province the voting has been postponed that after an attack that left to senior officials dead including a top police chief\nPamela constable covers Afghanistan for the Washington Post and she's on the line walking to the\nProgram I'm Glad to be with you I guess we should figure out what was supposed to happen this weekend what is the original plan what's at stake and what's the campaigning bin Laden\n[noise] um the original plan was to have a very big nationwide election more than two thousand five hundred candidates for two hundred and forty nine seats in parliament\nCandidates of all all flavors uh an philosophies ah there was lots of excitement about the election but also lots of concern and worry\nPartly because of threats by the column on which has now come true awe and partly\nWidespread of widespread charges on that there was going to be massive fraud [noise] do you feel a lot of a positive uh campaigning a lot of new fresh faces a lot of enthusiasm but also a great deal of worry a A N and an anxiety at the same time\nSo you've been reporting that in Kandahar Province really large and important province the voting will be delayed for a week but this does raise a question what is possibly going to be any different a week\nRight and we don't know that obviously to sit at a metric taken on an emergency\nUm things down and I'm kind of hard to very large province which is tough law\nIt's police chase its intelligence chase and the governor has been a gravely wounded um there's acute security vacuum people are very nervous and worried\nSo I think that's obviously a measure designed for short term a relief of that I'm obviously a decision will be made later on I I Would take and hope that that elections can be held there because it's a favorite populist lots lots of voters\nBut let's let's see what happens tomorrow on let's see if there's violence elsewhere or not\nUm and to what extent that happens how how bad it is I suspect a generally speaking out they're going to become famous one day at a time here\nDoes it feel and the rest of the country Pamela constable like a democratic process does do do feel like you're in the middle of a reelection campaign where the people's will might be expressed\nI Do it does a it's been it's been a a a a nice experience so to speak out compared to previous\nElections here um\nYou know record record numbers that candidates out and about a four hundred women are among the candidates with it which is extraordinary a for a very traditional society\nLike this one up on the other hand candidates although they've been busy\nAn active have not been doing a lot of public campaigning they've been proved that they've been cautious they'd had inside events um it had a loudspeaker trucks but you have not seen massive public rallies a few have been held in the provinces and some of those have been attacked\nI'm so and and as we mentioned earlier that you had candidates have been killed and\nWell okay Pamela constable of the Washington Post and Afghanistan thanks so much\nIt very

been like\nA plan water here have a very big nationwide elections or that kid out there five hundred candidates for two hundred and forty nine seats in parliament from candidates of all all flavors and philosophy\nBut also lots of concern and worry\nPartly because of threats by the Taliban which has now come true well and partly widespread of widespread charges on that there was going to be

reporting in Kandahar Province of really large and important province the voting will be delayed for a week but this does raise a question what is possibly going to be any different a week\n[noise]
