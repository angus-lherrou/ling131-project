Susan Collins\nAnd we may hear from her at that time so we did it one of those things where we're going to have to walk this throughout the day to know exactly what will happen on that final which will come sometime on Saturday because then it rules require that they ... about thirty hours after they finished this procedure hold up today\nAnd David Greene is co hosting our coverage this morning Kelsey I\nYou know I Wonder if you could talk about how different this moment feels I mean in terms of the procedures and\nAnd what we're watching play out it is very familiar you have senators from both parties standing up and being very passionate and talking about how they feel and and there's this era of of disagreement but then he senators you know they all know each other they get along I mean you you've been reporting on how\nThe culture of the Senate feels very different right now I mean to this day and all this context field ...\nTense moments that I've seen 'em up here in the capital when as I walked into the Capitol today there are barricades set up ... not knowing that there are barricades set up and there are more police you and then I have seen president on from just about any voters any kind\nIt it's just become one of these major flashpoints of the tribalism that we have talked about American politics for the past year or so\nIt seems to be driving people in both parties to their corners and as much as they are still getting some bipartisan work done they passed appropriations bills they passed a bill they they are doing those basic pieces of governance but\nAs soon as they leave the floor and even in these speeches on the floor they will talk about how unhappy they are with each other how ... the other side as well still getting to the basics of government on question is if they can continue to do that or if they fights towers them far more negotiations down the road\nLet's turn to to uh or other colored Scott Detrow congressional correspondent who's in our studios in Washington ... so it tell us what we're going to be watching and listening to hear a head of the food we have Grassley I think a Dianne Feinstein is going to be coming out but but what what exactly are we going to be watching\nYeah and we should say the vote when it begins at ten thirty or could take a very long amount of time we don't call it there's not a hard time living on Senate voted could stretch out for a half hour or more\nA before then we're going to hear from Fort key voices in this debate we're hearing from Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley right now his counterpart the or the ranking Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein will speak next\nShe's played a key role in all of this she of course had that information about Christine Blasey Ford\nFor many weeks before sharing it with other Democratic senators Feinstein said\nShe was trying to respect for its confidentiality request not to share the information but Republicans have repeatedly pointed Feinstein holding that information as one sign that Democrats are didn't necessarily want a fair ... airing of these these\nCharges but rather waiting for the last minute after that we're going to hear from the two leaders a Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and that should bring us right up to the point where they begin voting\nAnd and one question I have to go and I know you've been covering the politics around all of this has has this debate this impassioned debate that seems to be gripping so many people in the country has it changed the dynamics heading into this midterm election in terms of momentum on on on both sides and both parties\nWe think it has and the question is will outlast the remaining month a month can be a long time especially in our current news environment like years except somebody pointed out that anonymous ah op ed from a Trump Administration senior advisor was about a month and I just\nRemember I remember that ugly remember something in the past about that yeah\nBut you know NPR actually had a poll that we know got a lot of tension within the political world showing that the enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans has been all but a race for mid summer until now and a lot of people see the cabin off fight as a key reason a lot of Republicans\nFeeling feeling or under siege and you've seen a shift in the way Republicans talk about Chuck Grassley on the floor just now talking about Democrats are targeting Kavanaugh saying the fix was in ... Republicans have gotten more and more aggressive in painting this as as cabinet under siege a compared to the early days where they were saying Christine Blasey Ford deserves to be heard\nLet's go back to the floor of the United States Senate where Senator Chuck Grassley is continuing and perhaps beginning to wrap up his speech and listen to a little bit more of a\nSexual assault even under the laws standard of proof she concluded quote a he said she said cases incredibly difficult to prove\nBut this cases even ... than that Dr Florida invites other witnesses to the event so knows witnesses either refuted or allegations or failed to wreak corroborate there for the reasons this\nReasonable prosecutor could bring this case based upon the evidence before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standard and the pope\nWe have thoroughly investigated judge Kavanaugh's background in addition to the prior six FBI fall feel\nFeel background investigations were the interviews of nearly a hundred and fifty people who are known judge Kevin all his entire life\nThe committee also separately and thoroughly investigated every credible allegation that were received are more than twenty committee staff members have more night and day over the last many weeks tracking down virtually all leads and at the request of undecided members\nThe FBI reopen judge Kavanaugh's background investigation for another week\nThe FBI interviewed ten more people related to the latest credible sexual assault allegations and the FBI confirmed what we Senate investigators already concluded that is is there is nothing in the supplemental FBI background investigation report that we didn't already know\nThese on corroborated accusations have been unequivocally and repeatedly rejected by\nA judge Kavanaugh and these are the Judiciary Committee nor the FBI could locate any third parties who can attest to any of the allegations there also is no contemporary contemporaneous evidence\nThis investigation found no hand of misconduct and the same is true of six prior FBI investigations are conducted during judge Kavanaugh's twenty five years of public service\nNothing and investigator including career FBI special agents\nDoes ever being good enough\nTo satisfy\nDemocrat leaderships in Washington who staked out opposition to judge Kavanaugh before he was even nominate\nThere is simply no reason then to the judge Kavanaugh a seat on the Supreme Court on the basis of the evidence presented to us\nThe Democratic strategy used against judge Kavanaugh has made one thing clear they will never be satisfied no matter how fair answer all the process is\nThirty one years ago the Senate Democrats treatment as Robert Bork their playbook\nRemains the same for the left wing advice and consent has become\nSort of listening to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa this is special coverage from NPR News we're hearing some voices from the United States Senate as they prepare to vote on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court to vote again today is to end debate the formal vote to actually confirm or not\nWould probably be sometime tomorrow we just heard a reference there to Robert Bork a man who was a nominated to the Supreme Court by president Ronald Reagan in the Nineteen eighties\nAnd ultimately rejected after a campaign by Democrats who said that his views were extreme Charles Grassley argues that essentially the same thing is happening now that Brett Kavanaugh as being ... which is the way the conservatives refer to this I mean the Totenberg is that a fair comparison\nWell I actually don't think it's a fair comparison I'm Robert ... nomination has been a sore point for Republicans now ever since it happened ever since he was defeated\nAnd there's been a lot of academic studies now of the confirmation process and how book fairs and the fact is that Bork went into his confirmation hearings with the votes to easily bacon\nDid have some ads against him and they were chump change compared to what the money to spend today I mean I think they mainly aired in Washington DC so that they would get written about by the likes of being me\n[noise] um but\n... views it turned out he answered the questions quite forthrightly like I didn't have very strong and he had very strong views and quite as it turned out in the view of many Americans and their senators extreme view this\nCase Kavanaugh has pulled his punches quite deliberately are not quite said what is the U.S because actually\nCorrect so ... for example said he's sticking to his use the one person one vote decision was wrong\nKavanaugh or would not\nReally express his views on almost anything he he would always said that Supreme Court precedent um I I as a judge had to follow the Supreme Court precedent or things like that so", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "05"}
