Rachel Martin and I'm Noel King good morning the billionaire George Soros says one of several public figures who've been mailed what are believed to be pipe bombs this week\nCirrhosis of hedge fund investor and philanthropist whose donated to causes many of them progressive around the world and we should note that the open society foundation which he founded in Nineteen Ninety three has been a financial supporter of NPR\nDirt science has a lot of enemies in politics he's been a target of conspiracy theories from the right\nSebastian Mallaby is the author of more money than God a history of the hedge fund industry and I asked him recently if he was surprised to see George Soros among the U.S presidents and other prominent Washington figures who've been sent these packages\nWell the whole phenomenon of the pipe bombs or Mrs surprises me in a pool as me but um if you were to say that somebody was to make a list of you know progressive leaders they want to attack\nThat I wouldn't be surprised to see ... on that list I think he is the single most important known politician\nI'm spearheading progressive causes worldwide\nGeorge Soros has a really interesting personal history tell us about that and tell us how did he make all of his money\nWhen he was born in Nineteen Seventy two or well to do Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary and so his childhood was dominated by the Nazi occupation of his country and he survived by separating from his family and I think that ... explains a lot about it the focus of his finance or in his politics and their life\nAnd he left hungry at Seventeen to go to London and from that he went into financing moved to New York he opened one of the very early hedge funds in New York was a very successful stock market trader so that by around Nineteen eighty\nHe was worth a hundred million dollars but I was just to start\nBecause then he went into current to speculation in the eighties and nineties\nAnd tell us briefly how did currency speculation make him rich\nWell I'm In the nineties a specialty was a currency pegs the notes unsustainable and famously in Nineteen Ninety two he broke the bank of England by betting that the bank of England couldn't keep the British pound listening to the German deutsche mark\nAnd weren't sources right or the pound collapse are us made enough food for sure and and the u._k. economy are descended into some chaos\nWhen did you start getting involved in politics in earnest\nIf the gun in his native Hungary and then in the east European countries where his finance or had a clear\nPolitical confidence which was to build ... and so he was sort of in politics from that period and the eighties on words but the switch came in two thousand tree when he waited into us politics because of the Iraq War there once it became clear in two thousand four\nQuite how much money he was spending on democratic get our desert causes that was the inevitable um counterattack from Republicans a and it became a useful trick\nIf you are being attacked in the media and you were a Republican member of Congress to say\nUs and his allies have put him up to ...\nWhy does George Soros in particular become seen as a shadowy figure hiding in dark isn't just because he has so much money\nYou know I think it's ironic that he's seen as shutter we'd caught expended Russian ... actually is for them to be a girl the open society Institute He's very open about it he publishes figures are about whether donations or so I think it's hard to escape\nThe suspicion that the critics who say he shot or a um a natural and you're on a long tradition of anti Semitism\nWhere Jewish finances are portrayed as the shutter re figure through minute to politicians and therefore I think it's a pretty good indication of that tradition\nWell what do people in his native hungry think of Soros\n[noise] he was a hero or early on in the transition away from communism things have tonnes more recently because of the anti immigration populist nationalism taken over the country\nSebastian Mallaby is the author of several books and a senior fellow at the council on Foreign Relations thank you so much\nSo I think President Trump is headed to Charlotte North Carolina today to rally supporters for Republican congressional candidate mark Harris\nHarris is caught in a tight race in a former Republican strongholds against Democrat Dan McCready NPR's Kelsey Snell has more on how major shift in North Carolina politics mirror changes across America\nFor more than fifty years boaters in the ninth congressional district in North Carolina have been sending Republicans to Congress but things are changing\nThis year Harris a conservative Baptist minister is slipping in the polls behind mccready a Democrat and former marine David a Clinton a professor of political science at ... college says the Trump rally is a sign that Republicans have to fight harder than there used to\nThe fact that President Trump is coming from it was a ... they still see the races will it would've been inconceivable two decades ago for a Republican president me become into that district\nNick Clinton said because of shifting demographics people from other states and other countries are flocking to jobs in places like Raleigh Durham and Charlotte young generations of farmers are doing it too he sounds like the rest of America Democrat in North Carolina dominate the cities and suburbs but things change the further out you've got\nYour work at the political fine for them and you can almost see other county law and the shift between the Democratic signs are on one side of the law and when you move into another county more rural county and all of a sudden it's strong country\nThe line isn't so clear in other areas like pull county where the view of the political trend line depends on who you ask county commissioner ray Gaspar ... says the areas about sixty percent Republican but he's the only elected Democrats\nAnd well he sees his party dominating in statewide offices in the future that doesn't mean the entire state is turning blue\n... and started for sub or for the rule which for him to go much more Republican\nCounty Republican chairman diction honesty says rural Republican voters like Trump\nI'm shooting a trend where there's a movement away from the Democratic party to the Republican Party just because there is a lot of dissatisfaction with what has been going on at the national level\nTrump's rally could be the closing pitch for Republicans who want to keep at least the ninth congressional district from turning blue Kelsey Snell NPR News ...
