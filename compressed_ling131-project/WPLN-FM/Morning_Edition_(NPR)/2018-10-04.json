born with microcephaly or I'd normally small heads among other parents that come with that\nAround the same time BBC producer William Kramer had a child of his own who was also born with microcephaly although not because of the guy\nCramer wanted to know how Brazil's so called ... babies were developing so we went there and produced a radio documentary called the love stories among the people he met there where her mom out so ... she's the head of a support group for parents called the United mothers of angels\nAre still some other ... found multiple ... to get him he had his ... gave us two options either be a victim in don't do anything or become a protectionist in the lives of these kids\nI talked with a million Kramer about his reporting earlier this week\nCan you introduce us to the women you met the you go to Brazil to try to follow up on the children who were born out of busy a crisis and you meet this network of mother\nYeah that's right I mean it was I was quite remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds uneducated many of them very young as well mothers so they did have a hard time I'm typing with what happened [noise]\nBut they certainly didn't come across as victims to me when I when I was a um they were very very they were very tight group loss of solidarity very determined women some of them um were engaged in you know political campaigning\nUm they certainly didn't take any known since from us that it was a ... a a degree of skepticism towards the press because they feel like the press was involved in their lives and then kind of just forgot about them um they are pretty skeptical about doctors as well which is kind of common for special needs parents\nSo they were quite a strong set of women I mean obviously very different ... the leader of this group which is called the ... mothers of angels [noise]\nUh this is a group in punt on because states which is just sort of\nIt's a ... one of the states which was worst affected by the ... the leader of that group is ...\nAnd she is you know really quite a powerful personality uh she doesn't mean I was you know she's one of these people that just give you a look and you sort of just stopped talking\nA but also very charming and you know she's made a lot of friends with politicians sympathetic ... people have sought to try and campaign for the women\nWhat is the health status of these children who were born with the guy I mean you write that in the beginning these mothers were getting a horrible prognosis that their children may not even survive beyond a year or so I'm ... how are they doing\nWell that's right and so around ten percent of them have died most of those so that's about three hundred and twenty children most of us children probably died very soon off the bus\nOr a few of them are cut things up chest infections through breathing food in when they were learning to wean but on the other hand\nI I mean this is actually this is one of the things that fascinated me the most is they're they're very mixed group of children so there was some children's you can walk to can stand there is some children who got what we can talk\nI'm Still may be a little bit behind ... is it you know at the at that age but then there are other children as you you know they can't roll over on other that fat through achieve into that told me that that much much more um you know disabled\nSome of the children who are more physically disabled or actually cognitively left side and some of the children who are more cognitively disabled cannot stand up and walk around it's an incredibly mixed saying I'm not\nSo much so that you actually tell the stories twins of girl who was born with a virus and her brother did not was matter of fact it\nYeah it was you had this fragile little ... she was called a she really couldn't move very much a tool she seemed very aware of what was going on around huh but then she had her twin brother who was turned off him who he was acting just like you would expect it to an offer a boy to act [noise]\nJumping up and down and climbing on his mom and I know I Know this kind of thing um so they don't really understand they didn't know why it affected one twin and another ... ... it's it's quite possible that it was because of genetic differences between them so that they now know that\nSome people seem to have a sort of genetic defense against seek out\n[noise] you write that unique affected families are at a turning point why it's such an important moment in in their story\nWhat ice or is that the family is a a really thinking about the social aspect so while they're largely going to be like like [noise]\nWhat school are they going to go to ... and how would they be able to access a school um will moms be able to go back in and work again what are they going to do about child care and and\nSo we were able to join um that the actress ... she went around the some of the more deprived parts of northern Brazil and she's kind of giving talks to these women and giving them talks and just sort of saying you know you need to write to the man you need to write to the health extreme tell him to give you a bus to tell you a charter school you know just kind of thing\nAnd those are the kinds of social campaigning up the issues that they really start to do it now\n[noise] I Wonder because you have this personal connection because your own daughter has microcephaly how did you come back from this Chet how did it did it change your alter the way you think about her condition in any way the\nChildren were very some some of the children ... the political you mentioned militia the twin she especially it was very similar to my gosh you reminded me so much with my little guy the guy and holding how it was just like holding my little girl and\nHer mom was at that point where I was kind of Eighteen months ago when I was kind of despairing an Eighteen month Katie my daughter has done so much and I really wanted to say the ... she's got to worry she'll come you know\nBut you can't you know you just don't know where every child different uh ...

captured nearly a year ago NPR's Tom Bowman was in the Syrian city when he spoke to our colleague Steve Inskeep\nOn the soccer stadium right in downtown rocker and this is a stadium that ISIS used to jail people for executions goes world beheadings and it's interesting that now the stadium is being rebuilt to be used for an actual soccer stadium now how is the city\nThan it was when you were there early in the years shortly after it was captured\nTo be coming back to life step by step is still a lot of rubble removal being done for the streets are pretty clear clean water is widely available now some electricity is coming back it was really interesting is a lot more shops are open it's kind of bustling in a way\nBut what's curious as the shops are open on the first floors of a lot of buildings\nIt's sort of a skeleton of the building and a lot of rubble just above the shops and they said there were more than five hundred homes that have been cleared of booby traps and more and more kids are going back to school but there's still an enormous need for health officials say\nThey need hundreds of millions of dollars from the international community or just for the basic sort of water or electricity and so forth\nAre people returning home people who had fled the city or fled Syria entirely\nYeah a lot more people are coming home and the interesting thing is it's straining the services now but people are going back into their homes you'll drive the street so look completely desolate from the damage from the IRS strikes and ISIS blowing buildings out and you'll see your family actually walking\nInto their homes the city was roughly two hundred and twenty thousand before the war\nAnd now it's around a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nSo there are Syrian forces aligned with the United states to control that part of the country do they have enough territory that it can govern itself it can run itself even though it is still obviously very separate from the parts of Syria controlled by Bashar al Assad\nThey can sort of govern themselves they're sitting on local councils they're creating sort of local security forces to patrol this area so it really is sort of a little oasis here in Syria far away from Assad and his forces\nAnd where does the United states fit into all of this President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syrians\nFrightened that was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty percent of the usa for returning these basic services and some of them wondering is the U.S going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead and what's interesting Steve is when the president cut that money\nThey had to basically stop some of the programs here in Raqqa searches bomb removal and also education programs\nAnd that really worried a lot of people and it was only fifty million dollars from the United Arab Emirates that got these programs rolling again\nNow President Trump said Saudi Arabia as pledge a hundred million dollars to the relief effort but that money has not shown up yet and here's the bottom line with that Steve if you don't provide people with the basic needs for living resentment will grow\nPeople become more desperate and radicalized and ISIS already is trying to slip back into Iraq and other liberated areas trying to recruit and they still have money to pass round so um\nThere's a concern that ISIS could continue to come back if this rebuilding effort doesn't continue\nNPR's Tom Bowman is

sexual misconduct or that they allege a Brett Kavanaugh committed a Ramirez is of course a classmate of Kavanaugh's uh her story is that a Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party when they were both in college\nDemocrats as opposed to Republicans Democrats wanted a more in depth look at those allegations in for the FBI to kind of follow any leads are witnesses that might spin off of those so\nDemocrats have also increasingly talked about Kavanaugh's drinking um since that could have bearing on his behavior at the time of the legit incidents but the key thing to remember here is that\nUh the White House is the one in control of the background investigation and the scope the FBI does this background investigation at the behest of the White House the president controls the

Greene and I'm Rachel Martin three years ago this week an epidemic swept across Brazil as a result thousands of babies were born with microcephaly or I'd normally small heads among other impediments that come with that\nAround the same time BBC producer William Kramer had a child of his own who was also born with microcephaly although not because of the guy\nCramer wanted to know how Brazil's so called ... babies were developing so we went there and produced a radio documentary called seek a love story among the people he met where German ... she's the head of a support group for parents called United mothers of angels\nLast time I don't know I was thinking download the push to get him he had his ... gave us two options either be a victim in don't do anything or become a protectionist and the lives of these kids\nI talked with William Kramer about his reporting earlier this week\nCan you introduce us to the women you met so you go to Brazil to try to follow up on the children who were born out of this week a crisis and you meet this network of mothers\nYeah that's right I mean it was a it was quite remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds uneducated many of them very young as well mothers so they did have a hard time I'm typing with what happened\nBut they certainly didn't come across as victims to me when I when I Lived that um they were very very they were very tight group loss of solidarity very determined women some of them um were engaged in you know political campaigning\nUm they certainly didn't take any known since from us that it was a ... a a degree of skepticism towards the press because they feel like the press was involved in their lives and then kind of just forgot about them um they are pretty skeptical about doctors as well which is kind of common to special needs parents\nSo they were quite a strong set of women I mean obviously\nVery different ... the leader of this group which is called the anointed mothers of angels [noise] uh this is a group in turn on the cruise stage which is a sort of\nIt's a ... one of the states which was worst affected by the ... the leader of that group is ... and she is

you know she's made a lot of friends with politicians sympathetic ... people have started to try and campaign for the women\nWhat is the health status of these children who were born with the guy I mean you write that in the beginning these mothers were getting a horrible prognosis that their children may not even survive beyond a year or so I'm well how are they doing\nWell that's right and so around ten percent of them have died most of those so that's about three hundred and twenty children most of us children probably died very soon off the bus\nOr a few of them are cut things up chest infections through breathing food in when they were learning to wean but on the other\nActually doing pretty well I mean this is actually this is one of the things that fascinated me the most is that they were very mixed group of children so there was some children's you can walk to can stand there is some children who got what we can talk\nI'm Still may be a little bit behind the pay is it you know at the at that age but then there are other children who you know they can't roll over on that the fed through achieve into that told me that that much much more um you know disabled\nSome of the children who are more physically disabled or actually told me to the left side and some of the children who are more cognitively disabled cannot stand up and walk around it's an incredibly

like you would expect to turn off for a boy to act [noise]\nJumping up and down and climbing on his mom and I know I Know this kind of thing um so they don't really understand they didn't know why it affected one twin and not another ... ... ... it's it's quite possible that it was because of genetic differences between them so that they now know that\nSome people seem to have a sort of genetic defense against the\nCap you write that you seek affected families are at a turning point why it's such an important moment in in their story\nWhat ice or is that the families have a really thinking

kind of giving talks to these women and giving them talks and just sort of saying you know you need to write to the man in each right to the health effects to tell him to give you a bus to take your child's school you know just kind of thing\nAnd those are the kinds of social campaigning up the issues that they really start to deal with now\n[noise] I Wonder because he has his personal connection because your own daughter has microcephaly how did you come back from his chats I did it did it change your alter the way you think about her condition in any way\nThe children were very some some of the children ... you mentioned Melissa the twin she especially it was very similar to my gosh you reminded me so much with my little girl a year ago and holding how it was just like holding my little
