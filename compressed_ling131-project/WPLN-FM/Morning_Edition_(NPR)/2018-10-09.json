Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz and asked him what do we know about my mother\nAlways sixty four years old he served as the vice minister of public security bureau which is China's national police are in twenty sixteen he became the first Chinese head of Interpol in his lecture was a big victory for China's government which under\nLeader Xi Jinping was eager to use Interpol to locate an extra day Chinese officials at it deemed corrupt to it escaped China\nBut as it turns out among himself is under investigation by Chinese authorities for corruption\nWhat exactly are they investigating him for\nWhat China's government has been released\nBribery and other unspecified crimes and the little we know about how is the tension unfolded has come from his wife grace among on September twenty fifth\nThe day her husband arrive to China for a visit she allegedly received a text from him that said wait for my call which was followed by in a mood to even nights suggesting that she was in

while she's crying during this part of the video with their back turned to the camera because she's received threats and is under protection by French police well\nWhen she talks about the husbands and fathers who've disappeared in China what does she mean\nWell she's talking about the government anti corruption campaign was launched by paying immediately after he took office in twenty Thirteen and its neared hundreds of thousands officials both on the local level as well as among the highest echelons of the party\nIn fact the man who appointed Malone way to vice minister of public security

what does this mean for ... well even\nBefore this happened China's use of it or fall under amongst presidency was starting to raise some red flags earlier this year China attempted to issue a red notice that it's an international alert for wanted person\nFor an exile weaker activists were yours are mostly Muslim ethnic minority who live in northwestern China who China's government blames for unrest and who are increasingly being sent to re education camps\nOther members of Interpol vetoed that particular red notice after China could not provide any evidence of criminal wrongdoing but it was an example of how China was using the organization for its own political means in this case with ... is a good example of how China's messy politics is spilling over into international organizations\nReally interesting stuff NPR's Rob Schmitz joined us from Shanghai thanks Rob thanks do\n\nAcross the United states more criminal courts are turning to video proceedings this isn't an effort to save time and money as that happens some public defenders and others in the criminal justice system are questioning whether the rights of those accused are being affected by this technology

thing was sentenced to Eighteen months in prison [noise] layer Rosalie joy says she hears stories like David since all the time she's with the national\nLegal aid and defender association and says the increasing use of video court has some defense attorneys concerned that alienates the accused from those deciding their fate\nEven before the proceedings began you already feel like you're treated as though you're guilty you are feeling excluded from the process you are treated as\nThe least important part of the process because there is nothing that can replace human interaction and as a defense attorney I Am never going to be as effective in the courtroom from my client unless my clients stand shoulder to shoulder to me\nWell there's little research on video court much out there shows it may increase fail amounts and in many cases makes private communication between attorneys and clients more public\nOn the prosecution side many defend video court for its cost savings and efficiency while
