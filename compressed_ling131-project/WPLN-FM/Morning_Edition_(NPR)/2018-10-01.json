for a cheaper health insurance and you can currently find on the individual market a whole host of new options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the ... the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option\nThese are a niche product always have been\nThat started badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nIt's simply another choice for consumers that for many ah is more affordable than the other products with them on the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years that stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies can find coverage [noise] more than eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk people who think\nThat they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want a backstop they may want something and they may buy these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some and they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care and generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that the ... met\nSo people have something called health insurance um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs\nThese policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live in the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out\nThe government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million people\nAlison Kodjak NPR News [noise]\nSupport for your health comes from exact scientists offering color guard for average risk adults

grow up\nAnd online data to all being made public today let you see for yourself the link between where you are on the American dream Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nEconomists dry Shadi has been worried about the fading American Dream for years he's crunched the numbers and they are troubling if you were born in the Nineteen forties or fifties he says you are virtually guaranteed to achieve the American dream of earning more than your parents did but you see that for\nKids turning thirty today who were born in the mid Nineteen eighties only fifty percent of them go on to earn more than their parents to that is it's a coin flip as to whether you are now going to achieve the American dream\nChatty and his colleagues that opportunity insights a research and Policy Institute located at Harvard water improved those thoughts so they've partnered with the U.S Census Bureau to develop an online program it works a lot like a Google Map\nYou can see the whole country or you can zoom in to local neighborhoods and you can click on a neighborhood and get an immense amount of data from incomes and racial makeup to marriage figures\nWe are able to pinpoint you know what are the places where we're seeing lots of kids climbing the income let our border of the places where the outcomes don't look as good and we put this all out in the form of a publicly available\nInteractive tool called the opportunity outlets that we hope citizens local policymakers nonprofits people working on these issues can use to make better decisions\nFounded moving out of a neighborhood with poor upward mobility to a better one\nKids by an average of two hundred thousand dollars of course moving a lot of people these impractical so the focus is on helping low performing areas improve\nCharlotte North Carolina has gotten the head start on this effort back in twenty fourteen chatty and his colleagues found Charlotte was dead last out of fifty cities at providing upward mobility for low income kids that shocked many residents\nIf you know anything about Charlotte Charlotte wants to be number one\nOphelia ... brown a prominent Charlotte physician says that ranking ran counter to Charlotte's image of itself as a thriving banking center with an expanding high tech sector and a city that's been a leader in job creation and wage growth over the past two decades\nOr what surprised that we had done poorly I've been a physician for a lot of years work with people who live in poverty so\nI saw what she saw was a segregated city where low income black residents especially faced the little chance of moving up the economic ladder Carmen brown joined an effort by the foundation for the Carolinas to address the problem\nThe group identified early childhood development college and career readiness families stability and strong social networks as key factors that enhance upward mobility it singled out segregation as a key obstacle\nAnd now Charlotte officials are learning to use the opportunity at us to effectively target some remedies things like pre K programs and affordable housing\nSo I have that here right now it's just kind of pure math median income in Charlotte and\nA lot of Williams from the chat each team is demonstrating the opportunity atlas for a group that includes the local officials she's zooms into Charlotte and clicks on neighborhoods if the area is reddish brown it signals low levels of upward mobility if it's green or blue it has higher opportunity\nFor the outcomes for children who grew up in different tracks in Charlotte Frank\nBarnes is the chief equity officer for Charlotte Mecklenburg schools he says the tool has already exceeded his expectations I think the key thing that has happened is that the fathers for the Carolinas brought a lot of partners

Allison Aubrey NPR News\nOkay if you're looking for a cheaper health insurance then you can currently find on the individual market a whole host of new options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to give people who think affordable\nI think they're worth it a different option these\nAre a niche product or which have been\nThat started badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nIs simply another choice for consumers that for many ah is more affordable than the other products with them on the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years that stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies confined coverage\nMore than ... eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk\nPeople who think that they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want a backstop they may want something and they made by these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on time and they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care and generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that the ... met people\nHave something called health insurance [noise] um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs\nThese policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live\nIn the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out the government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million people\nAlison Kodjak NPR News [noise]\nSupport for your health comes from exact science is offering color guard for average risk

demanding something that would collapse their own authority and their own government but it's not the first time but they do so so I think we have to be realistic as long as the you know we have the\nMiddle East and reformed and pockmarked with so much violence so much radicalism so much terrorism this is the best we could we could have a lot and\nYou you believe in any circumstance that Israel should be able not only that security control but to arrest people to bring them into Israeli courts you want that to stay with Israel [noise]\nUh yes I Want to have that overriding power and

terrorists\nIn a one of the Palestinian towns and we would call up typically the Palestinian security authorities and say why don't you take care of it 'cause I don't want to send our soldiers there

but that depends on exactly where in America you live it's often said that you can predict the future as as many kids by finding out the ZIP Code where they grow up\nAnd online data to all being made public today let you see for yourself the link between where you are and the American dream Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nEconomists dries ... has been worried about the fading American Dream for years he's crunched the numbers and they are troubling if you were born in the Nineteen forties or fifties he says you were virtually guaranteed to achieve the American dream of earning more than your parents did but you\nSee that for kids turning thirty today who were born in the mid Nineteen eighties only fifty percent of them go on to earn more than their parents to that is it's a coin flip as to whether you are now going to achieve the American dream\nAnd his colleagues that opportunity insights a research and Policy Institute located at Harvard\nPartnered with the U.S Census Bureau to develop an online program it works a lot like a Google Map you can see the whole country or you can zoom in to local neighborhoods and you can click on a neighborhood and get an immense amount of data from incomes and racial makeup to marriage figures\nWe are able to pinpoint you know what are the places where we're seeing lots of kids climbing the income let our border of the places where the outcomes don't look as good and we put this all out in the form of a publicly available interactive tool called the opportunity outlets that we hope\nCitizens local policymakers nonprofits people working on these issues can use to make better decisions\nChatty founded moving out of a neighborhood with poor upward mobility to a better one increases lifetime earnings for low income kids by an average of two hundred thousand dollars of course moving a lot of people these impractical so the focus is on helping low performing areas improve\nCharlotte North Carolina has gotten the head start

anything about Charlotte Charlotte wants to be number one\nOphelia ... brown a prominent Charlotte physician says that ranking ran counter to Charlotte image of itself as a thriving banking center

of years work with people who live in poverty so I saw\nWhat she saw was a segregated city where a low income black residents especially faced little chance of moving up the economic ladder\nCarmen brown joined an effort by the foundation for the Carolinas to address the problem\nThe group identified early childhood development college and career readiness family stability and strong social networks as key factors that enhance upward mobility it singled out segregation as a key obstacle\nAnd now Charlotte officials are learning to use the opportunity at us to effectively target some remedies things like pre K programs and affordable housing\nSo I have that here right now it's just kind of share of median income\nIn Charlotte said a lot of Williams from the chat each team is demonstrating the opportunity atlas for a group that includes the local officials she's zooms into Charlotte and clicks on neighborhoods if the area is reddish brown it signals low levels of upward mobility\nIf it's green or blue it has higher opportunity for\nThe outcome for children who grew up in different tracks in Charlotte Frank Barnes is the chief equity officer for Charlotte Mecklenburg schools he says the tool has already exceeded his expectations I think the key thing that has happened is\nThe fathers for the Carolinas brought a lot of partners to the table to think about how to\nAct on these data I think that's the power it's in the community collaboration in the community partnership Charlotte's effort to improve upward mobility is already taking shape at such field middle school\nIt's located in a majority white maybe not far from downtown Charlotte but assistant principal Eric ... says the school students are mostly\nBlack and Hispanic so we have forty point nine percent are Hispanic forty four point five percent are African American four percent are white it's not unusual for a public school in Charlotte to have a student\nBody this largely minority that's because many white students attend private schools or public schools outside their neighborhoods that segregation hinders\nThe teacher of the year is working with such fields administration to make the school more racially balanced for now an education consultant says to local elementary schools have already emerged for that reason\nEventually something similar is going to pay the demographics you're going to shift a quite a bit this majority black and brown and now\nWe're in the coming years it changes it started to look more like the neighborhood\nBut there's another challenge here beyond segregation it's the lack of social networks minority children need to succeed\nThis hedge field neighborhood is more affluent than a nearby majority black neighborhood called south side park but the opportunity atlas shows African American boys growing up and said field in the Nineteen eighties and nineties are now doing worse than their counterparts from South side park\nFord says that might surprise some people\nWe may assume because it areas a flu like that's a high opportunity area when the truth is that may not be high opportunity area according to the metrics that we're looking at\nIn this case it may be that the majority black neighborhood of south side park offers young black man this social networks friends extended family churches that help them get ahead those kinds of networks might not be accessible to them in a majority white neighborhood\nFord says the opportunity at should help reduce misconceptions about economic mobility\nThis

health insurance then you can currently find on the individual market a whole host of new options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option\nThese are a niche product always have been\nThat started badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nIt's simply another choice for consumers that for many or is more affordable than the other products available on the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years that stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies can find coverage [noise]\nMore than ... eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk\nPeople who think that they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want to backstop they may want something and they made by these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some and they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care and generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that the duck double as met so people\nHave something called health insurance [noise] um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs\nThese policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live in the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out\nThe government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million people\nAlison Kodjak NPR News [noise]\nSupport for your health comes from exact science is offering color guard for average risk adults
