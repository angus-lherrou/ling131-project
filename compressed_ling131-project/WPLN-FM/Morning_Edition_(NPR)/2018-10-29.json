drove a man to open fire in a synagogue and Pittsburgh\nIt's a question to be approached carefully who really knows what leads a man to take a high powered rifle and other weapons into a house of worship and kill people who were as old\nAs Ninety seven he was known for exaggerating claims and he made some threatening statements before the shooting the attack Jews on social media\nHe connected Jews to the camera ban that's a group of migrants slowly moving toward the United states border to ask for entry into the U.S who have been described as a grave threat by President Trump\nHaving made those statements the suspect spent twenty minutes with this for weapons in the synagogue before to surrender\nAnd let's turn to NPR's Quil Lawrence now who is in Pittsburgh high there Quil hey good morning so I Know you've been spending time in squirrel hill this neighborhood where um this happened how are people doing\nI mean the night of the shooting there was a lot of shock um many of the of the Jewish community were in other synagogues other temples when the shooting happened uh and they had to shelter in place or some of them because it was the Jewish Sabbath didn't have any access to their phones and divided at the news to later\nAnd then I was hearing two narratives one was this ancient anti Semitism which has been around for centuries and Jews or you know in in a weird sad way

and then they use some kind of medical tape and they tape these plastic capsules to your back that's it\nWinston left then came back two days later\nAnd they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read my back\nTurns out when I was allergic to eleven substances they tested she was so relieved to have answers that then two and a half months later the bill came\nI was in total shock forty eight thousand three hundred and twenty nine dollars to tape some plastic capsules to her back I didn't have any needle stalking me I had no scalpel stuck in me I had no anesthesia\nIn a statement Stanford said the procedure was highly specialized and required extensive technical resources and knowledge that medical billing expert Michael ... says there's not enough information to understand the charges imagined buying a car for forty eight thousand dollars\nWould want to know what I had a four cylinder six hundred solar engine does it have the top of the wind blew to stereo

this test is thirty five dollars and that includes a twenty six percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area\nEven if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nOr just do the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more\nGood so the ... still doesn't make sense to me in the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she hated that down to Fifteen hundred she put it on a credit card but she thinks of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance like hers\nWhen I Walk into the clinic and I see a grand piano and on this last visit I saw mano grams embroidered pillow cases I thought that forty eight thousand is going to pay for those ... cases and that grand piano\nWinston says if all that money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'd be worth it for ... five star hotel me not\nOr that reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive through Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for a partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test [noise]\nUh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is the kind of test\nAt a sophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it there is much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more ...\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems in the bay area there are four\nThey can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things I can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could it expensive could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable\nDon't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think\nWe have to look nationally for references\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so much\nThanks [noise]\nSupport for NPR health coverage comes from

that continued deep into the night yesterday after the retired army captain sailed to victory in yesterday's runoff election he'll take office\nOn the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy and let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusion do we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all of the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and they use for the restoration of national pride\nAnd I think that it helps explain why does not have defeated the workers' party candidate for them to a dashing so comprehensively\nI should say the most amount of himself insist the survival of dumped democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted\nAn off duty read out part of the constitution to

believe this I think he's a really good guy\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as he's promised to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said does he have a game plan to do that\nWhat he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more

going where and then they use some kind of medical tape and they tape these plastic capsules to your back that's it Winston left and then came back two days later and they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read my back\nTurns out Winston was allergic to eleven substances they tested she was so relieved to have answers that then two and a half months later the bill came\nI was in total shock forty eight thousand three hundred and twenty nine dollars to tape some plastic capsules to her back I didn't have any needle stuck in me I had no scalpel stuck in me I had no anesthesia\nIn a statement Stanford said the procedure was highly specialized and required extensive technical resources and knowledge that medical billing expert Michael ... says there's not enough information to understand the charges imagined buying a car for forty eight thousand dollars\nWould want to know that a four cylinder six or under it's orange and does it have the top of the wind blew

of pocket so the ... still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she hated that down to Fifteen hundred she put it on a credit card but she thinks of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance like hers\nWhen I Walk into the clinic and I see a grand piano and on this last visit I saw mano grams embroidered pillow cases I thought that forty eight thousand is going to pay for those ... cases and that grand piano\nWinston says if all that money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'd be worth it for a lobby the fitting a five star hotel maybe not\nOr that reporting coming from April ...\nSan Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive bill Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for our partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test\n[noise] uh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test\nOut of sophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advising you to put a little on your arm the night before and to make sure you don't react to it there is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems in the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead\nBasically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy tests\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable\nDon't just look in your area I mean the expert and the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally for references\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so much\nThanks

outside his home in Rio de Janeiro that continued deep into the night yesterday after the retired army captain sailed to victory in yesterday's runoff election he will take office\nOn the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy and let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to this man I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusion can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the left\nOf the last decade and a half that sick of corruption and crime and\nThe union for the restoration of national pride I think that it helps explain why does not have defeated the workers' party candidate Fernando ... so comprehensively I should say the most amount of himself insist the survival adult democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution but\nHe is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an off duty read out part of the constitution to reporters about the need for the future presidents who respects\nTo judge had to remind him and the people that people Brazil about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which they say is a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's a central issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these as jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an an corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not his home in ...\nHe's rainy on as he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any races and I don't believe that I think he really put die\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him as he's promised to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said that does have a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready\nPeople hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high moody right yet the prospect of more guns and more police violence also concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that concerned when I visited a federal court or senior last night which is a sprawling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... powder a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people are by somebody that poor

based in Europe she has covered much of Merkel's political career and joins me now has ...\nGood morning David so significant moment ... speaking\nSaying [noise] she she sounded very steady and she looked a little sad but she said that she said before she was not born chancellor\nA that it has been a daily honor but also a daily challenge to serve as a chancellor for the past Thirteen Years and as head of her party for the last Eighteen but that it was time to to move side to listen to what citizens had to say uh and and that is that they have a lack of faith in her government um and so she's stepping aside to make room for the next generation\nWell I feel like you and I have talked um countless times with America on some of the challenges and calling her times in battle I mean she and her government have been in trouble since she was welcoming refugees to Germany in large numbers back in twenty Fifteen rights or the evil wise widely arrived at this moment now what's different

it's hard to imagine the European politics without her I mean what what is the reaction so far this decision well\nThe ah the stocks have gone down I mean this is something that's definitely going to send a very strong ripple effect across Europe people or are they knew this was coming but again she had never announced that until today so this is going to make it very difficult for Brussels for example to push through a its plans to try and integrate the union more\nUh this is probably not going to help the the breakfast situation those negotiating that are going on I mean she is the strongest leader there and she's also been someone who's helped forge consensus and she's an incredibly weaken position now even though technically what she's saying is this isn't going to happen until twenty Twenty one you know she's not going to seek re election until ... in twenty Twenty one and that she's\nBasically going to remain in power until uh until then uh but it's that she's a lame

you general secretary unemployed come ... she's a fifty six year old\nWho's who's someone who many would like to see take her place but there are also other people like the health minister who is much

capsules to your back that's it Winston left then came back two days later and they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read my back\nTurns out Winston was allergic to eleven substances they tested she was so relieved to have answers that then two and a half months later the bill came\nI was in total shock forty eight thousand three hundred and twenty nine dollars to tape some plastic capsules to her back I didn't have any needle stuck in me I had no scalpel stuck in me I had no anesthesia\nIn a statement Stanford said the procedure was highly specialized and required extensive technical resources and knowledge that medical billing expert Michael ... says there's not enough information to understand the charges imagined buying a car for forty eight thousand

percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area\nEven if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nOr just do the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent\nThan this patient as being left with to pay out of pocket so the mass still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three

Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel King\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test\nUh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test\nOut of sophisticated level that you could do at a more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advising you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital systems\nIn the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks but here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable\nDon't just look in your area I mean the expert in the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal and the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally
