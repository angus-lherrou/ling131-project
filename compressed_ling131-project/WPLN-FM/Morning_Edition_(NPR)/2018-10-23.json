Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got in the ... election in the redistricting that occurred the year after\nTo draw gerrymandered seats at the state level as well as the congressional level and then so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one a fair process by which people will draw lines that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are truly going to represent the the people\nLet's be blunt when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat won that is slanted more to Democrats than Republicans\nNo uh uh I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine\nAre you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans and conservative groups were spending a lot of time and focus building up their bench\nI don't I don't criticize the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats I don't think really have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to\nRace in every state um every time\nSo if your goal is a different map for legislative districts in twenty Twenty one what is at stake in two thousand eighty\n[noise] well we have at stake I'm a little less than half of the people who will be at the table and twenty Twenty one will be selected in twenty Eighteen the governors who are elected 'em in twenty Eighteen who will be serving four year terms will be intimately involved in the redistricting process in twenty Twenty one\nState legislators who are serving for your terms and who are elected in twenty eight team\nWill be at the table in in twenty Twenty one so the impact um that we want to have on twenty Twenty one has to begin now in twenty Eighteen and obviously we have to have a good electoral effort as well uh in twenty twenty in addition to the lawsuits that we will be bringing\nAnd the independent commission efforts that we will be supporting between now and a twenty Twenty one\nWhat kind of money as your organization raising an hour you're distributing\nWe've raised I guess about a hundred over thirty million dollars and we are distributing um the

um they matter in certain places hum Supreme Court justices will matter so in North Carolina we're supporting an IED or else who is running for the state Supreme Court is one of the reasons why we campaign so\nHard for Rebecca ... who won he Wisconsin Supreme Court cease\nFire you campaigning for judges who are elected in many states with the explicit idea that these are judges who might someday rule the way you would like on a redistricting case\nThough oh I'm looking for or or judges who will look at the facts look at the law a and rule in a fair way not trying to pick the judges who will rule our way uh I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench you look at the\nThe laws as they had been written look at our constitution as it has been written look at the state constitution says they have been written that we will get rulings that will be acceptable to the people generally a ... and I think ... or a or a fair process\nOne of the attorney general you received

tough when it comes to confronting people like that and all parties I'm like that\nAs you know there's a broad debate about how properly to be forceful as that's something to be expressed through

Government first set a new nothing of his disappearance and then said ... died in a fight and that it is still investigating NPR's Peter Kenyon joins us from Istanbul Hi there Peter hasty so what evidence is there to put on the table\n[noise] well ... says the evidence that they have so far I strongly suggest that this was a planned operation basically dismissing the Saudis story that it was an accident\nOr one new thing that he said uh is that part of the evidence that they have is that the Saudi team that showed up in advance of the killing scout it out some areas possibly for disposal of a body including a forest in northeast is double a and then he also ah in his remarks called on Riyadh or to allow\nThe Eighteen people they've arrested in connection with the show ... death\nTo be prosecuted in Turkey they have all gone back to Riyadh Saudi Arabia so they would have to be extradited\nUm that Turkish president also says this evidence they've got so far raises big questions including on whose orders was this killing carried out why there's such a delay and allowing the consulate and other properties to be searched\nAnd why has the Saudi explanation of what happened changed so many times so it at all points to the fundamental question was at a rogue operation is Riyad suggests or was the leadership and\nOkay so some new information they're affirming on the record that the Turks believe this Saudi team scout at places to dispose of a body did aired on confirming any of the other various news reports about bits of damning information [noise]\nAlso seeing a lot

but in the long term there may be more at\nStake in hundreds of races that receive little national coverage they are elections for state offices governors and state legislators and many many others they will have great influence in drawing election districts and those districts influence who can be elected to Congress another legislatures in the future\nPresident Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder announced that Republicans\nDominated that process after the two thousand ten cents as he leads a group tried to give Democrats influence after\nTwenty Twenty one of the problem that your tried to address but we're trying to deal with the problem of\nPartisan gerrymandering and racial gerrymandering or we saw the Republicans in twenty eleven use the power that they got in the ... election in the redistricting that occurred the year after two droid gerrymandered seats at the state level as well as the congressional level and so what we want to do with having twenty Twenty one\nPeople will draw lines that will include a Republicans and Democrats who are truly going to um represent the the people\nLet's be blunt when you say a fair process do you really mean because you're a Democrat won that is slanted more to Democrats than Republicans\nNo ah I'm just looking for a fair process I I think that if we have a process that is fair Democrats and progressives as opposed to conservatives and Republicans will do just fine\nAre you in this whole at least in part because as his critics would suggest President Obama didn't do much to build up the Democratic party to build up the bench at a time when Republicans and conservative groups were spending a lot of time and focused building up their badge\nNo I don't criticize the president on that but I I Would say the Democrats I don't think really have focused enough at the state and local level to the degree that Republicans did and we have to reverse that we have to make sure that we are focusing on every race in every state um every time\nSo if your goal is a different map for legislative districts in twenty Twenty one what is at stake in two thousand eighty\n[noise] well we have at stake I'm a little less than half of the people who will be at the table and twenty Twenty one will be selected in twenty Eighteen the governors who are elected 'em in twenty Eighteen if it will be serving for your terms will be intimately involved in the redistricting process in twenty Twenty one\nState legislators who are serving for your terms and who are elected in twenty Eighteen\nWill be at the table in in twenty Twenty one so the impact um that we want to have on twenty Twenty one has to begin now in twenty Eighteen and obviously we have to have a good electoral effort as well uh in twenty twenty in addition to the lawsuits that we will be bringing\nAnd the independent commission efforts that we will be supporting between now and a twenty Twenty one\nWhat kind of money as your organization raising an hour you're distributing\nWe've raised I guess about a hundred over thirty million dollars and we are distributing the money\nWe look at everything through a redistricting land so governors always matter\nA state legislators matter but in certain states if you look at Ohio State auditor the state's secretary of state um they matter in certain places hum Supreme Court justices will matter when North Carolina we're supporting and eat or else who is running for the state Supreme Court is one of the reasons why we campaign so\nHard for Rebecca ... who won a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat\nArgue campaigning for judges who are elected in many states with the explicit idea that these are judges who might someday rule the way you would like on a redistricting case\nThough oh I'm looking for or or judges who will look at the facts look at the law a and rule in a fair way not trying to pick the judges who will rule our way ah I'm confident that again if you put people on the bench you'll look at the the the laws as they have been written look at our constitution\nAs it has been written look at the state constitution says as they have been written that we will get rulings that will be acceptable to the people generally\nA ... and I think ensure a or a fair process\nOne other thing attorney general you received a lot of attention particularly in conservative media for a speech you made and what you were ripped off a famous remark by Michelle Obama knew\nWhen they go low we know [noise] they go low we can what did you mean\nOr what I meant ... ... ... in that remark was that ah I Am going to stand up very forcefully against anybody who would try to undermine our democracy that the Democrats have to be tough when it comes to confronting people like that or parties I'm like that\nAs you know there's a broad debate about how properly to be forceful as that's something to be expressed through votes through protest through yelling at lawmakers at restaurants or something else what's appropriate\nWell I certainly think ... votes\nThat just personally I Would not be yelling at them\nLawmakers in in restaurants going to go into their homes um you know I I'd be going act them I'm at the ballot box I I think it was extremely powerful when women came out the day after the Trump immigration I was very powerful when young people marched here I'm In Washington

some awkward conversations if you were to win and that's not all\nLived in la where people used to play in a group a long time ago and then if somebody wanted a single and then the group went after them said no we're always playing together\nVery awkward but curling is not entirely against office pools\nWell you know I understand why people do it because you know you'll feel terrible if you're off his wife and you didn't contribute just because you didn't like those I Would never say not to understand that there's always peer pressure because you don't want to be the one person left out so

I'm Steve Inskeep\nAnd I'm Noel King the Supreme Court has weighed in on the lawsuits over the controversial citizenship question on the twenty twenty cents is the court has sided with the Trump Administration and temporarily blocked the questioning of commerce secretary Wilbur Ross\nDozens of states cities and other groups are suing over Russia's decision to add the question which asked census takers if they are us citizens\nAnd here's how long has been reporting on these lawsuits he joined us now from New York a morning on the\nMorning Noel so why did the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the lower order for the commerce secretary to testify for these lawsuits well\nThis is requests from the Trump Administration which has been arguing that these lawsuits should be resolved based on internal documents emails memos they've already release where these lawsuits about the citizenship question and not on any questioning of commerce secretary Wilbur Ross\nThe plaintiffs in these lawsuits really want to question however secretary Wilbur Ross because they think that these documents are not sufficient\nThat there have been inconsistencies in a row his testimony to Congress about why and when he added the citizenship question and the plaintiffs want to use a deposition uh questioning of Ross in order to get more evidence this is all preparation for a trial\nThat is expected to begin on November fifth in New York could be the first trial of the six lawsuits around the country and at this point it the Trump Administration could ask the Supreme Court to permanently block car secretary Wilbur Ross is deposition\nOregon even asked the Supreme Court to hear this case so we're not quite sure right now what will happen in the trial if that is the case well\nWhat is the Supreme Court order mean for the states and cities that are suing over the citizenship question\nIt means that the windows really closing took like additional evidence to support their claims in this lawsuit\nAnd it's important remember the Supreme Court did allow last night in this order the plaintiffs attorneys to question the Justice Department official John Gore he's the acting head of a civil rights division that the administration says needs this citizenship question to better enforce the voting rights act\nAnd the Supreme Court is allowing additional document requests but again we have to see what the administration does next in their next expected requesting Supreme Court and what they asked the Supreme Court to do a before a trial starts\nAnd honestly when can we expect to find out like the the final fate of the citizenship question\nUltimately these this legal battle is expected to be argued in front of the Supreme Court\nAnd so once this gets fully onto the Supreme Court docket we are likely not going to get any answer on whether or not this question stays or goes from the courts until possibly in early summer before the Supreme Court wraps up its session\nIt'll

says James Roberts former foreign service officer now with the Heritage Foundation a conservative Washington think tank\nThird dozens of programs in the three countries and they could be reviewed not all of them are effective manner you're too small to make a long term difference it's often difficult to measure the room\nWhile Robert would light that thorough review he points out that it takes

this was not only three WPN Lynn I'm Jason Wilkins\nWith democratic gubernatorial nominee Karl Dean was mayor of national he had the benefit of a city and the metro council but largely saw politics his way\nTo W. peel ends Emily ... asked him how he plans to handle leading a state and working with the state legislature that leans heavily Republican were re airing part of an interview we had with dean earlier in the campaign\nKarl Dean often talks about being nonpartisan as national mayor but party labels are often impossible to avoid in the governor's office so I asked him how as a Democrat he'd work with a Republican state legislature\nWell I think it would take what it takes under almost any scenarios you got to go into anything will be willing to work with the other side you got to be willing to negotiate you got to be willing to compromise you got to be willing to know that you're not going to always going to get everything that you want\nBut you want to keep the conversation focused on what's best for the people who tend to see what's best for the future of the state\nAnd if you succeed in doing that ... that's when the magic happens when you could actually get things done and this is not a new situation and history of the state of Tennessee Phil Bredesen second term Republicans were taking over the legislature Lamar Alexander and many Republican governors serve very capable when they had democratic dominance of the legislature\nYou can look around the country at any given time you have governors a one party state legislature of another I give you two examples Steve bullock in Montana and gets a lot of attention he's a Democrat Montana's overwhelmingly Republican legislature\nGovernor Baker in Massachusetts Republican overwhelmingly democratic legislature\nPeople are forced to talk to each other to work to negotiate and to get things done and that's where you can actually benefit the state so that that'd be my approach\nSo as you looked at as governors as models what are they doing that you'd want to emulate\nWell I think they're putting the interest of the state first you know I I you know for instance I've talked a lot about the the the mistake was not do the Medicaid expansion in the state\nAnd you look back on that decision that was a sort of a very partisan political decision other states with Republican governors Republican legislatures\nUm did Medicaid expansion they analyzed it differently they didn't analyze it by the politics of it they analyzed ... what's going to help the citizens of tend to see what's going to help maintain our rural hospitals what's going to make us a competitive state in terms of our health care\nAnd they made a different decision and so I Would now say to the legislature let's make this decision rationally let's look at where we are and I'm willing to work with you and compromise with you but\nWe now know what the result of that decision is we've lost four billion dollars we've had ten hospitals closed and let's do something to put Tennessee in a more competitive position that's how I approach it\nDoes that mean I'll say that the\nGovernor is I mean occasionally they ... the legislators passing something that they don't personally agree with that has kind of have to buy their tongue and\nWas in Tennessee to override the governor's veto simple majority so the governor's veto something passes the legislature with a high margin\nI'm your Vito is you know governor has some space this repeal it doesn't there's not much you can do\nBut there I can certainly see scenarios where um I Would um on principle veto something that I felt if it was sort of against things that I Believe in in terms of the way people should be treated\nOr um or values that I have um you know I I I think that's important for the governor to be able to use the bully pulpit to say this is the type of state we are these are the things that we believe in and we don't believe in that\nYou can hear
