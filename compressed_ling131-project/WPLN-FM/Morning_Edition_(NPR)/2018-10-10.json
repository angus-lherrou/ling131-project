situations and most seemed to conclude that getting verbal consent as the best choice moving traditions founder and CEO Deborah Meier says the goal is to give teens the space to arrive at the right answer with their peers\nWe aren't telling them this is how you need to behave and this is how you don't behave and we don't shame them for who they are we help guys uncover the tenderness and that connection and the joy of themselves as a human being and develop for themselves a sense of ethics and values and responsibility\nTalking about sexual assault in consent this way sounds different from what a lot of people heard in the past University of New Hampshire sociology professor Sharon Potter says older generations might remember talks for incoming college freshmen\nHave ... and ... and ... you know it kept going\nAt that and how they can be made that\nThe problem says Potter is that only a small percentage of men are perpetrators Potter says a more productive approach is to train bystanders how to identify someone who may be at risk of sexual assault and then how to intervene Potter says this is hard work but not impossible\nWe've already done hey anyway anti drunk driving\nDecades back most people were uncomfortable taking a friend's keys when they're too drunk to drive but after years of research and education programs the rate of alcohol related traffic deaths has been cut in half since the Nineteen eighties\nPotter says for sexual assault this kind of culture change is just getting started but look around and you'll find examples one of the teenage boys meeting in the basement says that as a high school freshmen he's all ready to use the skills\nI have seen some stuff like a football game\nMatthew O'Donnell says he saw another guy touching a girl and trying to get into meant he wasn't sure it was a problem but just in case he made an excuse to separate them when\nI saw happening I was just kind of like oh I have to go to the bathroom in the bathroom was like on the other side of the stadium so I said come with\nThe guy went with him and the potential problem was averted\nSharon Potter the sociologist says that's a perfect example of identifying a situation and then intervening she says more of that along with praise for people like O'Donnell could lead to the culture changed that results in fewer sexual assault in the future\nJeff Brady NPR News Philadelphia [noise]\nOoh [noise]\nThis is NPR News\nOn the next fresh air\nI Believe this nation should the minutes out cheating the goal of landing a man on the

to call it a fee not attacks more on that later\nBurgers and says Exxon Mobil support will make lawmakers more receptive to a carbon tax but you may wonder why does an oil and gas giant like Exxon Mobil support a tax on its main products\nVerbal since says one big reason is that companies want regulatory certainty they want to know what the rules of the game will be and that's an unclear and the current environment\nWe're operating in what amounts to a game of regulatory thing wrong and which you have one administration developing rules only to have the next roll them back\nAnother important reason Exxon Mobil supports the plan is that why would tax carbon it would also remove most existing regulations on carbon emissions Myrtle ... says the carbon taxes group is proposing would be much more effective at reducing carbon pollution than the current regulations\nThe Americans for carbon evidence plan is based on a proposal from two Republican elder statesmen James Baker this

Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court prompted a lot of discussion in all corners of American Life about sexual assault and specifically how young men are taught or not taught about consent\nA Jewish organization near Philadelphia has a program to talk about this and other difficult topics with teenagers NPR's Jeff Brady sat in with a group of young men\nIn the basement of a suburban Philadelphia home a half dozen high school freshmen boys are munching on chip and pretzels is thirty five year old group leader Cody green is introduces the week's topic\nRaise your hand if you've heard of the me too movement he's a volunteer with moving traditions which organizes conversations like this with thousands of Jewish teens around the country ... leads a discussion about historical power differences between men and women and how that can play out when it comes to Saturday's do we believe that\nVerbal consent as necessary\nBut one of the boys David Letterman says it isn't always so simple he describes the situation on a bus where both people already said they're interested in each other and the girl purposely sits next to the boys\nThere and then she puts a blanket around you too and lays down and cut it yeah exactly and I cut into your life grabs your hands or you can hold hands and stuff like those are signs you know\nThe boys discuss several different situations and most seemed to conclude that getting verbal consent as the best choice moving traditions founder and CEO Deborah Meier says the goal is to give teens this space to arrive at the right answer with their peers\nWe aren't telling them this is how you need to behave and this is how you don't behave and we don't shame them for who they are we help guys uncover\nThemselves as a human being and

Hampshire a sociology professor Sharon Potter says older generations might remember talks for incoming college freshmen\nWe have ... and ... and we help them you know it can't go and they went out and and he made and then we went and got nana how not to be made that\nThe problem says Potter is that only a small percentage of men are perpetrators Potter says a more productive approach is to train bystanders how to identify someone who may be at risk of sexual assault and then how to intervene Potter says this is hard work but not impossible\nWe've already had anyway anti drunk driving\nDecades back most people were uncomfortable taking a friend's keys when they're too drunk to drive but after years of research and education programs the rate of alcohol related traffic deaths has been cut in half since the Nineteen eighties Potter says for sexual assault this kind of culture change is just getting started but\nLook around and you'll find examples one of the teenage boys meeting in the basement says that as a high school freshmen he's all ready to use these skills\nI have seen some stuff like a football game\nMatthew O'Donnell says he saw another guy touching a girl and trying to

like on the other side of the stadiums so I said come with me\nThe guy went with him and the potential problem was averted\nSharon Potter the sociologist says that's a perfect example of identifying a situation and then intervening she says more of that along with praise for people like O'Donnell could lead to the culture changed that results in fewer sexual assault in the future\nJeff Brady NPR
