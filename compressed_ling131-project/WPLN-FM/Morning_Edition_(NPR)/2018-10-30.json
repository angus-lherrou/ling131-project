station\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm David Greene many of us have something going on in our lives that could shape how we vote on November ...\nMaybe it's a family crisis ending job change maybe the birth of a child over the next three days our co host Rachel Martin will bring his conversations about personal questions or anxiety that shaped election decisions\nThe first is with Isabel Simon from Lauderdale by the sea Florida is about lived in Florida for eight years she has two kids an older daughter and a twenty four year old son named Margot when he was Eighteen Marco injured his back on the job at a grocery store he was prescribed Percocet\nAnd even though he was living with his mom is a bill had no idea that her son had become addicted here's our conversation with rich more\nSo when did you figure out that this was a problem\nWhen I realized he was stealing from me I first I was thinking hey there's like twenty dollars less in my wallet and I confronted him about it and he of course denied but it got to the point where he had me good night and then with one hand going back per se you know I'll let you know as I was reading in bed you know is\nVery heartbreaking at that point when I realized what was going on was there a rock bottom for him\nNot right away I Know this went on for a while my father had passed away during this time period and through getting through the grief of that I didn't realize that my son knew my dad's ATM password and emptied out the bank account\nUm while you're all taking his grandfather and my father yeah because I was the executive tricks at that uh the state and yeah he was just whatever he could get his hands on at that time he was just\nGoing full bore so she ended up moving to Baltimore from Florida right\nYes I had friends in Hagerstown, Maryland where we had lived ... for short period of time and he agreed to go into rehab and they said the best help would be in Baltimore and that's how we ended up in Baltimore because they had a lot of programs for people\nAnd after I dropped him off he didn't even the last two days and he got kicked out because he was combative he did not want to be there and he ended up on the street he was homeless yeah he was homeless for almost three years\nAnd you know there's only so much one person can do but I felt if I gave up on him and he would have nobody it was the lowest point of my life with my child I mean I I was losing him and I could tell I was losing him\nAnd then somewhere along the way I heard something that just resonated with me it said\nA mother can only be as happy as are unhappy is child and I told them are of that and he cried and I think maybe that Senate seat because after that I could see that he wanted to do some things to get better he's actually enrolled into a methadone program\nAnd I honestly don't even know what that catalyst for this whole thing was what it took for him to want to say enough is enough buddies health fees gained thirty pounds\nHe looks good he wants to stay clean and he's doing all the right things he's trying to get his GED now it's a it's a process\nSo it's hard to think about what's happening in Washington or how lawmakers can effect change in any life but especially in a life like yours where you and your son have endured this [noise] but as you think about voting\nHow would this experience effect you're thinking about the choices that you make\nThere are so many programs that are out there but not everyone can afford it\nAnd why did my son have to go back to Baltimore to get the help he needed to get better you know why couldn't it had been in my home state of Florida why did we not have the ability to get the help\nOur candidates talking about this issue in Florida no they're not\nRight now we're so polarized for ... I think are ridiculous reasons and we're not focusing on our own people and what our own people need to make it through the days when times\nAre you talking about like President Trump and allegations against him the Russia investigation all that stuff feels really far afield to\nActually I voted for President Trump did you I did not like the way the country was going and I wanted to make a change I was willing to try to change and I still don't think the president's role in this is as much an issue as\nOur local governments like why is it state to state so different why is or help available in one area and not in another area why can't it be uniform I look at the realities of our life what candidate will\nGive the access to the programs are people need health care drug counseling who will support that and to me I really don't care what party that is I just wanted to be someone who will say okay this is my cars and I want to fix this problem\nThat means is about your your who everyone wants president from especially wants to keep your vote a with a GOP even though he's not on the ballot in these midterms in general are you satisfied with how he has done in the job in the past couple of years\nI'm very satisfied with his performance on the job I Wish she would get off Twitter though because that is an unnecessary [noise]\n[noise] I don't even know how to verbalize that I just think that takes away and it feeds into all the hatred we have right now and all the discord\nIt's like if he would just do his job the economy's doing well I Believe on for the things he stands for he wants it's best for America and I really truly believe that but he can't help themselves\nBut to take criticism many just blows up and goes on Twitter with Iran and that takes away from all the goodies trying to do in other areas\n[noise] Lesley I'll just closed by asking you how things are between you and Marco right now I mean I understand he's in a good place how has your relationship\nIt's a strong as it's ever been I've never given up on my son um I've always loved him he knows I Would do anything for him that I've got his back till my last breath visible thank you so much for talking with us and sharing your story You're welcome thank you\n\nRachel Martin speaking there too is a bill Simon and this is NPR News\nHours after eleven and people were killed in a

have something going on in our lives that could shape how we vote on November ... maybe it's a family crisis pending job change maybe the birth of a child\nOver the next three days our co host Rachel Martin will bring us conversations about personal questions or anxiety but shape election decisions\nThe first is with Isabel Simon from Lauderdale by the sea Florida\nIs lived in Florida for eight years she has two kids an older daughter and a twenty four year old son named Margot\nWhen he was Eighteen Marco injured his back on the job at a grocery store he was prescribed Percocet\nEven though he was living with his mom is a bill had no idea that her son had become addicted here's her conversation with rich more\nSo when did you figure out that this was a problem\nWhen I realized he was stealing from me\nI first I was thinking hey there's like twenty dollars less in my wallet and I confronted him about it and he of course denied but it got to the point where he would hug me good night and then with one hand going by per se you know a lot you know as I was reading in bed you know is very heartbreaking at that point when I realized what was\nGoing on was there a rock bottom for him\nNot right away I Know this went on for a while my father had passed away during this time period and through getting through the grief of that I didn't realize that my son knew my dad's ATM password and emptied out the bank account\nUm while you're operating his grandfather my father's yeah because I was the executive tricks of that or the state and yeah he was just whatever he could get his hands on at that time he was just\nGoing full bore so he ended up moving to Baltimore from Florida right\nI had friends in Hagerstown, Maryland where we had lived ... for short period of time and he agreed to go into rehab and they said the best health would be in Baltimore and that's how we ended up in Baltimore because they had a lot of programs for people\nAnd after I dropped him off he didn't even the last two days and he got kicked out because he was combative he did not want to be there and he ended up on the street he was homeless yeah he was homeless for almost three years\nAnd you know there's only so much one person can do but I felt if I gave up on him and he would have nobody\nIt was the lowest point of my life with my child I mean I I was losing him and I could tell I was losing him\nAnd then somewhere along the way I heard something that just resonated with me it said a mother can only be as happy as are unhappy is child\nAnd I told them are of that and he cried and I think maybe that planted a seat because after that I could see that he wanted to do some things to get better he's actually enrolled into a methadone program\nAnd I honestly don't even know what that catalyst for this whole thing was what it took for him to want to say enough is enough buddies health fees gained thirty pounds he looks good he wants to stay clean\nThings he's trying to get his GED now it's a it's a process\nSo it's hard to think about what's happening in Washington or how lawmakers can effect change in any life but especially in a life like yours where you and your son have endured this [noise] but as you think about voting\nHow would this experience effect you're thinking about the choices that you make\nThere are so many programs that are out there but not everyone can afford it\nAnd why did my son have to go back to Baltimore to get the help he needed to get better you know why couldn't it had been in my home state of Florida why did we not have the ability to get the help\nOur candidates talking about this issue in Florida no they're not right now we're so polarized for ... I think are ridiculous reasons and we're not focusing on our own people and what our own people need to make it through the day sometimes\nAre you talking about like President Trump and allegations against him the Russia investigation all that stuff feels really far afield to\nActually I voted for President Trump did you I did not like the way the country was going and I wanted to make a change I was willing to try to change and I still don't think the president's role in this is as much an issue as\nOur local governments like why is it state to state so different why\nIs or help available in one area and not in another area why can't it be uniform I look at the realities of our life what candidate will\nGive the access to the programs are people need health care drug counseling who will support that and to me I really don't care what party that is I just wanted to be someone who will say okay this is my cars and I want to fix this problem\nThat means Isabel your your who everyone wants president from especially wants to keep your vote a with a GOP even though he's not on the ballot in these midterms in general are you satisfied with how he has done in the job in the past couple of years\nI'm very satisfied with his performance on the job I Wish she would get off Twitter though because that is an unnecessary [noise]\n[noise] I don't even know how to verbalize that I just think that takes away and it feeds into all the hatred we have right now in all the discord\nIt's like she would just do his job the economy's doing well I Believe on for the things he stands for he wants what's best for America and I really truly believe that but he can't help themselves\nBut to take criticism many just blows up and goes on Twitter with Iran and that takes away from all the goodies trying to do in other areas\n[noise] fluffy I'll just close by asking you how things are between you and Marco right now I mean I understand he's in a good place how was your relationship it's a strong as it's\nEver been I've never given up on my son um I've always loved him he knows I Would do anything for him that I've got his back till my last breath visible thank you so much for talking with us and sharing your story You're welcome thank you\n\nRachel Martin speaking there too is a bill Simon\nAnd this is NPR News support for National Public radio comes from you\nWeb streaming is made possible by the Blair school of music and Vanderbilt opera theater presenting Leonard Bernstein's candied November ninth tenth and eleventh ... hall combining music and ... and the best of all possible worlds details that Blair dot Vanderbilt dot edu our roads\nAnd to check your tires every month more information is available online at tires safety dot com and center point energy services with more than a century of experience in business energy needs including consulting strategy and pricing information etcetera point energy dot com slash energy services\nIf you go back to May of two thousand Seventeen with the Republican effort to repeal the ADA and very deep cuts to Medicaid contained in that House bill and then consider the fact that there is talk and voted for that bill\nGolden wants to extend Medicare coverage to people age fifty five and believes there should eventually be universal coverage\nThat position has been attacked by a Republican income and Bruce pollock when in TV ads like this one radical gold medal of government control your health care ending Medicare as we know sibling taxes we reached out to public ... campaign repeatedly for an interview but got no response\nThe sixty four year old is running for his third term as the only remaining Republican in the house from New England in a debate earlier this month he cited his votes to lower taxes and cut regulations while accusing golden of being in the pocket of democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and others\nI'll tell you what I really object you is all of this on a state money by Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters and all these dark money groups that are pouring money in here are trying to convince the people in Maine and attacked me and say I'm ...
