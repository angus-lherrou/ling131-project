Goldwater responsible for one of 'em Ronald Reagan Gingrich himself and now President Trump does he see each of these waves that's connected to to the previous well\nHe does but what's interesting is that when you press them on that you know why why how are all these connected because you can make a case that philosophically they're all quite different\nUm what he said to me was you know basically they're all anti liberal which I think actually illustrates a broader point about\nThe politics that Gingrich helped create which is it's tribal in nature partisan and nature and driven especially by negative partisanship it's about a desire to beat the other team more than it is accomplished some unified goal\nIt is a zero sum it's out of versus them President Trump was on sixty minutes last night talking about what a nasty place Washington DC is the backstabbing complicity in almost in the same breath he said I feel very comfortable uh was was Gingrich as comfortable swimming in the swamp\nHe was I mean a lot of ways he created the swamp that the Trump now says he's trying to drain right I'm ... and you know I think that this is actually one of the things that ... like most about Trump when you try to get him to talk\nOf conservatism that the president stands for what he talks about most is the personality and the larger than life style and how how cutthroat he can be that's what Gingrich likes about Trump and I think that says a lot about his worldview\nTo what end though I mean whereas Democrats support the idea of what Trump has rot in terms of our political discourse erosion of norms undermining of institution does Gingrich see all this as a long awaited political breaks through\nYou know totally I think that in in the big scheme of things she actually likes that our politics has gotten more tribal and more bishop said has kind of shed a lot of these symbolizing trait she thinks that it should be two teams you know duking it out and ... and that's how he sees the world and he's happy that it's gotten to where it is\nLike a ... inch of the Atlantic magazine his new profile of Newt Gingrich appears in this issue it is called Newt Gingrich says You're welcome McKay cop and thanks much for coming in they give and this is NPR News\nThis is Ninety point three WPN land Nashville public radio Ninety One point five W ... in Ninety One point seven W.

on which would prove very complicated for President Trump who has sought to develop closer ties with him\nDid President Trump in this interview outlined what the severe punishment might be of Saudis proven to have been behind us he\nDid not uh and what he did do is outlined what it will not be and that is it will not be any sanctions that limit a arms sales are banned arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nA and he made clear that he felt like that would be a economically damaging to the U.S and therefore it it it wouldn't be a good idea to go that route some lawmakers have caught for that action\nBut he said that that is not\nA what he plans to do although he did say that he was very upset by this story and that he he said he will take strong\nAction and he at least open the

terrorists in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry sent dirty in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and the homeless Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nAnd the same reasons why we have the world's greatest sources of the same reason where the world's greatest bourbon Kentucky system lumps don't show\nThough I'm social filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world with how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon about hundred twenty six\nCountries so at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nOr it it it has a point where it's it's more than ... percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past few years you're probably your global sales have been out pacing your domestic sales while\nAnd just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over\nFrom the store to store but yes the I I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay for domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets\nIn the mid nineties what was the key free trade agreements with a well a nasty and the EU agreement\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem uh but at the same time we you know ... they're starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away\nWe'll ah we don't like the options on the table\nAnd this is the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks is no doubt about it so you're either going to pass along those costs a consumer in and hopefully you know have people you've converted from scotch do remain Berman

was murdered in their country on the order of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammad bin some on which would prove very complicated for President Trump who has sought to develop closer ties with

that is it will not be any sanctions that limit a arms sales are banned arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nA and he made clear that he felt like that would be a economically damaging to the U.S and therefore it it it wouldn't be a good idea to go that route some lawmakers have caught for that action\nBut he said that that is not a what he plans to do although he did say that he was very upset by this

understandable if executives and Kentucky bourbon industry said they need a drink bourbon whiskey as the target of terrorists in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry sent dirty in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world's resources or the same reason where the world's greatest bourbon Kentucky system lumps don't show though I'm\nAnd um it just became the perfect place to make the world's best whiskey how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nOr it it it's getting to the point where it's it's more than ... percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past ... years you're you're probably your global sales have been out pacing\nYour domestic sales while and just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over ...\nFrom the ... but yes they I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements well a nap to any you agreements\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements has become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem ah but at the same time we you know ... they're starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate and that's the point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and\nWell ah we don't like the options on the table and this is the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks there's no doubt about it\nSo you're either going to pass along those costs a consumer and hopefully you know have people that have converted from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back a which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any other\nState of the obvious as a state that voted for President Trump has voted for Republicans a lot to ask 'em when you have conversations with people do you run into people who were having conflicted feelings\nAre I think we all understand that there are no winners or a trade war and you know we're we didn't have for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why we know we're kind of collateral damage or you know\nTo be honest with you um ... again I haven't heard much uh come up as an issue yet\nYou made an issue like an election yeah it has come up I mean\nCops and bar has been very helpful to us in the past few months he set up a meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky and the spring how does the vice president\nRespond he you know being from Indiana he knows what Barbie means you Kentucky or he will note for the non geographically minded right across the river yes ah and and he told us he understood exactly that this would this district mean for us\nBourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thanks to Nineteen sixty federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States\nUnlike you know highly David sandwich announce it can move some production overseas we can't do that\nWith bourbon you've got to make it here in\nAmerica and if you want to sell you better make in Kentucky\nBeginning next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this hasn't been a I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers or that we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they started looking and and from my standpoint if the bourbon is higher prices\nMaybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before you know we might lose people for our industry and if we lose them now than we might lose him for generations Eric\nGregory of the Kentucky distillers association\nNext we turn to the effort to total the damage from hurricane Michael Chet Florida's panhandle last week NPR's Camila Domonoske reports since hurricane Michael hit impacts\nLife difficult for residents and rescue teams and for

but last April source of income\nOur livelihood really asking it suggests this hurricane caused billions of dollars of damage Fitch Ratings says the insurance companies will have substantial cost but ... says the industry is quote well positioned to absorb the losses\nAnd yeah that's what insurance companies are supposed to do that in Florida in particular every big storm raises worries that the industry will just fail\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to many companies went bankrupt or backed away from covering coastal areas so we had some good news the analysts say that's not likely to happen now the communities are still facing a long difficult recovery Chandler in Alabama since the damages upsetting\nYou wish that you could just snap your fingers and like

Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and bold there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be voting because what if the Democrats take it by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts that opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump the base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consistently had forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause he's at eighty or Ninety Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning at the election as we are dedicated to luxury election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding goal\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern\nThat means funding of all replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security accomplishments that eluded them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll certainly have a narrow majority making at all even harder Mara Liasson NPR News Washington\nYou're listening to NPR News\nYou're listening to MORNING EDITION on point three WGLA this traffic report is made possible by Bradley a full service law firms that understands legal matters are more than contests of critical thought that you have real world implications learned more about legal services that Bradley dot com\nWe've had a whole series of incidents on a twenty four this morning let's go to the south east side of West bound wreck reported as you approach ... wrote coming from Murfreesboro another one you're wandering road in la Verne a third one is you had passed Harding place and another one year for forty\nThat had the two right lanes out of commission we've also got a rack up on the north west side on twenty four west bound having half wide screen bike but for an accident now at forty west mad as yet past sixty five north in downtown Nashville and a collision coming from the east on forty west bound your Stewart's very hard not to look at the roads bomb August Ninety point three WGLA\nSupport for National Public radio comes from Tennessee local grapes are harvested from wind making an October and many one result for educational tours and tasting wineries are listed on the product or Tennessee mobile [noise]\n\n\n\n\nThere is a place where joyful learning happens every day a place where childhood is revered not right and where students can sink dream to wear Mozart in mathematics go hand in hand\nHave woodworking compliments mechanical physics the place is Lyndon mold or schools serving early childhood through eighth grade visitors can observe a multi dimensional way of learning at the October twenty fourth windows on World War two wars registration limited involved or dog or\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from the any Casey foundation developing solutions to support strong families and communities to help ensure a brighter future for America's children more information is available as a C.
