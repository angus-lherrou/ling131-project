EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin election day is coming November six voters will go to the polls to cast their ballots but they will also on that same day take care of a sick relative of a difficult conversation with a loved one maybe start a new career basically live their life\nThis week we're bringing you personal conversations that illustrate the ways in which that lived experience affects how we vote today we'll hear from a young woman named Alexa groom and she's twenty four years old from a family of Democrats in Minnesota at a recent job is changing her political identity\nDid I hear that you've been taking online quiz has to figure out where you actually live in the pie\nBecause I think so too I\nI I just feel stuck somewhere in the middle and generally it feels pretty hard to talk about it the\nMiddle is not such a comfortable place for a lot of people I mean are you feeling not as both parties going to move to extremes\nYeah I almost feel guilt that I no longer a line with some of my my previous ideas and and I think that's part of the problem is that\nIt seems like if you want to appear as a as a liberal and society you either have to believe everything on the table or you're out you're out of the group\nAnd there's so much going on but I feel like I Can't speak up because you're just asking for people to come after you\nDid you grow up in a in a family that talked a lot about politics oh we talked a lot about politics [laughter] I was fortunate that my whole family lives nearby we would go to my grandma's house every Sunday and the kids go play but I like to sit and listen to you know my parents and my aunts and uncles talk and it was generally about\nYou know politics social issues that we were always encouraged to voice our thoughts and growing up in Minnesota which is pretty ... pretty democratic that's when I grew up hearing [noise]\nAs you started to develop your own political identity and how did that take shape short it was after the twenty sixteen election I felt man I Need to get more involved and that's what led me to working and\nImmigration because I saw all these families who were being deported and it broke my heart and I got a great opportunity to help a lot of people but\nEverything that I had been hearing about ice and conservatives in the news is there these these evil people who don't care about these families and they don't want\nPeople coming to our country and and some of the most and lightning moments I had were when I did work with I Want to go pay bond or go down to the government center and what I saw is and it sounds kind of silly now saying out loud but they're not\nEvil people there people who are looking at the same problem as me and believing that there's another solution that there's a different solution [noise]\nSo I guess it it gave me a lot more\nCompassion towards the right that I hadn't had before in my personal development yes I still feel like I have my roots in liberalism but I I feel like we should be listening to each other a little bit more 'cause I I had thought before that I had been listening and I I found out that I hadn't and [noise]\nYou also watched the Supreme Court nomination hearings of Brett Kavanaugh really closely\nShape how you're thinking about politics or the election\nIt's an issue that hits very close to home I have personally experienced sexual assault um people in my life were very close to me has been rates so it's it's not something that I take lightly whatsoever [noise] um I\nBelieve Dr Ford and I I ... I Believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I there was just not quite enough\nEvidence brought forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't know [noise]\nSo how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it\nWith you know chasing after people in in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of bullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and say that it's no that's activism but I think with everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere\nYou don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just whining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for if I ever Clinton I\nI don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous I guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angers [noise]\nI guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\n[noise] so you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump\nCorrect and because it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on\nStrictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic check boxes I I Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least\nGone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a a Republican and upcoming election [noise] have you taught your family about your\nAbout your evolution I have [laughter] than avoiding it\nYou know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before the hearing on the radio and I I don't think that they would ever think less of me they're very very accepting people although they might hear me say things and go why would you say that so I just [noise]\nIt's it's taken me some time because I'm Still trying to work it out myself\nSo [noise] I'll do my research and whoever I think is you know best for the job then you know that's where I'll put my check mark and that's where all the focus my optimism electric ruin thank you so much for talking with I\nThink you know [noise] [noise] this is NPR News\nHundreds of women are running in federal state and local elections for black women have been the most reliably voting constituency\nAnd so this is about more than jazz respecting our vote

school also wanted students to know where they were coming from history teacher jacking gold Blum says she told her class she felt helpless in scared\nThat how many of the cell phone or of all and they all raised their hands and that was at the floodgates open and they were all presenting their you know what emotions they were going through and I think they had a hard time processing but I told them that's okay because adults are having a hard time processing\nOne of her eighth grade students that she was concerned about the attack on the synagogue would soon be forgotten\nBecause mass shootings have become a regular part\nOf life and I didn't know what to say to her sometimes the teacher\nDoesn't know what to say but then I came back with you or the voices and you can make change you're not too young\nGold Blum says her job is to help her students understand religious identity and cycles of persecution her students have a sense for justice they've been active and marches for refugee and immigrant rights she says they're now connecting those movements to their own Jewish history\nThey have felt very strongly about this because they know from studying the Holocaust how the doors are shut down on them\nBaron Monroe is the head of the school she says well older students process\nAnti Semitism some younger students were scared\nA lot of them were like I go there or my

and ask questions before giving answers\nJust say what do you know about it and find out where they're coming from usually it's a much them replace me adult\nShe says teachers are not only helping students process tragedy there also teaching them that it's their job to make the world a better place\nIn the birds she couldn't on them which is basically repair of the world so I'm a very young age

that is not the case with last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh\nAccording to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism but critics say his division of rhetoric contributes to a climate in which anti Semitism can't take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses that argument\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are Moe level it out to control the world Jeffrey ... historian at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operate behind the scenes and are enormously powerful and enormously evil\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produce fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nDon't go to first and only go so I don't get paid by sorrows or somebody that\nFrom a rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana [noise]\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Jeffrey her fired used that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nCan't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another dozen bucking the most famous conspiracy theory\n... on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says is deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a bias Trump is personally promoted as they did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nHere the smartest people talk about they talk about the lead you ever see the elite\nSays when people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nThat danger for the Jews is that we are very small in number but we are prominent it whether it's Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows his controversial his own daughter and son in large Jewish and Herve is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and\nHe has a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people know\nSo then what's the connection\nHe wants to win and he has a special talent of knowing how to appeal to the resentments of hatred of is the editor in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then is perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual in semi who might have been very isolated but now have these platforms when they find other people that share their views and urge them on and it's fostered an accelerated a climate of heat and anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidence has risen sharply over the last two years Tom Gjelten NPR News\nThis is the time of year when once bacon stores take on a temporary new life is

same day take care of a sick relative of a difficult conversation\nTheir life this week we're bringing you personal conversations that illustrate the ways in which that lived experience affects how we vote today we'll hear from a young woman named Alexa groom and she's twenty four years old from a family of Democrats in Minnesota\nAt a recent job is changing her political identity did I hear that you've been taking online quiz is to figure out where you actually live in the five\nBecause I don't know I\nI I just feel stuck somewhere in the middle and generally it it feels pretty hard to talk about it the\nMiddle is not such a comfortable place for a lot of people I mean are you feeling not as both parties going to move to extremes yeah I almost feel guilt\nThat I no longer a line with some of my my previous ideas and and I think that's part of the problem is that\nIt seems like if you want to appear as a as a liberal and society you either have to believe everything on the table or you're out you're out of the group\nAnd there's so much going on but I feel like I Can't speak up because you're just asking for people to come after you\nDid you grow up in a in a family that talked a lot about politics oh we talked a lot about politics [laughter] I was fortunate that my whole family lives nearby we would go to my grandma's house every Sunday and the kids who go play but I like to sit and listen to you know my parents and my aunts and uncles talk and it was generally about\nYou know politics social issues that we were always encouraged to voice our thoughts and growing up in Minnesota which is pretty ... pretty democratic that's what I grew up hearing [noise]\nAs you started to develop your own political identity and how did that take shape short it was after the\nTwenty sixteen election I felt man I Need to get more involved and that's what led me to working and immigration because I saw all these families who were being deported and it broke my heart and I I got a great opportunity to help a lot of people but\nEverything that I had been hearing about ice and conservatives in the news is there these\nThese evil people who don't care about these families and they don't want\nPeople coming to our country and\nAnd some of the most and lightning moments I had were when I did work with us when it would go pay bond or go down to the government center\nAnd what I saw is and it sounds kind of silly now saying out loud but they're not evil people there people who are looking at the same problem as me and believing that there's another solution that there's a different solution [noise]\nSo I guess it it gave me a lot more compassion towards the right that I hadn't had before and my personal development yes I still feel like I have my roots in liberalism but\nI I feel like we should be listening to each other a little bit more because I I had thought before that I had been listening and I I found out that I hadn't been [noise]\nI understand you also watched the Supreme Court nomination hearings of Brett Kavanaugh really closely identified how did those how did those hearings shape how you're thinking about politics or the election\nIt's an issue that hits very close to home I have personally experienced sexual assault um people in my life were very close to me has been rates so it's it's not something that I take lightly whatsoever [noise] um I\nBelieve doctor for it and I believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I there was just not quite enough\nEvidence brought forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should\nWe just don't know [noise] so how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and say that it's no that's activism but I think with everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere you don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just whining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for if I were to Clinton I I don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous\nGuess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angers I guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump\nCorrect and because it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on\nStrictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic check boxes I I Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least\nGone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a a Republican and upcoming election [noise] have you talk to your family about your\nAbout your evolution I has [laughter] than avoiding it\nYou know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before the hearing on the radio and I I don't think that they would ever think less of me they're very very accepting people although they might hear me say things and go why would you say that so I just\nIt's it's taken me some time because I'm Still trying to work it out myself so [noise] I'll do my research and whoever I think is you know best for the job then you know

News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin when mass shootings happen in this country we often don't ever understand them out if\nThat's not the case with last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh\nAccording to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism but critics say his division of rhetoric contributes to climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses document\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are ... out to control the world Jeffrey her story it at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operated behind the scenes and are enormously powerful and enormously there's no question Donald\nLike TV networks and big newspapers produce fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nThey'll go to a person gets paid by sorrows or somebody that\nFrom a rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Geoffrey ... that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another dozen bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nPurpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says is deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a biased Trump is personally promoted as they did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nYou're the smartest for [noise] you know talking about talking about is the lead you ever see the elite\nHalf says when people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nThat danger for the Jews is that we are very small in number but we are prominent it whether it's Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows is controversial his own daughter and son in large Jewish and her is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people\nKnow so then what's the connection\nHe wants to win and he has a special talent of knowing how to appeal to the resentments and hatred that is the editor in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then it's perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and guys semi who might have been very isolated but now have these platforms when they find other people that share their views and urged them on and it's fostered an accelerated a climate of heat and anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidence has risen sharply over the last two years Tom Gjelten NPR

and digital companies that are adopting the model to build their brand and interact with customers in person\nAnd they're using that pop up model sort of test the waters so I think that the Halloween

EDITION from NPR News I'm students groups and I'm Rachel Martin election day is coming November six voters will go to the polls to cast their ballots but they will also on that same day take care of a sick relative of a difficult conversation with a loved one maybe start a new career basically live their life\nThis week we're bringing you personal conversations that illustrate the ways in which that lived experience affects how we vote today we'll hear from a young woman named Alexa groom and she's twenty four years old from a family of Democrats in Minnesota at a recent job is changing her political identity\nDid I hear that you've been taking online quizzes to figure out where you actually live in the eye\nBecause I think so too I\nI I just feel stuck somewhere in the middle and generally it it feels pretty hard to talk about it the middle is not such a comfortable place for a lot of people I mean are you feeling not as both parties going to move to extremes yeah I almost feel guilt\nThat I no longer a line with some of my aunts my previous ideas and and I think that's part of the problem is that\nIt seems like if you want to appear as a as a liberal and society you either have to believe everything on the table or you're out you're out of the group\nAnd there's so much going on but I feel like I Can't speak up because you're just asking for people to come after you\nDid you grow up in a in a family that talked a lot about politics or we talked a lot about politics [laughter] I was fortunate that my whole family lives nearby we would go to my grandma's house every Sunday and the kids go play but I like to sit and listen to you know my parents and my aunts and uncles talk and it was generally about\nYou know politics social issues that we were always encouraged to voice our thoughts and growing up in Minnesota which is pretty ... pretty democratic that's what I grew up hearing [noise]\nAs you started to develop your own political identity and how did that take shape short it was after the\nTwenty sixteen election I felt man I Need to get more involved and that's what led me to working and\nImmigration because I saw all these families who were being deported and it broke my heart and I got a great opportunity to help a lot of people but\nEverything that I had been hearing about ice and conservatives in the news is there these these evil people who don't care about these families and they don't want\nPeople coming to our country and\nAnd some of the most and lightning moments I had were when I did work with I Want to go pay bond or go down to the government center\nAnd what I saw is and it sounds kind of silly now saying out loud but they're not evil people there people who are looking at the same problem as me and believing that there is another solution that there is a different solution [noise]\nSo I guess it it gave me a lot more compassion towards the right that I hadn't had before in my personal development yes I still feel like I have my roots and liberalism but\nI I feel like we should be listening to each other a little bit more 'cause I I had thought before that I had been listening and I I found out that I had an and [noise] I understand you off\nShouldn't herrings of Brett Kavanaugh really closely identified how did those how did those hearings shape how you're thinking about politics or the election\nIt's an issue that hits very close to home I have personally experienced sexual assault um people in my life were very close to me has been rates so it's it's not something that I take lightly whatsoever [noise] um I\nBelieve doctor for it and I I ... I Believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I there was just not quite enough\nEvidence for forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't know\n[noise] so how how does that affect how you vote\nIt's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it with you know chasing after people and in restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and say that it's no that's activism but I think\nWith everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere you don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just whining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for if I ever Clinton I I don't like Trump I think you know going back to the cabinet questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous\nI guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angered [noise] I guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump\nCorrect and because it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue and decide based on that rather than based on\nStrictly party lines and it's rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic check boxes I\nI Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least gone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a a Republican and upcoming election [noise] have you talk to your family about your\nAbout your evolution I have [laughter] than avoiding it\nYou know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before the hearing on the radio and I I don't think that they would ever think less of me they're very very accepting people although they might hear me say things and go why would you say that so I just [noise]\nIt's it's taken me some time because I'm Still trying to work it out myself\nSo [noise] I'll do my research and whoever I think is you know best for the job then you know that's where I'll put my check mark and that's where all focus my optimism Alexa grooming thank you so much for talking with I think you know\n[noise] this\nIs NPR News support for National
