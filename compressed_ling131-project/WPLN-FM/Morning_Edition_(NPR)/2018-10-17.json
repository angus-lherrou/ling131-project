accept the social code that requires women to remain silent on the face of the abuses to which they had to be subjected to\nFour years ago as ... street fighters enslaved thousands of women and girls in Iraq many were repeatedly raped and sexually abused in other words\nNot humor odd was one of those women she was only Twenty one years old at the time and from a tiny but ancient religious minority group the ...\n... people that they are very ...\nThey just on a simple life they they can they can leave we any group in Iraq in even hand but and they are they're very ... these people in the state yeah they just want\nTo live in peace and fixing\nTo feel safe I talked to an audience brought in NPR's Washington studios earlier this week it was her first full interview since she won the Nobel Peace prize with the help of an interpreter she spoke mostly in ... which is her native language about what she now hopes to achieve\nUm diminution um we have set it over and over that it's important\nFor us the justice is done out of the six thousand years ET women who were abducted by ISIS we hope to see at least one ISIS number who did this to one me as a woman to be punished for the crimes they committed against gives me the women and we hope to see them in court in public\nI think it is easy to see winning the Nobel Peace prize as a kind of combination or end of a person's career you've you've done what you said how to do\nIn your case at twenty four years old that is clearly not true you clearly feel like you have a lot less to do what is next for you after winning the

say is that we are right we have the right to speak about this we have the right to deliver a message\nIf anger doesn't quite capture it what is the word what do you feel every day or\nChemicals to show them that you know like I said what makes us feel good at least is that we are delivering a peaceful massive die we are not delivering a message to hurt anyone or when they meet with students and residents and anyone\nI speak about what happened to us and I deliver my message with a clear conscience that I advocate for people\nHumor odd seemed at times pretty shattered but also strong she says that strength comes from her UCD identity she calls the rape of using the women and the murder of UCD men including many people in her own family a genocide\nShe wants these atrocities to be classified as war crimes but even after winning the Nobel Peace prize she's not sure if that's going to happen and she sometimes finds herself frustrated\n... sometimes I feel that my message has not been clearly heard but that is not my fault because I feel like too much is going on in terms of woman ... victims and it's not the first time and certainly it's not the last time\nAnd perhaps every year a woman's someplace in the world or groups of woman or thousands will be victims of sexual violence or terrorist groups and so I feel like this is not new to people and it's not going to be the

secretary of state Pompeo was on something a fact finding mission here out what did he learn or not learn in these meetings in Riyadh end in Turkey\nWell if you learn anything new from the Saudis there's been no public discussion of that so far he did say Riyadh is committed to a full transparent investigation or the Saudis as you note denying involvement in ... disappearance uh their stated

...\nShe has thousands of social media followers they're mile or tell stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lawyer\nA little girl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad a girl who was on the streets selling herself at eleven years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there should be no girl on the streets when her free is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who was a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's ... more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me and particularly its fund her ... her husband incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a week this is a story about about social media on about how you present the story level really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pockets on things that the individually but taking a small steps are making a difference\nSo who is Katie mylar why did she start this organization\n... a woman from New Jersey who cut along but growing up in doing various forms of gift community help volunteer work too\nOn an evangelical internship and then from there she continued her relationship with the country and she started ... first registered in two thousand and eight\nShe didn't have a lot of nonprofit management did she\nKnow and ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this was an incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped start this organization on the ground in Liberia was an army Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental and the starting up of this organization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked\nAnd he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in the recruitment of girls and he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with ... and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie ... the founder of the organization now what he was doing [noise]\nWell that's something that we asked the and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my mother had an intimate relationship with them but she's conceded in an interview\nBut that same year and twenty eleven there was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who\nWho says that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that he loves the children but she didn't she didn't really get it\nAnd then my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd Harrods she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that but he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that she had HIV right\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died\nAnd as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contact with them which according to reports on to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls\nAnd more potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually were willing to bring a case they were tested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for this says\nYou know where are your schools where the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if her organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to this city is that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see\nLeadership so there was this sense of why are you telling this story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points that organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution and any other context\nIn Liberia still allows the organization to operate schools there\nWell the the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up as an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm On the local community at the sense of\nA lot of people that feeling that something's gone wrong in this in this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has announced a fool investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case [noise]\nUm and they're looking as well as more technical stuff like well how do we are both a process for credit than these organizations have we hold them accountable they're looking into whether the HIV aids policy was was followed and the school\nThat was Finley young for pro public I talking to Rachel Martin since his

the the writer disappeared after entering Saudi Arabia us consulate in Istanbul\nBecause you'll have been critical of the Saudi Government and many people believe he was killed by Saudi agents but the Saudis so far are denying any knowledge and President Trump so far seems to be taking them at their word\nNPR's Peter Kenyon is with us now from assemble Hi Peter I know so secretary of state Pompeo was something a fact finding mission here out what did he learn or not learn in these meetings in Riyadh and in Turkey\nWell if you learn anything new from the Saudis there's been no public discussion of that so far he did say Riyadh is committed to a full transparent investigation of the Saudis as you note deny any involvement in ... disappearance or their stated position is still that he left the consulate freely within an hour of arriving and they don't know where he is\nA there are however these multiple media accounts reporting the Saudis were preparing to acknowledge ... died in the

King more than me is a charity that aims to educate and protect Liberian curls\nIts founder is an American woman named Katie ... she has thousands of social media followers they're my lawyer tells stories about life in West point which in a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lawyer\nA little girl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad a girl who was on the streets selling herself at eleven years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there should be no girls are still on the streets when her biggest dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who was a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story before we go\nCharity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's ... more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me and particularly its ... had an incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media on about how you present the story level really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pocket and think that the individually by taking a small steps are making a difference\nSo who is Katie ... why did she start this organization\nKatie my there's a woman from New Jersey who had along background in doing various forms of ... of community help and volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on on evangelical internship\nAnd then from there she continued their relationship for the country and she started ... first registered in two thousand and eight\n[noise] she didn't have a lot of nonprofit management ditching\nKnowing ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that she brought to this wasn't incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped start this organization on the ground in Liberia was an army Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental and the starting up of disorganization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked\nAnd he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in the recruitment of girls and he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with Katie my either and he was using that power according to other girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie ... the founder of the organization now what he was doing [noise]\nWell that's something that we ask Katie and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my mother had an intimate relationship with them but she's conceded in an interview but that same year and twenty eleven there was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who [noise]\nWho says that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that he loves the children but she didn't really get it\nAnd then my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd Harrods she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that that he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that she had HIV right\nIt was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died and as a consequence you know potentially all of those who had contacts\nAnd to our reporting and also to court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls that are potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually we're going to bring a case they were tested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the piece Katie ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for this says\nYou know where are your schools where the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if for organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to this city is that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had from the Chinese leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution in any other context\nAnd Liberia still allows the organization to operate schools there\nWell the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up as an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm a local community at the sense of\nA lot of people that feeling that something is going wrong in this and this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has announced a fool investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case\nUm uh they're living as well as more technical stuff like well how do we heard was a process for credit thing these organizations have we help them accountable they're looking into whether the HIV aids policy was was followed and the school\nThat was Finley young for pro public I talking to Rachel Martin since his story was published Katie my
