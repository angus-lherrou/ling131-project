public service loan forgiveness program began in two thousand seven with a pretty simple pitch\nSpent ten years in one of those public service jobs paying down your student loans and the government would forgive whatever's left as a thank you but last year from an was hearing from lots of public servants who said they made it years into the program\nAnd found out their plan for financial freedom essentially just wiped out in the blink of an eye because of the mistakes of their student loan company\nHere's what was happening from and says the federal government pays a bunch of companies to manage more than forty million student borrowers\nThese companies are called servicers and they handled the paperwork and answer the phones when borrowers call and ask for help and they're doing a

four to go\nBut recently she called the ed department and someone told her oh I'm Sorry but you don't qualify not until you consolidate your loans\nBut she was told if she does that her count down to forgiveness would reset back to ten years\nI can kind of let my guard down and said he had this kind of sucks and she said yeah it really sucks [laughter]\nTwenty nine thousand applications for public service loan forgiveness have been process so far and all of those Ninety nine percent have been denied in other words ... story he's not unusual oh well see that's actually a huge relief\nBecause I Walk around with an enormous amount of feelings silly [laughter]\nIts defense the education department says everybody who is eligible\nWorking on improving the process but Seth Rodman the former student loan watchdog says the department under President Trump\nIsn't only walking away from the fight to help student loan borrowers they're actually arming the other side\nIn response to all those state law suits against it servicers the Trump Administration is now arguing these companies they're protected from state laws because they work for the federal government in this fight is now being
