arrangement or something more to it\nWas not oil for arms is oil and arms\nOf recent years the United states has become much more self sufficient in terms of energy but Saudi Arabia remains a huge producer of oil and more important incredibly influential in the international setting of oil prices but it's also a purchaser as President Trump has repeatedly said\nOf arms made by U.S companies but there's something more and that is mainly Iran the United states is saying Saudi Arabia's a check on Iran both in the region internationally and to the extent that it's alive issues the U.

problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting end to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment and then the company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch\nYou want to make the whole climate change problem just go away\nYeah I Wish it was that easy because a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of Silicon Valley big promise disrupt everything eat those is

this morning most Asian markets were down overnight the Nikkei\nHang saying that the Shanghai stock exchange was stable which was unexpected because China stock market has fallen thirty percent since January and its currency is falling to its lowest level against the dollar in nearly two years\nNPR's Rob Schmitz is with us from Shanghai good morning Rob\nGood morning to isolate thirty percent top pertain to stock market sounds pretty darned bad what's going on\nWell China's economy has been lagging for the last few years the government's dealing with a lot of problems you've got public debt spiraling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble\nIn through all of this Beijing's making painful changes in how China's economy runs moving from an economy based on building things to one based on buying things and the downturn in China stock market this year reflects that\nWas five thirty percent like this year it isn't going to have\nAs big an impact on the economy like if the ... the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U.S much of the country's retirement plans are invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't a great indicator of the overall economy as say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is edits weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\nBut what's interesting here is that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing [noise]\nYears ago China used to weaken its currency to make exports cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that the u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast\nChina is doing a China doesn't want its currency to be depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now so if China should get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and\nChina are these terrorists that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a communist I'm speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy\nIn my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes all of their supply chains to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade war and that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U. S. China's economy was\nAlready vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost NPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai thanks out ...\nAccording to a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change\nSilicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes blocks chain the technology behind crypto currency like bitcoin is the latest solution coming from big tech\nMember station KCUR December net has more\nUntil about a year ago hardly anyone in climate science is talking about watching but at the recent global climate action some in San Francisco it was all over the place there were panels papers people were talking about how he could help mitigate climate change in all sorts\nOf land agriculture\nHarvests oils frustration\nOur sometime and co chairs the climate change ... he came to the conferences spread awareness about ... [noise] so what is it\nA chain or distributed electric technology really references a larger system of technology [noise]\nOkay [noise] think of it like ... ... is like an accounting book everyone can see a distributed ledger it's a record of transactions that isn't held by a central authority like a bank but it said on the computers of everyone on the block ching\nTransparency is its main advantage ... tons of new companies are springing up saying that they will use the transparency block Jane to solve all sorts of problems and everything from curing cancer to endings human trafficking and now even climate change\nFits it's our intention to build the infrastructure to make it possible to reverse climate change\nBall gamble used to be a software product manager he's working on climate change now but he's still makes the grand tech world pitches he's the CEO of a new Silicon Valley company called ...\n... the black chain based marketplace that makes it easier for people to pay for removing carbon dioxide\nCanada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credit systems the total number of carbon possible to admit is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let the ... more economists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon carbon markets\nIn the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting and go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment\nAnd then the company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch you want to make this whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy\nBecause he's a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of Silicon Valley is big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it suggests there's a quick and easy solution that things that fix climate change are going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars the pollute\nThe call I said before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data were the hot new things\nAnd these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past a shiny thing and start talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nIs watching could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees the company's planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mock a climate scientist at Stanford agrees but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt's just as they can kicking ethic where we won't be putting into place the solutions that are actually more important to make the entirety of the problem something as horrible\nWith a clock ticking on climate change ... there's no time to waste sorting facts from high [noise]\nFriend PR News I'm Sam [noise]\nThis is NPR News\nSupport for Nashville public radio

S. also thinks that Saudi Arabia could be helpful and then the elusive Israeli Palestinian peace agreement\nNow oil is also on the minds of our next listener hello my name is Sean ... I'm from New Orleans Louisiana how did the U.S views Saudi Arabia before oil was a failing thank you\nBasically there was no view before oil was a thing a Saudi Arabia as we know it was it became a country in Nineteen thirty to the very next year inside an agreement with standard oil of California to form aramco the Arabian American oil company which is now owned by the Saudi state\nAnd that happened even before it was clear how oil rich the country would be\nThe leader for a unified the country and started a relationship with the U.S was Abdul Aziz evens out he had forty five\nSons Steve and all the king's since his death in Nineteen fifty three of them one of those times the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman we've been hearing so much about lately would be the first of the next generation if he becomes king\nThe next question is whether us being so close to the Saudis can get them to do anything\nI was just out of south from Upton, Massachusetts how much influence does the United states have over Saudi Arabia\nQuestion is more how much the U.S has chosen to exert that the biggest case in point at the moment is the civil war in Yemen where the Saudis had been accused of bombing civilians in closing off\nAccess to a humanitarian aid so that now there's an enormous food crisis taking place but the kinds of Iran is involved with the faction the Saudis are fighting the United states has sided with the Saudis\nBut the ...
