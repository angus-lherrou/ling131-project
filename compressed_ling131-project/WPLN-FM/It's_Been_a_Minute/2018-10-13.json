history and here in the coming out stories from listeners I've been talking to Marcy Gallo she's a professor at University of Nevada Las Vegas just talk me through the history of coming out and you can't really talk about that history without talking about this one big moment yeah\nIt was a big deal uh she took a big big big risk and we'll are a lot\nThat's Marcy discussing Ellen in Nineteen

problem with it you know there are a lot of people out there I think people like me are sick\nYou so I mean coming out has been a thing at this point for a few decades and run the backlash that she face was pretty ethic you know lost the show obvious conservative groups urged companies to not buy ads\nOn the show ABC actually put an adult content warning on episodes of Alan that showed a woman kissing a woman [noise]\nThere was even coverage that if you listen back to you from NPR that\nI find it hard to imagine airing um snow in April Nineteen Ninety seven the afternoon before that episode aired of Alan a Robert Knight who was then the head of the family Research Council he talked to NPR about this and you just got to hear it\nSo you see there is an agenda here to normalize homosexuality altogether characters are upbeat you know free spirits wonderful people and of course a lot of gay people are like that\nBut not all of them and and yet it it seems to me that they are doing their best present homosexuality or something desirable normal something you ought to try kids or you don't have to worry about any morality since we've decided there is no right and wrong in this issue\nOf the only right thing to do is embrace it normalize it and anyone who says otherwise is a terrible ...\nWow wow [noise] it's so funny she says there's an agenda to normalize homosexuality it's like yeah yeah yeah there is a partner\n[laughter] the whole he hate kids it's okay you can try to um it was fascinating to hear because of course what they were terrified about it it would get normalize that there would be acceptance um [noise]\nAnd I I frankly I think we're still fighting that fight quite honestly and can I jump and I know we're going decade by decade I'll do it go ahead but you know I ... for today I was looking at a Washington Post opinion piece you might have already seen it\nI'm like academic I'm Matt Brickell wrote this really interesting piece in the Washington Post last October eleventh is when it appeared um and he sets off a brain blow flag waving firestorm really of protest when he says\nDon't come out you say people like clear people stopped coming out\nIn the ... gone from Nineteen Ninety seven Allen coming out and it's a big deal to twenty Seventeen Twenty years later I'm don't do it academically and don't\nDo it what is the rationale behind [laughter] okay so for one and this is debatable America this is a quote America's a safer place in twenty Seventeen on people secondly though and even more kind of convincing in some ways he's arguing that are having to come out\nReinforces the view that heterosexuality still is the norm [noise]\nNo I'm paraphrasing he's you know we have to proclaim my sexuality right and we need a national holiday to do it but they don't whereas my head of sexuality is normal and expected and he says everyone should come out for no one should\nMake the heterosexual people should come out on October eleventh and say I'm straight and but he is arguing that our sexuality is no way to organize our judgments about people and that no particular sexuality\nWeb streaming is made possible by Lipscomb

S. dot O. R. G.\nYou're listening to it's\nBenefited from NPR fan than just this past Thursday October eleventh was a dirty national coming out day [noise] mark that day we are exploring coming out [noise] that was never just one day and\nHow it's different for different people born in in this next segment you'll hear a gay slur I've been talking with the Patrick Johnson the head of the African American studies department at Northwestern university and he told me how coming out can change when you're from a marginalized background\nI'm Talking about black people brown people but there's people\nWhoever where you live a gay life\nBut you don't talk about it and maybe there isn't a coming out day or you tell everyone hopes no and and and like other folks don't [laughter] this feels to me to be a thing but it's much more of a thing for gay people who are not white and my rights and yes\nYes and yeah and if you are already hailed as and you fill in the blank in terms of your rights or a black person I like the next person an Asian person\nAnd that brings with it a whole set of responses to who you are as a person and so you in some ways don't have\nAny choice but to\nLive with that because you you can hide it and I especially feel that way I'm for African Americans in particular because of the\nConnection to the church mhm you couldn't go to any black church in the United states and not find a gay man ... ... yes um\nAnd it's a complicated place because I grew up in the church and the church is actually where I feel I came into my own at\nWork I mean like I felt safe they're like yeah as a young black boy yeah the church was the one place I knew I wasn't going to be made fun of correct but it was also the one place where I knew that I might hear the word faggot over the pulpit mhm it was this weird dichotomy but I always felt in this weird way safe there yeah\nIt to 'em express myself which I was a big old clean love 'em and in the choir stand a singing soprano the only way over the Sopranos\nSection I'm sure that ended up I'm sure they loved it they should be in that yet at the same time the pastor was talking about gay folks going to hell in God gave you age because you sent yet ...\nNot in my church that I thought okay that [laughter] but many charges were doing ... made a absolute and still do and ... and so yeah it it's a really a\nConcert we're [laughter] ... yeah no but that's that's part of the other thing but also you know we also had the whole down low yeah phenomena and also we should stop to define what the downloads for those who might not know\nHe has so men who are on the down low are men who sleep with men but who do not attend a fight as gay and they're usually black and only allowed to jail for men other than black man\nYes I'm even though that's not true [laughter]\nWell I mean like ... for like white man they yeah but they don't live in another life you know yeah the lead a double life yeah\nWhy does it say about what coming out has become where you move from Harvey Milk in the seventies to coming out day in the eighties to acceptance for folks like Alan by the nineties yet at the same time the subset of the community black man they're still being labeled with this term deal\nSo at the same time that\nThere was a part of the community that we're not being opened there was another part that was actually being\nVery open in the seventies in particular there were a radical group of of black and Latino connects lesbians\nWere open and pushing things forward and and it was that wing are pushing back against the second wave feminist movement\nWas white straight middle class women and these black can lead to next lesbians like hello I'm we're here as well and so people like Audrey lord a serene arabica Gloria and so do uh\nI could go on and on and all of these jak lesbian yeah and like you know lesbians\nSo it's a complicated history is not just that black folk sort of disavow coming out or being open about their sexuality or in total some make that decision [laughter] but then there was a whole other set who made another choice\nThat choice can be very challenging for all kinds of marginalized people take on ... riots there another listener who shared a coming out story with us on a twenty five from Minnesota on his parents are Catholic immigrants from Mexico two and a half years ago and he came out to family and friends as clear\nTheir parents reacted okay not great but okay but on the has the second coming out story about coming out to themselves as transgender\nI was in college and I in one of my classes on my professor at brought in a trench shoot a gentleman who is just like kind of sharing her story that guy like raise to be only strong and like no softness [noise]\nUm and I always felt like something was wrong but like I said at like ... like in the military and I got a wife and kids like all this stuff and I never gave myself face to really like\nAsk myself centrally like think about who I Am\n[laughter] [noise]\nI Would like to get back in my chair that I might add\nI'm just kind of mine that I've read other like giving yourself [noise] [noise] or something [noise] never done that before\nInteresting and kind of put his myself that question I was like okay well I Am I on it and like almost fell out of my chair [laughter] because I like the answer was no [noise]\n\nI recently wrote a letter to their mom and dad to explain this saying they were considering top surgery a double mastectomy on his parents got really hung up on that\nSame kind of got stuck on the idea that like oh this is a a\nCosmetic issue and or like an aesthetic issue and it's like I just something you don't like about your body and I don't like it was not my lion everybody like things about their body which they'll all\nMake our way through life and we just have to learn to love ourselves and it was like well there's a difference between that and and feeling like I mean associated with your with like a body art and like\nI don't know like something feels like genuinely wrong\nAnd so I\nKind of made it clear that like it doesn't matter if you understand or not but like it doesn't matter if you kind of respect and honor my autonomy on that and that was something that\nYeah the other it in a way like Saturday Night and then as the going off the bat and my dad called out after me and say like well again tonight and thanks for being yourself\nI mean maybe not never really under stand in that but I'm Still there and I'm yeah I'm Still on each other\nThat was on a ride in Minnesota their story highlights how coming out today can be much more complex than what Elon did Twenty one years ago professor ... Patrick Johnson told me it's more complex now for celebrities to\nLike Janelle Monet a is an example because she didn't\nCome out as gay or it was something much more fluid and I think we're in a moment of trans fats and gender non conforming aid that is really influencing\nHow people announced their sexuality and so it's much more ... than a I'm coming out because I like the same sex it's more like well I'm not heterosexual", "show_name": "It's Been a Minute", "year": "2018", "city": "Nashville", "day": "13"}
