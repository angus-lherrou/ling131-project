album of old prince demos that was released late last month called piano and a microphone Nineteen eighty three and it's these nine and release prince demos from way back then and so the thing about this is that like\nOf the demos a scratch tracks just prints at the piano playing the songs to show his band and his team how he wanted to do the songs with the full band later and there's just really interesting moment a new song you here were prince starts to beat box to basically show the drummer how he wants to Trump's this town [noise]\nIt's just amazing and so but what's so weird about this

and fighting Amazon like he's been coming out for a while now introduced a bill that's called stop basis act or you know that no a lot of it [laughter]\nYeah and on Tuesday when Amazon came out with this announcement I talked to Senator Sanders and his line was I got to give credit where credit's due and Amazon\nAnd Jeff Bezos made the right call it's a good decision so it's yes we are is definitely part of it and another really huge element to all of this is that the economy\nIs presenting an extremely tight labor market there are more job openings than workers and Amazon is heading into this season um holidays are coming up they're going to be fighting for these workers they that they need but also Walmart needs and\nBest Buy needs and all these other retailers need and you know having a Fifteen dollar minimum wage in this this bumping 'em coverage of that I'm sure it can't\nHurt helps them attract workers while I can talk about Amazon all day as you know

the show where we catch up on the week that was here were to get this week Chris ... legal editor at buzzfeed news and Alina Selyukh business correspondent for NPR a I have a question for you both\nBe honest do either of you remember your home coming from high school well I've only been to one because\nLeave ... but it was also confusing because I had never known that such an event exist it and it was very strange uh-huh Chris I think I went I was I wasn't a closeted\nGay boy in Youngstown, Ohio um I went with a girl and I know it went like home coming in ... but they were not the notable or life moments\nThat they are for some others I'm bringing up a homecoming because it's a subject this week of our long distance call [noise] there's you know long distance as a segment where we call up someone somewhere in the world and talk with them about\nThe news so this week I talked with two students from Austin high school in my home state of Texas are their names are Sicilia McBride and story ... ... I asked them about their homecoming story or the your average teenagers in the high school band plays ... stories in the color guard so where are you both now\nI work both hiding in a corner or near banned all [laughter]\nSo fun fact I also was in marching band when I was in high school I Am from Texas\nI'm just about an hour south of you guys know where to go I went to a jets in high school for two years into Clemens high school and shirts for it to you know I was a saxophone player I was a drum major so I'm having fond\nFond font thoughts of my days hiding in the corner and we\nActually played at ... at a competition on Saturday\nReally small world small world yeah\nThe Syrian story there are couple and their friends nominated them to be on the ... court\nWe just want to say just one of the opportunity to weigh together or we didn't have to come together but I mean we didn't even have the chance at least originally did it\nTo do you want it to run on the homecoming court as again but the school administration told her that only boys can be genes and only girls can be queens\nCecilia and stories said that this made it impossible for a gay couple to actually win together they push back in the school actually changed the rules that same day they decided to have no gender titles in the home coming contests ... know queens everyone on the homecoming court\nWould just be known as quote royals\nBut that didn't make the soda and story happy\nI mean it's definitely a step forward it's another way of avoiding acknowledging a same sex couples\nStory how do you feel about this\nThey think they were over compensating rather than just the day and that well it shouldn't have been at a gym there they should have just made it so you are voting friction ... regardless of their jets that Christian Church whether or not that we're now that the chain\nOr ... or anything between and it was up to that it wasn't up to school because they weren't going to take out come on circuit check out check your guest one couple I'm sure you got there\nA spokesperson for the school told us quote we can say that we believe the resolution is an appropriate one often independent school district is committed to creating a safe supportive environment for all students and staff including those who identify as algae be teach you plus since the change the sodium story happened dealing with the fallout\nOther students support them but I don't like the outcome\nThere pretty much the same way as we are when they say that they don't think that the court did what they should have done they don't like when you're out it is that what ... coming to post about a outside Austin order hearing about it the common core ... they're not very positive\nWhat's been the worst kind of comments\nThey're mostly ... saying that we're that we're not ... look or special treat ball and\nWhat they would have expected it oh acting or is that they are and how little yeah\nPeople really think is going to ruin homecoming ...\nAnd it up taking away the whole kind of traditional gotcha\nIs they're going to be other stuff that you all go through throughout this year are you a senior year right yeah that will have to I mean like there's probably going to be\nOther gender roles for other senior year traditions as well like you are going to be a situation when it comes to prom king and queen what happens next guy\nYes actually one of the teachers that had been talking to us throughout the whole issue that you thought that it gets you but and I can't wait till we get the wrong they\nWere ... king and queen how that turned out my goodness so there may be more drama I had before the years done fleet [noise]\n\nIt'd be street on one of the story and stories they've been dealing with this fall out some students support them others don't like the outcome the votes actually aren't done yet that's going to happen next week but this story\nReally made me think like Austin, Texas is a pretty progressive city not just for Texas but for the country\nAnd so you have this woman is ration that is trying to in some way be an ally to these young women but even they can't figure out what the right language is what the right term should be I think\nWe're in this period where defining and letting gender roles be more fluid can be confusing for some people\nI I just celebrated my forte first birthday and one of the things that I've learned is like that means that I'm getting older and I'm not going to necessarily understand how a younger group of people is looking at things and\n[noise] with that um this portion of the show was over and I'm going to say goodbye to my guess we're going to go out with one another special treat 'em print and more from his

I don't I Would also kind of like middle aged half to go to prepare for girls trip exactly that would be kinda cool yeah and she's kind of you know\nTrying to keep the family together and just trying to do her best to keep going forward and we have everyone come to the house mom dad brothers interpreted rather conservative brother a slightly left of center sister kind of the whole family is all over the map and\nThe first kind of half of the movie is really all about you know trying your best to not talk about politics at the holiday table yes let's leave it there let's leave it there yeah did your family Thanksgiving inspired this at all it actually did a it was read the Thanksgiving right after the twenty sixteen election how hot one it was a hot one\nPeople didn't know what to say they were all shell shock yeah\nAnd that for dinner the three of us kind of gotten this argument [noise] there was a little bit of wine involved but\nYou know what struck me about the argument was that we were all on the same side we all voted for the same person rather enthusiastically and I think my brother has kind of position he was a little more of a Bernie Sanders guy and I think his position was you know what party could have won this [noise] and you know my mom lives in ...\nYou know it was saying well they forgot about the mid west they gave up the mid west which is ridiculous and I was kind of like well it's Kobe's fault and this and there's just struck me that if we're also aligned and ... and we're fighting\nWhat's going on to their tables around the country and and so I I knew that that arena would be like a really fun area for us to explore and I knew it can be funny and potentially explosive yeah\nWhat I Love about the movie and you mentioned that it it it it makes us all think about how and when and how much we should talk about politics\nI covered the last election and my ... throughout was like people should talk about it more because of shapes the nation and we put the hard stuff to the side are only preach to the choir here to talk about a more but now\nI'm usually like everyone just shut out thing\nI was like you I was the guy for a good year and a half that\nSit down at dinner with some friends first day on TALK about can you believe this this is insane and I did it that thing where I was like I don't understand how people are not talking about is that what is bigger what's the bigger news story in your in my lifetime that what's happening now there's not one minute so I I was getting frustrated that people's\nFrustration with me talking about it but I I recently\nI recently started trying to find that balance a little bit and like if you are just if you are just on Twitter all day and you're just you're just raise your blood pressure raises your blood pressure and I think you know when I wrote the movie I was like I Want to put myself in the head of Chris my character who really as obsessive and and he's consumed by the cycle\nSo I had to CNN Fox News or MSNBC on twenty four rarely and I was reading it and it makes you crazy to do it is a a slightly romantic story\nBut I'm ... right after we first meet them um I really wanted to show the wear and tear that that she was going through with him um because that was very very much based off of my wife really yeah so well my wife who is it is you know politically active and she goes to the marches\nAnd has very little on the list to NPR I'm Steve Inskeep your liver she does not in the area [laughter]\nI'm a I'm a ... there was one morning where it was like six twenty five in the morning and I uh\nShe was in bed next to me and she was breastfeeding our or newborn and I was reading some articles that with us you know like it's not helping not held onto their jobs and I turned her yeah that was that was not being president and I turned to her I said just very like morose Leah America's last", "year": "2018", "show_name": "It's Been a Minute", "city": "Nashville", "day": "06"}
